Volatility : 53.17% (As of Oct. 29, 2024)\nView and export this data going back to 2010. Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\n\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap. Note that \"N/A\" values will not show up in the chart.\n\nTesla's Volatility Distribution in the Vehicles & Parts Industry\nFor the Vehicles & Parts industry and Consumer Cyclical sector, Tesla's Volatility distribution charts can be found below:\n* The bar in red indicates where Tesla's Volatility falls into.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Calculation\nThe annualized volatility is calculated as following:\n\u03c3A=\u03c3M*\u221a12=\u221a 1/(n-1) \u2211(Ri - R')^2*\u221a12\nWhere: \u03c3M is the monthly volatility, n is the number of months in the period, Ri is the security's historical monthly returns and R' is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns.\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD.\n* For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nKenneth Dorell\ninvestor@meta.com\u00a0/ investor.fb.com\nPress:\nRyan Moore\npress@meta.com\u00a0/ about.fb.com/news/\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

This lowers the interest rate target to a range of 4.75% to 5%.1\nThe Fed\u2019s decision to ease monetary policy is likely to support growth and stabilize a slowing labor market. Our strategists believe this is the beginning of the Fed moving into a new stance \u2013 in the Fed\u2019s eyes, recent slowing in the labor market is now a bigger risk than inflation. This cut in policy rates, and plans to lower rates further, is designed to support economic growth.\nNoteworthy changes in the Fed\u2019s statement\nIn the FOMC statement, the Fed reiterated that the economy \u201ccontinued to expand at a solid pace\u201d and that it remains committed to \u201cachieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of two percent over the longer run.\u201d2\nHowever, the statement included noteworthy changes from the prior statement regarding inflation and the labor market. The Committee noted that it has \u201cgained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards two percent\u201d and the risks to its dual mandate \u201care roughly in\u201d balance, compared to being in \u201cbetter\u201d balance as noted in the prior statement. This follows August\u2019s inflation data which showed inflation is now at 2.5%, considerably closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target.3\nThe statement describes job gains as having \u201cslowed,\u201d a change from \u201cmoderated\u201d in the past statement, and underscores it is now \u201cstrongly committed to supporting maximum employment.\u201d4 This follows August\u2019s labor market data,\u00a0which revealed that the labor market is slowing more quickly than expected, but not breaking.\nShifts in the Summary of Economic Projections\nThe much-anticipated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed that the median FOMC participant is penciling in 50 basis points of further cuts across the remaining two meetings this year, followed by 100 basis points of cuts in 2025 and 50 basis points more in 2026 to a terminal rate of 2.9%, where they sees rates remaining through 2027.5\nOfficials raised their end of 2024 median forecast for the unemployment rate to 4.4% from 4%, a slight decline from the current rate of 4.2%.6\nThese projections reflect the Committee\u2019s belief that the risks to inflation have become broadly balanced while risks to the unemployment rate are now weighed to the upside. This will likely lead to further rate cuts for risk management purposes, to help prolong the expansion.7\nEconomic and monetary policy outlook\nEconomic variables are trending in the right direction, which allowed for the Fed to begin easing monetary policy. Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that inflation is \u201cmuch closer\u201d to its 2% target and the labor market is \u201cless tight\u201d than pre-pandemic in 2019. He highlighted that the \u201cprimary focus\u201d has shifted from \u201cbringing down inflation\u201d to supporting maximum employment.8\nGoing forward, Chair Powell underscored that the Fed\u2019s decision on the direction of rates continues to be made on a \u201cmeeting by meeting\u201d basis with data leading the way. This measured approach allows the committee to carefully assess the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.9\nOur strategists believe that there will likely be two additional rate cuts in 2024, and expect the cuts to continue into 2025. This cut in policy rates should help support labor markets from slowing too quickly.\nMarket reaction\nU.S. equities were initially higher in the afternoon following the Fed\u2019s announcement on September 18, as stocks made an intra-day all-time high, while bond yields \u2013 especially at the short end \u2013 moved lower. However, by the end of the day, the S&P 500 declined by 0.29%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 0.25% and the Nasdaq declined by 0.31%. In early trading on Thursday, the market was up big, with S&P 500 futures in the green by 1.5%.\nWhat a rate cut could mean for investors\nEven though bond yields have fallen, our strategists still think excess cash should find a better home while the Fed is cutting rates. This decision to cut 50 basis points reinforces that reinvestment risk is real, and bond yields could still move lower from here. But it\u2019s not too late \u2013 over the last 12 cutting cycles (from first cut to last cut), fixed income has outperformed cash in all but one. When the Fed cuts rates outside of recession, equities tend to deliver strong performance.\nReferences\n1.Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \u201cFederal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement.\u201d (September 18, 2024)\n2.Ibid.\n3.Ibid.\n4.Ibid.\n5.Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \u201cSummary of Economic Projections\u201d (September 18, 2024).\n6.Ibid.\n7.Ibid.\n8.Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \u201cTranscript of Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Opening Statement\u201d (September 2024).\n9.Ibid.\nConnect with a Wealth Advisor\nOur Wealth Advisors begin by getting to know you personally.

      "Knowledge\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Top 5 Trends for Defence in 2024\r\n\t\t\t\nGreat challenges will bring huge opportunities in 2024, as the defence and aerospace industry seeks to rise to a diverse range of hurdles. Amid these headwinds, Defence Engage looks at the trends which could come to characterise 2024, from battling skills shortages to pivotal digitalisation efforts.\nMarked by ongoing conflicts in Israel-Palestine and Ukraine, 2024 will see ongoing tensions with China and Iran which pose significant threats to the international order. Geopolitical concerns aside, the industry grapples with supply chain issues, talent shortages, operational risks, and rising costs amid inflation. In the biggest global election year in history we could see significant strategic changes from key players such as the USA, UK, India, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Russia. Here are the five key trends likely to dominate 2024\u2026\n\u00a0\n#1 AI and digitalisation efforts to bring security and efficiencies\nThe defence industry faces challenges in rapidly adopting new defensive systems and procedures to keep up with adversaries' technological innovations. From upgrading aging software to mitigate cyber threats, to expanding access to, and the adoption of, key cyber credentials, keeping up with digital trends remains pivotal. Meanwhile, governments are prioritising bringing AI to maturity while ensuring its development is safe and responsible. The rapid adoption of AI, spurred by recent advancements like Chat-GPT, is underway in industry, and indeed OpenAI has already started the year by easing its stance on the use of ChatGPT for military purposes.\nThe impact of AI for defence is forecast to be significant, from helping front-line users detect threats to activating cyber defences faster and with greater agility. Additionally, the integration of AI into defence supply chains could improve platform and parts delivery efficiency, reducing delays and costs, whilst improving security. Meanwhile, digital twins, coupled with machine learning, can enhance visibility of supply chain problems or complexities. According to a BAE report, 86% of defence and aerospace decision makers say their nation has adopted AI for defence applications, so the technology is set to become increasingly mature in 2024.\n\u00a0\n#2 Decarbonisation initiatives continue\nFollowing recent data which indicates that 2023 was the hottest year ever, the impetus behind decarbonisation efforts sees renewed urgency. The contribution of the global defence industry to carbon emissions has come under a microscope, with some having suggested that the sector had been overlooked, but there have been some major decarbonisation initiatives, including the establishment of NATO\u2019s Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and the UK\u2019s Sustainable Support Strategy.\nThe impact of climate change upon defence goes beyond the weight of its own contributions, with both the UN and NATO describing climate change as a \u2018threat multiplier\u2019, alluding to the destabilising impact climate can have on societies and economies. Industry is rising to meet the challenge, with innovations such as new power solutions or increased circularity in manufacturing. \u00a0Last year the EU signalled its intention for defence supply chains to become more sustainable, alongside developing more localised energy in a drive for logistical resilience. Individual initiatives such as the Royal Air Force\u2019s first use of sustainable aviation fuel in a fighter aircraft are lighting the way towards a greener, more sustainable, military.\n\u00a0\n#3 Recruitment challenges to persist\nDefence is facing significant challenges when it comes to acquiring talent, skills and retention, from front-line military roles to cyber, quantum and manufacturing. In recent weeks the UK\u2019s Royal Navy has seen significant problems with hiring, at a critical time for the force, with ships being deployed to the Red Sea to counter Houthi Rebels. Last month, the Times reported that Armed forces and defence companies are locked in \u2018a war for talent\u2019.\nDwindling forces are due to the lack of recruits for basic training, a lack of digital skills, and the pull of incentives given by neighbouring sectors. The EU and US have recently signalled their plans to try and combat personnel shortages in key areas. The US\u2019 new Defence Industrial Strategy, cites \u2018workforce readiness\u2019 as a key strategic focus, with a desire to develop a \u2018sufficiently skilled and staffed workforce\u2019. Meanwhile, the European Commission expects skills shortages to increase into the future, with defence urgently requiring skills and talent acquisition, as procurement organisations seek to develop and manage emerging disruptive technologies.\n\u00a0\n#4 Agile supply chains to be prioritised\nThe scramble to arm Ukraine and Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China have highlighted US and allied supply chain vulnerabilities. The last couple of years have seen efforts to build a more resilient supply chain. The US CHIPS act and the EU CHIPS Act designed to securitise semiconductor supply, the European Defence Agency has set out to ensure \u2018security of supply\u2019 across the EU, and at the start of 2024, the US\u2019 Defence Industrial Strategy took aim at supply chain fragility, seeking to make it more sustainable alongside more flexible acquisition processes.\n2024 will see more emphasis on agile supply chains: increasing pressure to move away from lengthy procurement processes that cannot react quickly enough or where the end product could be outdated by the time it comes into service. There will be a race to secure and effect easy access to increasingly scarce resources such as minerals driven by the appetite for batteries and the move away from fossil fuels. The surge of additive manufacturing creates a \u2018just in time\u2019 supply option, while new military tactics such as the use of drones and increasing need for cyber security will continue to push military to commercial and more readily available solutions.\n\u00a0\n#5 Alliances and collaboration lead development and procurement\nCollaborative development programmes such as the sixth-generation fighter efforts: Tempest (by Italy, Japan and the UK) and FCAS (by France, Germany and Spain), are key initiatives designed to combine the best of each nation\u2019s domestic capabilities and combat declining resources. Meanwhile, the AUKUS programme demonstrates how two established nuclear navies (UK and US) are aiding Australia in bolstering Indo-Pacific security. Furthermore, NATO\u2019s Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA), which opened its doors with three innovation challenges in 2023, has established test centres and accelerator units across Europe and North America. The collaboration of NATO members is nothing new, but this more centralised effort to progress on emerging disruptive technologies is hoped to go from strength to strength in 2024.\nGroup-purchases have become increasingly common amongst NATO allies in recent years, with a marked increase since the war in Ukraine began. Just two weeks ago, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain agreed to jointly purchase $5.5 billion worth of Patriot missiles following their effective use observed in Ukraine. Additionally, the research opportunities posed by the war in Ukraine have seen allies and industry testing experimental tech in partnership with Ukrainian soldiers, helping speed up development initiatives, particularly for drones. Following on from the big trend of multi-domain integration, Defence Engage expects multi-national development, purchases and bids to strengthen regional military power and aid embattled allies such as Israel and Ukraine, to continue in 2024 amid ongoing geopolitical upheaval.\n\u00a0\nKeep ahead of the trends\nDefence Engage connects suppliers and buyers to help make defence accessible, follow us on LinkedIn or register for our weekly Defence Contracts Digest to stay apprised of new solutions and collaboration opportunities this year.\nWant to discover more about how Defence Engage can enhance your lead-gen efforts and boost your discoverability in Defence?

For the 12-month's ending March 2024, dividends set a record $593.1 billion payments, up 3.4% on an aggregate basis from the prior 12-month March 2023's $573.7 billion.\nTotal shareholders return of buybacks and dividends increased to $388.4 billion in Q1 2024,\u00a0up 4.1% from Q4 2023's $373.2 billion and up 7.2% from Q1 2023's $362.3 billion. Total shareholder returns for the 12-months ending March 2024 decreased 1.5% to $1.410 trillion from the prior 12-month March 2023's $1.431 trillion.\nThe 1% tax on net buybacks, which started in 2023, reduced the Q1 2024 S&P 500 operating earnings by 0.47%, up from Q4 2023's 0.44% impact, and As Reported GAAP earnings by 0.54% up from the prior 0.50%; for the 12-month March 2024 period they reduced earnings 0.41% for operating and 0.46% for As Reported.\n\"The share count impact on EPS increased for the first time after five consecutive quarters of declines as companies increased their overall buyback expenditure by 8%, which countered the impact of both share issuance and employee options being exercised. While\u00a0buybacks supported share price, 13.3% of the issues saw a significant increase (of at least 4%) in their EPS due to share count reduction, compared to 18.5% in Q1 2023. For Q1 2024, more issues did buybacks and spent more. While the 13.3% remains lower than the 17.5% average and pales compared to the almost 25% rate posted in Q1 2019, the increase comes after five quarters of declines, and hints to a forward upswing. Companies with strong cashflows continued to aggressively do buybacks, as the top 20 issues accounted for 50.9% of the buybacks in Q1 2024,\" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\"Given the market's current expectations for interest rates to decline later in the year and the continued uncertainty over geopolitical and domestic issues, companies may be shy to finance buybacks going forward as discretionary buybacks, which reduce share count, may need to be financed from ongoing operations. Top-tier cash-flow issues however are seen as continuing their buybacks and positively impacting their EPS.\"\n1% Buyback Excise Tax:\nThe 1% excise tax on net buybacks reduced Q1 2024 operating earnings by 0.47%, up from Q4 2023's 0.44% and up from the 0.45% for Q1 2023. The 12-month impact was 0.41%, up from 2023's 40% and down from the proforma 2022 of 0.51%. The tax on As Reported GAAP earnings impact increased to 0.54%, up from the Q4 2023 0.50% and up from the Q1 2023 0.49%. The 12-month impact was 0.46%, up from 2023's 0.45% and down from the proforma 2022 0.58%.\nSilverblatt added: \"The 1% tax remains an expense but has not impacted overall buybacks at this point. However, given the initial 1% buyback tax had bipartisan support and remains an attractive cash generator for the government, there is an expectation that some increase or potential change to the type of buybacks that are taxed will remain on the table following the election cycle. Given the current corporate sensitivity to costs, a buyback tax rate of 2%-to-2.5% was seen as impacting both buybacks and the EPS impact of share-count-reduction (which is already at a lower level due to high stock prices). This is because some of the expenditures may shift from buybacks to dividends. However, any shift would not be on a-dollar-for-dollar basis as dividends remain a long-term pure cash-flow item which must be incorporated into corporate budgets.\"\nQ1 2024 GICS\u00ae Sector Analysis:\nInformation Technology maintained its lead in buybacks, representing 24.2% of all buybacks for the quarter. Q1 2024 expenditures increased 1.8% to $57.3 billion, compared to Q4 2023's $56.3 billion, it was up 24.8% from Q1 2023's $45.9 billion expenditure.

For the 12-month's ending March 2024, dividends set a record $593.1 billion payments, up 3.4% on an aggregate basis from the prior 12-month March 2023's $573.7 billion.\nTotal shareholders return of buybacks and dividends increased to $388.4 billion in Q1 2024,\u00a0up 4.1% from Q4 2023's $373.2 billion and up 7.2% from Q1 2023's $362.3 billion. Total shareholder returns for the 12-months ending March 2024 decreased 1.5% to $1.410 trillion from the prior 12-month March 2023's $1.431 trillion.\nThe 1% tax on net buybacks, which started in 2023, reduced the Q1 2024 S&P 500 operating earnings by 0.47%, up from Q4 2023's 0.44% impact, and As Reported GAAP earnings by 0.54% up from the prior 0.50%; for the 12-month March 2024 period they reduced earnings 0.41% for operating and 0.46% for As Reported.\n\"The share count impact on EPS increased for the first time after five consecutive quarters of declines as companies increased their overall buyback expenditure by 8%, which countered the impact of both share issuance and employee options being exercised. While\u00a0buybacks supported share price, 13.3% of the issues saw a significant increase (of at least 4%) in their EPS due to share count reduction, compared to 18.5% in Q1 2023. For Q1 2024, more issues did buybacks and spent more. While the 13.3% remains lower than the 17.5% average and pales compared to the almost 25% rate posted in Q1 2019, the increase comes after five quarters of declines, and hints to a forward upswing. Companies with strong cashflows continued to aggressively do buybacks, as the top 20 issues accounted for 50.9% of the buybacks in Q1 2024,\" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\"Given the market's current expectations for interest rates to decline later in the year and the continued uncertainty over geopolitical and domestic issues, companies may be shy to finance buybacks going forward as discretionary buybacks, which reduce share count, may need to be financed from ongoing operations. Top-tier cash-flow issues however are seen as continuing their buybacks and positively impacting their EPS.\"\n1% Buyback Excise Tax:\nThe 1% excise tax on net buybacks reduced Q1 2024 operating earnings by 0.47%, up from Q4 2023's 0.44% and up from the 0.45% for Q1 2023. The 12-month impact was 0.41%, up from 2023's 40% and down from the proforma 2022 of 0.51%. The tax on As Reported GAAP earnings impact increased to 0.54%, up from the Q4 2023 0.50% and up from the Q1 2023 0.49%. The 12-month impact was 0.46%, up from 2023's 0.45% and down from the proforma 2022 0.58%.\nSilverblatt added: \"The 1% tax remains an expense but has not impacted overall buybacks at this point. However, given the initial 1% buyback tax had bipartisan support and remains an attractive cash generator for the government, there is an expectation that some increase or potential change to the type of buybacks that are taxed will remain on the table following the election cycle. Given the current corporate sensitivity to costs, a buyback tax rate of 2%-to-2.5% was seen as impacting both buybacks and the EPS impact of share-count-reduction (which is already at a lower level due to high stock prices). This is because some of the expenditures may shift from buybacks to dividends. However, any shift would not be on a-dollar-for-dollar basis as dividends remain a long-term pure cash-flow item which must be incorporated into corporate budgets.\"\nQ1 2024 GICS\u00ae Sector Analysis:\nInformation Technology maintained its lead in buybacks, representing 24.2% of all buybacks for the quarter. Q1 2024 expenditures increased 1.8% to $57.3 billion, compared to Q4 2023's $56.3 billion, it was up 24.8% from Q1 2023's $45.9 billion expenditure.

This was up for the quarter compared to Q4 2023's expenditure of $29.4 billion, but down from Q1 2023's $46.9 billion. For the 12-month March 2024 period, Financials spent $134.5 billion, up from $113.6 billion for the prior 12-month period.\nHealthcare significantly increased their Q1 2024 expenditure by 93.5%, spending $25.5 billion, compared to the Q4 2023 expenditure of $13.2 billion and up 10.0% from the Q1 2023 $23.2 billion expenditure. For the 12-months ending March 2024, the sector spent $67.1 billion, down from the prior period's expenditure of $84.9 billion.\nConsumer Staples increased their spending in Q1 2024 by 32.7% to $12.0 billion, up from the prior $9.0 billion and up 90.9% from the Q1 2023 expenditure of $6.3 billion.\nConsumer Discretionary\u00a0decreased their spending by 44.1% to $16.1 billion from Q4 2023's $28.7 billion and was 12.3% lower than the $18.3 billion spent in Q1 2023.\nIssues:\nThe five issues with the highest total buybacks for Q1 2024 were:\nApple (AAPL):\u00a0continued to dominate the issue level buybacks, as it again spent the most of any issue with its Q1 2024 expenditure ranking as the 6th highest in S&P 500 history.

Apple holds 18 of the top 20 record quarters (Meta Platforms holds #14 and QUALCOMM holds #16). For the 12-months ending March 2024, Apple spent $87.4 billion on buybacks, down from the prior 12-month period's $91.1 billion. Over the five-year period Apple has spent $429 billion, and $664 billion over the ten-year period.\nMeta Platforms (META): $18.2 billion for Q1 2024, up from the $8.2 billion in Q4 2023; the 12-month

For the 12-month's ending March 2024, dividends set a record $593.1 billion payments, up 3.4% on an aggregate basis from the prior 12-month March 2023's $573.7 billion.\nTotal shareholders return of buybacks and dividends increased to $388.4 billion in Q1 2024,\u00a0up 4.1% from Q4 2023's $373.2 billion and up 7.2% from Q1 2023's $362.3 billion. Total shareholder returns for the 12-months ending March 2024 decreased 1.5% to $1.410 trillion from the prior 12-month March 2023's $1.431 trillion.\nThe 1% tax on net buybacks, which started in 2023, reduced the Q1 2024 S&P 500 operating earnings by 0.47%, up from Q4 2023's 0.44% impact, and As Reported GAAP earnings by 0.54% up from the prior 0.50%; for the 12-month March 2024 period they reduced earnings 0.41% for operating and 0.46% for As Reported.\n\"The share count impact on EPS increased for the first time after five consecutive quarters of declines as companies increased their overall buyback expenditure by 8%, which countered the impact of both share issuance and employee options being exercised. While\u00a0buybacks supported share price, 13.3% of the issues saw a significant increase (of at least 4%) in their EPS due to share count reduction, compared to 18.5% in Q1 2023. For Q1 2024, more issues did buybacks and spent more. While the 13.3% remains lower than the 17.5% average and pales compared to the almost 25% rate posted in Q1 2019, the increase comes after five quarters of declines, and hints to a forward upswing. Companies with strong cashflows continued to aggressively do buybacks, as the top 20 issues accounted for 50.9% of the buybacks in Q1 2024,\" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\"Given the market's current expectations for interest rates to decline later in the year and the continued uncertainty over geopolitical and domestic issues, companies may be shy to finance buybacks going forward as discretionary buybacks, which reduce share count, may need to be financed from ongoing operations. Top-tier cash-flow issues however are seen as continuing their buybacks and positively impacting their EPS.\"\n1% Buyback Excise Tax:\nThe 1% excise tax on net buybacks reduced Q1 2024 operating earnings by 0.47%, up from Q4 2023's 0.44% and up from the 0.45% for Q1 2023. The 12-month impact was 0.41%, up from 2023's 40% and down from the proforma 2022 of 0.51%. The tax on As Reported GAAP earnings impact increased to 0.54%, up from the Q4 2023 0.50% and up from the Q1 2023 0.49%. The 12-month impact was 0.46%, up from 2023's 0.45% and down from the proforma 2022 0.58%.\nSilverblatt added: \"The 1% tax remains an expense but has not impacted overall buybacks at this point. However, given the initial 1% buyback tax had bipartisan support and remains an attractive cash generator for the government, there is an expectation that some increase or potential change to the type of buybacks that are taxed will remain on the table following the election cycle. Given the current corporate sensitivity to costs, a buyback tax rate of 2%-to-2.5% was seen as impacting both buybacks and the EPS impact of share-count-reduction (which is already at a lower level due to high stock prices). This is because some of the expenditures may shift from buybacks to dividends. However, any shift would not be on a-dollar-for-dollar basis as dividends remain a long-term pure cash-flow item which must be incorporated into corporate budgets.\"\nQ1 2024 GICS\u00ae Sector Analysis:\nInformation Technology maintained its lead in buybacks, representing 24.2% of all buybacks for the quarter. Q1 2024 expenditures increased 1.8% to $57.3 billion, compared to Q4 2023's $56.3 billion, it was up 24.8% from Q1 2023's $45.9 billion expenditure.

      "Get focused newsletters especially designed to be concise and easy to digest\nSea Level Rise Projection Map \u2013 Miami\nMiami is notoriously vulnerable to sea level rise, and its mayor has been vocal about the looming dangers of climate change in a relatively skeptical political environment. Mitigation plans involve massive engineering feats that may help in the short-term, but will eventually be overrun.\nEarth.Org takes a closer look.\n\u2014\nA major centre of finance, commerce, culture, arts and trade, Miami is a global city with a USD $345 billion GDP. Built on a broad, low-lying plain between Everglades wetlands and Biscayne Bay, its citizens are already experiencing early signs of climate change.\nWhy?\nSince 1870, global sea levels have risen by an average of 20 cm, but Southeast Florida\u2019s local levels have risen by 30 cm. By 2060, it could double or triple that.\u00a0\nThe impacts of sea level rise in Miami\nIn light of the last point, officials have decided to build a network of huge pumps that force water out of flood-prone areas and into Biscayne Bay. There are over 30 pumps today, with 90 planned in total. The estimated cost for 3 pumps, including land acquisition, is USD $ 200 million. Unfortunately, even all 90 cannot protect the larger Miami area.\u00a0\nThe city of Miami still toils away to mitigate flooding, raising roads and buildings, hoping to buy time. The world would do well to keep an eye on how Miami fares, as it may be the first major victim of climate change.\nEarth.Org has mapped severe flooding in southern Florida by the end of the century to illustrate the impending danger.\nSea Level Rise: Miami\u2019s Map\nSea level rise projections by 2100 for two scenarios with the amount of rise in meters indicated (mild = 1m; extreme = 4m). Percentage and total population displacement indicated bottom right, yellow star on the city of Miami.\nMethodology\nGlobal mean sea level is projected to rise by 2m at the end of this century. However, in order to determine local sea level rise (SLR), one has to take into account local coastal flood levels which could be 2.8m above Mean Higher-High Water (MHHW) at extreme forecasts. These local levels bring variability to the projected SLR from 1m to 6.5m (eg. Rio vs Kolkata).\nThe SLR scenarios used in this study are based on the forecasts from Climate Central \u2013 Coastal Risk Screening Tool \u00a0with the following parameters:\nSea level Projection Source:\nFrom two highly cited journals by Kopp et al., estimating SLR mainly due to ocean thermal expansion and ice melt. The mid-range scenario projected 0.5-1.2m of SLR based on different representative concentration pathways (RCP) defined by the IPCC. While the pessimistic scenario added more mechanisms of ice-sheet melting, estimating SLR at 1m-2.5m in 2100, with a projection of 10m SLR at 2300.\nCoastal Flooding\nMore frequent coastal flooding is a direct impact of sea-level rise. Based on the Global tides and surge reanalysis by Muis et al., (2016), it is estimated that the extreme coastal water level could be from 0.2 \u2013 2.8m over the mean level. While in extreme cases like China and the Netherlands it could experience 5-10m of extreme sea levels. Here, the coastal local flood level is added on top of the projected SLR.\nPollution Scenario:\nAllows choosing the RCP, the greenhouse gas concentration trajectory defined by the IPCC.\u00a0 The mild level is based on RCP4.5, of 2\u00b0C temperature rise; while the Extreme level is based on RCP 8.5, of 4\u00b0C temperature rise.\nLuck:\nApplies to the baseline SLR, defined in the \u201cSea level projection\u201d section, upon which we add flooding. \u201cMild\u201d refers to the mid-range scenario of 0.5-1.2m, and \u201cextreme\u201d to the pessimistic scenario of 1-2.5m. We used the high-end value of each scenario (mild = 1m; extreme = 2.5m).\nYou might also like: Sea Level Rise by 2100 \u2013 New York City\nA Graphical History of Atmospheric CO2 Levels Over Time\n11 Interesting Climate Change Facts\nThe Statistics of Biodiversity Loss [2020 WWF Report]\nHand-picked stories weekly or monthly.

      "Get focused newsletters especially designed to be concise and easy to digest\nSea Level Rise Projection Map \u2013 Miami\nMiami is notoriously vulnerable to sea level rise, and its mayor has been vocal about the looming dangers of climate change in a relatively skeptical political environment. Mitigation plans involve massive engineering feats that may help in the short-term, but will eventually be overrun.\nEarth.Org takes a closer look.\n\u2014\nA major centre of finance, commerce, culture, arts and trade, Miami is a global city with a USD $345 billion GDP. Built on a broad, low-lying plain between Everglades wetlands and Biscayne Bay, its citizens are already experiencing early signs of climate change.\nWhy?\nSince 1870, global sea levels have risen by an average of 20 cm, but Southeast Florida\u2019s local levels have risen by 30 cm. By 2060, it could double or triple that.\u00a0\nThe impacts of sea level rise in Miami\nIn light of the last point, officials have decided to build a network of huge pumps that force water out of flood-prone areas and into Biscayne Bay. There are over 30 pumps today, with 90 planned in total. The estimated cost for 3 pumps, including land acquisition, is USD $ 200 million. Unfortunately, even all 90 cannot protect the larger Miami area.\u00a0\nThe city of Miami still toils away to mitigate flooding, raising roads and buildings, hoping to buy time. The world would do well to keep an eye on how Miami fares, as it may be the first major victim of climate change.\nEarth.Org has mapped severe flooding in southern Florida by the end of the century to illustrate the impending danger.\nSea Level Rise: Miami\u2019s Map\nSea level rise projections by 2100 for two scenarios with the amount of rise in meters indicated (mild = 1m; extreme = 4m). Percentage and total population displacement indicated bottom right, yellow star on the city of Miami.\nMethodology\nGlobal mean sea level is projected to rise by 2m at the end of this century. However, in order to determine local sea level rise (SLR), one has to take into account local coastal flood levels which could be 2.8m above Mean Higher-High Water (MHHW) at extreme forecasts. These local levels bring variability to the projected SLR from 1m to 6.5m (eg. Rio vs Kolkata).\nThe SLR scenarios used in this study are based on the forecasts from Climate Central \u2013 Coastal Risk Screening Tool \u00a0with the following parameters:\nSea level Projection Source:\nFrom two highly cited journals by Kopp et al., estimating SLR mainly due to ocean thermal expansion and ice melt. The mid-range scenario projected 0.5-1.2m of SLR based on different representative concentration pathways (RCP) defined by the IPCC. While the pessimistic scenario added more mechanisms of ice-sheet melting, estimating SLR at 1m-2.5m in 2100, with a projection of 10m SLR at 2300.\nCoastal Flooding\nMore frequent coastal flooding is a direct impact of sea-level rise. Based on the Global tides and surge reanalysis by Muis et al., (2016), it is estimated that the extreme coastal water level could be from 0.2 \u2013 2.8m over the mean level. While in extreme cases like China and the Netherlands it could experience 5-10m of extreme sea levels. Here, the coastal local flood level is added on top of the projected SLR.\nPollution Scenario:\nAllows choosing the RCP, the greenhouse gas concentration trajectory defined by the IPCC.\u00a0 The mild level is based on RCP4.5, of 2\u00b0C temperature rise; while the Extreme level is based on RCP 8.5, of 4\u00b0C temperature rise.\nLuck:\nApplies to the baseline SLR, defined in the \u201cSea level projection\u201d section, upon which we add flooding. \u201cMild\u201d refers to the mid-range scenario of 0.5-1.2m, and \u201cextreme\u201d to the pessimistic scenario of 1-2.5m. We used the high-end value of each scenario (mild = 1m; extreme = 2.5m).\nYou might also like: Sea Level Rise by 2100 \u2013 New York City\nA Graphical History of Atmospheric CO2 Levels Over Time\n11 Interesting Climate Change Facts\nThe Statistics of Biodiversity Loss [2020 WWF Report]\nHand-picked stories weekly or monthly.

      "Get focused newsletters especially designed to be concise and easy to digest\nSea Level Rise Projection Map \u2013 Miami\nMiami is notoriously vulnerable to sea level rise, and its mayor has been vocal about the looming dangers of climate change in a relatively skeptical political environment. Mitigation plans involve massive engineering feats that may help in the short-term, but will eventually be overrun.\nEarth.Org takes a closer look.\n\u2014\nA major centre of finance, commerce, culture, arts and trade, Miami is a global city with a USD $345 billion GDP. Built on a broad, low-lying plain between Everglades wetlands and Biscayne Bay, its citizens are already experiencing early signs of climate change.\nWhy?\nSince 1870, global sea levels have risen by an average of 20 cm, but Southeast Florida\u2019s local levels have risen by 30 cm. By 2060, it could double or triple that.\u00a0\nThe impacts of sea level rise in Miami\nIn light of the last point, officials have decided to build a network of huge pumps that force water out of flood-prone areas and into Biscayne Bay. There are over 30 pumps today, with 90 planned in total. The estimated cost for 3 pumps, including land acquisition, is USD $ 200 million. Unfortunately, even all 90 cannot protect the larger Miami area.\u00a0\nThe city of Miami still toils away to mitigate flooding, raising roads and buildings, hoping to buy time. The world would do well to keep an eye on how Miami fares, as it may be the first major victim of climate change.\nEarth.Org has mapped severe flooding in southern Florida by the end of the century to illustrate the impending danger.\nSea Level Rise: Miami\u2019s Map\nSea level rise projections by 2100 for two scenarios with the amount of rise in meters indicated (mild = 1m; extreme = 4m). Percentage and total population displacement indicated bottom right, yellow star on the city of Miami.\nMethodology\nGlobal mean sea level is projected to rise by 2m at the end of this century. However, in order to determine local sea level rise (SLR), one has to take into account local coastal flood levels which could be 2.8m above Mean Higher-High Water (MHHW) at extreme forecasts. These local levels bring variability to the projected SLR from 1m to 6.5m (eg. Rio vs Kolkata).\nThe SLR scenarios used in this study are based on the forecasts from Climate Central \u2013 Coastal Risk Screening Tool \u00a0with the following parameters:\nSea level Projection Source:\nFrom two highly cited journals by Kopp et al., estimating SLR mainly due to ocean thermal expansion and ice melt. The mid-range scenario projected 0.5-1.2m of SLR based on different representative concentration pathways (RCP) defined by the IPCC. While the pessimistic scenario added more mechanisms of ice-sheet melting, estimating SLR at 1m-2.5m in 2100, with a projection of 10m SLR at 2300.\nCoastal Flooding\nMore frequent coastal flooding is a direct impact of sea-level rise. Based on the Global tides and surge reanalysis by Muis et al., (2016), it is estimated that the extreme coastal water level could be from 0.2 \u2013 2.8m over the mean level. While in extreme cases like China and the Netherlands it could experience 5-10m of extreme sea levels. Here, the coastal local flood level is added on top of the projected SLR.\nPollution Scenario:\nAllows choosing the RCP, the greenhouse gas concentration trajectory defined by the IPCC.\u00a0 The mild level is based on RCP4.5, of 2\u00b0C temperature rise; while the Extreme level is based on RCP 8.5, of 4\u00b0C temperature rise.\nLuck:\nApplies to the baseline SLR, defined in the \u201cSea level projection\u201d section, upon which we add flooding. \u201cMild\u201d refers to the mid-range scenario of 0.5-1.2m, and \u201cextreme\u201d to the pessimistic scenario of 1-2.5m. We used the high-end value of each scenario (mild = 1m; extreme = 2.5m).\nYou might also like: Sea Level Rise by 2100 \u2013 New York City\nA Graphical History of Atmospheric CO2 Levels Over Time\n11 Interesting Climate Change Facts\nThe Statistics of Biodiversity Loss [2020 WWF Report]\nHand-picked stories weekly or monthly.

That means\r\neach month's MSL measurement is correlated, to an extent which varies by location, with the MSL measurements of the previous\r\nand next months. That means there are effectively fewer independent measurements, which would cause a naive confidence interval\r\ncalculation to underestimate the breadth of the intervals. The code here follows the method of Zervas 2009, \u201cSea Level\r\nVariations of the United States 1854-2006,\u201d\nNOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 053 (or here), p. 15-24, to\r\naccount for autocorrelation, when calculating confidence intervals and prediction intervals. That isn't the only way to do it,\r\nthough, and one of the items on my to-do list is to examine alternative approaches.\r\n\n\u2021Some data is excluded from regression calculations\n\nReferences\u00a0\u2191I am grateful to the following data providers:\n1.

That means\r\neach month's MSL measurement is correlated, to an extent which varies by location, with the MSL measurements of the previous\r\nand next months. That means there are effectively fewer independent measurements, which would cause a naive confidence interval\r\ncalculation to underestimate the breadth of the intervals. The code here follows the method of Zervas 2009, \u201cSea Level\r\nVariations of the United States 1854-2006,\u201d\nNOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 053 (or here), p. 15-24, to\r\naccount for autocorrelation, when calculating confidence intervals and prediction intervals. That isn't the only way to do it,\r\nthough, and one of the items on my to-do list is to examine alternative approaches.\r\n\n\u2021Some data is excluded from regression calculations\n\nReferences\u00a0\u2191I am grateful to the following data providers:\n1.

      "Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\nMain navigation\nHeader Buttons\nBreadcrumb\nWhere Does the Budget Stand Compared to Historical Averages?\n\nRecently, there has been a lot of discussion over whether the country has a revenue problem or a spending problem. While there is no way to definitively answer that question \u2013 by definition, our fiscal problems are due to the disconnect between spending and revenue \u2013 one way to evaluate our situation would be to put spending and revenue in a historical context as a share of economic output. From that perspective, it is clear the answer is \"both.\"\nIncorporating the effects of the recent budget deal, federal spending is expected to total 21.1 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, while revenue is expected to total about 16.6 percent of GDP. With 50-year historical averages for spending and revenue at 20.3 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively, that means spending will be higher and revenue will be lower than their historical\u00a0averages by about the same amount:\u00a00.8 percent of GDP.\nThis wasn't always so. As recently as 2017, revenue was close to its historical average, and as recently as 2018, spending was as well. But thanks in large part to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, both have departed from these averages.\nDue to the rising costs of health, retirement, and interest spending, spending is projected to diverge from its average even further. We estimate that over the next decade, spending will rise to 23.1\u00a0percent of GDP by 2029, which is 2.8 percentage points\u00a0above the historical average. Revenue will rise above its historical average but largely because the net revenue-losing portions of the TCJA are scheduled to expire, mostly after 2025. If those and other tax cuts were continued as the Congressional Budget Office presents in its Alternative Fiscal Scenario (AFS), revenue would remain below its historical average at least through the next decade, with revenue 0.4 percentage points below that average in 2029.\u00a0\nThe fact that spending and revenue are above and below their historical averages, respectively, is troubling, especially since even at these\u00a0averages debt has risen by about 50 percent of GDP over the past half century to its highest level since just after World War II.\nIn the past when the economy was strong and unemployment was low, revenue usually rose above average levels as a share of GDP while spending fell below. This time, policymakers have continued to cut taxes and increase spending regardless of the fiscal consequences.\nTrending\n$700 Billion of Easy Deficit Reduction\nWith the national debt approaching record levels and interest costs exploding, lawmakers will need to consider substantial spending cuts and revenue increases to put the national debt on a more...\nAs the Fed Cuts Rates, Treasury Yields Are Rising\nWith last week\u2019s rate decision, the Federal Reserve has now cut the federal funds rate by 75 basis points over the past eight weeks.

      "Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\nMain navigation\nHeader Buttons\nBreadcrumb\nWhere Does the Budget Stand Compared to Historical Averages?\n\nRecently, there has been a lot of discussion over whether the country has a revenue problem or a spending problem. While there is no way to definitively answer that question \u2013 by definition, our fiscal problems are due to the disconnect between spending and revenue \u2013 one way to evaluate our situation would be to put spending and revenue in a historical context as a share of economic output. From that perspective, it is clear the answer is \"both.\"\nIncorporating the effects of the recent budget deal, federal spending is expected to total 21.1 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, while revenue is expected to total about 16.6 percent of GDP. With 50-year historical averages for spending and revenue at 20.3 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively, that means spending will be higher and revenue will be lower than their historical\u00a0averages by about the same amount:\u00a00.8 percent of GDP.\nThis wasn't always so. As recently as 2017, revenue was close to its historical average, and as recently as 2018, spending was as well. But thanks in large part to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, both have departed from these averages.\nDue to the rising costs of health, retirement, and interest spending, spending is projected to diverge from its average even further. We estimate that over the next decade, spending will rise to 23.1\u00a0percent of GDP by 2029, which is 2.8 percentage points\u00a0above the historical average. Revenue will rise above its historical average but largely because the net revenue-losing portions of the TCJA are scheduled to expire, mostly after 2025. If those and other tax cuts were continued as the Congressional Budget Office presents in its Alternative Fiscal Scenario (AFS), revenue would remain below its historical average at least through the next decade, with revenue 0.4 percentage points below that average in 2029.\u00a0\nThe fact that spending and revenue are above and below their historical averages, respectively, is troubling, especially since even at these\u00a0averages debt has risen by about 50 percent of GDP over the past half century to its highest level since just after World War II.\nIn the past when the economy was strong and unemployment was low, revenue usually rose above average levels as a share of GDP while spending fell below. This time, policymakers have continued to cut taxes and increase spending regardless of the fiscal consequences.\nTrending\n$700 Billion of Easy Deficit Reduction\nWith the national debt approaching record levels and interest costs exploding, lawmakers will need to consider substantial spending cuts and revenue increases to put the national debt on a more...\nAs the Fed Cuts Rates, Treasury Yields Are Rising\nWith last week\u2019s rate decision, the Federal Reserve has now cut the federal funds rate by 75 basis points over the past eight weeks.

Areas that are hydrologically connected to the ocean are shown in shades of blue (darker blue = greater depth).\nLow-lying areas, displayed in green, are hydrologically \"unconnected\" areas that may also flood. They are determined solely by how well the elevation data captures the area\u2019s drainage characteristics. The mapping may not accurately capture detailed hydrologic/hydraulic features such as canals, ditches, and stormwater infrastructure. A more detailed analysis, may be required to determine the area\u2019s actual susceptibility to flooding.\nThere is not 100% confidence in the elevation data and/or mapping process. It is important not to focus on the exact extent of inundation, but rather to examine the level of confidence that the extent of inundation is accurate (see mapping confidence tab).\nScenarios\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

These new scenarios were developed by the U.S. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force as input into the U.S. Global Change Research\r\n                            Program Sustained Assessment process and, Fifth National Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios\r\n                            provide an update to the NOAA 2017 scenarios, which were developed as input to the Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            While these RSL scenarios begin in 2005, they have been adjusted to 2000 to more easily compare them with the 2017 RSL scenarios. They take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion.  \r\n                        \n\r\n                            By 2050 (relative to sea level in 2000), RSL projections range from 0.40\u20100.45 meters along the East Coast,\r\n                            0.55\u20100.65 meters along the Gulf Coast, 0.20\u20100.30 meters along the West Coast, 0.20\u20100.35 meters along\r\n                            the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands, 0.30 meters along the northern coast of Alaska, and an RSL\r\n                            decrease along the southern coast of Alaska\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Another important change from the 2017 scenarios is the exclusion of the extreme (2.5 meter)\r\n                            scenario. Based on the most recent scientific understanding, and as discussed in the IPCC AR6, the\r\n                            uncertain physical processes that could lead to much higher increases in sea level are now viewed as\r\n                            less plausible in the coming decades before potentially becoming a factor toward the end of the 21st\r\n                            century. A GMSL increase of 2.5 meters is thus viewed as less plausible and the associated scenario has\r\n                            been removed.\r\n                        \n2017 Sea Level Rise Technical Report:\n\r\n                            The five relative sea level rise (RSL) scenarios shown in this tab are derived from NOAA Technical Report\r\n                            NOS CO-OPS 083: \u201cGlobal and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States\u201d using the same\r\n                            methods as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change Curve Calculator. These new\r\n                            scenarios were developed by the Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools\r\n                            Interagency Task Force, jointly convened by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the\r\n                            National Ocean Council as input to the USGCRP Sustained Assessment process and Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios provide a revision to the global scenarios that were developed\r\n                            (Parris et. al, 2012) as input to the Third National Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            These RSL scenarios begin in 2000 and take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional\r\n                            changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local\r\n                            vertical land motion.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            For almost all the scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be greater than the global average in the U.S. Northeast\r\n                            and the western Gulf of Mexico. In intermediate and low scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be less than the\r\n                            global average in much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For high scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be\r\n                            higher than the global average along all U.S. coastlines outside Alaska.\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nAdditional Information:\n\r\n                            A RSL-change adjustment to the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983-2001) will cause a minimal\r\n                            offset that may be needed for some applications. The USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator can\r\n                            correct for this offset.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Rounding to the nearest 1-foot mapping increment to view potential impacts is appropriate based on\r\n                            the accuracy of the elevation and tidal surface data used as mapping inputs.\r\n                        \nMapping Confidence\nThe inundation areas depicted in the Sea Level Rise tab are not as precise as they may appear. There are many unknowns when mapping future conditions, including natural evolution of the coastal landforms (e.g., barrier island overwash and migration), as well as the data used to predict the changes. The presentation of confidence in these maps only represents the known error in the elevation data and tidal corrections.\nBlue areas denote a high confidence of inundation, orange areas denote a high degree of uncertainty, and unshaded areas denote a high confidence that these areas will be dry given the chosen water level.\nIn this application 80% is considered a high degree of confidence such that, for example, the blue areas denote locations that may be correctly mapped as 'inundated' more than 8 out of 10 times. Areas with a high degree of uncertainty represent locations that may be mapped correctly (either as inundated or dry) less than 8 out of 10 times.\r\n                        For a detailed description of the confidence levels and their computation, see the methods document.\nMarsh\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

As sea levels increase, some\r\n                            marshes may migrate into neighboring low-lying areas, while other sections of marsh will change type or\r\n                            be lost to open water.\r\n                        \nUnderstanding the Scenarios\n\r\n                            The scenarios are derived from NOAA Sea Level Rise Technical Reports and take into account global\r\n                            mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to\r\n                            ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion. You can learn more about them within the Local\r\n                            Scenarios Tab of this viewer.\r\n                        \nNote: We do not show the low scenario as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nSocial Vulnerability\nBy overlaying social and economic data on a map that depicts sea level rise, a community can see the potential impact that sea level rise can have on vulnerable people and businesses.\nThe Social Vulnerability Index, which shows areas of high human vulnerability to hazards, is based on population attributes from Census 2010 (e.g., age and poverty) and the built environment. By looking at the intersection of potential sea level rise and vulnerable Census tracts, one can get an idea of how vulnerable populations might be affected by sea level rise. Dark red indicates tracts having a high vulnerability, and the lighter reds indicate decreasing vulnerability.\nHigh Tide Flooding\nAnnual occurrences of tidal flooding\u2014exceeding local thresholds for minor impacts\r\n            \t\t\tto infrastructure\u2014have increased 5- to 10-fold since the 1960s in several U.S. coastal\r\n            \t\t\tcities. The changes in high tide flooding over time are greatest where elevation is lower, local RSL rise is higher, or extreme variability is less.\nIn a sense, today\u2019s flood will become tomorrow\u2019s high tide, as sea level rise will cause flooding to occur more frequently and last for longer durations of time.\nThe red layer in the map represents areas currently subject to tidal flooding, often called \u201crecurrent or nuisance flooding.\u201d\nClick on a NOAA tide station icon in the map to see historical inundation events in flood days per year. The flood thresholds used in these plots are derived national flood thresholds from NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 086: Patterns and Projections of High Tide Flooding Along the U.S. Coastline Using a Common Impact Threshold. The derived thresholds used here provide a national definition of coastal flooding and impacts for quantifying and communicating risk. These thresholds may deviate from NWS impact thresholds which take into account local flood risk and are used to issue NWS coastal flood watches, warnings,  and advisories.\nCurrent Location\nHigh Tide Flooding\nHistorical Yearly Inundation Events\n\nCoastal County Snapshots\nUse the sea level rise snapshot to communicate potential impacts at the county level\nLake Level Viewer\nVisualize potential lake level changes and impacts for the U.S. Great Lakes\nCoastal Flood Exposure Mapper\nMap people, places, and natural resources that are potentially exposed to coastal flooding\nTakeaways from the 2022 Sea Level Rise Technical Report\nWatch this video to explore four takeaways from the report and key actions that communities can take\nGet more sea level rise and inundation resources and tools from the Digital Coast.\nAbout Sea Level Rise Viewer v 3.0.0\nThe purpose of this map viewer is to provide federal, state, and local coastal resource managers and planners with a preliminary look at sea level rise and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses best-available, nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help estimate impacts and prioritize actions for different scenarios.\nThe data and maps in this tool illustrate the scale of potential flooding, not the exact location, and do not account for erosion, subsidence, or future construction. Water levels are shown as they would appear during the highest high tides (excludes wind-driven tides). The data, maps, and information provided should be used only as a screening-level tool for management decisions. As with all remotely sensed data, all features should be verified with a site visit. The data and maps in this tool are provided \u201cas is\u201d without warranty to their performance, merchantable state, or fitness for any particular purpose. The entire risk associated with the results and performance of these data is assumed by the user. This tool should be used strictly as a planning reference tool and not for navigation, permitting, or other legal purposes.\nAdditional Resources\nLeveed Areas Disclaimer\nLevees are displayed as yellow lines, and enclosed leveed areas are displayed as a white stippled pattern.\nMajor federal leveed areas were assumed high enough and strong enough to protect against inundation depicted in this viewer, and therefore no inundation was mapped in these regions.\nMinor (nonfederal) leveed areas were mapped using the best available elevation data that capture leveed features. In some cases, however, breaks in elevation occur along leveed areas because of flood control features being removed from elevation data, limitations of the horizontal and vertical resolution of the elevation data, the occurrence of levee drainage features, and so forth. Flooding behind levees is only depicted if breaks in elevation data occur or if the levee elevations are overtopped by the water surface. At some flood levels, alternate pathways around\u2014not through\u2014levees, walls, dams, and flood gates may exist that allow water to flow into areas protected at lower levels. In general, imperfect levee and elevation data make assessing protection difficult, and small data errors can have large consequences.\nAs new elevation data become available, or as stakeholders provide additional levee information, the NOAA Office for Coastal Management will periodically update the inundation and levee data.\n"

Areas that are hydrologically connected to the ocean are shown in shades of blue (darker blue = greater depth).\nLow-lying areas, displayed in green, are hydrologically \"unconnected\" areas that may also flood. They are determined solely by how well the elevation data captures the area\u2019s drainage characteristics. The mapping may not accurately capture detailed hydrologic/hydraulic features such as canals, ditches, and stormwater infrastructure. A more detailed analysis, may be required to determine the area\u2019s actual susceptibility to flooding.\nThere is not 100% confidence in the elevation data and/or mapping process. It is important not to focus on the exact extent of inundation, but rather to examine the level of confidence that the extent of inundation is accurate (see mapping confidence tab).\nScenarios\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

These new scenarios were developed by the U.S. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force as input into the U.S. Global Change Research\r\n                            Program Sustained Assessment process and, Fifth National Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios\r\n                            provide an update to the NOAA 2017 scenarios, which were developed as input to the Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            While these RSL scenarios begin in 2005, they have been adjusted to 2000 to more easily compare them with the 2017 RSL scenarios. They take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion.  \r\n                        \n\r\n                            By 2050 (relative to sea level in 2000), RSL projections range from 0.40\u20100.45 meters along the East Coast,\r\n                            0.55\u20100.65 meters along the Gulf Coast, 0.20\u20100.30 meters along the West Coast, 0.20\u20100.35 meters along\r\n                            the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands, 0.30 meters along the northern coast of Alaska, and an RSL\r\n                            decrease along the southern coast of Alaska\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Another important change from the 2017 scenarios is the exclusion of the extreme (2.5 meter)\r\n                            scenario. Based on the most recent scientific understanding, and as discussed in the IPCC AR6, the\r\n                            uncertain physical processes that could lead to much higher increases in sea level are now viewed as\r\n                            less plausible in the coming decades before potentially becoming a factor toward the end of the 21st\r\n                            century. A GMSL increase of 2.5 meters is thus viewed as less plausible and the associated scenario has\r\n                            been removed.\r\n                        \n2017 Sea Level Rise Technical Report:\n\r\n                            The five relative sea level rise (RSL) scenarios shown in this tab are derived from NOAA Technical Report\r\n                            NOS CO-OPS 083: \u201cGlobal and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States\u201d using the same\r\n                            methods as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change Curve Calculator. These new\r\n                            scenarios were developed by the Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools\r\n                            Interagency Task Force, jointly convened by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the\r\n                            National Ocean Council as input to the USGCRP Sustained Assessment process and Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios provide a revision to the global scenarios that were developed\r\n                            (Parris et. al, 2012) as input to the Third National Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            These RSL scenarios begin in 2000 and take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional\r\n                            changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local\r\n                            vertical land motion.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            For almost all the scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be greater than the global average in the U.S. Northeast\r\n                            and the western Gulf of Mexico. In intermediate and low scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be less than the\r\n                            global average in much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For high scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be\r\n                            higher than the global average along all U.S. coastlines outside Alaska.\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nAdditional Information:\n\r\n                            A RSL-change adjustment to the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983-2001) will cause a minimal\r\n                            offset that may be needed for some applications. The USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator can\r\n                            correct for this offset.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Rounding to the nearest 1-foot mapping increment to view potential impacts is appropriate based on\r\n                            the accuracy of the elevation and tidal surface data used as mapping inputs.\r\n                        \nMapping Confidence\nThe inundation areas depicted in the Sea Level Rise tab are not as precise as they may appear. There are many unknowns when mapping future conditions, including natural evolution of the coastal landforms (e.g., barrier island overwash and migration), as well as the data used to predict the changes. The presentation of confidence in these maps only represents the known error in the elevation data and tidal corrections.\nBlue areas denote a high confidence of inundation, orange areas denote a high degree of uncertainty, and unshaded areas denote a high confidence that these areas will be dry given the chosen water level.\nIn this application 80% is considered a high degree of confidence such that, for example, the blue areas denote locations that may be correctly mapped as 'inundated' more than 8 out of 10 times. Areas with a high degree of uncertainty represent locations that may be mapped correctly (either as inundated or dry) less than 8 out of 10 times.\r\n                        For a detailed description of the confidence levels and their computation, see the methods document.\nMarsh\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

As sea levels increase, some\r\n                            marshes may migrate into neighboring low-lying areas, while other sections of marsh will change type or\r\n                            be lost to open water.\r\n                        \nUnderstanding the Scenarios\n\r\n                            The scenarios are derived from NOAA Sea Level Rise Technical Reports and take into account global\r\n                            mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to\r\n                            ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion. You can learn more about them within the Local\r\n                            Scenarios Tab of this viewer.\r\n                        \nNote: We do not show the low scenario as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nSocial Vulnerability\nBy overlaying social and economic data on a map that depicts sea level rise, a community can see the potential impact that sea level rise can have on vulnerable people and businesses.\nThe Social Vulnerability Index, which shows areas of high human vulnerability to hazards, is based on population attributes from Census 2010 (e.g., age and poverty) and the built environment. By looking at the intersection of potential sea level rise and vulnerable Census tracts, one can get an idea of how vulnerable populations might be affected by sea level rise. Dark red indicates tracts having a high vulnerability, and the lighter reds indicate decreasing vulnerability.\nHigh Tide Flooding\nAnnual occurrences of tidal flooding\u2014exceeding local thresholds for minor impacts\r\n            \t\t\tto infrastructure\u2014have increased 5- to 10-fold since the 1960s in several U.S. coastal\r\n            \t\t\tcities. The changes in high tide flooding over time are greatest where elevation is lower, local RSL rise is higher, or extreme variability is less.\nIn a sense, today\u2019s flood will become tomorrow\u2019s high tide, as sea level rise will cause flooding to occur more frequently and last for longer durations of time.\nThe red layer in the map represents areas currently subject to tidal flooding, often called \u201crecurrent or nuisance flooding.\u201d\nClick on a NOAA tide station icon in the map to see historical inundation events in flood days per year. The flood thresholds used in these plots are derived national flood thresholds from NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 086: Patterns and Projections of High Tide Flooding Along the U.S. Coastline Using a Common Impact Threshold. The derived thresholds used here provide a national definition of coastal flooding and impacts for quantifying and communicating risk. These thresholds may deviate from NWS impact thresholds which take into account local flood risk and are used to issue NWS coastal flood watches, warnings,  and advisories.\nCurrent Location\nHigh Tide Flooding\nHistorical Yearly Inundation Events\n\nCoastal County Snapshots\nUse the sea level rise snapshot to communicate potential impacts at the county level\nLake Level Viewer\nVisualize potential lake level changes and impacts for the U.S. Great Lakes\nCoastal Flood Exposure Mapper\nMap people, places, and natural resources that are potentially exposed to coastal flooding\nTakeaways from the 2022 Sea Level Rise Technical Report\nWatch this video to explore four takeaways from the report and key actions that communities can take\nGet more sea level rise and inundation resources and tools from the Digital Coast.\nAbout Sea Level Rise Viewer v 3.0.0\nThe purpose of this map viewer is to provide federal, state, and local coastal resource managers and planners with a preliminary look at sea level rise and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses best-available, nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help estimate impacts and prioritize actions for different scenarios.\nThe data and maps in this tool illustrate the scale of potential flooding, not the exact location, and do not account for erosion, subsidence, or future construction. Water levels are shown as they would appear during the highest high tides (excludes wind-driven tides). The data, maps, and information provided should be used only as a screening-level tool for management decisions. As with all remotely sensed data, all features should be verified with a site visit. The data and maps in this tool are provided \u201cas is\u201d without warranty to their performance, merchantable state, or fitness for any particular purpose. The entire risk associated with the results and performance of these data is assumed by the user. This tool should be used strictly as a planning reference tool and not for navigation, permitting, or other legal purposes.\nAdditional Resources\nLeveed Areas Disclaimer\nLevees are displayed as yellow lines, and enclosed leveed areas are displayed as a white stippled pattern.\nMajor federal leveed areas were assumed high enough and strong enough to protect against inundation depicted in this viewer, and therefore no inundation was mapped in these regions.\nMinor (nonfederal) leveed areas were mapped using the best available elevation data that capture leveed features. In some cases, however, breaks in elevation occur along leveed areas because of flood control features being removed from elevation data, limitations of the horizontal and vertical resolution of the elevation data, the occurrence of levee drainage features, and so forth. Flooding behind levees is only depicted if breaks in elevation data occur or if the levee elevations are overtopped by the water surface. At some flood levels, alternate pathways around\u2014not through\u2014levees, walls, dams, and flood gates may exist that allow water to flow into areas protected at lower levels. In general, imperfect levee and elevation data make assessing protection difficult, and small data errors can have large consequences.\nAs new elevation data become available, or as stakeholders provide additional levee information, the NOAA Office for Coastal Management will periodically update the inundation and levee data.\n"

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows.

When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows.

When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

      "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 (Week 16) using Drought Monitor Data Gregg Ibendahl April 19, 2024 Week 16 prediction1 Kansas wheat estimate for 4/19/24 Using Drought Monitor Data Yield range from 39.1 to 46.2 Predicted yield of 42.6 Abstract This paper uses data from the U.S. drought monitor website (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu2) to predict yields on a crop reporting district (CRD) level for Kansas. These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F. A. 2017.\nDrought Severity and Cover- age Index.\nUnited States Drought Monitor.\ndroughtmoni-tor.unl.edu/About/AbouttheData/ DSCI.aspx 4Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available. In other words, the drought index only shows moisture deficit levels and not excess moisture levels.\nWhile this report currently indicates a below average wheat year, the wide confidence intervals indicate these predictions could improve with timely rains. It is still early spring after all. The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5"
