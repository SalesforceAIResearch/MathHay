Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nKenneth Dorell\ninvestor@meta.com\u00a0/ investor.fb.com\nPress:\nRyan Moore\npress@meta.com\u00a0/ about.fb.com/news/\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nKenneth Dorell\ninvestor@meta.com\u00a0/ investor.fb.com\nPress:\nRyan Moore\npress@meta.com\u00a0/ about.fb.com/news/\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

      "Knowledge\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Top 5 Trends for Defence in 2024\r\n\t\t\t\nGreat challenges will bring huge opportunities in 2024, as the defence and aerospace industry seeks to rise to a diverse range of hurdles. Amid these headwinds, Defence Engage looks at the trends which could come to characterise 2024, from battling skills shortages to pivotal digitalisation efforts.\nMarked by ongoing conflicts in Israel-Palestine and Ukraine, 2024 will see ongoing tensions with China and Iran which pose significant threats to the international order. Geopolitical concerns aside, the industry grapples with supply chain issues, talent shortages, operational risks, and rising costs amid inflation. In the biggest global election year in history we could see significant strategic changes from key players such as the USA, UK, India, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Russia. Here are the five key trends likely to dominate 2024\u2026\n\u00a0\n#1 AI and digitalisation efforts to bring security and efficiencies\nThe defence industry faces challenges in rapidly adopting new defensive systems and procedures to keep up with adversaries' technological innovations. From upgrading aging software to mitigate cyber threats, to expanding access to, and the adoption of, key cyber credentials, keeping up with digital trends remains pivotal. Meanwhile, governments are prioritising bringing AI to maturity while ensuring its development is safe and responsible. The rapid adoption of AI, spurred by recent advancements like Chat-GPT, is underway in industry, and indeed OpenAI has already started the year by easing its stance on the use of ChatGPT for military purposes.\nThe impact of AI for defence is forecast to be significant, from helping front-line users detect threats to activating cyber defences faster and with greater agility. Additionally, the integration of AI into defence supply chains could improve platform and parts delivery efficiency, reducing delays and costs, whilst improving security. Meanwhile, digital twins, coupled with machine learning, can enhance visibility of supply chain problems or complexities. According to a BAE report, 86% of defence and aerospace decision makers say their nation has adopted AI for defence applications, so the technology is set to become increasingly mature in 2024.\n\u00a0\n#2 Decarbonisation initiatives continue\nFollowing recent data which indicates that 2023 was the hottest year ever, the impetus behind decarbonisation efforts sees renewed urgency. The contribution of the global defence industry to carbon emissions has come under a microscope, with some having suggested that the sector had been overlooked, but there have been some major decarbonisation initiatives, including the establishment of NATO\u2019s Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and the UK\u2019s Sustainable Support Strategy.\nThe impact of climate change upon defence goes beyond the weight of its own contributions, with both the UN and NATO describing climate change as a \u2018threat multiplier\u2019, alluding to the destabilising impact climate can have on societies and economies. Industry is rising to meet the challenge, with innovations such as new power solutions or increased circularity in manufacturing. \u00a0Last year the EU signalled its intention for defence supply chains to become more sustainable, alongside developing more localised energy in a drive for logistical resilience. Individual initiatives such as the Royal Air Force\u2019s first use of sustainable aviation fuel in a fighter aircraft are lighting the way towards a greener, more sustainable, military.\n\u00a0\n#3 Recruitment challenges to persist\nDefence is facing significant challenges when it comes to acquiring talent, skills and retention, from front-line military roles to cyber, quantum and manufacturing. In recent weeks the UK\u2019s Royal Navy has seen significant problems with hiring, at a critical time for the force, with ships being deployed to the Red Sea to counter Houthi Rebels. Last month, the Times reported that Armed forces and defence companies are locked in \u2018a war for talent\u2019.\nDwindling forces are due to the lack of recruits for basic training, a lack of digital skills, and the pull of incentives given by neighbouring sectors. The EU and US have recently signalled their plans to try and combat personnel shortages in key areas. The US\u2019 new Defence Industrial Strategy, cites \u2018workforce readiness\u2019 as a key strategic focus, with a desire to develop a \u2018sufficiently skilled and staffed workforce\u2019. Meanwhile, the European Commission expects skills shortages to increase into the future, with defence urgently requiring skills and talent acquisition, as procurement organisations seek to develop and manage emerging disruptive technologies.\n\u00a0\n#4 Agile supply chains to be prioritised\nThe scramble to arm Ukraine and Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China have highlighted US and allied supply chain vulnerabilities. The last couple of years have seen efforts to build a more resilient supply chain. The US CHIPS act and the EU CHIPS Act designed to securitise semiconductor supply, the European Defence Agency has set out to ensure \u2018security of supply\u2019 across the EU, and at the start of 2024, the US\u2019 Defence Industrial Strategy took aim at supply chain fragility, seeking to make it more sustainable alongside more flexible acquisition processes.\n2024 will see more emphasis on agile supply chains: increasing pressure to move away from lengthy procurement processes that cannot react quickly enough or where the end product could be outdated by the time it comes into service. There will be a race to secure and effect easy access to increasingly scarce resources such as minerals driven by the appetite for batteries and the move away from fossil fuels. The surge of additive manufacturing creates a \u2018just in time\u2019 supply option, while new military tactics such as the use of drones and increasing need for cyber security will continue to push military to commercial and more readily available solutions.\n\u00a0\n#5 Alliances and collaboration lead development and procurement\nCollaborative development programmes such as the sixth-generation fighter efforts: Tempest (by Italy, Japan and the UK) and FCAS (by France, Germany and Spain), are key initiatives designed to combine the best of each nation\u2019s domestic capabilities and combat declining resources. Meanwhile, the AUKUS programme demonstrates how two established nuclear navies (UK and US) are aiding Australia in bolstering Indo-Pacific security. Furthermore, NATO\u2019s Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA), which opened its doors with three innovation challenges in 2023, has established test centres and accelerator units across Europe and North America. The collaboration of NATO members is nothing new, but this more centralised effort to progress on emerging disruptive technologies is hoped to go from strength to strength in 2024.\nGroup-purchases have become increasingly common amongst NATO allies in recent years, with a marked increase since the war in Ukraine began. Just two weeks ago, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain agreed to jointly purchase $5.5 billion worth of Patriot missiles following their effective use observed in Ukraine. Additionally, the research opportunities posed by the war in Ukraine have seen allies and industry testing experimental tech in partnership with Ukrainian soldiers, helping speed up development initiatives, particularly for drones. Following on from the big trend of multi-domain integration, Defence Engage expects multi-national development, purchases and bids to strengthen regional military power and aid embattled allies such as Israel and Ukraine, to continue in 2024 amid ongoing geopolitical upheaval.\n\u00a0\nKeep ahead of the trends\nDefence Engage connects suppliers and buyers to help make defence accessible, follow us on LinkedIn or register for our weekly Defence Contracts Digest to stay apprised of new solutions and collaboration opportunities this year.\nWant to discover more about how Defence Engage can enhance your lead-gen efforts and boost your discoverability in Defence?

Why has the society not made faster progress on cancer front? Why do discoveries in biotechnology sector occur in fits and spurts? We claim that this slow and sporadic progress has a lot to do with the vagaries of capital markets. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s begin with a success story. There is little doubt that BioNTech (Pfizer), Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines had a profound impact on the developed world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Without them, countless more lives and trillions of dollars of economic value would have been further lost. The stock prices of these companies reached dramatic peaks after the world learned about their success. However, as of this week, they have already shed 50% of their peak market values, while we are still in the midst of the pandemic. This rapid rise and fall of these biotechnology stocks is not just about the Covid-vaccine stocks but also about the fortunes of the biotechnology sector as a whole. We describe this roller-coaster phenomenon in this post and claim that this phenomenon is not healthy for the society, particularly given the aging population and increasing need for new healthcare solutions.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\nContrary to popular beliefs, most of the new drugs or vaccines are not discovered by big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer or Merck. The development chain of a new life-science product can be divided into several phases: synthesis (discovery of a molecule or formulation), initial research (preclinical tests in lab and trials on animals), and development (human trials). The initial steps are typically taken by individual scientists, biotechnology start-ups, and research labs of universities. Those early-stage discoveries, their patents, or the discovering companies themselves, are then bought by the big pharmaceutical companies. The later steps in the development chain require numerous approvals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is numerous long and costly processes, that can only be done by big pharma. The next steps after FDA approval can also be undertaken only by big pharma: creation of brands through massive advertising campaigns, putting and scaling up manufacturing capabilities, and distribution of drugs using extensive vendor network. Small companies can try, but the likelihood of success is low given their lack of experience and capabilities in these areas. For example, Novavax is yet to be launched in the US, despite a claim that is it a better vaccine than the currently available ones.\nConsider two of Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest drugs from before Covid period: Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Palbociclib (Ibrance). They were discovered by Northwestern University and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blockbuster product, infliximab (Remicade), was synthesized at New York University in collaboration with a small biotechnology company Centocor. More recently, BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s synthesized the Covid Vaccine. It then entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to \u00e2\u0080\u009cleverage Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broad expertise in vaccine research and development, regulatory capabilities, and global manufacturing and distribution network.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biohaven, a small biotech company, relied on Pfizer for the commercialization of its migraine drug Rimegepant.\nIt must be clear from the above discussion that small biotech firms or research labs play the foundational role in innovation of drugs and vaccines. That innovation must benefit the society, evident from the progress in healthcare, physical well being, and increasing longevity of human beings over the last century. Yet, synthesis and discovery are not straightforward activities. Behind each successful product lie millions of research hours and thousands of synthesized products that never see the light of the day. Out of thousands of synthesized molecules, only few reach what is called Phase 1 success, and just 10% of those receive FDA approval. Even after FDA approval, only a few products are launched in the market, because a launching firm must reassess market potential before spending additional billions of dollars in creating manufacturing, branding, and distribution network. So, only a few start-ups, even among those that successfully synthesized products, are finally rewarded by big pharma. Why would a small company, or a group of scientists and doctors, devote their precious time, give up their careers, and spend their meager resources to develop something that has less than a lottery like chance to succeed? The answer is lottery like payoffs.\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider a few examples. From market value of just $5 billion at the end of 2018, Moderna reached a valuation of $181 billion dollars in Sept 2021.\u00c2\u00a0 BioNTech, which got listed in October 2019, reached a peak value of $108 billion in Aug 2021. This phenomenon is not just about Covid vaccines. Axsome Therapeutics, which traded for just $2 per share by the end of 2018, reached $108 dollars by the end of 2019. More important, big pharma pays large premiums to acquire listed companies and unlisted start-ups. For example, in 2017, Gilead acquired a small biotech Kite Pharma, for $11.9 billion, and in 2020, Bayer acquired Asklepios, a gene-therapy startup, for a total cost of $4 billion. Acquisition by Big Pharma is typically the endgame for most biotech start-ups.\nBut the efforts and cost spent on drug development, after adjusting for inflation, keep doubling every nine years. This phenomenon is described in Eroom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law. (For curious people, Eroom is opposite of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law, which describes the decreasing costs of discovering new products in electronics.) Given the rising costs, only rising lottery payoffs can keep up the incentives for small biotechnology start-ups to bet it all on their ventures. Indeed, announcement of each new multibillion dollar acquisition lifts both valuations and innovation efforts across the industry.\nHowever, the purpose of this post is not to describe that small, biotechnology firms have lottery like payoffs, but to emphasize that any drop in lottery type payoffs could have an opposite impact on the society. The valuations of biotechnology companies have recently declined rather rapidly. Moderna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $64 billion and BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $38 billion, both more than 50% off their recent peaks. And it is not just about a few, isolated stocks. Diversified funds, that invest in hundreds of biotechnology stocks, are also off their recent peaks. For example, XBI, an S&P Exchange Traded Fund investing in biotechnology companies, is down 50% of its peak in less than twelve months. Neither the tech-heavy Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 index have declined by that much over the past one year, on the contrary, both have increased.\nWhy should one worry about sudden decline in valuations of biotechnology firms, or the vagaries in their fortunes? Well, they have a real impact on the society because an elaborate system of multi-stage and risky financing drives new drug discovery. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider this chain of thought. Now big pharma would pay a lower price for successful innovation, and a successful biotech firm now has a lower chance of doing the initial public offering or being acquired at an astounding price. Lowering of lottery like payoffs, in conjunction with the rising costs of discoveries, means that venture capitalists would pull out investments from risky biotech projects and doctors and researchers will spend less hours in synthesizing new drugs. Importantly, some promising research would not progress further, and their discoveries would be prematurely lost. Thus, the roller coaster in the fortunes of biotechnology sector now means lower chance of developing new drugs and vaccines, as well as loss of promising research effort. This is not just like putting off another steel plant, which can increase the steel prices, and increase the costs of automobiles. Not discovering a drug or a vaccine means prolonged illness, pain, or even more deaths. It may sound macabre, but fluctuating stock market fortunes of biotech firms would impact the health and wellbeing of citizens, something that personally touches us all, even if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invest in stock markets.\nIn sum, the rapid rise and fall of biotechnology sector adversely impact society. How to solve this problem? One proposed solution by MIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Andrew Lo, is to pool the risks of multiple cancer projects and fund it using a superfund. We strongly endorse this idea. However, it is unclear how a superfund can better allocate seed capital to individual small projects than can capital markets or venture funds which are known for their speed and efficiency. Another idea is that such important research should not be left to private ventures but should instead be done by government sponsored and not-for-profit research institutions. Indeed, health-sector research is the largest avenue for government R&D funding, sponsored through National Institute of Health. Recall that government research funding was instrumental in development of Covid vaccines. Furthermore, the benefits from public R&D spill over to many more public and private projects that do benefit from private R&D. This point is enforced by President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent announcement on cancer research.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe key takeaway from this post is that there is a need for a new model to fund grassroot research in biotechnology sector. On one hand, the current model, based on venture funding, unleashes entrepreneurial energies and efforts, and attracts the best talent to biotechnology sector. On the other hand, the vagaries of biotechnology stocks in capital markets lead to fits and starts in biotechnology discoveries and cause frequent loss of promising research. Society must find a happy balance between the two forces and find a new way to address this problem, a problem that cannot be simply left to free markets.\n\n   Volume 66, Issue 4\n   Summer 2024\n   \nTo Be or Not to Be: Will Virtual Worlds and the Metaverse Gain Lasting Traction?\nThe Metaverse Flywheel: Creating Value across Physical and Virtual Worlds\nThe Diffusion of the Metaverse: How YouTube Influencers Shape Mass Adoption\nMetaverse Management as Urban Planning: Lessons from Paradise (Nevada)\nGreen Innovation Games\nCalifornia Management Review\nBerkeley-Haas's Premier Management Journal\nPublished at Berkeley Haas for more than sixty years, California Management Review seeks to share knowledge that challenges convention and shows a better way of doing business.\nHaas School of Business\n                University of California, Berkeley\nCalifornia Management Review\n                F465 Berkeley Haas School of Business\n\t\t\t\t2220 Piedmont Ave. Berkeley, CA 94720-1900\n\t\t\t\t(510) 725-7826 |\n\t\t\t\tcmr@haas.berkeley.edu\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2024 UC Regents | UC Berkeley | Privacy Policy\n"

      "News\nLife\nEntertainment\nFinance\nSports\nNew on Yahoo\nYahoo Finance\nFDA Events Can Send Stocks Soaring: Here's One That Absolutely No One Is Talking About\nBiotech and healthcare stocks are loved by traders for their big price moves, which usually happen when a company makes progress (or faces problems) with their developmental products like drugs and devices. Results from Phase I, II and III clinical studies, and FDA or European approvals (and rejections), can send stocks soaring.\nEveryone is familiar with these monster moves. Recent examples include Amarin Corp's (AMRN) 3X move in one day, or Zosano Pharma Corporations' (ZSAN) 100% rip on recent study results. Now, a new entrant in the large neurological market, NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC), could be on the eve of their first FDA approval, and few investors are paying attention to this small company because it's so new and quiet about what they're doing.\nNevertheless, NMTC is 10% owned by the Mayo Clinic and has a stable of veteran physicians and researchers on their board and advisory board. With the possibility of two FDA clearances in 2019 for their first planned medical devices, the company could have a breakout year if they execute and move from unknown to mainstream.\nNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2019 / Small healthcare stocks are known for making heroic moves, often when their development-phase drugs or devices move closer to going commercial. Completion of Phase I, II, and III trials can all send stocks rallying, as can approvals from European and U.S. regulators.\nCase in point, Zosano Pharma's (ZSAN) recent monster 100% move recently when they announced success in a Trial of their drug for migraines. Amarin Corp (AMRN) saw their stock price triple after their drug Vascepa succeeded in a large Phase III study.\nThe largest moves tend to happen when most investors aren't paying much attention, and that could be the setup for a newer neuro company that recently made their way to the public markets. NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC) is a small developer of electrode technology that just quietly submitted their first product to the U.S. FDA for a possible clearance early in 2019. NeuroOne's technologies - sometimes known as ''neurostimulation'' devices - have been tested at the Mayo Clinic, which is also a 10% owner of the company's public stock. Now that the company is headed towards their first possible FDA clearance, and with a second possible clearance for another device right on its heels, NMTC is a healthcare company to be aware of before it gets discovered.\nNeuroOne Operates In An $8B And Growing Device Market\nThe emerging field of neurostimulation refers to technologies that electrically stimulate or monitor the nervous system to treat and diagnose disorders. Though humans have learned much about the nervous system in the last twenty years, it remains a mysterious organ and technology has only recently begun to unlock some new treatment options. These devices are now helping in a variety of difficult neurological disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, Dystonia, Epilepsy and even in the treatment of pain and some nerve damage.\nIt's an exciting time as this industry takes off. In 2019 the research firm Global Markets Insights expect this to be a $8.196 billion industry across the globe, and $6.5 billion in North America and Europe alone.\nOne of the earliest successes for neurostimulation devices was in Epilepsy and Parkinson's using Deep Brain Stimulation, or DBS and ablation. After identifying brain tissue that may be causing Epileptic seizures or movement problems as in severe Parkinson's, neurologists can selectively modulate or destroy this tissue with a DBS or ablation device, reducing or sometimes eliminating symptoms of the disorder. In fact, ablation can cure about 50% of Epileptic patients.\nThe hangup for many Parkinson's, Dystonia, or Epilepsy patients who are eligible for DBS or ablation is the traumatic surgical requirements, not only for treatment but also to diagnose and pinpoint the affecting brain tissue. It can take weeks in the hospital, sometimes with wires protruding from a patient's skull!\nHere's where NeuroOne hopes to make its mark on the industry. The company's initial devices are high-fidelity electrodes designed to enhance and possibly shorten this diagnostic/treatment process. These thin-film electrodes, used in a procedure called an EEG (electroencephalogram), may provide more accurate detection of irregular brain activity over currently available technology. In limited clinical testing so far, doctors at the Mayo Clinic have been able to document pre-seizure activity (called micro-seizures) during clinical research with their patients using NeuroOne's technology. The electrodes are being developed as strips and depth electrodes, and they've already demonstrated an improvement in inflammatory response compared to existing products when used on some brain tissue. With better diagnostic process, NeuroOne hopes that their products can shorten the diagnostic time and improve safey for Epileptics and patients suffering from movement disorders.\nCombined, this first technology addresses a demand for improved diagnostic options among neurologists, and NeuroOne is now racing to market with their first medical devices for approval.\nNMTC Quietly Made Their First FDA Clearance Application\nNeuroOne has been mostly quiet on the investor front, but in a recent SEC filing they revealed that they filed their first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) application on January 28, 2019. The application covers their cortical and strip electrodes for temporary (less than 30 day) use with recording, monitoring, and acute stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring and stimulation of electrical signals on the surface of the brain.\nIn the case of this 510(k) process, which is used when the device holds a low risk to the patient, the FDA will aim to complete its review within 90 days of receiving the notification.\nThis is the biggest gating event for NeuroOne since the company went public, and it could take them from a development stage company to commercial and their first revenue. An FDA clearance could launch the into the mainstream of healthcare companies, and investors will undoubtedly take notice of this tiny company.\nThe company also plans to file a FDA 510(k) marketing clearance for their first depth electrode during the second quarter. Following that, they're working on a unique diagnostic/ablation device that could further shorten and simplify the treatment time for patients.\nNMTC could have two value-driving events in the next 5-6 months, and the markets are barely paying attention.\nStrong Advisory Board Backs NeuroOne, And Mayo Owns 10% Of The Company\nThe breadth of expertise involved in NeuroOne is impressive. The company has strong advisors and executives, and their technology has been tested over the years by both the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the Mayo Clinic, the latter of which is also a 10% holder of NMTC's public stock.\nSince going public, NeuroOne has been building a team of experienced medical tech and neurology advisory members: Mayo Clinic's Greg Worrell MD, PhD and Gregory J. Esper, MD, MBA of Emory University both sit on the company's scientific advisory board. More recently, Dr. Kip Ludwig, former Program Director for Neural Engineering at the NIH, became chair of the company's new \"artificial intelligence\" advisory board, which will focus on deploying NeuroOne's electrode technology in artificial intelligence and bioelectronics applications. Dr. Cristin Welle of the Univ. of Colorado joined, a founder of the Neural Interfaces Program at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of Science and Engineering Labs; plus Dr. Doug Weber, a Program Manager in the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) at DARPA.\nEvaluating AI opens up some unique possible opportunities as more researchers have considered the potential for electrode/brain interfaces. The possibility for some kind of translational work in this space is intriguing.\n2019 Should Be A Big Year For NMTC Shareholders\nNeuroOne has been operating in stealth mode for the last year, but 2019 could be when investors start to pay attention. The company will likely have 2 FDA clearances in the next 6 months if the FDA signs off on their cortical and depth electrode 510(k) filings. As this stock has been mostly flat since going public, these events may be the first time that investors stand up and take notice. Additionally, NMTC plans to apply for a listing on the Nasdaq, another catalyst that could create significant value for shareholders if NMTC can qualify. With CEO Dave Rosa's successful track record building venture stage healthcare companies, multiple value creating catalysts on the horizon, and an awesome technology with blue sky potential, investors long NMTC could be handsomely rewarded for a patient long position in this relatively unknown healthcare company.\nAbout One Equity Stocks\nOne Equity Stocks is a provider of paid-for research on publicly traded emerging growth companies.

Moreover, because it may be difficult to find quotations for certain penny stocks, they may be difficult, or even impossible, to accurately price. For these, and other reasons, penny stocks are generally considered speculative investments. Consequently, investors in penny stocks should be prepared for the possibility that they may lose their whole investment (or an amount in excess of their investment if they purchased penny stocks on margin).\nSOURCE: One Equity Stocks\nView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/536396/FDA-Events-Can-Send-Stocks-Soaring-Heres-One-That-Absolutely-No-One-Is-Talking-About\nSign in to create a watchlist"

      "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 (Week 16) using Drought Monitor Data Gregg Ibendahl April 19, 2024 Week 16 prediction1 Kansas wheat estimate for 4/19/24 Using Drought Monitor Data Yield range from 39.1 to 46.2 Predicted yield of 42.6 Abstract This paper uses data from the U.S. drought monitor website (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu2) to predict yields on a crop reporting district (CRD) level for Kansas. These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F. A. 2017.\nDrought Severity and Cover- age Index.\nUnited States Drought Monitor.\ndroughtmoni-tor.unl.edu/About/AbouttheData/ DSCI.aspx 4Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available. In other words, the drought index only shows moisture deficit levels and not excess moisture levels.\nWhile this report currently indicates a below average wheat year, the wide confidence intervals indicate these predictions could improve with timely rains. It is still early spring after all. The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5"

In addition, approximately 300 polar bears are held in captivity. However, the world's population of polar bears is on a decline, and some scientists fear they could become extinct by 2100. To protect these majestic creatures, the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibit harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing polar bears.\nA significant portion of the polar bear population resides in Canada, where two-thirds of all polar bears live. About 16,000 polar bears are spread across 13 provinces and territories, including Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Northern Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland, and Labrador. Notably, Churchill, Manitoba, is known as the polar bear capital of the world due to its high concentration of these animals.\nIn the United States, Alaska is the only state with a polar bear population, estimated to be between 4,000 and 7,000 individuals. The polar bears in Alaska are primarily divided into two subpopulations: those in the Chukchi Sea, or Alaska-Chukotka, and the Southern Beaufort Sea.\nRussia is home to an estimated 26,000 polar bears, living on islands and the mainland coast. Wrangel Island, a UNESCO-protected nature reserve in Russia, is often referred to as a polar bear maternity ward. Additional polar bear populations in Russia are found in the Barents Sea region, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya, and the Far East Village.\nGreenland's fjords and glacial ice are also home to polar bears, though they are elusive and rarely seen. It's estimated that around 4,400 polar bears inhabit Greenland, with two protected areas, Melville Bay and Greenland National Park, supporting polar bear populations.\nThe Svalbard archipelago in Norway is another prime location for spotting polar bears, with an estimated population of around 3,000. Despite their remote habitats, polar bear encounters can sometimes be dangerous. Since the 1970s, there have been six recorded human fatalities due to polar bear attacks.\nMost polar bears in captivity are found in zoos, aquariums, and parks across Europe, North America, and Asia, contributing to conservation and education efforts about these iconic Arctic inhabitants.\n\nThe global polar bear population is estimated to be 20000-25000 individuals as of 2023, shared between all countries included in the species' range: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia, and the United States, as well as in international polar regions.\nPolar bears often roam from one country's territory into another, particularly in the winter when the polar ice reaches its broadest spread. As such, per-country population estimates are logistically challenging and can become outdated very quickly.\n\nCountry\nRegions Occupied\nCanada\nLabrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Yukon Territory\nGreenland\nGreenland\nNorway\nNorway\nRussia\nChukotka, Northern European Russia, Siberia\nUnited States\nAlaska\n\nUrsus Maritimus (Polar Bear) - IUCN Red List\n\nSources\n\u00a9 2024 World Population Review \u00a0Privacy PolicyTermsContactAbout\nCite This Page\nCite This Page"

We honour their continuing culture, knowledge, beliefs and spiritual relationship and connection to Country. We also recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners of the land and sea Country on which the Australian Institute of Marine Science works and as Australia\u2019s first scientists. Coral cover remains high while impacts of mass coral bleaching yet to be determined ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF CORAL REEF CONDITION 2023\u20132024 Published 7 August 2024 In Short \u2022 This report summarises the condition of coral reefs in the Northern, Central and Southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 94 reefs conducted between August 2023 and June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). \u2022 Over the past 38 years of monitoring by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), hard coral cover on reefs of the GBR has decreased and increased in response to cycles of disturbance and recovery. \u2022 Percent hard coral cover is one standard measure of reef condition recorded by scientists worldwide, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health and is used in this report. Other important data, such as diversity or composition of coral assemblages, are collected and reported by LTMP in other ways. \u2022 Changes in coral cover are qualified with respect to the margin of error, defined by 95% credible intervals (CIs). Credible intervals describe the level of uncertainty in the estimates of hard coral cover. \u2022 Above-average water temperatures (i.e. sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1\u20132.5\u00b0C) occurred on the GBR over the austral summer, peaking in March 2024 and resulting in the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016. \u2022 The mass coral bleaching on the GBR was part of a global event declared by NOAA and ICRI in April 2024. \u2022 The Central GBR was impacted by two tropical cyclones: Cyclone Jasper (Category 5 \u2013 December 2023) and Cyclone Kirrily (Category 3 \u2013 January 2024). Although Cyclone Jasper was a Category 5 in the Coral Sea, it was only Category 2 when traversing the GBR. \u2022 Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks have persisted on four Southern GBR reefs, while four reefs of the Northern GBR have low numbers of starfish. \u2022 In 2024, hard coral cover has increased across the GBR, but regional hard coral cover remains similar to that reported in 2022 and 2023. Importantly, most surveys were conducted prior to the mass coral bleaching event and passage of two cyclones, and the full impact of these events is yet to be determined. Its also important to note that bleached coral is still recorded as live coral during surveys, and the fate of these corals is not yet known. \u2022 Of the 94 reefs surveyed, only two reefs had hard coral cover <10%, 36 reefs had hard coral cover between 10% and 30%, and 35 reefs had coral cover between 30% and 50%. The remaining 21 reefs had hard coral cover between 50% and 75%. \u2022 On the Northern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs), a regional high, but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (35.8% average; 32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs). All surveys were completed prior to the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024. \u2022 On the Central GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), a regional high but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (30.7% average; 27.5% \u2013 34.0% CIs). Twenty-three of 39 reefs were surveyed before the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024, while 17 reefs were surveyed before cyclone impacts. \u2022 On the Southern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.1% (33.7% to 44.5% CIs) from 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) in 2023. Fourteen of 30 reefs were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. \u2022 The high coral cover reported this year is good news but does not mean all is fine on the GBR as it continues to face cumulative stressors. 2024 saw the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016 with the largest spatial footprint of coral bleaching yet recorded, coupled with the impact of two tropical cyclones. The impacts on coral cover from these events are partially captured in this year's report. A full assessment of changes in coral cover following these disturbances will be recorded during the next survey season. \u2022 It is important to note that recent increases in hard coral cover can be quickly undone, as many corals are susceptible to elevated heat stress, wave damage and crown-of-thorns starfish predation, all of which impacted the GBR this year. \u2022 The results presented here are our best understanding of reef condition before the impact of summer\u2019s disturbances.

Reefs are defined as Recovering when they were previously classified with an Established or Severe Outbreak but currently have COTS numbers below outbreak thresholds. d) The coral bleaching severity (percent of hard corals bleached) recorded during in-water LTMP manta tow surveys. e) The coral bleaching severity (percent of hard corals bleached) recorded during aerial surveys. Photo credit: AIMS LTMP Background: Sampling Methods and Analysis With reef surveys extending over 38 years, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring Program provides a unique and invaluable record of change in reef status by repeatedly and consistently surveying coral reef communities on representative reefs across the entire span of the Great Barrier Reef. This annual summary of the status and trends in hard coral cover is derived from manta tow surveys of coral reefs (Figure 1). These surveys are a broadscale technique that covers reef slopes of whole reef perimeters in a short amount of time. More detailed surveys of fish and coral assemblages are also conducted along permanently marked transects on 71 reefs; however, the data from these are still being analysed and undergoing quality assurance and quality checking. They will become available on the online dashboard once completed. Our Monitoring Dashboard presents a synthesis of all AIMS\u2019 coral reef monitoring data across each of the surveyed reefs and at various spatial aggregations (including Natural Resource Management regions and latitudinal sectors). For this annual summary, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Northern, Central and Southern GBR; Figure 1) that show different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time. These changes are mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances: severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. Since 2016, GBR-wide summaries are no longer displayed, as this spatial resolution oversimplifies the variability of coral cover dynamics. Presentation of patterns for the three regions separately offers an easily interpretable overview without oversimplification or getting lost in the complexity inherent at finer spatial scales (i.e. individual reefs). A total of 94 reefs were surveyed from August 2023 to June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). Online reports on the status and trends of individual reefs and reefs grouped by latitudinal sectors, including their disturbance history, are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip and quality checking of the data. Data summaries are available for download. The reefs of the GBR are dynamic, and there is considerable variation among regions in the decline and recovery cycles of hard coral cover and community composition in response to disturbances. Understanding these dynamics in the context of the disturbance regimes is critical for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). The number of reefs able to be surveyed each year is a small portion of the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs were selected to provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures multiple geographical and ecological gradients (e.g. latitude and position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continuous improvement in the analysis of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches for the type of ecological time series data used in this report. Temporal trends in hard coral cover presented in this report are analysed using Bayesian hierarchical models, and more detail of these analytical methods is presented here.

Minor bleaching was recorded on several reefs throughout the Northern GBR, such as Swinger Reef and North Direction Island. E. Outer shelf reefs such as Davie Reef have diverse fish and corals. F. Flourishing coral assemblages at Middle Banks. Note that all surveys were conducted before the peak summer heat in March 2024. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. There was substantial variation in the condition of the 25 individual reefs surveyed in the Northern GBR (Figure 1a, Image 1). Nine of 25 reefs had coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 12 reefs had >30% \u2013 50% cover and four reefs had >50% \u2013 75% cover (Figure 1a). A total of 24 of the 25 Northern GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Of these, six had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b). However, only two were outside the margin of error, and these declines were most likely due to crown-of-thorns starfish predation and coral disease. Region-wide hard coral cover was relatively stable from 1985 to 2010, then declined to the lowest recorded levels in 2017 following cumulative impacts from crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, severe tropical cyclones (STCs Ita and Nathan), and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. There was a period of strong recovery from 2017 to 2022. Hard coral cover has increased further since 2023, from 35.8% (32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs) to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs) in 2024, the highest level since surveys began, but it remains within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 2). Surveys in 2024 found low crown-of-thorns starfish numbers at some reefs in the region (Image 1A), but all reefs were classified as either No COTS or No Outbreak (Figure 1c). Additionally, COTS feeding scars were observed on 14 reefs, indicating the presence of low numbers of starfish. Northern GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP experienced accumulated heat stress between 3.64 and 8.73 DHWs1 during peak heat accumulation in March 2024. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted from November 2023 to February 2024 before the height of summer; however, low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) (Figure 1d, Image 1C,D). No bleaching was observed on the remaining seven reefs (Figure 1d). We discuss the severity and spatial extent of the 2024 mass coral bleaching event in more detail below. Figure 2: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 25 reefs were surveyed in 2024. Note that many reefs in this region were surveyed before the peak heat stress occurred in March 2024. 1 DHWs (degree heating weeks) expresses the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHWs and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHWs. Further information available from NOAA.

More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2024. Of the 39 reefs surveyed, two reefs had <10% hard coral cover; 18 had hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 14 reefs had hard coral cover >30% \u2013 50%, and five had hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a, Image 2). A total of 30 of the 39 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Thirteen of these reefs had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b), but only two had declines outside the margin of error. Hard coral cover was higher on 17 reefs (Figure 1b), with estimates outside the margin of error on 11 reefs. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly until 2016. From 2016, region-wide hard coral cover decreased continuously to 2019, largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown\u2010of\u2010 thorns starfish. From 2017 to 2022, hard coral cover recovered, but then declined in 2023. In 2024 it increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), the highest level since surveys began, but it remained within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 3). There were no Potential, Established or Severe Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2024 (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, small numbers of COTS feeding scars were observed on 11 reefs, indicating the presence of low levels of COTS on these reefs. Cyclone Jasper crossed the Central GBR between Cooktown and Port Douglas in December 2023. No reefs in the cyclone path were surveyed after the cyclone and impacts from this event will be gauged next season. Shortly after the storm, tourism operators noted a large flood plume causing freshwater bleaching and coral mortality at inshore reefs, especially Low Isles, which will be next surveyed in 2025. Cyclone Kirrily transited the Central GBR in late January and resulted in variable impacts on the 22 reefs that were surveyed after the passage of the storm. Some reefs, such as Kelso, John Brewer, Helix and Chicken, had evidence of storm damage and declines in hard coral cover ranging from 6% to 9.9% since last being surveyed. Other reefs appear to have escaped with little impact. Central GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP were exposed to accumulated heat stress of between 3.37 and 9.31 DHWs over the summer. This resulted in low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching (Image 2C,D) on 16 of the 39 survey reefs in the Central GBR during the 2024 LTMP surveys (Figure 1d). The remaining 23 reefs had no bleaching recorded (Figure 1d, Image 2E,F); however, these reefs were all surveyed in August and September 2023, months before the heat stress occurred. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 39 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 23 of these were completed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024, and the impacts of the bleaching remains to be determined. Southern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Proserpine to Gladstone) Surveyed September 2023 to May 2024 The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 38-year survey history. Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009 reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 4). A rapid and substantial increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2017, reaching 36.7% (30.1% \u2013 44.3% CIs). However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018, and regional coral cover decreased to 29.0% (22.8% \u2013 36.2% CIs) in 2019. In 2021, coral cover had increased to 37.8% (31.6% \u2013 44.4% CIs), but it declined again to 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) by 2023 (Figure 4). In 2024, coral cover had increased to 39.1% (33.7% \u2013 44.5% CIs), but it remains within the margin of error of the past three years. The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) with nine reefs having hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, nine reefs with hard coral cover >30% \u201350% and 12 reefs with hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a). Of the 30 reefs surveyed in 2024, 25 reefs had been surveyed in the past two years. Hard coral cover was lower than previous surveys on five of these, with estimates outside the margin of error on one reef (Figure 1b). Twenty reefs had higher hard coral cover than previously surveyed, of which nine had estimates outside the margin of error (Figure 1b). The Southern GBR has been the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in recent years and remained so in 2024 with the focus in the Swain reefs. One of the 30 reefs was classified as having a Severe Outbreak, one reef had an Established Outbreak and one reef had a Possible Outbreak (Figure 1c; Image 3A). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on four reefs classified as No Outbreak and the remainder had No COTS, while COTS outbreaks have run their course on other reefs with low coral cover (Image 3B). In 2024, Southern GBR reefs surveyed by LTMP were exposed to the highest levels of accumulated heat stress (6.22\u201311.64 DHWs) ever recorded in this region. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted at 11 reefs during the height of thermal stress in March. Very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90% of colonies) was recorded at four of these reefs, while three had high (>30% \u2013 60%) bleaching and the remaining four reefs had medium (>10% \u2013 30% bleaching (Figure 1d; Image 3C,D)). Five reefs were surveyed in May after peak heat had occurred and all had bleaching between 1% and 30% of corals. The remaining reefs in this region were all surveyed in September and October 2023, well before the onset of heat stress, with little bleaching recorded (Image 3E,F). Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 30 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 14 of these were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. Image 3: Various disturbance events have impacted the Southern GBR in 2024, including coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. A. A severe outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish was still active at Tern Island in the Pompeys. B. Elsewhere in the Southern GBR, crown-of-thorns starfish infestations have run their course and reduced coral cover to very low levels, particularly in the Swains, such as Gannet Cay. Coral bleaching was recorded in the Southern GBR including C. Pompey Reef No. 1 and D. Reef 21-060. High coral cover is still found at many reefs in the Southern GBR, like E. Masthead Island and F. Fairfax Island in the Capricorn-Bunkers. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. Why Hard Coral Cover? What does \u2018percent hard coral cover\u2019 mean? There are many ways to measure the status of coral reefs. One of the most common is to use percent hard coral cover as an indicator of reef condition because it describes the abundance of a critical ecosystem engineer on coral reefs. This measure describes the proportion of the seafloor that is covered in live hard coral. Percent hard coral cover is widely used by scientists worldwide and is a standard measure that applies to all locations. While it does not tell us anything about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health. Percent hard coral cover can be estimated using various techniques. The technique used for this report is manta tow surveys, which are visual estimates of percent hard coral cover over the area covered by an observer during one 2-minute tow (~2000 m2). The percent hard coral cover for a reef is then estimated as the average of the estimates from all tows around a reef and reported as broad categories (e.g. 0%, >0% \u2013 10%, >10% \u2013 30%, >30% \u2013 50%, >50% \u2013 75% and >75% \u2013 100%; Image 4). A coral reef consists of more than just hard coral and contains a diverse array of other corals, sponges, algae, sand, rock and invertebrates. It is relatively rare for GBR reefs to have 75% \u2013 100% hard coral cover, and AIMS defines >30% \u2013 50% hard coral cover as a high value, based on historical surveys across the GBR. Other techniques for determining percent hard coral cover involve counting the number of points within sampling units (quadrats and photos), as used by the LTMP during fixed-site surveys, or the linear distance along a tape measure (line-intercept) that intersect live hard coral colonies. Adding up the total number of points of live hard coral cover and then expressing this as a percent of the total number of points within a sample yields the estimates of hard coral cover. Data from both the fixed-site and manta tow surveys conducted by the LTMP are highly correlated and show the same trends in hard coral cover estimates. However, manta tow estimates are commonly lower than those obtained from fixed site surveys as they encompass the entire reef, including sandy back reef habitats that generally have low coral cover. Image 4: Examples of categories of percent hard coral cover a) >0% \u2013 10%, b) >10% \u2013 30%, c) >30% \u2013 50% and d) >50% \u2013 75%. The yellow areas show non-hard coral reef surfaces, and the categorisation is based on the proportion of the substrate covered in live hard coral colonies. The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event In the austral summer of 2023\u20132024, much of the GBR was subjected to a level of accumulated heat stress that caused mass coral bleaching to occur (Figure 5). This was the fifth mass bleaching event on the GBR since 2016 and part of the fourth global mass bleaching event. In response to this event, AIMS and the Reef Authority undertook aerial surveys of 1080 reefs (Image 5) across the GBR and Torres Strait during the peak summer heat in March 2024. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, AIMS also conducted dedicated in-water bleaching surveys on 36 reefs during this time (22 February to 20 March 2024) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys were conducted from Lizard Island in the Northern GBR to Lady Musgrave Island in the Southern GBR at three depths \u2013 Shallow (2\u20135m), Mid (7\u20139m) and Deep (9\u201312m) \u2013 and consisted of assessments of the prevalence of coral bleaching (i.e. the number of colonies affected). The level of bleaching of an individual coral colony was recorded as 1. No bleaching 2. Partial bleaching (5%\u201350% of colony white) 3. Fully bleached (>50% of colony white) 4. Dead (colony recently dead and overgrown with light green algae). Data were then summarised as the percent of colonies in each category at each depth at each site. The 2024 bleaching event had the highest levels of exposure to heat stress to date, with some reefs in the Southern GBR experiencing up to 15 DHWs (Figure 5), far surpassing the level of heat accumulation they had been subjected to in previous events. 2024 also saw a record-breaking spatial footprint of coral bleaching, with 49% of reefs having high levels (>30% of corals bleached) and 32% of reefs having very high to extreme levels of coral bleaching (>60% of corals bleached; Image 6). In-water surveys conducted at the height of the event also confirmed that severe bleaching (whole colonies fully bleached white) was prevalent at 94% of reefs, and recent mortality due to intense thermal stress was present at 89% of reefs across all three regions of the GBR. The severity and prevalence of bleaching was variable among reefs, but some clear regional patterns emerged. The Northern GBR aerial survey reefs were exposed to maximum heat accumulation between 1.84 and 9.7 DHWs over the summer (Figure 5). There was variation in the levels of heat stress accumulation across the Northern GBR. Aerial surveys revealed reefs north of Lockhart River were least affected, while the inner- and mid-shelf reefs between Lizard Island and Cape Sidmouth suffered very high and extreme levels of bleaching after being subjected to accumulated heat stress between 4.9 and 9.7 DHWs. Figure 5: Accumulated heat stress (points on map) and the level of bleaching (bar charts) recorded during aerial surveys of GBR reefs surveyed in March 2024. DHW categories: Bleaching low risk = 0\u20132 DHWs, Bleaching warning = 2\u20134 DHWs, Bleaching possible = 4\u20136 DHWs, Bleaching probable = 6\u20138 DHWs and widespread bleaching with possible mortality= >8 DHWs. Source: NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Coral Reef Watch program. Coral bleaching prevalence categories: 0 = no bleaching, 1 = low bleaching (<10% of corals), 2 = medium bleaching (>10% \u2013 30%), 3 = high bleaching (>30% \u2013 60%), 4 = very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90%), 5 = extreme bleaching (>90%). Note that these are the same categories used by LTMP manta tow surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event Levels of bleaching recorded from aerial surveys showed bleaching intensity decreased further north and at offshore reefs in the region. Throughout the Northern GBR, 27.6% of reefs had no bleaching recorded, 33% had low bleaching and 39.4% had high to extreme bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys (additional to LTMP) within Princess Charlotte Bay and around Lizard Island revealed partial to fully bleached colonies with low levels of early onset mortality at the time of survey (late February and early March 2024). In-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP were conducted just prior to the maximum period of heat stress (mid-March) and are likely to underrepresent the true extent of bleaching at the peak of the event (Figure 6). Furthermore, LTMP surveys in the Northern GBR, including around Lizard Island, were all conducted prior to March 2024, and coral cover for this region had not yet changed in response to this bleaching event. Nevertheless, early-onset low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 LTMP reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) prior to the onset of elevated heat stress. The Central GBR experienced elevated thermal stress throughout the summer, with aerial survey reefs ranging from 2.4 to 11.4 DHWs (Figure 5). Heat stress accumulation was highest around Cairns (5.1\u20139.5 DHWs), inshore reefs in the Palm Island Group around Townsville (5.2\u20139.5 DHWs) and the inner (5.8\u2013 8.95 DHWs) and outer shelf (5.2\u201311.4 DHWs) reefs of the Whitsundays (Figure 5). Levels of bleaching observed from the aerial surveys closely matched the accumulated heat stress levels. Across the Central GBR, 8.1% of aerial survey reefs were categorised as having no or low bleaching (1% \u2013 10% of corals), 15.8% as having medium bleaching (11% \u2013 30% of corals) and 76.1% having high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals; Figure 5). Around Cairns, 5% of aerial survey reefs had low bleaching, 40% had medium bleaching and 55% had high, very high or extreme bleaching. Townsville inshore aerial surveys recorded 22% of reefs with low bleaching, 18% with medium bleaching and 60% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. Aerial surveys recorded 19% of Whitsunday reefs with low bleaching, 22% with medium bleaching and 59% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, dedicated in-water bleaching surveys in the Central GBR recorded variable levels of bleaching prevalence and low levels of early onset coral mortality (Figure 6). In the Central GBR, 23 of 39 LTMP survey reefs were surveyed too early to detect the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event, but 16 reefs were surveyed between March and May 2024. These reefs all had low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching during the 2024 LTMP surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event The Southern GBR experienced the most intense exposure of the three regions, with the highest levels of accumulated heat stress on record for the GBR, high prevalence of fully bleached corals and the highest levels of early onset mortality recorded during in-water bleaching surveys (Figures 5, 6). While there was variation in the amount of heat stress recorded among aerial survey reefs (Figure 5), the highest levels of heat stress were recorded in southern inshore reefs around the Keppel Island group (11.4\u201313.3 DHWs), and further south near Gladstone (15.3\u201315.6 DHWs \u2013 cf LTMP survey reefs). Offshore reefs of the Capricorn-Bunker (10.9\u201311.7 DHWs) and Swain sectors (7.3\u20139.9 DHWs) all had heat stress accumulation to the level where widespread bleaching and coral mortality are expected (Figure 5). Aerial surveys also revealed that all reefs around the Keppel Island group and the Capricorn-Bunkers had high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals), and while the Swain reefs were more variable, 91% of reefs had high, very high or extreme bleaching levels in shallow reef habitats. In the Southern GBR, in-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP surveys revealed a much higher proportion of fully bleached corals than either the Northern or Central GBR, and higher levels of early onset mortality at the time of in-water bleaching surveys across all three depths (Figure 6). Of the 11 reefs surveyed by the LTMP during the height of the heat stress in March 2024, 7 had high to very high bleaching (>30% \u2013 90%) and a further 4 had medium bleaching of >10% \u2013 30%. All other Southern GBR LTMP reefs were surveyed either before the onset of heat stress or in May 2024, after the heatwave had abated; these surveys recorded bleaching of between 1% and 30%. The results from both the aerial and in-water surveys have documented the greatest spatial extent of accumulated heat stress and high to extreme bleaching to impact the GBR in recorded history. High to extreme bleaching was observed across all regions of the GBR, with the highest impacts in the inshore and mid-shelf reefs in the Southern, Central and Northern GBR. Prevalence of fully bleached corals in the Southern GBR was close to 100% in some shallow-water habitats, and early-onset mortality ranged from 1% to 75%. Reefs with a higher prevalence of partially bleached and fully bleached corals are more likely to suffer adverse health impacts from this bleaching event. Bleaching-related impacts can be direct effects (partial or whole colony mortality) that reduce coral cover or indirect, chronic effects such as reduced growth and reproduction and increased susceptibility to coral disease. These results only partly tell the story. The full effects of the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event will continue to unfold over the coming months, as fully bleached corals can remain that way for several months, as late as September or October, depending on the species. Further in-water surveys at permanent locations are required to capture changes in hard coral cover following the bleaching, and these surveys will begin in September 2024 when the LTMP scientists return to the reef.

Assessing the Long-term Health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust, long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the \u2018shifting baseline\u2019 syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The past few years have revealed increases in hard coral cover across much of the GBR. In 2022, we reported the highest-recorded coral cover in the Northern and Central GBR since the LTMP began monitoring in the 1980s, after rising from the lowest-recorded cover in the preceding decade. There was little change in hard coral cover in 2023, but this year coral cover has again increased. However, 60 out of 94 reefs were surveyed before the two cyclones and the mass coral bleaching event and impacts of these events will become apparent once surveys are completed next year. The 2024 mass coral bleaching event was the most extensive in terms of accumulated heat stress and the large spatial footprint of high to extreme bleaching. Some parts of the GBR saw unprecedented levels of heat accumulation. The increased frequency and extent of bleaching events since 2016 remains highly concerning. Crown-of-thorns starfish are coral predators, and their outbreaks represent a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\u2019s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak. The program deploys targeted surveillance and culling operations to systematically suppress starfish numbers and protect coral across hundreds of priority reefs. Recent evidence from the COTS Control Program and the LTMP demonstrates that targeted control has effectively suppressed outbreaks and protected coral from COTS predation across entire reefs and sectors. The findings also suggest that the southward progression of the outbreak \u2018wave\u2019 through the GBR may have been delayed and reduced via the suppression of adult COTS. In 2024, the number of Severe Outbreaks has continued to decrease from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. LTMP surveys revealed low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish in the far northern GBR and around Lizard Island, which suggests that starfish numbers are increasing in these areas. Much of the recent hard coral cover increase was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase that rapidly increases percent hard coral cover, as documented in the 2022 and 2024 results. However, fast-growing corals are particularly susceptible to waves generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to heat stress and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. Therefore, large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be overturned by disturbances on reefs where Acropora corals predominate. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves. The consequences of climate change are evidenced by multiple mass coral bleaching events since 2016 in the three GBR regions. Such bleaching events were rare prior to the late 1990s but have become a biennial occurrence in the last decade. Simultaneously, the continuing risk of tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry, can all negatively affect recovery rates. Additionally, more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Enabling coral reefs to survive these stressful conditions requires a combination of a reduction in global greenhouse emissions to stabilise temperatures, best practice management of local pressures, and the development of interventions to help reefs adapt to and recover from the effects of climate change. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS\u2019 research and monitoring.

      "10 Impactful Ways to Conserve Coral Reefs\n\n\t\t\tBy: \t\t\tAuthor Our Endangered World \nPosted on Last updated: October 13, 2023\nWhat can we do to conserve coral reefs? Coral reefs are critically important ecosystems, providing a wide range of benefits to both humans and marine life. They support extraordinary biodiversity and marine species, including fish, sea mammals, and invertebrates.\nWhile they only cover less than one percent of the ocean, coral reefs support an estimated 25% of sea life. They provide nursery, spawning, refuge, and feeding areas for various sea organisms. These include mollusks, crustaceans, and sea urchins.\nAlso, they play an essential role in water quality and coastal stability. For example, they help to filter sediments and nutrients from the water. Additionally, they act as natural breakwaters. As such, they minimize wave impacts from storms such as hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons.\nThat\u2019s not all; coral reefs form stunning ecosystems that appeal to the eyes. This makes them a powerful tourism attraction feature. In general, coral reefs provide habitat, food, income, protection, and medicine.\nHowever, various factors like water pollution threaten these beautiful sea species. And this calls for their protection. How, then, can we help protect the world\u2019s coral reefs and ensure that they continue to play an important role in the ocean ecosystem?\nTable of Contents\nHow to Conserve Coral Reefs\nIf you want to learn how to conserve coral reefs, here are superb options you can consider.\n1. Learn About the Threats Coral Reefs are Facing\nOne of the most important things you can do is to educate yourself about the threats surrounding coral reefs. You can make informed decisions that help save coral reefs when you are aware of these threats.\nSome of the main threats to coral reef survival include the following:\nPollution can come from various sources, such as agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage effluent. On the other hand, coastal development causes water runoff and sedimentation, which damage coral reefs. Also, it can disrupt coral reef habitats and lead to the introduction of non-native species.\nOverfishing can impact the populations of fish species that eat coral reef algae. This leads to the depletion of coral reef ecosystems.\nClimate change causes increased ocean temperature and oceanic acidity levels. Warmer waters increase the likelihood of coral bleaching events. And more acidic ocean waters harm coral reefs and impede their growth.\nIf we learn how to keep coral reefs healthy and reduce these threats, we can take proactive steps to protect them. In return, this helps guarantee their continued survival.\nSee Related: What is Overfishing? Examples & Solutions to Prevent\n2. Become a Reef-Safe Traveler\nIf you become a reef-safe traveler, you help protect coral reefs. Also, you help protect the beaches and ocean habitats from harm and contribute to the conservation efforts in the coastal areas.\nBut how can you become a reef-safe traveler? There are many ways to do so. First, choose accommodations with minimal environmental impacts. Choose the ones with low-flow faucets and toilets to conserve water when taking a shower or washing dishes.\nYou can also reduce your environmental impact using energy-saving or Energy Star-Certified appliances. Also, switching off lights and electronic devices while not in use or when leaving the room can help.\nWhen walking along the beach, practice responsible tourism. For example, ensure that you don\u2019t touch or step on any coral you see on the beach.\nYou can also be reef safe by using reusable water bottles and bags. Alternatively, buy locally-made eco-friendly products. Always avoid single-use plastics wherever possible.\nKeep off from souvenirs or aquariums made of living coral. And if you must purchase a souvenir, choose one made of wood or another non-coral material.\nLastly, if you have a pet, take steps to prevent it from harming the coral and surrounding environment. When you do so, you will help to conserve these valuable ecosystems for future generations to enjoy.\nSee Related: Best Solutions to Climate Change\n3. Practice Safe Snorkeling and Diving\nOne of the best ways to preserve and protect coral reefs is to practice safe snorkeling and diving. And since snorkeling is a fun activity for many people, doing it responsibly can go a long way.\nThe first step here in protecting these ecosystems is to avoid touching the reefs or anchoring your boat to them. Anchoring can damage or even kill corals. As for touching, it may damage delicate coral animals and reef fishes.\nAnother way to help protect coral reefs is to choose a dive site that is not too close to them. Also, if you see damaged coral, avoid it. Instead, report it to authorities so they can take proper measures to ensure the reef\u2019s health.\nAdditionally, ensure that the visitors on your dive trip do their part to protect the environment. We should all strive to keep coral reefs alive for future generations.\nLastly, avoid destructive actions that can damage the reef ecosystem or deprive it of vital resources for survival. For instance, avoid standing on them or crushing them.\n4. Choose a Reef-Friendly Sunscreen\nAnother common concern for reef-conscious people is the impact of the chemicals sunscreen contains. While many modern sunscreens are safe for coral, some contain dangerous chemicals that can have long-term effects on marine ecosystems.\nWhen buying sunscreen, look for mineral-based sunscreens that use a micro-sized particle or non-nano zinc oxide as their active ingredients. These are safe and effective and do not contribute to coral bleaching.\nAvoid sunscreens with oxybenzone, Parabens, Triclosan, Octocrylene, Homosalate, and Octinoxate. These ingredients are toxic to coral reefs and other marine life if washed off into the ocean.\nAlways check the sunscreens\u2019 labels to find the active ingredients and choose the ones that will be safe for corals. Finally, ensure the products are in reusable containers or bio-degradable plant-based materials.\nSee Related: Best Books on Pollution | Noise, Air and Water\n5. Dispose of Trash Properly and Recycle\nMarine debris can harm coral reefs. Therefore, reduce throwing trash around as much as possible. Use materials that support the three Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). When you reuse and recycle the trash at home and on the go, especially those made of plastic, you help conserve the environment.\nDispose of trash properly in the proper cans to avoid the probability of it getting washed away into waterways and oceans.\nWhen on the beach, leave no traces behind. That means don\u2019t throw plastic cans and cigarette butts in the sand. Also, don\u2019t leave unwanted fishing lines on the beach or in the water.\nFinally, you can organize beach or reef cleanups or volunteer at environmental organizations that do such cleanups. Pick up trash from the community and dispose of it properly. Volunteer for annual trash cleanup activities to help protect the oceans from marine debris.\n6. Reduce Stormwater Runoff\nStormwater runoff is the fastest-growing source of pollution. This water flows after the rain hits parking lots, rooftops, and roads. Thus, this untreated water contains a wide range of contaminants.\nReducing stormwater runoff helps reduce flooding, prevent water pollution, and protect our water bodies. To achieve this, homeowners can use rain barrels and gardens to collect rainwater or install water catchments. Conserving water and planting trees can also help reduce runoff into the oceans.\nAvoiding the dumping of wastewater into the ocean can help too. Ensure that it passes through treatment before it reaches the water\u2019s natural bodies, such as tributaries, lakes, rivers, and oceans.\nSee Related: Breaking Down the Best Off-Grid Water Systems\n7. Minimize the Use of Fertilizers\u00a0\u00a0\nMinimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns can help protect water quality.\nWhen you use fertilizer in gardens, the nutrients, including phosphorous and nitrogen, eventually get washed away into the waterways. Finally, they end up in the ocean, damaging sea life.\nThese fertilizers, chemicals, and pesticides pollute the water and harm coral reefs. Therefore, reducing fertilizer overuse will help save coral reefs.\nAlternatively, consider only organic or ecological fertilizers. These are less likely to contaminate lands and water.\n8. Use Environmentally-Friendly Modes of Transportation\nOpting for a cleaner means of transport reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles that use gas and fossil fuels release carbon emissions into the environment. These emissions contribute to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, which impede coral growth.\nTherefore, reduce the use of vehicles. Instead, walk, take a bike, or use public transport (like trains and buses) to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nIf you plan to purchase a vehicle, go for a fuel-efficient hybrid or electric car. This helps reduce carbon footprint. Remember, human-generated greenhouse gases are the main contributor to global warming.\n9. Marine Parks and Reserves\nThe creation of marine parks and reserves can play a role in coral reef conservation efforts. First, they can help preserve the threatened marine species or species that can no longer survive in the ocean safely.\nSecondly, the marine protected areas help limit human activity, including commercial fishing, mining, and recreational activities, which may threaten coral reefs.\nPaying a visit to marine parks can help raise awareness about the ocean ecosystem. A perfect example of marine parks in the US is the East End Marine Park, Virgin Islands. It helps protect the largest barrier reef system in the Caribbean Sea. The park comprises 60 square miles of coral reefs and shallow seas, among other ocean inhabitants.\nSee Related: Is Polyvinyl Alcohol Bad for the Environment?\n10. Spread the Word About Coral Conservation\nEducating the community around you about conserving the coral reefs is crucial. First, share this information with your friends and family.\nAdditionally, organize seminars to raise awareness about protecting water quality and conserving coral reefs. Visit local schools around you and teach about coral reef conservation.\nJoin local businesses and organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs. The Planetary Coral Reef Foundation, Coral Reef Alliance, and Reef Relief are examples of organizations working hard to stop coral reef destruction.\nFinally, find out what your local representatives are doing about the conservation efforts and support them where possible. If there has been no activity on the same, write to them and demand action.\nFAQs\nWhat are the main threats to coral reefs?\nThere are numerous threats to coral reefs. But perhaps the major ones include global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, destructive fishing practices, and disease outbreaks. Runoff water from land-based activities, sedimentation from coastal development, and bleaching also form a big part of water pollution which is also a threat to the coral reefs.\nHow can I help protect the coral reefs?\nThe first step towards protecting the coral reefs is reducing your carbon footprint. For example, switching to renewable energy sources.Minimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns and avoiding wastewater dumping into oceans and waterways will also go a long way. Lastly, you can support organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs and educating others about conservation efforts.\nWhat is ocean acidification?\nOcean acidification is a process caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It leads to increased acidity in seawater, which can be damaging to corals and other organisms living in these waters.As more carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it decreases pH levels. This, in return, leads to decreased calcification rates and makes it difficult for reef-building organisms to form their calcium carbonate skeletons.\nRelated Resources\nRead These Other Guide\nCategories Environmental Conservation\nPost navigation\nHow Does Saving Water Help Climate Change?\n9 Best Solar-Powered Computers to Buy Today\nRecent Posts\nEco-Friendly Products\nSpecies\nEco-Friendly Products\nEnergy Efficient Products\nSolar Products\nConservation\nAbout\nCopyright OurEndangedWorld | All Rights Reserved\n"

      "10 Impactful Ways to Conserve Coral Reefs\n\n\t\t\tBy: \t\t\tAuthor Our Endangered World \nPosted on Last updated: October 13, 2023\nWhat can we do to conserve coral reefs? Coral reefs are critically important ecosystems, providing a wide range of benefits to both humans and marine life. They support extraordinary biodiversity and marine species, including fish, sea mammals, and invertebrates.\nWhile they only cover less than one percent of the ocean, coral reefs support an estimated 25% of sea life. They provide nursery, spawning, refuge, and feeding areas for various sea organisms. These include mollusks, crustaceans, and sea urchins.\nAlso, they play an essential role in water quality and coastal stability. For example, they help to filter sediments and nutrients from the water. Additionally, they act as natural breakwaters. As such, they minimize wave impacts from storms such as hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons.\nThat\u2019s not all; coral reefs form stunning ecosystems that appeal to the eyes. This makes them a powerful tourism attraction feature. In general, coral reefs provide habitat, food, income, protection, and medicine.\nHowever, various factors like water pollution threaten these beautiful sea species. And this calls for their protection. How, then, can we help protect the world\u2019s coral reefs and ensure that they continue to play an important role in the ocean ecosystem?\nTable of Contents\nHow to Conserve Coral Reefs\nIf you want to learn how to conserve coral reefs, here are superb options you can consider.\n1. Learn About the Threats Coral Reefs are Facing\nOne of the most important things you can do is to educate yourself about the threats surrounding coral reefs. You can make informed decisions that help save coral reefs when you are aware of these threats.\nSome of the main threats to coral reef survival include the following:\nPollution can come from various sources, such as agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage effluent. On the other hand, coastal development causes water runoff and sedimentation, which damage coral reefs. Also, it can disrupt coral reef habitats and lead to the introduction of non-native species.\nOverfishing can impact the populations of fish species that eat coral reef algae. This leads to the depletion of coral reef ecosystems.\nClimate change causes increased ocean temperature and oceanic acidity levels. Warmer waters increase the likelihood of coral bleaching events. And more acidic ocean waters harm coral reefs and impede their growth.\nIf we learn how to keep coral reefs healthy and reduce these threats, we can take proactive steps to protect them. In return, this helps guarantee their continued survival.\nSee Related: What is Overfishing? Examples & Solutions to Prevent\n2. Become a Reef-Safe Traveler\nIf you become a reef-safe traveler, you help protect coral reefs. Also, you help protect the beaches and ocean habitats from harm and contribute to the conservation efforts in the coastal areas.\nBut how can you become a reef-safe traveler? There are many ways to do so. First, choose accommodations with minimal environmental impacts. Choose the ones with low-flow faucets and toilets to conserve water when taking a shower or washing dishes.\nYou can also reduce your environmental impact using energy-saving or Energy Star-Certified appliances. Also, switching off lights and electronic devices while not in use or when leaving the room can help.\nWhen walking along the beach, practice responsible tourism. For example, ensure that you don\u2019t touch or step on any coral you see on the beach.\nYou can also be reef safe by using reusable water bottles and bags. Alternatively, buy locally-made eco-friendly products. Always avoid single-use plastics wherever possible.\nKeep off from souvenirs or aquariums made of living coral. And if you must purchase a souvenir, choose one made of wood or another non-coral material.\nLastly, if you have a pet, take steps to prevent it from harming the coral and surrounding environment. When you do so, you will help to conserve these valuable ecosystems for future generations to enjoy.\nSee Related: Best Solutions to Climate Change\n3. Practice Safe Snorkeling and Diving\nOne of the best ways to preserve and protect coral reefs is to practice safe snorkeling and diving. And since snorkeling is a fun activity for many people, doing it responsibly can go a long way.\nThe first step here in protecting these ecosystems is to avoid touching the reefs or anchoring your boat to them. Anchoring can damage or even kill corals. As for touching, it may damage delicate coral animals and reef fishes.\nAnother way to help protect coral reefs is to choose a dive site that is not too close to them. Also, if you see damaged coral, avoid it. Instead, report it to authorities so they can take proper measures to ensure the reef\u2019s health.\nAdditionally, ensure that the visitors on your dive trip do their part to protect the environment. We should all strive to keep coral reefs alive for future generations.\nLastly, avoid destructive actions that can damage the reef ecosystem or deprive it of vital resources for survival. For instance, avoid standing on them or crushing them.\n4. Choose a Reef-Friendly Sunscreen\nAnother common concern for reef-conscious people is the impact of the chemicals sunscreen contains. While many modern sunscreens are safe for coral, some contain dangerous chemicals that can have long-term effects on marine ecosystems.\nWhen buying sunscreen, look for mineral-based sunscreens that use a micro-sized particle or non-nano zinc oxide as their active ingredients. These are safe and effective and do not contribute to coral bleaching.\nAvoid sunscreens with oxybenzone, Parabens, Triclosan, Octocrylene, Homosalate, and Octinoxate. These ingredients are toxic to coral reefs and other marine life if washed off into the ocean.\nAlways check the sunscreens\u2019 labels to find the active ingredients and choose the ones that will be safe for corals. Finally, ensure the products are in reusable containers or bio-degradable plant-based materials.\nSee Related: Best Books on Pollution | Noise, Air and Water\n5. Dispose of Trash Properly and Recycle\nMarine debris can harm coral reefs. Therefore, reduce throwing trash around as much as possible. Use materials that support the three Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). When you reuse and recycle the trash at home and on the go, especially those made of plastic, you help conserve the environment.\nDispose of trash properly in the proper cans to avoid the probability of it getting washed away into waterways and oceans.\nWhen on the beach, leave no traces behind. That means don\u2019t throw plastic cans and cigarette butts in the sand. Also, don\u2019t leave unwanted fishing lines on the beach or in the water.\nFinally, you can organize beach or reef cleanups or volunteer at environmental organizations that do such cleanups. Pick up trash from the community and dispose of it properly. Volunteer for annual trash cleanup activities to help protect the oceans from marine debris.\n6. Reduce Stormwater Runoff\nStormwater runoff is the fastest-growing source of pollution. This water flows after the rain hits parking lots, rooftops, and roads. Thus, this untreated water contains a wide range of contaminants.\nReducing stormwater runoff helps reduce flooding, prevent water pollution, and protect our water bodies. To achieve this, homeowners can use rain barrels and gardens to collect rainwater or install water catchments. Conserving water and planting trees can also help reduce runoff into the oceans.\nAvoiding the dumping of wastewater into the ocean can help too. Ensure that it passes through treatment before it reaches the water\u2019s natural bodies, such as tributaries, lakes, rivers, and oceans.\nSee Related: Breaking Down the Best Off-Grid Water Systems\n7. Minimize the Use of Fertilizers\u00a0\u00a0\nMinimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns can help protect water quality.\nWhen you use fertilizer in gardens, the nutrients, including phosphorous and nitrogen, eventually get washed away into the waterways. Finally, they end up in the ocean, damaging sea life.\nThese fertilizers, chemicals, and pesticides pollute the water and harm coral reefs. Therefore, reducing fertilizer overuse will help save coral reefs.\nAlternatively, consider only organic or ecological fertilizers. These are less likely to contaminate lands and water.\n8. Use Environmentally-Friendly Modes of Transportation\nOpting for a cleaner means of transport reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles that use gas and fossil fuels release carbon emissions into the environment. These emissions contribute to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, which impede coral growth.\nTherefore, reduce the use of vehicles. Instead, walk, take a bike, or use public transport (like trains and buses) to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nIf you plan to purchase a vehicle, go for a fuel-efficient hybrid or electric car. This helps reduce carbon footprint. Remember, human-generated greenhouse gases are the main contributor to global warming.\n9. Marine Parks and Reserves\nThe creation of marine parks and reserves can play a role in coral reef conservation efforts. First, they can help preserve the threatened marine species or species that can no longer survive in the ocean safely.\nSecondly, the marine protected areas help limit human activity, including commercial fishing, mining, and recreational activities, which may threaten coral reefs.\nPaying a visit to marine parks can help raise awareness about the ocean ecosystem. A perfect example of marine parks in the US is the East End Marine Park, Virgin Islands. It helps protect the largest barrier reef system in the Caribbean Sea. The park comprises 60 square miles of coral reefs and shallow seas, among other ocean inhabitants.\nSee Related: Is Polyvinyl Alcohol Bad for the Environment?\n10. Spread the Word About Coral Conservation\nEducating the community around you about conserving the coral reefs is crucial. First, share this information with your friends and family.\nAdditionally, organize seminars to raise awareness about protecting water quality and conserving coral reefs. Visit local schools around you and teach about coral reef conservation.\nJoin local businesses and organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs. The Planetary Coral Reef Foundation, Coral Reef Alliance, and Reef Relief are examples of organizations working hard to stop coral reef destruction.\nFinally, find out what your local representatives are doing about the conservation efforts and support them where possible. If there has been no activity on the same, write to them and demand action.\nFAQs\nWhat are the main threats to coral reefs?\nThere are numerous threats to coral reefs. But perhaps the major ones include global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, destructive fishing practices, and disease outbreaks. Runoff water from land-based activities, sedimentation from coastal development, and bleaching also form a big part of water pollution which is also a threat to the coral reefs.\nHow can I help protect the coral reefs?\nThe first step towards protecting the coral reefs is reducing your carbon footprint. For example, switching to renewable energy sources.Minimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns and avoiding wastewater dumping into oceans and waterways will also go a long way. Lastly, you can support organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs and educating others about conservation efforts.\nWhat is ocean acidification?\nOcean acidification is a process caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It leads to increased acidity in seawater, which can be damaging to corals and other organisms living in these waters.As more carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it decreases pH levels. This, in return, leads to decreased calcification rates and makes it difficult for reef-building organisms to form their calcium carbonate skeletons.\nRelated Resources\nRead These Other Guide\nCategories Environmental Conservation\nPost navigation\nHow Does Saving Water Help Climate Change?\n9 Best Solar-Powered Computers to Buy Today\nRecent Posts\nEco-Friendly Products\nSpecies\nEco-Friendly Products\nEnergy Efficient Products\nSolar Products\nConservation\nAbout\nCopyright OurEndangedWorld | All Rights Reserved\n"

This is a sharp increase from the previous assessment, published in 2008, which found a third of corals were in danger of being lost.\nClimate change is the leading cause of the declines, with high temperatures causing corals to eject the photosynthetic algae that live in their tissues. These events, known as bleaching, are becoming more extreme and more frequent, and causing mass die-offs in reefs across the world.\nThe IUCN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Director General, Dr Grethel Aguilar, has called for strong action to limit greenhouse gas emissions as the best option to protect these vital species.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis global coral assessment vividly illustrates the severe impacts of our rapidly changing climate on life on Earth and drives home the severity of the consequences,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealthy ecosystems like coral reefs are essential for human livelihoods \u00e2\u0080\u0093 providing food, stabilising coastlines, and storing carbon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe protection of our biodiversity is not only vital for our wellbeing but crucial for our survival. Climate change remains the leading threat to reef-building corals and is devastating the natural systems we depend on. We must take bold, decisive action to cut greenhouse gas emissions if we are to secure a sustainable future for humanity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nCorals get their colour from the photosynthetic algae that live inside them, as part of a relationship which has lasted for over 380 million years. \u00c2\u00a9 Alexandre.ROSA/ Shutterstock\nHow endangered are corals, and why are they important?\nThe results of the latest Red List are the latest reminder of the dangers that reef-building corals face, with the animals having become more threatened with every reassessment of their health.\nWhile Red List assessments have changed over the past 30 years, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimated that just 13 coral species were considered Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered in the 1990s. By the time of the next assessment in 2008, this figure had risen to 231.\nIt has now risen again, by more than 100, meaning almost half of all corals are at significant risk of extinction. This makes corals proportionately more endangered than all the major animal groups on land, including amphibians, mammals and reptiles.\nIf these coral species do become extinct, their loss would cause major changes for life in the oceans. Coral reefs support around a quarter of all marine life, and so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely that coral extinctions could cause losses among fish, crustaceans and many other groups.\nThe loss of coral reefs would also remove an important nursery habitat for fish, as the hard skeletons provide a safe area for small fish to grow up in, away from large predators. Fewer nursery habitats would likely mean fewer fish, impacting both predator populations and fisheries.\nThe economic impact of coral extinctions goes much further than fishing, with reefs estimated to prevent billions of pounds worth of damage from flooding and erosion every year by breaking up waves. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also likely tourism would suffer, cutting off a vital source of income for many communities.\nThe most at-risk reefs are in the Atlantic, where half of all species are at risk of extinction and a quarter are Critically Endangered. In a separate paper, published in PLOS One, researchers have examined the threats facing these corals in particular.\nThe staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis is found in the Atlantic, and is considered Critically Endangered under the most recent Red List. \u00c2\u00a9\u00c2\u00a0Alberto Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez-Ram\u00c3\u00adrez\nWhy are Atlantic corals so threatened?\nWhile the vast majority of reefs are found in the Indian and Pacific Ocean, around 10% are found in the Atlantic. These corals are very distinct from their relatives, having been separated from other corals by the joining of North and South America over three million years ago.\nIn total, 85 shallow-water coral species live in the Atlantic, with the most important hotspots found in the Caribbean and off the coast of Brazil.\u00c2\u00a0As study co-author Dr Nadia Santodomingo explains, the limited ability of these species to respond to the threats facing them means these reefs are more vulnerable to collapse.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAtlantic corals have been hit the hardest by reef decline,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Nadia, a Curator of Fossil Cnidaria at the Natural History Museum. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re facing a perfect storm of threats, of which climate change is just one part.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese corals are being significantly impacted by overfishing, pollution and coral diseases which are more prevalent in the Atlantic than in other regions. As a result, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprised to see the results of the IUCN assessment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDisease has perhaps had the most dramatic impact on Atlantic corals, devastating not only the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corals but also the animals they depend on. An unknown illness is suspected to have killed as much as 98% of the Caribbean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-spined sea urchins in the 1980s, meaning these grazers couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent algae from dominating many reefs.\nNew diseases are continuing to emerge, with stony coral tissue loss disease first detected in 2014. The illness has spread rapidly throughout the Caribbean, killing as many as 94% of all infected corals.\nRising temperatures are also an increasing threat, with bleaching just the tip of the iceberg. Higher levels of carbon dioxide are making the ocean more acidic, making it harder for corals to grow their calcium carbonate skeletons. Climate change has also been linked with rising numbers of hurricanes in the region, which are washing away centuries-old reefs in a matter of hours.\nWhile the PLOS One study raises plenty of cause for concern, it also notes some reasons to be hopeful. After the devastating declines of the 1970s and 1980s, the researchers found that the fall in Atlantic coral cover appears to be getting smaller.\nTo support these green shoots of recovery, further research needs to be taken to understand how corals can adapt to the challenges that face them. As Dr Beth Polidoro, a co-lead author of the paper, explains, this must go hand in hand with urgent action to combat climate change and the other threats facing coral.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions alongside action to address local threats if we want to give coral reefs a chance to survive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Beth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy acting now, we can slow the pace of ocean warming and broaden the window of opportunity for corals to potentially adapt and survive in the long term.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRead more\nDiscover oceans\nFind out more about why we need to protect oceans and read about the pioneering work of our marine scientists.\nRelated posts\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCoral reefs cover more of Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface than realised, new estimates reveal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSatellite images have revealed a missing 64,000 square kilometres of coral cover, an area similar to the size of Ireland.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOver half of coral reef cover across the world has been lost since 1950\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCoral reefs have declined by over half since the 1950s as they suffer from the effects of climate change and overfishing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe resilient coral reefs surviving ocean warming\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOcean warming is threatening coral reefs but some reefs are surviving the warming waters and offer hope for these vital ecosystems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHighlighting coral reefs at risk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhat can antique corals reveal about the impact of climate change on the ocean?\nDon't miss a thing\nReceive email updates about our news, science, exhibitions, events, products, services and fundraising activities.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nAssessing the U.S. Climate in March 2024\n\n\n    Severe storms brought large hail and tornadoes to portions of the Midwest; blizzard buried parts of California under feet of snow\n    \nKey Points:\nOther Highlights:\u00a0\nTemperature\n\n\nThe average temperature of the contiguous U.S. in March was 45.1\u00b0F, 3.6\u00b0F above average, ranking 17th warmest in the 130-year record. March temperatures were above average across much of the contiguous U.S., while below-average temperatures were observed in small pockets of the West and Southwest.\nThe Alaska statewide March temperature was 14.1\u00b0F, 3.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the 100-year period of record for the state. Above-average temperatures were observed across much of the state with near-normal temperatures in parts of the North Slope, Interior, Southwest and parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\n\n\nFor January\u2013March, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 39.4\u00b0F, 4.2\u00b0F above average, ranking fifth warmest on record for this period. Temperatures were above average across most of the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast. Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine each ranked second warmest for the January\u2013March period.\nThe Alaska January\u2013March temperature was 9.4\u00b0F, 3.5\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Much of the state was above normal for the three-month period while temperatures were near average across the eastern portions of the state and in parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\nPrecipitation\n\n\nMarch precipitation for the contiguous U.S. was 2.85 inches, 0.34 inch above average, ranking in the wettest third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average across much of the West, in the Great Lakes and along the Gulf and East coasts and in parts of the northern Plains. Conversely, precipitation was below normal across much of the Ohio Valley, the Plains, and in parts of the Northwest and Florida. Maine and Rhode Island each had their second-wettest March on record.\nAlaska\u2019s average monthly precipitation ranked in the middle third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior, south-central Alaska and in parts of the Panhandle during the month.\n\n\nThe January\u2013March precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 8.15 inches, 1.19 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across much of the contiguous U.S., with Rhode Island having its second-wettest year-to-date period on record. Conversely, precipitation was below average across much of the northern Plains and in small parts of the Northwest, central and southern Plains, Ohio Valley and Southeast during the January\u2013March period.\nThe January\u2013March precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record, with above-average precipitation observed in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior and south-central Alaska, as well as southern portions of the Panhandle during this period.\nBillion-Dollar Disasters\nOne new billion-dollar weather and climate disaster was confirmed in March 2024 after a severe weather event impacted the central and southern U.S. during mid-March, with the most severe weather occurring on March 13\u201315.\u00a0The U.S. has sustained 378 separate weather and climate disasters since 1980 where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (including CPI adjustment to 2024). The total cost of these 378 events exceeds $2.675 trillion.\nOther Notable Events\nFive wildfires, including the Smokehouse Creek wildfire, were finally contained in the Texas Panhandle, the largest cattle-producing region in the world. The wildfires resulted in approximately 1.1 million acres scorched, hundreds of destroyed structures, hundreds of miles of ruined fencing and more than 7,000 dead cattle.Winter did not bring heavy snowfall to Wisconsin nor the temperatures necessary to maintain the snow, allowing fires to begin early and in high numbers. Between January\u2013March 2024, there have been more than 220 fires across Wisconsin.A 5.25-inch diameter hail stone fell in Ada, Oklahoma on March 14, which is the largest stone reported in Pontotoc County since 1950, as well as the largest to fall in the state in nearly 13 years.\nA state of emergency was declared for Ohio as several tornadoes struck the state, resulting in 3 fatalities on March 14 when an EF-3 tornado crossed Auglaize and Logan Counties.\nDrought\nAccording to the April 2 U.S. Drought Monitor report, about 18% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought, down about 3.6% from the end of February. Drought conditions expanded or intensified in portions of the Plains and in parts of the Northwest, central Mississippi Valley, northern Great Lakes and Hawaii this month. Drought contracted or was reduced in intensity across much of the Mississippi Valley, Puerto Rico and the West, and in parts of the Plains, Great Lakes and Carolinas.\nMonthly Outlook\nAbove-average temperatures are favored to impact much of the central U.S., Northwest and Northeast in April while above-average precipitation is likely from much of the Plains to parts of the East Coast and in much of the Southwest. Drought is likely to persist along portions of the Northern Tier, the Southwest, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Visit the Climate Prediction Center\u2019s Official 30-Day Forecasts and U.S. Monthly Drought Outlook website for more details.\nSignificant wildland fire potential for April is above normal across much of the Upper Midwest and in parts of the central and southern Plains. For additional information on wildland fire potential, visit the National Interagency Fire Center\u2019s One-Month Wildland Fire Outlook.\nThis monthly summary from NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nAssessing the U.S. Climate in March 2024\n\n\n    Severe storms brought large hail and tornadoes to portions of the Midwest; blizzard buried parts of California under feet of snow\n    \nKey Points:\nOther Highlights:\u00a0\nTemperature\n\n\nThe average temperature of the contiguous U.S. in March was 45.1\u00b0F, 3.6\u00b0F above average, ranking 17th warmest in the 130-year record. March temperatures were above average across much of the contiguous U.S., while below-average temperatures were observed in small pockets of the West and Southwest.\nThe Alaska statewide March temperature was 14.1\u00b0F, 3.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the 100-year period of record for the state. Above-average temperatures were observed across much of the state with near-normal temperatures in parts of the North Slope, Interior, Southwest and parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\n\n\nFor January\u2013March, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 39.4\u00b0F, 4.2\u00b0F above average, ranking fifth warmest on record for this period. Temperatures were above average across most of the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast. Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine each ranked second warmest for the January\u2013March period.\nThe Alaska January\u2013March temperature was 9.4\u00b0F, 3.5\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Much of the state was above normal for the three-month period while temperatures were near average across the eastern portions of the state and in parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\nPrecipitation\n\n\nMarch precipitation for the contiguous U.S. was 2.85 inches, 0.34 inch above average, ranking in the wettest third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average across much of the West, in the Great Lakes and along the Gulf and East coasts and in parts of the northern Plains. Conversely, precipitation was below normal across much of the Ohio Valley, the Plains, and in parts of the Northwest and Florida. Maine and Rhode Island each had their second-wettest March on record.\nAlaska\u2019s average monthly precipitation ranked in the middle third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior, south-central Alaska and in parts of the Panhandle during the month.\n\n\nThe January\u2013March precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 8.15 inches, 1.19 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across much of the contiguous U.S., with Rhode Island having its second-wettest year-to-date period on record. Conversely, precipitation was below average across much of the northern Plains and in small parts of the Northwest, central and southern Plains, Ohio Valley and Southeast during the January\u2013March period.\nThe January\u2013March precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record, with above-average precipitation observed in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior and south-central Alaska, as well as southern portions of the Panhandle during this period.\nBillion-Dollar Disasters\nOne new billion-dollar weather and climate disaster was confirmed in March 2024 after a severe weather event impacted the central and southern U.S. during mid-March, with the most severe weather occurring on March 13\u201315.\u00a0The U.S. has sustained 378 separate weather and climate disasters since 1980 where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (including CPI adjustment to 2024). The total cost of these 378 events exceeds $2.675 trillion.\nOther Notable Events\nFive wildfires, including the Smokehouse Creek wildfire, were finally contained in the Texas Panhandle, the largest cattle-producing region in the world. The wildfires resulted in approximately 1.1 million acres scorched, hundreds of destroyed structures, hundreds of miles of ruined fencing and more than 7,000 dead cattle.Winter did not bring heavy snowfall to Wisconsin nor the temperatures necessary to maintain the snow, allowing fires to begin early and in high numbers. Between January\u2013March 2024, there have been more than 220 fires across Wisconsin.A 5.25-inch diameter hail stone fell in Ada, Oklahoma on March 14, which is the largest stone reported in Pontotoc County since 1950, as well as the largest to fall in the state in nearly 13 years.\nA state of emergency was declared for Ohio as several tornadoes struck the state, resulting in 3 fatalities on March 14 when an EF-3 tornado crossed Auglaize and Logan Counties.\nDrought\nAccording to the April 2 U.S. Drought Monitor report, about 18% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought, down about 3.6% from the end of February. Drought conditions expanded or intensified in portions of the Plains and in parts of the Northwest, central Mississippi Valley, northern Great Lakes and Hawaii this month. Drought contracted or was reduced in intensity across much of the Mississippi Valley, Puerto Rico and the West, and in parts of the Plains, Great Lakes and Carolinas.\nMonthly Outlook\nAbove-average temperatures are favored to impact much of the central U.S., Northwest and Northeast in April while above-average precipitation is likely from much of the Plains to parts of the East Coast and in much of the Southwest. Drought is likely to persist along portions of the Northern Tier, the Southwest, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Visit the Climate Prediction Center\u2019s Official 30-Day Forecasts and U.S. Monthly Drought Outlook website for more details.\nSignificant wildland fire potential for April is above normal across much of the Upper Midwest and in parts of the central and southern Plains.

      "\nDifference Between Standard Costing and Historical Costing\n\nWritten by True Tamplin, BSc, CEPF\u00ae  \nReviewed by    Subject Matter Experts \nUpdated on March 30, 2023\nFact Checked \n Why Trust Finance Strategists?\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost is divided into two broad categories: historical cost and predetermined cost.\nHistorical costs are computed after the production of goods is complete. Therefore, the cost figures have value only from a historical point of view.\nAlthough the figures obtained at the end of the production process may have a definite value in correcting past practices if they are carefully analyzed, a key limitation is that inefficiencies and errors in production are not identified until after the damage is done.\nCost analysis requires the use of predetermined cost estimates, which are made on a more or less scientific basis, to generate standard costs.\nThese costs are prepared in advance of production or supply, and they are based on a correlation of the technical specification of materials and labor to the prices and wage rates estimated for a selected period of time.\nThe following differences exist between historical costing and standard costing:\n1. Costs used: Standard costing includes cost figures that are predetermined based on past experience and expert advice. In historical costing, data are included from costs that have actually been incurred.\n2. Cost calculation: Standard costs are determined and known before the start and completion of production, but historical costs are known only after production is finished.\n3. Cost control: Standard costs are helpful to control costs, judge efficiency, and improve the operations of the organization. By contrast, historical costing does not provide these advantages to the management.\n\n\nCost is divided into two broad categories: historical cost and predetermined cost.\nHistorical costs are computed after the production of goods is complete. Therefore, the cost figures have value only from a historical point of view.\nAlthough the figures obtained at the end of the production process may have a definite value in correcting past practices if they are carefully analyzed, a key limitation is that inefficiencies and errors in production are not identified until after the damage is done.\nCost analysis requires the use of predetermined cost estimates, which are made on a more or less scientific basis, to generate standard costs.\nThese costs are prepared in advance of production or supply, and they are based on a correlation of the technical specification of materials and labor to the prices and wage rates estimated for a selected period of time.\nThe following differences exist between historical costing and standard costing:\n1. Costs used: Standard costing includes cost figures that are predetermined based on past experience and expert advice. In historical costing, data are included from costs that have actually been incurred.\n2. Cost calculation: Standard costs are determined and known before the start and completion of production, but historical costs are known only after production is finished.\n3. Cost control: Standard costs are helpful to control costs, judge efficiency, and improve the operations of the organization. By contrast, historical costing does not provide these advantages to the management.\nDifference Between Standard Costing and Historical Costing FAQs\n\n\nAre historical costs the same as standard costs?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, historical costs are not the same as Standard Costs. Standard Costs are estimates that are made up front for materials, labor and overhead needed to produce goods or services. Historical costs can be obtained after production because they represent what actually occurred during the manufacturing process.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between standard costing and job order costing?\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Costing is used in a job order or Process Costing environment while actual costing is used in a batch or mass production environment.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between standard costs and variances?\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Costs are better to control costs, judge efficiency and improve operations of an organization. Variances can be calculated from either Standard Costs or historical costs. Historical costing is simply the process of determining costs after production.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between actual costs and standard costs?\n\n\n\n\n\nActual costs are determined by recording how much was actually spent on materials, labor and other expenses while Standard Costs are estimates that are calculated in advance based on data from past periods or expert advice.\n\n\nCan historical costs be used to test the reasonableness of standard costs?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, historical costs can be used in testing whether or not Standard Costs are in line with expected direct material and labor rates. Actual costs cannot however because they are simply what occurred during production.\nAbout the Author\nTrue Tamplin, BSc, CEPF\u00ae\nTrue Tamplin is a published author, public speaker, CEO of UpDigital, and founder of Finance Strategists.\nTrue is a Certified Educator in Personal Finance (CEPF\u00ae), author of The Handy Financial Ratios Guide, a member of the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing, contributes to his financial education site, Finance Strategists, and has spoken to various financial communities such as the CFA Institute, as well as university students like his Alma mater, Biola University, where he received a bachelor of science in business and data analytics. \nTo learn more about True, visit his personal website or  view his author profiles on Amazon, Nasdaq and Forbes.\nOur Services\nAsk a Financial Professional Any Question\nQuick Links\nOrganization\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinance Strategists\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n(213) 536-9984\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5550 Tech Center DriveColorado Springs,CO 80919\nDISCLAIMERS\nFinance Strategists has an advertising relationship with some of the companies included on this website.

      "\n\t\t\tCalifornia\u2019s intensive care nightmare: Which hospitals are full?\t\t\nShare this:\nIn summary\nIn the worst-hit counties, some hospitals are sending critically ill patients to other counties. Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired. We\u2019re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,\u201d said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county\u2019s two hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It\u2019s going to be exhausting, stretching.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\u00a0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\u00a0\n\u201cThat person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,\u201d Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\u00a0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there\u2019s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it\u2019s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.\u201d\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\u00a0\n\u201cOur hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cWhen you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that\u2019s 500 to 1000 people that are out.\u201d\u00a0\nSome are out because they\u2019re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\u00a0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure \u2014 at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar\u2019s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn\u2019t been cleared to talk to the press, said she\u2019s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\u00a0\n\u201cI was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter\u2019s while doing everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juggling act.\u201d\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\u00a0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\u00a0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county\u2019s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are full with patients coming to us through the front door,\u201d Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital\u2019s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. \u201cNothing about COVID-19 is typical.\u201d\u00a0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\u00a0\n\u201cICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.\u201d\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County \u2014 the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, \u201chospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,\u201d Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\u00a0\nSince October, Modoc County \u2014 wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet \u2014 has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county\u2019s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko. Typically, that includes hospitals in Modesto as well as Vohra\u2019s congested Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have the ability to do an improvised ICU should we have to hold patients but this is clearly not the preferred option,\u201d Sergienko said.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people, and has already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties.\nEven small counties that do have their own ICUs need to transfer patients who require a higher level of care than they can provide. Colusa County, for instance, has three ICU beds \u2014 none of which were occupied as of Monday, according to county counsel Marcos Kropf. (State data reports that zero ICU beds are available in Colusa. The state did not respond to a request for clarification.)\nBut Colusa County has nevertheless needed to transfer patients to hospitals elsewhere, including Chico, Roseville and Marysville. And in Marysville, the only ICU serving nearly 176,000 people in Sutter and Yuba counties is full, according to a health advisory released Friday.\u00a0\nPhuong Luu, health officer for both Sutter and Yuba counties, wrote that the surge has led hospitalizations at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville to almost triple.\u00a0\nMonica Arrowsmith, a spokesperson for the hospital, would not say Friday whether the ICU was at capacity or whether the hospital had enough staff, but she said the hospital has access to additional supplies, expertise and support from the rest of the Adventist Health system.\u00a0\nLuu, however, said the ICU \u201cis full because of the surge in COVID-19 patients needing ICU level care. There are not enough ICU nurses to expand for more ICU beds,\u201d according to the health advisory. \u201cThe current COVID-19 situation is dire in Yuba-Sutter.\u201d\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has requested 815 medical staffers, including 435 specifically for ICUs, from contractors and most are expected within a week, with Imperial County a high priority. The state has also asked the federal government for help staffing ICUs.\u00a0\nImperial County\u2019s El Centro Regional Medical Center plans to open 21 beds in a 50-bed parking lot tent facility today with staffing from the state, according to hospital CEO Edward. He also said the state will allow the hospital to increase the number of patients each nurse can care for. He hopes the changes will help the hospital increase its staffed ICU beds to 32 from 20.\nExhausted healthcare workers\nThe onslaught of cases after nine months of a pandemic are pushing healthcare workers to the brink. The word repeated by each healthcare worker CalMatters interviewed was \u201cexhausted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cExhausted. Oh man. Exhausted and frustrated,\u201d said one Northern California emergency medicine physician, who asked that her name and hospital not be named because she had not been cleared to speak to the press. \u201cAnd a little scared about what\u2019s going to happen soon.\u201d\u00a0\nAlready, she said, she\u2019s finding it increasingly difficult to transfer patients needing specialty care.\u00a0\n\u201cI called every single hospital in Northern California out to Reno and all the Bay Area hospitals, and they all refused to take this patient,\u201d the doctor said, adding that she found a local doctor who could help. \u201cFor those non-COVID patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\nEven at hospitals that still have room in their ICUs, healthcare workers are feeling the emotional toll of the prolonged pandemic.\u00a0\n\u201cFor those non-covid patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be dependent on this post-Thanksgiving surge,\u201d said Nick Sawyer, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health. \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we will overwhelm the system and people will end up in a hospital that is overwhelmed, that doesn\u2019t have the staffing that is necessary to provide that best care.\u201d\u00a0\nSawyer said that he traveled to New York to help the overwhelmed hospitals during the early days of the pandemic, and was shaken by what he saw there.\u00a0\n\u201cFamilies have to say goodbye to their loved ones over Facetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to the family. It\u2019s devastating to the nurses. It\u2019s devastating to the physicians. It\u2019s just not a normal thing we\u2019re used to doing. And it\u2019s so impersonal, for something that\u2019s so personal.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore that experience, he said, it wouldn\u2019t even register when he heard an ambulance siren.\u00a0\n\u201cNow when I hear an ambulance go by, I feel this heaviness in the pit of my stomach of like, \u2018Is that another coronavirus patient that\u2019s going to be going into the hospital?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m emotionally exhausted by it, even though we\u2019re just getting going.\u201d\u00a0\nCalMatters COVID-19 coverage, translation and distribution is supported by generous grants from the Penner Family Foundation, Blue Shield of California Foundation, the California Wellness Foundation and the California Health Care Foundation.\nRead more from CalMatters\nText\nGet breaking news on your phone.\nDownload\nKeep up with the latest via our app.\nSubscribe\nReceive updates in your inbox.\nMaricela, Montrose\nFeatured CalMatters Member\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel BeckerWater Reporter \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel Becker is a journalist reporting on California\u2019s complex water challenges and water policy issues for CalMatters.

      "L.A. County shatters COVID-19 record with 12,741 new cases in one day\nLos Angeles County shattered its daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 12,741 reported Thursday as hospitals continued to fill with patients, according to an independent Times tally.\nThe new total is more than 2,800 more coronavirus cases than L.A. County has seen in a single day \u2014 breaking the previous record set Sunday \u2014 and shows the coronavirus is still spreading rapidly through communities. The county also reported 74 new deaths, the fourth-highest single-day total of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe surge in cases likely represents the consequence of an explosion of virus transmission over the Thanksgiving holiday, officials said. \n\u201cI do think that we\u2019re starting to see some of the increases from Thanksgiving week, and the thousands of people that were either traveling or mingling with people outside their household for the holiday,\u201d L.A County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said earlier this week. \nWith the new numbers, L.A. County is now averaging nearly 9,500 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, and 52 COVID-19 deaths a day. Those are both records in this pandemic. Until Thursday, the highest average daily number of COVID-19 deaths in L.A. County over a weekly period was 50, a record set for the seven-day period that ended April 24.\nL.A. County is now recording double the number of daily coronavirus cases than it saw on Nov. 30, and quadruple its daily coronavirus cases since mid-November. Cumulatively, L.A. County has tallied 488,519 coronavirus cases and 8,151 COVID-19 deaths. \nCalifornia has averaged nearly 29,000 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, a new record. More Californians are also dying of COVID-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. The state has averaged about 150  deaths a day over the last week \u2014 breaking a record set in August.\nCalifornia on Thursday recorded 33,995 new coronavirus cases, marking the third highest tally for a single day, and 172 deaths.\nCumulatively, the state has logged more than 1.48 million coronavirus cases and more than 20,600 COVID-19 deaths. \nAt the same time, the availability of intensive care beds in Southern California and the Central Valley hit alarming new lows. \n\u201cLike a speeding car approaching a cliff, if we do not rapidly change course, we are in jeopardy of catastrophic consequences,\u201d Dr. Paul Simon, chief science officer for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said during a briefing Thursday. \nIn Southern California, ICU availability fell to 7.7% on Thursday, down from 9% the day before, the latest data show. The state defines the region as Imperial, Inyo, Los Angeles, Mono, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. \nThe situation was even more dire in the San Joaquin Valley region, which is reporting 1.9% ICU availability, down from 4.2%. Numbers have also worsened in the Greater Sacramento area, which reported in at 13.3%, down from 14.3%; and the San Francisco Bay Area, which was at 17.8%, down from 20.9%.\nRural Northern California remains in comparatively solid shape, at 30.3% ICU availability.\nStatewide, an all-time high of 11,497 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized as of Wednesday, the most recent day for which complete data are available. \nThat number increased by 485 in just one day and has swelled by 30% over the last week, state figures show. \nThe story is much the same when it comes to ICUs. The number of Californians requiring that level of care jumped 115 in just one day to a record 2,621 as of Wednesday.\nAs of Wednesday, L.A. County had 3,624 people in its hospitals with coronavirus infections, the 11th consecutive day that number has been a new high. The county\u2019s net number of COVID-19 hospitalizations increased overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday by 191 \u2014 the highest single-day jump in the pandemic.\nSan Bernardino and Orange counties are the only others that have more than 1,000 coronavirus-positive patients, according to state data. \n California \n Southern California is a main driver of state\u2019s record COVID-19 deaths, with no signs of a letup \nSouthern California and the Central Valley are by far the state\u2019s biggest contributors of total COVID-19 deaths in the last week.\nDec. 10, 2020\nHospitals can take steps to gird themselves against an influx of new patients \u2014 by canceling scheduled surgeries and outpatient visits; discharging patients as quickly as possible; and temporarily diverting ambulances with certain types of patients, for instance. \nBut ICU beds require high-tech equipment and specially trained healthcare professionals, which are in high demand throughout the state and nation.\nHealthcare systems can move trained staff around to help plug gaps where needed, but \u201cat a certain point, you run out of options, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re worried about,\u201d Simon said. \n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is what we saw back in the spring in New York City and in northern Italy where there were literally people in gurneys in hallways that were dying or near death, and that\u2019s beyond a tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that we can\u2019t let happen. We have to do everything possible to prevent that.\u201d\n World & Nation \n One-day U.S. death toll from COVID-19 tops 3,000, more than D-Day or 9/11 \nAs officials met to discuss approval of a coronavirus vaccine on Thursday, the number of cases and deaths grew ever more stunning.\nDec. 10, 2020\nThe way the state calculates regional ICU capacity is more complicated \u201cthan just looking at how many beds are full at any given point in time,\u201d said Ferrer.\nShe said Wednesday that the state had set a threshold that only 30% of ICU beds should be occupied by COVID-19 patients and that, should an area exceed that, \u201cthey make a downward adjustment \u2014 sort of, you get a penalty.\u201d\nThe California Department of Public Health elaborated in response to an inquiry from The Times Thursday: \u201cIf a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is reduced by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold. This is done to preserve the capacity of the ICU to also treat non-COVID-19 conditions.\u201d\n\u201cThe ICU is an important tool to save lives for those with COVID-19 and other critical medical conditions such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes,\u201d the department statement continued. \u201cIf a disproportionate number of ICU beds are being utilized to treat COVID-19 patients, then patients with non-COVID medical issues may not be receiving or be able to receive the level of care they need.\u201d\nAccording to data provided by Los Angeles County, 47% of the region\u2019s intensive care beds were filled with COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday. That\u2019s a significant cause for alarm, officials said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to need ICU beds for those many other conditions and so there is greater concern if, in addition to seeing a reduced overall capacity, we\u2019re seeing a greater proportion of these ICU beds taken up by COVID-19 patients,\u201d Simon said.\nHow California determines ICU availability is of keen interest, as that\u2019s the metric the state uses to determine whether to hand down additional restrictions on businesses and activities. \nThe state is implementing new stay-at-home orders in any region that sees its ICU capacity drop below 15%.\nThose orders \u2014 which reduce capacity at retail stores; close businesses including hair salons, nail salons, card rooms, museums, zoos and aquariums; and prohibit outdoor restaurant dining \u2014 are already in place in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley.\nThose restrictions will also go into effect in Greater Sacramento beginning Thursday night.\nOfficials have said they hope the additional restrictions will help stymie the latest coronavirus surge. \nGiven how widespread the virus is in communities up and down the state, experts say the best thing residents can do to keep themselves and their loved ones from being infected is to stay home as much as possible over the next few weeks.\n\u201cTo be blunt, we have one chance to turn this serious surge around, and that chance is right now,\u201d San Francisco health director Dr. Grant Colfax said this week. \u201cBut our window is narrowing and closing fast.\u201d\nWith grim case counts, officials have pointed to the relief a vaccine will soon bring as a way to encourage people to continue to maintain precautions.\nFerrer announced earlier this week that the county would likely get its first doses of the coronavirus vaccine as early as next week. During a Thursday  news conference, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said that as many as 500,000 doses may be distributed by the end of December.\n\u201cVaccines will be our most important tool in getting this crisis under control,\u201d he said. \u201cFDA authorization will mean that it\u2019s safe and that it\u2019s effective, and I urge all Angelenos to get vaccinated as soon as they qualify and those vaccines are available.\u201d\nHe urged residents, however, to continue to stay at home as much as possible, stating that \u201cthe worst is not yet behind us.\u201d\nTimes staff writers Maura Dolan, Ryan Menezes and Leila Miller contributed to this report. \nMore to Read \n \u2018A huge burden\u2019: L.A. hospitals strained by COVID surge, very bad flu season \nDec. 8, 2022\n Another bummer coronavirus summer for California?

      "\n\t\t1 Chicago Hospital Given \u2018F' Grade, 7 Others in Illinois Get a \u2018D' in New Safety Report\t\n\n\t\t\tThe latest rankings from the Leapfrog Group, a nonprofit watchdog, analyzed nearly 3,000 general hospitals in the U.S. based on protection from things like medical errors, accidents, injuries, and infections\t\t\nA new hospital safety report has graded more than 100 hospitals in Illinois, leaving just one Chicago hospital with an \"F\" and seven others with a \"D\" grade. \nThe latest rankings from the Leapfrog Group, a nonprofit watchdog, analyzed nearly 3,000 general hospitals in the U.S. based on protection from things like medical errors, accidents, injuries and infections.\n\ud83d\udcfa 24/7 Chicago news stream: Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are\nIn Illinois, 113 hospitals were rated, with 30 hospitals receiving \"A\" grades, 25 scoring \"B\" grades and 50 others getting \"C\" grades. Seven state hospitals were given \"D\" grades and one hospital earned an \"F\" rating. \nHospitals are ranked based on the number of infections, problems with surgeries, safety issues, staffing and measures aimed at preventing errors. \nThe \"F\" was given to South Shore Hospital in Chicago. \nThe hospital did not respond to NBC Chicago's requests, but was given low marks in some infection categories, hospital falls, error prevention strategies, and staffing and communication. \nSouth Shore CEO Leslie Rogers told the Chicago Tribune after stepping into a leadership role this summer, that the not-for-profit hospital was striving to have a \"C\" or better in the next ranking.\nLocal\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWoman shot and killed in northwest suburbs\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHere's what changes are coming to Social Security in 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMeanwhile, more than half a dozen other facilities got \"D\" grades on the list. \nThat includes Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Gateway Regional Medical Center in Granite City, Javon Bae Hospital in Rockford, Roseland Community Hospital in Chicago, Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center in Mattoon, Vista Medical Center East in Waukegan and Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago. \nWeiss Hospital told NBC Chicago in a statement that its low ranking was \"due to an increase in hospital acquired infections\" during earlier reporting periods. \n\"Since then, we have improved our processes and expect future scores, specifically Fall, to reflect those improvements,\" a spokesperson said. \"Patient safety is our highest priority, and our physicians and staff are fully committed to quality in our patient care activities.\" \nVista Health System said it \"improved during this rating period and continuously focuses on safety, quality, and our patients\u2019 experience\" but noted that data used in its grade \"is more than three years old in some cases and does not reflect the dedication and clinical performance of Vista\u2019s physicians, nurses, and staff.\"\n\"Several national and state agencies acknowledge Vista\u2019s commitment to quality and safety, including U.S. News and World Report, which recently recognized Vista as a high-performing hospital in stroke and COPD care for 2022-2023, and the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, which recognized Vista with a 'Get with The Guidelines Stroke Gold Plus' achievement award with Target: Type 2 Diabetes Honor Roll,\" the healthcare company said. \nAdvocate Aurora Health said it has a \"robust plan in place to drive continued improvement in both safety and health outcomes for our patients.\"\n\"We firmly believe that meaningful quality and safety data should be transparent to the public. However, accurately measuring this data can be challenging, and some organizations use limited methodologies that don\u2019t always reflect the quality of care or the varied factors that contribute to patient outcomes,\" the hospital system said in a statement.\nNBC Chicago reached out to a number of other hospitals listed in the ranking but did not receive a response. \nSome prominent Chicago-area hospitals were also among the \"C\" ratings on the list, including Northwestern Medicine's Lake Forest Hospital, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Science System, a number of OSF HealthCare facilities, Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago and more.  \nNorthwestern Medicine said its Lake Forest Hospital \"is committed to providing high quality, safe, patient-centered care.\" \n\"Our physicians, nurses and staff are driven by their dedication and passion for delivering outstanding care while always striving to do what is better for our patients,\" the hospital said in a statement. \"We believe that quality and safety data should be meaningful, informative and transparent to the public. We appreciate the ongoing efforts by\u00a0Leapfrog\u00a0to improve the usefulness and accessibility of information for consumers.\"\nOSF HealthCare said 10 of its 15 hospitals received a grade in the report, one of which was given an A and five others given B's. \nIn total, four were given a C rating. \n\u201cOSF supports transparency about quality and safety information such as that provided through the Leapfrog grades and is committed to finding ways to improve safety and quality of care. We are proud of the work our Mission Partners (employees) do every day and how they have faced the many challenges of the past two years,\" the healthcare company said in a statement. \nIllinois ranked 28th in the U.S., with 26.5% of hospitals getting an \"A\" grade in the bi-annual report. In the spring, the state was listed at 27th. \nStill, in the fall of 2021, only 18 state hospitals were listed with an \"A\" grade. \nThe top-ranked state on the list was New Hampshire, followed by Virginia, Utah, Colorado and Idaho. \nHere's a look at which Illinois hospitals received an \"A\" grade: \nAdventHealth Bolingbrook - Bolingbrook, IL \nAdventHealth GlenOaks - Glendale Heights, IL\nAdventHealth Hinsdale - Hinsdale, IL \nAdventHealth La Grange - La Grange, IL\nAscension Mercy - Aurora, IL\nAscension Resurrection - Chicago, IL\nBlessing Hospital - Quincy, IL\nCarle Foundation Hospital- Urbana, IL \nElmhurst Memorial Hospital - Elmhurst, IL\nFHN Memorial Hospital - Freeport, IL\nHSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital - O'Fallon, IL\nLoyola Gottlieb Memorial Hospital - Melrose Park, IL \nMacNeal Hospital - Berwyn, IL \nMcDonough District Hospital - Macomb, IL \nMemorial Hospital Belleville - Belleville, IL \nMorris Hospital - Morris, IL \nNorthwest Community Hospital - Arlington Heights, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital - Winfield, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital - Geneva, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Huntley Hospital - Huntley, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Kishwaukee Hospital - DeKalb, IL\nNorthwestern Medicine McHenry Hospital - McHenry, IL\nOSF HealthCare Saint Francis Medical Center - Peoria, IL \nRush Copley Medical Center - Aurora, IL\nRush Oak Park Hospital520 - Oak Park, IL \nRush University Medical Center - Chicago, IL \nSilver Cross Hospital - New Lenox, IL \nSSM Health St. Mary's Hospital-Centralia - Centralia, IL \nUnityPoint Health - Proctor - Peoria, IL \nUniversity of Chicago Medical Center - Chicago, IL\nSee the full list of hospital grades in Illinois here. \nTrending Stories\nWeather Forecast\n"

The state is seeing a shortage of physicians to meet the demands of the growing population.\nWith a shortage in care, that leads to longer appointment wait times and other issues.\nKate Snedeker knows the importance of getting a checkup. She lost her dad to a rare brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, earlier this year.\n\"If he hadn't gone to get it checked on again when he did, he would have been a lot more negatively impacted than he was immediately after,\" Snedeker said.\nBut the University of Texas at Austin senior said getting in to see a doctor herself has been tough.\n\"I was put on a waitlist to see someone for mental health freshman year, and I think I'm still on it. And I'm going to be a senior,\" Snedeker said.\nIt's become a problem for patients across the Lone Star State. According to the Texas Medical Association (TMA), Texas has 204.6 physicians per 100,000 people. The national average is closer to 245.5 per 100,000.\n\"Over the past decade, the population of Texas has grown by about 12% or so. The physician population of Texas has about doubled that, or about 25% increase during that period of time,\" said Dr. Rodney Young, a former chair for TMA's Council on Medical Education.\nYoung said that is great progress and that those ratios used to be worse. The state has opened new medical schools and put itself on the map for up-and-coming doctors. Still, many only practice in urban areas.\n\"We have this vast area of Texas where you have all these rural counties with very limited access to care. So we do still have a lot of work before us,\" Young said.\nRelated Articles\n\nCompany provides virtual alternative for primary health care\nAscension Seton Hays is delivering a lot of babies\n\nEven in town, Snedeker said she is now starting to plan her appointments months in advance.\n\"I've learned that I need to, when I come home from school, I need to book it at the beginning of the summer or the beginning of winter break to make sure that I can be seen,\" Snedeker said.\nBut as new medical schools and residency programs expand, Snedeker and Young are hopeful for a more stable future for physicians and patients in Texas.\nFord Sanders on social media:\u202fFacebook\u202f|\u202fTwitter\u202f|\u202fInstagram\nKVUE on social media:\u202fFacebook\u202f|\u202fTwitter\u202f|\u202fInstagram\u202f|\u202fYouTube\nClose Ad\nBefore You Leave, Check This Out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAd Choices\n\n\nEEO Public File Report\n\nFCC Online Public Inspection File\nClosed Caption Procedures\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n\u00a9 2024 KVUE-TV.

More than 75 percent of respondents expected supply chain challenges to worsen or remain the same this year.\nWhat follows is a current overview of key market updates as we start the new year, and guidance for providers on how to mitigate risk and potential disruptions.\nUnrest in the Middle East\nFollowing COVID-19 pandemic-driven challenges and more recently the Russia/Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas conflict is adding to global supply chain unease.\nMost Premier suppliers are reporting proactive adjustments of their logistics strategies, rerouting shipments and increasing lead times to mitigate the impact of Red Sea disruptions. While some suppliers have already implemented changes to their shipping routes, others are closely monitoring the situation with contingency plans in place.\nThe conflict highlights the interconnected nature of global supply chains and how geopolitical unrest in one region can have ripple effects on logistics operations and supply chains around the world.\nWeather\u2019s Wrath on the Panama Canal\nCommercial ships are facing long queues and delays to travel through the Panama Canal. An extended dry season has reduced the water levels necessary to allow vessels to pass through the canal\u2019s locks \u2013 triggering a logjam of ships awaiting their turn and slowing shipments of healthcare and other products.\nThe Panama Canal is responsible for moving 80 percent of global trade, and Canal authorities have placed restrictions on daily vessel transits that are expected to remain for at least several months. Additionally, some ships are being forced to carry up to 40 percent less cargo to avoid hitting the bottom in low-water levels.\nBeginning Jan. 16, the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) will increase the number of daily transits from 22 to 24 \u2013 compared to the typical 36-40 daily transits. Due to better-than-expected November rainfall and water-saving measures, PCA canceled its previous plans to reduce daily transits to only 18 vessel transits per day by Feb. 1.\nGeopolitical Tensions and Global Dependencies\nGlobal trade flows are shifting as importers increasingly look away from China, the world\u2019s largest goods supplier. In 2023, Mexico surpassed China as the U.S.\u2019s largest trading partner.\nDespite this shift, China continues to play an integral role in manufacturing medical devices, pharmaceutical ingredients and other technological components. Meanwhile, Taiwan is a crucial player in semiconductor production, dominating the global chip industry with 65 percent ownership and producing 90 percent of the world\u2019s most advanced chips.\nIn Aug. 2023, the Biden administration issued an executive order with the goal of preventing investments that might inadvertently benefit China\u2019s military and surveillance capabilities. The order bans U.S. investments in Chinese entities focused on advanced semiconductors, artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computers \u2013 areas integral to various industries, including healthcare.\nWith China and Taiwan crucial to healthcare operations, escalated tensions could create high risk for the healthcare industry \u2013 given the region\u2019s overconcentration of supply for critical goods and raw materials, potential trade and transportation challenges, cost implications and cybersecurity concerns.\nPremier developed a special report exclusively for our members with in-depth background on the geopolitical landscape and dynamics between China and Taiwan \u2013 to provide valuable insights to help navigate the complexities of operating in a global supply chain environment.\nWhat We Can Do\nPremier continues to monitor the global supply chain landscape and pursue proactive preparedness efforts, including ongoing supplier communications on contingency planning and continuous updates for our members.\nProviders should consider rethinking inventory management strategies as manufacturer lead times have increased. Risk management and contingency plans, diversifying product categories, strong supplier relationships, and leveraging the power of Premier\u2019s group purchasing organization can position providers for greater resiliency during this period of uncertainty. In addition, and alongside the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), hospitals should maintain appropriate conservation and stockpiling strategies to help keep supply levels maintained.\nPremier is continuously assessing product categories that are in unhealthy markets \u2013 when a category has two or fewer manufacturers representing 80+ percent of market share \u2013 are critical to patient care and can experience potential disruptions due to global supply chain issues.\nAs such, our Disaster Preparedness and Response team maintains Premier\u2019s data-driven weekly product watch list (available exclusively for members) with actionable information to help mitigate or prevent clinical disruption. Examples of current categories we\u2019re monitoring:\nA Key Solution: Greater Domestic Manufacturing and Supply Sources\nGeographic diversification in production and sourcing \u2013 including reshoring \u2013 continues to gain momentum.\nNinety-six percent of manufacturing CEOs are evaluating reshoring their operations, have decided to reshore or have already reshored \u2013 an increase from 78 percent in 2022. And three out of four U.S. healthcare supply chain leaders also say domestic manufacturing is an \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d component to their organizations\u2019 supply chain resiliency strategies, according to Premier\u2019s 2023 Resiliency survey.\nIncreasingly, U.S. hospitals and health systems are seeking out diverse and domestic suppliers that can reliably provide product without the worry of higher global shipping costs and potential delays that can impact patient care.\nPremier, together with our members, are investing in U.S.-based production. Through our initiatives:\nThe collaborations with Prestige Ameritech, DeRoyal Industries Inc, Honeywell, PRINCO LLC, VGYAAN Pharmaceuticals and Exela Pharma Sciences provide unique value unlocked by Premier and our group purchasing organization (GPO), enabling differentiated access to high-quality, domestically made supplies and a host of pharmaceuticals.\nIf your health system shares in the belief that we need increased domestic resiliency and are interested in participating in one or more of Premier\u2019s programs, please contact us.\nBuilding a proactive culture around mitigating disruptions and improving resiliency is critical to our future success.\nAmid an environment of ongoing uncertainty, Premier continues to arm our members with the information, support and solutions needed to both tackle cost imperatives and enable access to the vital products providers need to care for patients.\nAndy leads the acute and non-acute field and sales teams, Premier\u2019s sponsor programs, commercial operations, Nexera consulting and co-management functions, as well as the stockd\u00ae e-Commerce and alternate site business.\nBruce leads the company\u2019s core supply chain business, including sourcing, contract management, operations and business analytics.

One in 7 reports (14%) were associated with drug shortages (decreases in sales of \u226533%); supply disruptions increased for drugs with and without reports at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and returned to prepandemic levels after May 2020.\nMeaning\u00a0\r\n    These findings suggest that ongoing policy work is needed to protect US drug supplies from future supply shocks.\nImportance\u00a0\r\n    Drug shortages are a chronic and worsening issue that compromises patient safety. Despite the destabilizing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pharmaceutical production, it remains unclear whether issues affecting the drug supply chain were more likely to result in meaningful shortages during the pandemic.\nObjective\u00a0\r\n    To estimate the proportion of supply chain issue reports associated with drug shortages overall and with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\u00a0\r\n    This longitudinal cross-sectional study used data from the IQVIA Multinational Integrated Data Analysis database, comprising more than 85% of drug purchases by US pharmacies from wholesalers and manufacturers, from 2017 to 2021. Data were analyzed from January to May 2023.\nExposure\u00a0\r\n    Presence of a supply chain issue report to the US Food and Drug Administration or the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP).\nMain Outcomes and Measures\u00a0\r\n    The main outcome was drug shortage, defined as at least 33% decrease in units purchased within 6 months of a supply chain issue report. Random-effects logistic regression models compared the marginal odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports. Interaction terms assessed heterogeneity prior to vs during the COVID-19 pandemic and by drug characteristics (formulation, age, essential medicine status, clinician- vs self-administered, sales volume, and number of manufacturers).\nResults\u00a0\r\n    A total of 571 drugs exposed to 731 supply chain issue reports were matched to 7296 comparison medications with no reports. After adjusting for drug characteristics, 13.7% (95% CI, 10.4%-17.8%) of supply chain issue reports were associated with subsequent drug shortages vs 4.1% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.8%) of comparators (marginal odds ratio [mOR], 3.7 [95% CI, 2.6-5.1]). Shortages increased among both drugs with and without reports in February to April 2020 (34.2% of drugs with supply chain issue reports and 9.5% of comparison drugs; mOR, 4.9 [95% CI, 2.1-11.6]), and then decreased after May 2020 (9.8% of drugs with reports and 3.6% of comparison drugs; mOR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.6-5.3]). Significant associations were identified by formulation (parenteral mOR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-3.2] vs oral mOR, 5.4 [95% CI, 3.3-8.8]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.008), WHO essential medicine status (essential mOR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.3-5.2] vs nonessential mOR, 4.6 [95% CI, 3.2-6.7]; P\u2009=\u2009.02), and for brand-name vs generic status (brand-name mOR, 8.1 [95% CI, 4.0-16.0] vs generic mOR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.7-3.6]; P\u2009=\u2009.002).\nConclusions and Relevance\u00a0\r\n    In this national cross-sectional study, supply chain issues associated with drug shortages increased at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing policy work is needed to protect US drug supplies from future shocks and to prioritize clinically valuable drugs at greatest shortage risk.\nDrug shortages have reached record highs.1 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a shortage as \u201ca period of time when the demand\u2026for the drug\u2026exceeds the supply.\u201d2 Shortages have been associated with missed or delayed dosages,3,4 medication errors,5,6 increased spending,7,8 and death.9 Shortages are caused by underreimbursement,10 quality concerns,11 and an overreliance on single-source production.12\nSince 2012, companies must report to the FDA known issues affecting the supply chain which could result in shortages (hereafter, supply chain issue reports).2 These reports are also tracked by the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP).13 Examples of supply chain issue reports include quality concerns (eg, microbial contamination) and unanticipated events that may impact production (eg, natural disasters).14 The FDA also publishes recalls and discontinuations. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with record numbers of supply chain issue reports.1,15 Despite these known risks, it is unknown how often supply chain issues were associated with subsequent shortages, ie, meaningful decreases in the national supply of a medication.\nAs the public health emergency ends, there is an imperative need for evidence regarding its impact on the drug supply chain to inform policies16-20 that protect patients from future, unanticipated shocks.21 The primary objective of our study was to quantify the proportion of all supply chain issue reports that were associated with drug shortages from 2017 to 2021. Our study adds to existing literature by comparing shortages during vs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and by drug characteristics. Our results provide evidence to inform policies to manage upstream events before they impact patients\u2019 access to life-saving treatments.\nWe conducted a population-based, longitudinal cross-sectional study of US prescription drug purchases from January 2017 to December 2021. Using public information from the FDA and ASHP, we identified medications with supply chain issue reports and matched them to drugs without reports. We selected supply chain characteristics based on a conceptual framework and compared the odds of shortages for each group. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved the study as not human participants research; therefore, the requirements for approval and informed consent were waived. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.\nDrug manufacturers are legally required to report known supply chain issues which could result in shortages (eg, inability to obtain raw ingredients) to the FDA; they report voluntarily to ASHP. However, supply chain reports may be incomplete indicators for meaningful decreases in national supplies (ie, shortages). As represented in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1, protective shields in supply chains,22,23 including opening more production lines, importing drugs from other countries, lengthening expiration dates,14,22 or using residual supplies,22 may address issues prior to the depletion of supplies held by manufacturers, wholesalers, and pharmacies. Therefore, not all reported issues necessarily result in drug shortages.\nGiven these complexities and the known limitations of reporting, the purpose of our study was to quantify the proportion of supply chain issue reports that were associated with subsequent population-level shortages, both prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Because there is no legal standard for meaningful decreases in supply, we defined shortages as decreases in purchased units of at least 33% within 6 months after the issuance of a new supply chain issue report. This threshold was chosen based on previous studies24 and is consistent with the FDA and ASHP\u2019s definitions of shortages, ie, significant decreases in national supply2 with the greatest potential to impact patient care.25 We accounted for non\u2013shortage-related supply chain factors by matching drugs exposed to reports to unexposed drugs without reports. We then compared subsequent odds of shortages (ie, \u226533% decreases in supply) for each group.\nOur study population comprised a longitudinal cross-section of drugs purchased in the US from 2017 to 2021 in IQVIA\u2019s Multinational Integrated Data Analysis (MIDAS) database. MIDAS comprises 85% of retail and 97% of nonretail purchases by pharmacies from wholesalers and manufacturers, based on unit volume.26 Data are reported in standardized units, defined as 1 pill, capsule, or vial or 5 mL oral liquid. We conducted our analyses on the drug formulation level. We excluded products with incomplete data, radiopharmaceuticals, unapproved products, allergens, antidotes, and over-the-counter products that are not fully captured in MIDAS. We also excluded topicals, since these may reflect different dosages that are difficult to compare with systemic formulations (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).\nOur exposed group comprised drugs with incident supply chain issue reports issued from January 2017 to September 2021 (3 months prior to data end). For each report, we defined the index date as the initial posting date by the FDA or ASHP. This included issues reported as being likely to result in shortages,2,13,27,28 FDA recalls,29 and discontinuations. Reports for the same drug-form were considered the same episode if they occurred within 90 days (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding recalls and discontinuations which may be indefinite.30\nWe performed exposure density sampling (EDS) to match each drug with a supply chain issue report (ie, exposed) with up to 10 comparison drugs with no reports at the time of exposure (ie, nonexposed).31,32 EDS is akin to sampling techniques for nested case-control studies,32-34 with the exception that matching is performed at the time of an exposure instead of the time of an outcome. This approach mitigated bias due to seasonality. When appropriately combined with multivariable adjustment for confounders, EDS leads to unbiased results.32 We did not match on baseline purchasing trends, since many reports were precipitated by abnormal demand increases.35 Drugs could appear more than once in either group. Drugs with reports could serve as at-risk comparators during any month without an active supply issue report.33\nMotivated by FDA\u2019s definition2 and based on previous studies,24 we defined meaningful shortages as at least 33% decreases in purchased units within 6 months after an incident supply chain issue report, compared with 3 months prior (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1). This decrease is greater than what would be expected based on seasonal trends. We conducted secondary analyses of severe shortages, defined as decreases of at least 66%, as in previous literature.24\nWe used random-effects logistic regression models followed by marginal estimation to compare the odds of shortages for drugs with vs without supply chain issue reports. We included a random intercept for each matched set to account for potential dependency induced by matching. Our main estimates were the mean marginal odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports.34,35 We estimated absolute incidence by comparing the estimated probabilities of shortages in each group. A type 1 error rate of .05 was assumed, all hypothesis tests were 2-sided, and no adjustments were made for multiplicity. Analyses were conducted from January to May 2023 in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute), Stata version 16.1 (StataCorp), and RStudio version 4.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing).\nTo determine the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with US drug supply shortages, we included interaction terms to assess differential changes in the odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports before the pandemic (January 2017 to January 2020), in the first few months after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 an emergency and when stockpiling occurred36 (February 2020 to April 2020), and in the first pandemic year (May 2020 to September 2021). We grouped issues based on their issuance date.\nTo assess the associations of supply chain characteristics with shortage incidence, we included interaction terms by formulation. We then used marginal estimation to compare odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports, within each form, eg, parenteral drugs with reports vs parenteral comparators. Additional interaction terms were added for other characteristics, including years since market entry and generic availability from the FDA National Drug Code Directory (August 2022),37 WHO essential medicine status (June 2022),38 and clinician- vs self-administration, defined using J-codes.39 We proxied supply chain redundancy using the number of manufacturers in MIDAS in the 6 months prior to a supply chain issue report. To capture market size, we adjusted for total sales in MIDAS during the same period (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of methodological assumptions. Because some shortages take longer to develop (eg, due to residual supply), we redefined shortages as decreases in supply within 9 months after report issuance. We assessed 5 (vs 10) matched comparisons, FDA and ASHP reports separately, and excluded recalls and discontinuations.30 Finally, we used nearest-neighbor propensity score methods to match drugs on month, formulation, class, clinician- vs self-administration, WHO essential-medicine status, at least 20 years since market or generic availability, at least 5 manufacturers, and at least $5 million in sales.\nPrior to inclusion criteria, there were 4142 drugs. As shown in Figure 1, 2276 drugs met exclusion criteria, resulting in a final sample of 1866 drugs. Among these, 571 drugs (31%) had 731 incident supply chain issue reports. These were EDS-matched to 1597 unique drugs without concurrent exposures; 717 reports were matched to 10 comparators and 14 reports had 9 comparators, for a total sample size of 7296 comparators.\nPer the Table, generic drugs were overrepresented in supply chain issue reports (616 reports [84%] vs 4397 comparison drugs [60%]), as were products at least 20 years old (375 reports [51%] vs 2434 comparison drugs [33%]), drugs with at least 5 manufacturers (378 reports [52%] vs 2225 comparison drugs [30%]), WHO essential medicines (316 reports [43%] vs 2199 comparison drugs [30%]), and drugs with less than $5 million baseline sales (234 reports [32%] vs 2158 comparison drugs [30%]). Manufacturers did not provide a reason for 264 reports (36%); the percentage of reports with unknown or unspecified reasons increased to 42% from February to April 2020 and 47% after May 2020 (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Across the entire study period, more than half of reports were recalls or discontinuations (498 reports [68%]), mostly due to quality concerns (Table; eTable 4 in Supplement 1).\nWe observed 15 to 71 incident supply chain issue reports per quarter from 2017 to 2021 (Figure 2). Across the study period, the mean change in drug purchases was \u22125.1% (95% CI, \u22128.2% to \u22122.1%) in the first quarter and \u22127.0% (95% CI, \u221214.7 to 0.01%) in the second quarter after report-issuance (Table). Among all reports, 113 reports (16%) were associated with shortages (\u226533% decrease) within 6 months vs 491 of 7290 unexposed comparison drugs (7%) (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). We observed an increase in comparison drugs with shortages in the first quarter of 2020 (Figure 2). Severe shortages (\u226566% decrease) were less common, with 63 reports (9%) and 188 comparison drugs (3%) associated with severe shortages (eTable 5, eFigure 4, and eFigure 5 in Supplement 1). Nonrecall and nondiscontinuation reports were more likely to be associated with meaningful (83 reports [23%]) and severe (43 reports [12%]) shortages, compared with recalls (meaningful: 13 reports [10%]; severe: 4 reports [3%]) and discontinuations (meaningful: 48 reports [13%]; severe: 33 reports [9%]) (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1).\nMarginal odds ratios (mORs) and estimated probabilities from our logistic regression analysis are shown in Figure 3, with full regression output in eTable 6 in Supplement 1. Across baseline drug characteristics, the marginal estimated percentage of supply chain issue reports associated with shortages was 13.7% (95% CI, 10.4%-17.8%) of reports vs 4.1% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.8%) of comparators (Figure 3). Compared with drugs without reports, drugs with reports had greater marginal odds of shortages (mOR, 3.7 [95% CI, 2.9-5.1]). Results were similar for severe shortages (mOR, 6.3 [95% CI, 3.7-10.9]), although adjusted incidences were lower (6.0% [95% CI, 3.8%-9.2%] for supply chain issue reports and 1.0% [95% CI, 0.7%-1.4%] for comparison drugs) (eFigure 6 in Supplement 1).\nAs shown in Figure 3, the adjusted incidence of shortages for supply chain reports issued in the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to be associated with subsequent shortages than reports issued during the prepandemic period (34.2% [95% CI, 18.6%-54.1%] vs 13.7% [95% CI, 10.0%-18.5%]). However, we also observed increases in the adjusted proportion of comparison drugs without reports with shortages at or above our 33% cutoff compared with the prepandemic period (9.5% [95% CI, 7.2%-12.5%] vs 4.0% [95% CI, 3.3%-4.7%]). There were no significant interactions by COVID-19 pandemic period. The 95% CIs of the mORs comparing drugs with vs without reports issued from February to April 2020 overlapped with the prepandemic period (prepandemic mOR, 3.9 [95% CI, 2.6-5.6] vs February to April 2020 mOR, 4.9 [95% CI, 2.1-11.6]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.60). The mOR for drugs with vs without reports issued during or after May 2020 also did not significantly differ from the prepandemic period (mOR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.6-5.3]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.38) (Figure 3). The association between report status and severe shortages did not significantly differ during the prepandemic period (mOR, 6.8 [95% CI, 3.6-12.4]) vs during the early stage of the pandemic (February to April 2020: mOR, 5.9 [95% CI, 1.3-26.3]) or after May 2020 (mOR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.4-11.8]) (eFigure 6 in Supplement 1).\nFigure 4 summarizes our assessment of heterogeneity by drug characteristics. Across other characteristics, we observed a significant interaction for parenteral drugs with vs without reports, compared with oral drugs (parenteral mOR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-3.2] vs oral mOR, 5.4 [95% CI, 3.3-8.8]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.008). There were also significant interactions by WHO essential medicine status (essential mOR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.3-5.2] vs nonessential mOR, 4.6 [95% CI, 3.2-6.7]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.02), and for brand-name vs generic drugs (brand-name mOR, 8.1 [95% CI, 4.0-16.0] vs generic mOR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.7-3.6]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.002). We observed similar heterogeneity for severe shortages  (eFigure 7 in Supplement 1).\nAs shown in eFigure 8 and eTables 7 to 11 in Supplement 1, sensitivity analyses were consistent with our main findings. Excluding recalls and discontinuations resulted in a slightly higher adjusted incidence of shortages (16.7% [95% CI, 12.9%-21.4%]); however, the marginal odds of shortage were similar (mOR, 3.9 [95% CI, 2.8-5.4]).\nIn this national cross-sectional study, approximately 1 in 7 supply chain issue reports (14%) were associated with drug shortages within 6 months, and 1 in 15 supply chain issue reports (6%) were associated with severe shortages. The incidence of shortages increased to 1 in 3 reports (34%) from February to April 2020 and then reduced to prepandemic levels after May 2020. However, we also observed increases in shortages in drugs with no supply chain issues during the early pandemic. WHO essential and parenteral medicines were less likely to be associated with shortages, and brand name drugs were more likely to be associated with shortages.\nOur findings are mostly consistent with a similar RAND study in MIDAS from 2016 to 2019.30 In that study, utilization decreased by a mean of 8.4% in the quarter after a supply chain issue report vs 5.1% in our study. Our smaller absolute estimate may be due to a lower incidence of shortages after May 2020. Nevertheless, our study is an important contribution to the literature because we included recalls and discontinuations, which were less likely to be associated with shortages. We also tested whether shortages changed after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn our study, drugs with and without reports from February to April 2020 were more likely to be associated with subsequent shortages, compared with prepandemic rates. These findings are consistent with the known destabilizing impact of COVID-19 on supply chains. We observed a return to prepandemic levels after May 2020. This finding may be explained by the implementation of new policies that empowered the FDA to take more direct action.16,40,41 Despite these improvements, ongoing vulnerabilities in drug supply chains are in need of policy action,17 including greater supply chain transparency19,21 and addressing root economic causes of shortages.42\nIt is also possible that issuance of an FDA or ASHP report, while consistently associated with higher odds of shortages, may have underestimated relevant upstream issues at pandemic start. Before the pandemic, 4% of drugs with no report were associated with shortages at or above our 33% decrease cutoff; this increased to 10% from February to April 2020. We also observed a greater proportion of supply chain issues with no or unspecified reasons during the pandemic vs the prepandemic period. Temporary pauses in quality assurance reviews during COVID-19 lockdowns may have been associated with underreporting. There are no penalties for failure to report.22 Our wide 95% CIs for February to April 2020 should be interpreted with caution, given the small sample size (57 reports) and potential underreporting.\nWhen examining variation across drugs, we observed a higher mOR for the association between having a report and subsequent shortage among branded medications. This finding is not unexpected, given that branded markets usually have 1 supplier. The higher mOR among branded medications may therefore be explained by the unavailability of alternative manufacturers to supply product. Shortages of branded drugs may also respond to different underlying reasons, such as increased demand, quotas, or manufacturer capacity.43,44 In contrast, approximately 4 in 5 supply chain issue reports in our study were for generic medications, and one-third were for drugs with prereport sales less than $5 million. Generic supply chain issues likely involve insufficient incentives for manufacturers to invest in resilient supply chains for products of limited profitability.11,41 In this context, recent policy proposals suggest the implementation of reimbursement models which would provide add-on payments for generics manufactured in more resilient supply chains.42,45 Our findings of differing shortage risk by supply chain characteristics could be used to develop lists of high-priority generic drugs for the application of these novel reimbursement models. Our findings may also be informative for the development of shortage-critical lists to prioritize medications for other drug shortage policies,22,46 like those in Canada and Europe.47,48 Similar frameworks have not yet been adopted in the US but would be useful in the prioritization of national drug shortage policy.49\nInterestingly, we observed a lower mOR for the association between having a report and subsequent shortage for parenteral vs oral drugs. Changes in demand for these products, eg, cancellation of elective surgeries, may have resulted in residual supply during the pandemic. A higher proportion of parenteral drugs without supply chain reports were also associated with meaningful decreases in supply at or above our 33% cutoff, eg, 7% of parenteral vs 3% of oral drugs, suggesting that it is also possible all parenteral products were more vulnerable to disruption, lessening the difference between exposed vs unexposed drugs.11,41 Generic sterile injectables have therefore been prioritized in several recent drug shortage policy proposals.42,45\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, the observed increase in drugs without supply chain issue reports that experienced shortages from February to April 2020 suggests potential for underreporting during the COVID-19 shutdown. Our mORs comparing drugs with vs without reports from February to April 2020 should be interpreted with caution. Our dataset was also time-limited (2017-2021). Many pandemic-related policies were not yet fully implemented, and we could not assess the association of the end of the public health emergency in May 2023.50 Second, although MIDAS is the most comprehensive dataset available, it does not fully capture over-the-counter and topical products, many of which have recently been experiencing shortages. Third, we do not know the downstream impact of the identified shortages on patients. Bedside efforts and availability of therapeutic alternatives may maintain standards of care, even when shortages occur.22 ASHP includes information on equivalents for some drugs; however, this information was lacking in FDA databases.\nThis cross-sectional study found that 1 in 7 supply chain issue reports were associated with drug shortages. Although the shortages increased early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a return to prepandemic levels after May 2020. As the public health emergency ends, continued policy effort is needed to mitigate shortages and to prepare pharmaceutical supply chains for future, unanticipated shocks.\nAccepted for Publication: January 29, 2024.\nPublished: April 5, 2024. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.4246\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2024 Callaway Kim K et al.

      "Drug Shortages Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic\nChristina M. Bookwalter, PharmD, BCPSClinical PharmacistWomack Army Medical CenterFort Bragg, North Carolina\n\nUS Pharm. 2021;46(2):25-28.\nABSTRACT: The uncertainty of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused anticipatory purchasing of medications around the world, driving demand to an unprecedented high. Meanwhile, drug factories shut down in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the drug-supply chain was disrupted, and drug shortages resulted. In the face of these drug shortages, pharmacy personnel responded by initiating local policy changes, implementing detailed antibiotic stewardship, and enacting quantity limits for in-demand medications. Pharmacists are indispensable during a drug shortage because of their unique skills and ability to bridge shortage gaps with effective action plans that will not imperil patient safety.\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s a shortage of everything\u2019: Pharmacies in New York City struggle to keep key medications stocked amid coronavirus outbreak.\u201d1 \u201cCoronavirus pandemic is causing \u2018unacceptable\u2019 shortages in US drug supplies.\u201d2 These headlines and many others have overwhelmed news outlets, social media, and general conversation among the American public for months. When pharmacy personnel hear about drug shortages, panic, fear, and frustration begin to set in. Pharmacy\u2019s primary responsibility is to supply patients with life-saving medications. When drugs run out, pharmacy personnel may feel responsible for failing to supply the patient with a life-saving pharmaceutical. Accordingly, when pharmacy professionals encounter drug shortages, there is a call to action to be prepared. Pharmacies prepare by purchasing available product, looking for alternatives, implementing protocols to save stock, and finding creative solutions to conserve valuable resources. The uncertainty of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has highlighted the difficulties inherent in having a global drug-supply chain and has caused an increase in global demand for certain medications. It is imperative for pharmacists to understand the causes of drug shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, key medications affected at this time, and how to ensure patient safety during a shortage.\nCauses of Drug Shortages\nDrug shortages have been an ongoing problem for the medical community for decades; however, drug-shortage concerns have been exacerbated by this worldwide pandemic. Drug manufacturing follows standard business practices in order to make a profit. Excess stock in the warehouse is risky from a business standpoint. It costs money to store and maintain product in anticipation of sales and profit. Therefore, businesses may operate on a just-in-time model by manufacturing the product when it is needed in order to keep costs down and maintain efficiency. With no on-hand reserve, if anything alters supply or increases demand, a shortage can occur.3\nThe supply of goods to the market directly relates to the quantity of goods coming off the production lines over a given time. In order to produce a drug, raw materials must be acquired. The drug-manufacturing process is wholly dependent on the supplier of the raw materials. Often, there are multiple manufacturers for a drug, but there may be only one producer of the raw material. Therefore, any interruption in the supply of the raw material will affect all manufacturers of the drug.4 Currently, about 80% of the raw materials for drugs are imported from abroad, making the American drug supply highly dependent on other countries.4\nEven when adequate raw materials are available, there is a maximum capacity or a limited number of units that can be manufactured at a given time. Because the FDA approves a specific manufacturing line to produce a specific drug at a specific facility, a manufacturer cannot set up additional production of a drug in short supply elsewhere in the facility.4 Further limitations to production include the good manufacturing practices, chemical reactions, and in-process controls that must be in place to turn out a quality product.5\nThe spread of COVID-19 to the level of a global pandemic impacted the acquisition of raw material and caused manufacturing shutdowns around the world. China is a major source of active pharmaceutical ingredients, finished dosage forms, and raw materials.6 In response to COVID-19, roughly 37 pharmaceutical factories in China that manufactured active ingredients for U.S. drug products were shut down.7 Consequently, manufacturers in other parts of the world were forced to depend on current stock or find alternative supply sources. India, which imports roughly 70% of its raw materials from China and is the world\u2019s largest producer of generic drugs, began to experience delays in receiving ingredients and could not keep up with global demand under these conditions.7 In anticipation of drug shortages, the Indian government restricted the exportation of medications to other parts of the world in order to prevent a potential shortage in its own country.7 The limiting of drug exports from India amplified shortages in other areas of the world that depend on that supply.\nWith factory doors closed and COVID-19 a global threat, supplies start to run low. Not knowing when and where the next COVID-19 surge will occur, everyone is trying to be prepared. Pharmacies prepare by managing the inventory of critical drugs required for providers to adequately treat the virus. As soon as evidence surfaces to support a potential treatment, pharmacies begin procuring the drug, and global demand starts to increase. Some drugs that have been in high demand in association with COVID-19 include albuterol metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and sedation medications.\nDrugs in Demand for COVID-19 Treatment\nAlbuterol MDIs: Treatment of COVID-19 often involves the use of bronchodilators owing to the specific lung cells targeted by the virus. Given that nebulizers increase the generation of aerosolized virus in COVID-19 patients and potentially escalate the spread of the virus, MDI use is preferred. Inhaler shortages are occurring because of increased demand by hospitals for treatment of COVID-19.8 To combat potential shortages, hospitals can conserve supply by creating local policies that would allow patients to bring their inhaler supply from home to use during their inpatient stay.9 Another way to conserve supply is when an inpatient pharmacy dispenses an inhaler for hospital use, then gives it to the patient upon discharge, eliminating the need for the patient to obtain a new prescription from the outpatient pharmacy.9 The possibility of using one MDI for multiple patients has been discussed. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) currently recommends against a common MDI-canister protocol.9 Common canister protocol involves using the same MDI for multiple patients by disinfecting the MDI mouthpiece with an alcohol pad before inserting it into a patient-specific spacer with a one-way valve, administering the medication, and disinfecting the MDI mouthpiece after use.9 Studies have found rates of bacterial contamination on the disinfected mouthpiece of up to 5%.9 The ISMP states that using a common canister for patients on isolation or those who are immunocompromised may not be appropriate and that the methods in previous studies have been aimed at preventing bacterial contamination, which would not be applicable to COVID-19.9 Given the elevated demand for MDIs because of COVID-19, it is imperative that pharmacists consider their current inventory and plan to conserve supplies if needed.\nAzithromycin: Azithromycin has been used as adjunctive therapy to provide antibacterial coverage and potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of some viral respiratory tract infections.10 Many trials are testing the effect of azithromycin in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients.10 The increasing number of reports on azithromycin has led to an increased demand for the drug. On April 14, 2020, the FDA reported that there was currently a shortage of azithromycin owing to high demand.11 Although the intention to acquire supplies to keep on hand in case of a COVID-19 surge is laudable, it is important to remember that in 2018 the United States dispensed 38.5 million azithromycin prescriptions for conditions other than COVID-19.12 In order to reserve a supply of azithromycin, it is imperative that pharmacists practice good antibiotic stewardship and ensure that patients who receive azithromycin have an appropriate indication. In the U.S. alone, the CDC estimates that at least 30% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, commonly being written for viral respiratory infections when therapy is not indicated.13 Some other examples of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing include the use of non\u2013first-line antibiotics and the use of an antibiotic with excessively broad-spectrum activity for which a narrow-spectrum drug could be substituted.13 Pharmacists should review all azithromycin prescriptions to ensure that there is a proper indication and, when appropriate, recommend other proven therapy alternatives in order to help conserve the azithromycin supply.\nHydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are indicated for a very small population of patients with uncommon conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria. Therefore, typical purchasing quantities are minimal. However, COVID-19 research involving hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine has heightened the demand for these drugs. Many small trials began testing the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients because their mechanisms of action include targeting of lysosome, which can control graft-versus-host disease; inhibition of entry of the virus; prevention of virus cell fusion; anti-inflammatory effects; and reduction of cytokine storm.10 On March 20, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile to be used by licensed healthcare providers to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19.14 An analysis of outpatient retail pharmacy transaction data found that the prescribing of these drugs increased from 383,435 prescriptions in February 2020 to 759,186 prescriptions in March 2020.14 With demand doubling over 1 month, shortages followed, and the FDA published information on the shortages on March 31, 2020.15 In response, certain state boards of pharmacy established new rules to control use by requiring a diagnosis for the indicated disease to be written on the prescription, placing quantity limits for COVID-19 prescriptions, and restricting refills.16 On June 15, 2020, the FDA rescinded its EUA because the federal COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel issued recommendations against the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 and noted that, at the time, no medication could be recommended for COVID-19 preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis outside the clinical-trial setting.14 Following the release of this information, dispensing trends began to return to prepandemic levels, and the shortage resolved in late June 2020.14\nSedation Medications: COVID-19 can result in acute respiratory distress, and in extreme cases it requires the use of mechanical ventilation. Anticipation of an increase in mechanically ventilated patients and heightened demand for analgesics, sedatives, and paralytics created the perfect conditions for drug shortages. One way to save drug product is to minimize waste. Inpatient pharmacies should consider purchasing or compounding smaller drug volumes, when applicable, in order to minimize waste. Pharmacists should also review current hospital protocols and work with key stakeholders to make contingency plans for shortages of sedation medications. Traditionally, IV administration of opioids is preferred in mechanically ventilated patients; however, to conserve resources and keep opioid use to a minimum, hospitals can establish protocols for intermittent bolus analgesia, enteral administration of opioids, or implementation of adjuvant therapies.17 In ventilated patients, light sedation\u2014which helps conserve drug supply\u2014is preferred over deep sedation.17 Nonbenzodiazepine sedatives such as propofol and dexmedetomidine are preferred, but contingencies should be put in place to use other agents, such as ketamine, benzodiazepines, and pentobarbital.17 Awakening trials with reassessment of sedation needs should be performed daily. This practice may result in a reduction in sedation requirements while effectively conserving drug supply.17 In addition to analgesics and sedatives, some patients with COVID-19 will require paralytics. In order to conserve resources, hospital guidelines should be established for the use of continuous infusion versus intermittent bolus use of paralytic agents.17 In general, when a drug shortage arises, it is imperative that pharmacists familiarize themselves with all alternative products and assist in creating contingency plans.\nPatient Safety During a Drug Shortage\nA drug shortage commonly requires the substitution of an item that is ordered, prepared, or dispensed differently than the standard product. When prescribing practices switch to less-familiar alternative agents\u2014especially those that are less efficacious, have a worse adverse-effect profile, or require an unusual or difficult dosing regimen\u2014medication errors are more likely to occur.18 To minimize medication errors and maximize patient safety, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) guidelines on managing drug-product shortages recommend implementing a drug-product shortage team, creating a resource-allocation committee, and establishing a process for approving alternative therapies and addressing ethical considerations.18 The product-shortage team would have multiple responsibilities, including the purchasing of alternative agents, decisions on conserving or rationing supplies, implementation of technology updates, and communication of changes.18 The resource-allocation committee would create a framework for rationing drug resources in advance, thereby eliminating the need for bedside decisions during a shortage.18 The final ASHP recommendation is to have a process in place for approving alternative therapies and addressing ethical considerations. A multidisciplinary team would be responsible for establishing ethical procedures and protocols before they are needed in order to ensure that the rationing of life-saving drugs reflects the fundamental healthcare principles of justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence.18\nThe overarching recommendation for preventing medication errors and ensuring patient safety is to focus on communicating information about the drug shortage. Communication updates should include all pertinent information about the shortage, such as the drug affected and the substitution or rationing plan.18 If a new drug is being selected, educational references about prescribing differences should be distributed, and pharmacists should be prepared to answer questions about the new agent. When information is being disseminated, it is important to include all potential stakeholders across all shifts. With drug shortages on the rise during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that the pharmacy profession take a proactive leadership role in developing and implementing processes to address drug shortages and ensure patient safety.\nConclusion\nThe pharmacy profession has been dealing with drug shortages for years. However, no past experience could have adequately prepared pharmacists for the drug shortages and unprecedented high demand resulting from the extensive disruptions caused by COVID-19. The pandemic crippled the global drug-supply chain by leading to factory closings, limited access to raw materials, and altered import and export rates of final dosage forms. With an inadequate supply chain and high demand worldwide, prescription drug shortages became a common topic in the pharmacy realm. Fear of not having enough supplies to battle the virus motivated pharmacy personnel to change current practices by initiating local policy changes, focusing on antibiotic stewardship, and implementing quantity limits in order to conserve drug stock. Overall, the need to combat historic drug shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to innovation and critical thinking in an effort to conserve valuable supplies without sacrificing patient safety under less-than-ideal circumstances. Pharmacists are indispensable during a drug shortage because of their unique skills and ability to bridge shortage gaps with effective action plans that will not imperil patient safety.\nREFERENCES\n1.

      "Breaking Down the Drug Shortages of 2024\nContent\nThe landscape of healthcare in the United States often feels as intricate and complicated as the human body itself. In recent times, one of the greatest challenges stirring concern among professionals and patients alike has been the drug shortages of 2024. These shortages have broad-reaching implications, affecting everything from the supply chain management of pharmaceuticals to the availability of lifesaving, critical drugs for patients in need.\nDrug shortages can sound somewhat of a vague issue until we consider the direct and often critical impact on patient\u2019s lives. From vital chemotherapy drugs for cancer patients to essential medications for hyperactivity disorder, the landscape of drug availability has shifted dramatically in 2024, sparking widespread concern and calls for swift action.\nFor updated information on the drug shortage crisis, including the reason for the shortage, availability of products, and estimation of resupply, view the ASHP list or the FDA database.\n\nThe landscape of healthcare in the United States often feels as intricate and complicated as the human body itself.

After all, why would a country as powerful as the United States struggle with such a basic need? The answer, unfortunately, is not straightforward but is intertwined with a network of intricate factors involving not only the production and distribution of drugs but also economic, political, and regulatory elements.\nSupply Chain Vulnerabilities\nOne major element contributing to the drug shortage crisis is the vulnerabilities in the supply chain. Often, drugs and their raw materials are sourced and processed in different countries \u2013 a complex tapestry that can be easily disrupted by a range of factors, from natural disasters affecting raw material supplies to political instabilities and even global pandemics.\nThe contracting practices between drug wholesalers and manufacturers, which often prioritize high-value drugs over lower-cost generic ones\u2014those most at risk of shortage\u2014contribute to the problem. This bias for profitability over sustainability can leave the supply of lower-cost generic drugs, essential medicines for a large fraction of the U.S. population, teetering on the edge.\nMarket Forces\nMarket forces also play a critical role. Some drug manufacturers may opt to discontinue production of less profitable drugs, leading to shortages. In an industry driven by profit margins, these decisions can have a domino effect, causing shortages that ripple across the country.\nQuality Concerns for Generic Drugs\nFinally, there are quality issues to consider within drug production. This aspect focuses on challenges faced by generic manufacturers. Increasing amounts of generic drugs have been recalled due to quality concerns, fueling the shortage. Alarmingly, popular medications like Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate, a drug used to treat ADHD, have come under scrutiny, further exaggerating the crisis.\nIn this intricate web of causes, one thing is clear: the drug shortages of 2024 are a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to resolution. Understanding these causes is the first step toward finding sustainable solutions.\n\nAt first glance, the shortage of prescription drugs may be challenging to understand. After all, why would a country as powerful as the United States struggle with such a basic need?

The conditions that arise from shortage situations are far-reaching and directly impact the quality of care.\nAn active drug shortage implies that there are limitations on what is available for patient treatment. In some situations, alternatives exist, but they may not have the same efficacy as the initially intended medication. Also, alternative drugs may come with a higher risk of side effects, putting an additional strain on the patient\u2019s health.\nPublic comments and white papers have been increasingly filled with stories reflecting this crisis. Instances of parents unable to find ADHD medications for their children, or families of cancer patients scrambling to find equally effective alternatives for unavailable emergency medications like chemotherapy drugs, are becoming deeply unsettling realities of the crisis.\nThe response of the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Health and Human Services, and other federal agencies provides a sobering reflection of the severity of the situation. Given the complexity of these active shortages, federal bodies are grappling with formulating strategies to tackle the issue, with a focus on increasing generic drug production and bolstering the capacity of manufacturing chains.\nIn this light, the drug shortages of 2024 are not just numbers on spreadsheets and inventory lists. They represent a perilous reality for patients and healthcare providers across the United States. Exploring potential solutions, therefore, is not just a matter of balanced books\u2014it is a matter of life and health.\n\nAs we delve into the aftermath of drug shortages, we cannot overlook the strain they place on both healthcare providers and patients.

However, by taking systematic, strategic steps, it is possible to grapple with this issue effectively. Here are a few essential strategies being proposed to address and improve the drug shortage situation:\n1. Imposing Financial Penalties\nSome suggest leveraging financial penalties for delays in drug administration. This measure is believed to infuse a sense of responsibility and urgency within drug companies and discourage them from delay tactics that can exacerbate medical supplies shortage situations.\n2. Enhancing Supply Chain Resilience\nThe essence of this strategy lies in the diversification and reinforcement of the supply chain. This can be achieved through increased domestic manufacturing capabilities and a diversified global supply chain for key drug components. It is a tall order, requiring international cooperation, but it stands as a promising recourse for buffering against supply chain disruptions.\n3. Building a Robust Drug Shortage Database\nThe development of a comprehensive, up-to-date database on current and potential drug shortages is another crucial step towards mitigation. With access to real-time data, healthcare providers can anticipate supply issues, adjust inventories, and modify treatment plans, as necessary.\n4. Overhauling Contracting Practices\nThere is an emerging call to reassess contracting mechanisms within the pharmaceutical industry. Some contracts prioritize high-cost drugs over lower-cost generic ones\u2014a practice that needs to be revisited to ensure a stable supply of essential generic medications, most susceptible to shortages.\nIn summary, these proposed strategies represent a multi-pronged approach to tackling drug shortages\u2014a combination of regulatory measures, strategic overhauls, and technological solutions. By adopting such an approach, it opens the possibility of mitigating future drug shortages, ensuring that essential medications remain readily available to those who need them the most.\n\nNavigating through the complexities of drug supply shortages might seem daunting at first.

      "Breaking Down the Drug Shortages of 2024\nContent\nThe landscape of healthcare in the United States often feels as intricate and complicated as the human body itself. In recent times, one of the greatest challenges stirring concern among professionals and patients alike has been the drug shortages of 2024. These shortages have broad-reaching implications, affecting everything from the supply chain management of pharmaceuticals to the availability of lifesaving, critical drugs for patients in need.\nDrug shortages can sound somewhat of a vague issue until we consider the direct and often critical impact on patient\u2019s lives. From vital chemotherapy drugs for cancer patients to essential medications for hyperactivity disorder, the landscape of drug availability has shifted dramatically in 2024, sparking widespread concern and calls for swift action.\nFor updated information on the drug shortage crisis, including the reason for the shortage, availability of products, and estimation of resupply, view the ASHP list or the FDA database.\n\nThe landscape of healthcare in the United States often feels as intricate and complicated as the human body itself.

From vital chemotherapy drugs for cancer patients to essential medications for hyperactivity disorder, the landscape of drug availability has shifted dramatically in 2024, sparking widespread concern and calls for swift action.\nFor updated information on the drug shortage crisis, including the reason for the shortage, availability of products, and estimation of resupply, view the ASHP list or the FDA database.\nCauses of the Drug Shortages in 2024\nAt first glance, the shortage of prescription drugs may be challenging to understand. After all, why would a country as powerful as the United States struggle with such a basic need? The answer, unfortunately, is not straightforward but is intertwined with a network of intricate factors involving not only the production and distribution of drugs but also economic, political, and regulatory elements.\nSupply Chain Vulnerabilities\nOne major element contributing to the drug shortage crisis is the vulnerabilities in the supply chain. Often, drugs and their raw materials are sourced and processed in different countries \u2013 a complex tapestry that can be easily disrupted by a range of factors, from natural disasters affecting raw material supplies to political instabilities and even global pandemics.\nThe contracting practices between drug wholesalers and manufacturers, which often prioritize high-value drugs over lower-cost generic ones\u2014those most at risk of shortage\u2014contribute to the problem. This bias for profitability over sustainability can leave the supply of lower-cost generic drugs, essential medicines for a large fraction of the U.S. population, teetering on the edge.\nMarket Forces\nMarket forces also play a critical role. Some drug manufacturers may opt to discontinue production of less profitable drugs, leading to shortages. In an industry driven by profit margins, these decisions can have a domino effect, causing shortages that ripple across the country.\nQuality Concerns for Generic Drugs\nFinally, there are quality issues to consider within drug production. This aspect focuses on challenges faced by generic manufacturers. Increasing amounts of generic drugs have been recalled due to quality concerns, fueling the shortage. Alarmingly, popular medications like Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate, a drug used to treat ADHD, have come under scrutiny, further exaggerating the crisis.\nIn this intricate web of causes, one thing is clear: the drug shortages of 2024 are a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to resolution. Understanding these causes is the first step toward finding sustainable solutions.\n\nAt first glance, the shortage of prescription drugs may be challenging to understand.

Understanding these causes is the first step toward finding sustainable solutions.\nImplications of the Drug Shortages\nAs we delve into the aftermath of drug shortages, we cannot overlook the strain they place on both healthcare providers and patients. The conditions that arise from shortage situations are far-reaching and directly impact the quality of care.\nAn active drug shortage implies that there are limitations on what is available for patient treatment. In some situations, alternatives exist, but they may not have the same efficacy as the initially intended medication. Also, alternative drugs may come with a higher risk of side effects, putting an additional strain on the patient\u2019s health.\nPublic comments and white papers have been increasingly filled with stories reflecting this crisis. Instances of parents unable to find ADHD medications for their children, or families of cancer patients scrambling to find equally effective alternatives for unavailable emergency medications like chemotherapy drugs, are becoming deeply unsettling realities of the crisis.\nThe response of the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Health and Human Services, and other federal agencies provides a sobering reflection of the severity of the situation. Given the complexity of these active shortages, federal bodies are grappling with formulating strategies to tackle the issue, with a focus on increasing generic drug production and bolstering the capacity of manufacturing chains.\nIn this light, the drug shortages of 2024 are not just numbers on spreadsheets and inventory lists. They represent a perilous reality for patients and healthcare providers across the United States. Exploring potential solutions, therefore, is not just a matter of balanced books\u2014it is a matter of life and health.\n\nAs we delve into the aftermath of drug shortages, we cannot overlook the strain they place on both healthcare providers and patients.

Exploring potential solutions, therefore, is not just a matter of balanced books\u2014it is a matter of life and health.\nImproving the Drug Shortage Situation\nNavigating through the complexities of drug supply shortages might seem daunting at first. However, by taking systematic, strategic steps, it is possible to grapple with this issue effectively. Here are a few essential strategies being proposed to address and improve the drug shortage situation:\n1. Imposing Financial Penalties\nSome suggest leveraging financial penalties for delays in drug administration. This measure is believed to infuse a sense of responsibility and urgency within drug companies and discourage them from delay tactics that can exacerbate medical supplies shortage situations.\n2. Enhancing Supply Chain Resilience\nThe essence of this strategy lies in the diversification and reinforcement of the supply chain. This can be achieved through increased domestic manufacturing capabilities and a diversified global supply chain for key drug components. It is a tall order, requiring international cooperation, but it stands as a promising recourse for buffering against supply chain disruptions.\n3. Building a Robust Drug Shortage Database\nThe development of a comprehensive, up-to-date database on current and potential drug shortages is another crucial step towards mitigation. With access to real-time data, healthcare providers can anticipate supply issues, adjust inventories, and modify treatment plans, as necessary.\n4. Overhauling Contracting Practices\nThere is an emerging call to reassess contracting mechanisms within the pharmaceutical industry. Some contracts prioritize high-cost drugs over lower-cost generic ones\u2014a practice that needs to be revisited to ensure a stable supply of essential generic medications, most susceptible to shortages.\nIn summary, these proposed strategies represent a multi-pronged approach to tackling drug shortages\u2014a combination of regulatory measures, strategic overhauls, and technological solutions. By adopting such an approach, it opens the possibility of mitigating future drug shortages, ensuring that essential medications remain readily available to those who need them the most.\n\nNavigating through the complexities of drug supply shortages might seem daunting at first.

      "International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products Statistics Explained Source : Statistics Explained (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statisticsexplained/) - 15/11/2024 1 Data from April 2024 Planned article update: April 2025 \" In 2023 compared with 2022, imports (+6.1%) grew but exports (-3.5%) fell, shrinking the trade surplus from C 174 billion to C 158 billion.\" \" The United States and Switzerland were the EU\u2019s main trading partners for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023. \" \" Among the EU countries, Germany was the largest exporter of medicinal and pharmaceutical products to countries outside the EU, in 2023. \" This article is part of an online publication providing recent statistics on international trade in goods, covering information on the EU\u2019s main partners, main products traded, speci\ufb01c characteristics of trade as well as background information.\nStrong growth of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023 Figure 1 shows that extra-EU exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products have decreased for the \ufb01rst time since 2008, dropping C 10 billion compared to 2022, while imports continued to increase. Even the \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008, which affected trade in many other products, did not cause a fall in exports or imports. With exports increasing more than imports, the trade surplus increased from C 18 billion in 2002 to a record high of C 174 billion in 2022 but fell to C 158 billion in 2023.\nFigure 1: EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Increasing share in total trade In 2023, the share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade was 7.8% with the share for imports (4.7%) much smaller than the share for exports (10.8%). Between 2002 and 2008 these shares remained fairly stable (Figure 2). In 2009, the share of imports increased by 1.3 percentage points (pp) and exports by 1.6 pp.\nThis was not caused by an increase in trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products but rather by the decline in total trade. Since 2009, the shares have been \ufb02uctuating but there is a clear overall growth.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 2 Figure 2: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade, 2002-2023 (% in total trade) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) United States and Switzerland remain the top EU partners The United States stands out as the EU\u2019s main trading partner for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023 (Figure 3). Exports to the United States (33 %) were almost a third of all EU exports and were followed at some distance by Switzerland (15 %) and China (8 %). Imports to the EU were dominated even more by the United States (39 %) and Switzerland (32 %) followed by the United Kingdom (7 %). Since the United States and Switzerland are by far the two largest trade partners, the development of their trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products with the EU is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 3 Figure 3: Main EU partners for trade of medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade with the United States and Switzerland between 2002 and 2023 Figure 4 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and the United States from 2002 to 2023. Between 2022 and 2023, imports from the United States increased by 19.3% while exports decreased by 1.5%. This caused the trade balance to fall from C 54 billion in 2022 to C 45 billion in 2023.\nMeasured as average annual growth between 2002 and 2023, exports increased by 8.8 % per year and imports increased by 7.2 % per year. During the whole period the EU has had a trade surplus with the United States, peaking at C 54 billion in 2022.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 4 Figure 4: EU trade with the United States in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Figure 5 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and Switzerland from 2002 to 2023. In 2023, for the \ufb01rst time in the period under investigation, exports (C 43 billion) were larger than imports (C 38 billion), causing the trade de\ufb01cit of C 1 billion in 2022 to turn into a surplus of C 4 billion in 2023. Over the whole period between 2002 and 2023, measured as average annual growth, exports increased by 10.0 % per year, while imports increased by 7.3 % per year.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 5 Figure 5: EU trade with Switzerland in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products by EU Member State The share of intra EU imports in total (intra + extra) imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products varied greatly between EU countries in 2023 (Figure 6). For Luxembourg, Lithua-nia and Estonia it was above 93 %, while for Slovenia and Malta it was below 40 %. The average for the EU was 68 %.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 6 Figure 6: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in intra and extra EU imports, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) The share of intra EU exports in total (intra + extra) exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products also varied greatly between EU countries in 2023 (Figure 7). For Luxembourg, Slovakia, Czechia and Estonia it was above 80 %, while for Portugal, Finland, Denmark and Slovenia it was below 40 %. The average for the EU was 48 %.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 7 Figure 7: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in intra and extra EU exports, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Table 1 shows that in 2023, amongst the EU countries, Germany had the highest extra-EU exports (C 62 billion) followed by Belgium (C 43 billion) and Ireland (C 37 billion). Four countries had shares higher than 20 % for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU exports. These were Slovenia (59 %), Ireland (33 %), Denmark (27 %) and Belgium (25 %).\nBelgium (C 26 billion), Germany (C 20 billion) and the Netherlands (C 16 billion) were the largest importers of medicinal and pharmaceutical products from countries outside the EU, in 20231. In 2023, Slovenia (18 %), Belgium (14 %) and Austria (13 %) had the highest shares for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU imports.\nGermany (C 43 billion) and Ireland (C 31 billion) had the largest extra-EU trade surpluses for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023. Only Romania, Slovakia, Malta, Estonia and Czechia had trade de\ufb01cits.\n1Dutch and Belgian imports can be overestimated due to the so-called \"Rotterdam effect\" (See sectionData sources for more details) International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 8 Table 1: Extra EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (C million and %) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Source data for tables and graphs \u2022 International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products: tables and \ufb01gures Data sources This article is based on data available in the Eurostat COMEXT database for EU EU countries and in the United Nations COMTRADE database for non-EU countries.\nA code (such as \u2019DS_018995\u2019) is inserted as part of the source. This code allows the reader to easily access the most recent EU data on the Eurostat website. Note that data on the website is frequently updated and may also be more detailed or have a different measurement unit. It should also be noted that European statistics on international trade in goods are compiled according to the EU concepts and de\ufb01nitions and may, therefore, differ from national data published by EU countries.\nProduct classi\ufb01cation Division 54 \u2019Medicinal and pharmaceutical products\u2019 of the Standard international trade classi\ufb01cation revision 4 (SITC Rev. 4), is made up of the sub-groups: \u2022 5411 \u2019Provitamins and vitamins (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5413 \u2019Antibiotics (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5414 \u2019Vegetable alkaloids (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5415 \u2019Hormones, prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes\u2019; \u2022 5416 \u2019Glycosides; glands or other organs; antisera, vaccines; International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 9 \u2022 5419 \u2019Pharmaceutical goods, other than medicaments\u2019; \u2022 5421 \u2019Medicaments containing antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5422 \u2019Medicaments containing hormones, etc., but not antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5423 \u2019Medicaments containing alkaloids, but not containing hormones etc. or antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5429 \u2019Medicaments not elsewhere speci\ufb01ed\u2019.\nUnit of measure Trade values are expressed in millions (106) or billions (109) of euros. They correspond to the statistical value, i.e.\nto the amount which would be invoiced in case of sale or purchase at the national border of the reporting country. It is called a FOB value (free on board) for exports and a CIF value (cost, insurance, freight) for imports.\nA bias in the geographical allocation of extra-EU \ufb02ows Extra-EU imports and exports are reported by the Member State where the customs declaration is lodged, usually the place where the goods cross the EU external frontier (here referred to as the exit/entry Member State). This is not necessarily the Member State of actual import or export. The geographical allocation of an extra-EU \ufb02ow is biased in the case where the entry/exit Member State is not the actual importing/exporting Member State. In such a case, the extra-EU trade will be allocated to the entry/exit Member State and the actual importing/exporting Member State will report only intra-EU \ufb02ows with the exit/entry Member State. This issue particularly impacts the extra-EU imports of EU countries having important ports for transshipment of goods like Antwerp in Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. This is why it is known as the \u2019Rotterdam effect\u2019.\nThe United Kingdom is considered as an extra-EU partner country for the EU for the whole period covered by this article. However, the United Kingdom was still part of the internal market until the end of the transitory period (31 December 2020), meaning that data on trade with the United Kingdom are still based on statistical concepts applicable to trade between the EU countries. Consequently, while imports from any other extra-EU trade partner are grouped by country of origin, the United Kingdom data re\ufb02ect the country of consignment. In practice this means that the goods imported by the EU from the United Kingdom were physically transported from the United Kingdom but part of these goods could have been of other origin than the United Kingdom. For this reason, data on trade with the United Kingdom are not fully comparable with data on trade with other extra-EU trade partners.\nContext Pharmaceutical products are among the most important products within the chemicals sector (SITC section 5).\nToday, the pharmaceutical sector is extensively regulated at EU level in the dual interest of ensuring the highest possible level of public health and patient con\ufb01dence in safe, effective and high-quality medicinal products, while continuing to develop a single EU market for pharmaceuticals in order to strengthen the European pharmaceutical industry\u2019s competitiveness and research capability.\nThe most common trade impediments faced by pharmaceutical exporters are a range of burdensome and costly registration, licensing and certi\ufb01cation procedures. The EU aims to redress these through its bilateral trade agreements or by tackling individual barriers as part of its market access partnership.\nOther articles \u2022 International trade in goods - other articles International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 10 Dedicated section International trade in goods - dedicated section Database International trade in goods - database Data visualisations \u2022 International trade in goods - visualisations Methodology International trade in goods - methodology Legislation \u2022 International trade in goods - legislation External links \u2022 European Commission - DG Trade Notes International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 11"

      "\nIn this article\nABC Analysis is a method used in supply chain management to categorize inventory into three groups\u00e2\u0080\u0094A, B, and C\u00e2\u0080\u0094based on their importance. This classification helps businesses prioritize their resources and focus on the most critical items.\nAn Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN), sometimes referred to as Advance Ship Notice, is a notification sent by a supplier or manufacturer to a customer or retailer to provide detailed information about a pending shipment. The ASN serves as an electronic document that outlines the contents of the shipment before it physically arrives at the destination. \nAn agile supply chain is a flexible and responsive approach to supply chain management that enables organizations to quickly adapt to changing market conditions, customer demands, and disruptions. It focuses on enhancing speed, efficiency, and adaptability throughout the entire supply chain process, from sourcing raw materials to delivering finished products to customers.\nAn air waybill (AWB) is a vital logistics document used in air freight transportation. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper (consignor) and the airline (carrier), detailing the terms and conditions of air transportation for the shipment. The air waybill contains essential information such as the origin and destination of the cargo, the description of goods, the weight, and the freight charges.\nAn arrival notice is a notification sent by a carrier or freight forwarder to inform consignees or recipients that a shipment has arrived at its destination port or facility. This notice serves as an important communication tool in the supply chain, providing recipients with essential information about the arrival of their goods and detailing the next steps for delivery or pickup.\nAn Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a tracking system used in the maritime industry to monitor the location and movement of ships. AIS provides real-time information about vessel identification, position, course, and speed. \n\u00e2\u0080\u008dBackhauling is a transportation logistics practice where trucks carry a return load on their way back from delivering goods to their destination. Instead of returning empty, trucks utilize their empty space to transport goods from the destination back to the point of origin or another destination along the route. \nIn supply chain management, \"backorder\" refers to a situation where a customer places an order for a product that is temporarily unavailable in the seller's inventory. When an item is on backorder, it means the customer's order cannot be fulfilled immediately due to insufficient stock levels.\n\nA bay plan is a diagram that details the stowage of containers on a vessel, specifying their exact position by bay, row, and tier to ensure efficient and safe loading and unloading operations.\nA Beneficial Cargo Owner (BCO) is the entity with ownership or a beneficial interest in transported goods. While not always the shipper, the BCO reaps the benefits of the cargo's arrival. \nA bill of lading (B/L) is a legal document issued by a carrier or its agent to acknowledge receipt of goods for shipment. It serves as a contract between the shipper (seller) and the carrier (transport provider), detailing the terms and conditions of transportation, including the type, quantity, and destination of the goods.\nBlank sailing is a term used to describe the situation when a shipping line cancels a scheduled port call or an entire voyage. This can happen for various reasons, such as low demand for shipping services, operational issues, or unforeseen circumstances like bad weather or port congestion.\nA blind shipment refers to a logistics practice where certain details about the shipment, such as the sender, receiver, or contents, are intentionally obscured or withheld from one or both parties involved in the transaction. This is typically done to maintain confidentiality or to prevent competitors from obtaining sensitive information about suppliers, customers, or pricing.\nA bonded warehouse is a secured facility authorized by customs authorities where imported goods can be stored, manipulated, or undergo manufacturing operations without payment of duty.\nA booking confirmation is a document that verifies the reservation of space for cargo on a carrier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vessel, flight, or truck, ensuring all shipping arrangements are approved and scheduled.\nA request for reservation of space and equipment for a particular vessel/voyage and possibly inland transport.\nBreak bulk cargo refers to goods that are individually packaged or bundled, rather than being transported in containers or in bulk. These items are often large or irregular in size and include products like machinery, vehicles, construction materials, or heavy equipment. \nBuffer stock, also known as inventory buffer or stock buffer, refers to the extra inventory held by a company to mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by uncertainties in supply and demand. It acts as a cushion against fluctuations in customer demand, supply chain disruptions, and variations in lead times.\nBulk cargo refers to commodities that are transported unpackaged in large quantities, typically stored and handled in bulk form, rather than in individual units or containers. This category of cargo is crucial in global trade, especially for goods that are homogeneous and not easily damaged during transportation.\nThe bullwhip effect, also known as demand amplification or whiplash effect, is a phenomenon that occurs in supply chains where small fluctuations in demand at the consumer level lead to exaggerated fluctuations in demand further upstream in the supply chain. This amplification of demand variability causes inefficiencies, such as excess inventory, stockouts, and increased costs, as supply chain partners overreact to perceived demand changes.\nCIF, or Cost, Insurance, and Freight, is an international shipping agreement used in the transportation of goods. In freight shipping, CIF means that the seller takes responsibility for the cost of transporting goods to the buyer's destination port. This includes paying for shipping, handling, and insurance. The seller's obligations end when the goods reach the destination port, at which point the buyer assumes responsibility for customs clearance, import duties, and any further transport to their final destination.\nA Capesize ship is a large bulk carrier vessel designed to transport heavy raw materials across long distances, too large to transit through canals like the Panama or Suez.\nThe action of allowing cargo to leave the container yard typically authorized by the carrier. This is often confused with gate-out, but cargo release is the authorization necessary before shipments can be allowed to gate-out.\nA cargo survey is an inspection process that assesses the condition and quantity of goods during transportation to ensure compliance with shipping terms and prevent disputes.\nA shipping carrier is an organization that provides transportation services for goods. They manage the logistics of moving cargo, which includes loading, transporting, and delivering goods to the specified location. Shipping carriers handle various types of shipments, from small packages to large freight consignments, using different modes of transportation such as maritime, air, rail, and road.\nCarrier haulage refers to a transportation arrangement where the carrier, typically the ocean shipping line or its designated transport provider, is responsible for arranging and paying for the inland transportation of containers. In this scenario, the carrier takes charge of moving the container from the port of discharge to the final destination or vice versa, using their own transportation assets or subcontracted carriers.\nA carrier scorecard is a performance measurement tool used by supply chain and logistics professionals to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of their freight carriers. It provides a standardized way to assess carriers based on various performance metrics, helping organizations make informed decisions about their logistics partners\nA certificate of origin is a document issued by an authorized body or organization that certifies the country in which the goods being shipped were manufactured, produced, or processed. It serves as a declaration by the exporter to the customs authorities of the importing country, providing information about the origin of the goods and facilitating trade by ensuring compliance with trade agreements, tariffs, and regulations.\nA commercial invoice is a crucial document used in international trade transactions to provide details of the goods being shipped and their corresponding value. It serves as a formal request for payment from the buyer to the seller and is essential for customs clearance and regulatory compliance.\nIn shipping, a commodity refers to bulk goods or raw materials that are transported in large volumes as part of global trade.\nIn the realm of supply chain and logistics, the term \"Consignee\" refers to the individual, company, or entity to whom a shipment of goods is delivered. The consignee is the designated recipient or receiver of the goods, typically identified by name and address on shipping documents such as the bill of lading or delivery order.\nConsignment inventory is a supply chain arrangement where a supplier (consignor) retains ownership of goods while they are held at a customer's (consignee's) location. The consignee only pays for the goods when they are sold or consumed, and the supplier retains responsibility for managing and replenishing the inventory as needed.\nIn shipping and logistics, a consignor refers to the entity or person who is the sender or shipper of goods. The consignor is responsible for initiating the shipment of goods from one location to another, typically to a consignee or recipient.\nA container depot is a facility used for the storage, maintenance, and repair of empty shipping containers when they are not actively in use for transportation.\nContainer discharge is the process of unloading shipping containers from a vessel at a port, using cranes and other equipment, for onward transportation.\nA container freight station (CFS) is a designated facility where goods are received, sorted, and prepared for onward transportation, enhancing efficiency in logistics operations.\nShipping container grades classify containers based on their condition and suitability for transporting goods, ranging from cargo-worthy to as-is quality.\nA container packing certificate is a document that verifies the proper packing and loading of goods into a shipping container. It attests that the contents have been securely packed, arranged, and secured according to industry standards and regulatory requirements. Obtaining a container packing certificate is crucial for compliance with international shipping regulations and contractual obligations. It provides assurance that the goods have been properly prepared for transport, minimizing the risk of delays, damages, or disputes during the shipment process.\nA container rollover occurs when a shipping container is not loaded onto its scheduled vessel and is instead 'rolled over' to a subsequent vessel. This delay means the container misses its intended departure and must wait for the next available sailing, which can significantly impact lead times and delivery schedules.\nContainer stripping (devanning) is the process of unloading cargo from a shipping container at its destination for inspection, storage, or further distribution.\nContainer stuffing is the process of loading cargo into a shipping container in a safe and space-efficient manner for transportation.\nCross docking is a logistics strategy where incoming goods from suppliers are unloaded from incoming trucks or containers and directly loaded onto outbound trucks or trailers, with minimal or no storage time in between. Essentially, it involves transferring goods directly from the inbound dock to the outbound dock, bypassing the need for traditional warehousing storage.\nA customs broker is a licensed professional who specializes in facilitating the clearance of goods through customs barriers for importers and exporters. Acting as intermediaries between businesses and customs authorities, customs brokers ensure compliance with regulations and smooth passage of goods across international borders.\nCustoms clearance refers to the process of fulfilling the legal requirements necessary to facilitate the import or export of goods across international borders. This procedure ensures that shipments comply with local laws and regulations, allowing them to enter or leave a country legally. It involves various documentation, inspections, and payments of duties and taxes.\nA customs manifest lists in detail all the bills of lading issued by a carrier, its agent or master for a specific voyage and port call. It is a detailed summary of the total cargo of a vessel and is used principally for customs purposes. It acts as a declaration to customs authorities, ensuring compliance with regulations and facilitating smooth movement of goods through ports and checkpoints.\nThe latest point in time where a container has to be delivered to a terminal to be loaded on a vessel, or where certain documentation has to be provided by the Shipper.Example: CY cut-off, FCL cut-off, VGM cut-off, DG cut-off.\nCycle counting is a methodical approach to inventory management where a subset of inventory is counted on a continuous basis, typically throughout the year. Unlike traditional annual or periodic inventory counts that halt operations, cycle counting allows businesses to maintain regular operations while ensuring accurate stock levels.\nDAP, or Delivered At Place, is a term used in international trade that specifies the seller's obligation to deliver goods to a designated location in the buyer's country. In DAP terms, the seller is responsible for all costs and risks associated with delivering the goods to the agreed-upon destination. This includes arranging transportation, handling charges, and insurance up to the point of delivery. The buyer, however, is responsible for unloading the goods, handling customs clearance, and paying any import duties and taxes once the goods arrive at the destination.\nDDP (Delivered Duty Paid) shipping terms dictate that the seller assumes all responsibilities and costs associated with delivering the goods to the buyer's specified destination. This includes transportation, insurance, handling charges, and import duties and taxes. Essentially, the seller handles everything from the point of origin to the final delivery location, ensuring the goods arrive ready for use by the buyer without any additional costs or logistical burdens.\nDDU, or Delivered Duty Unpaid, is an international shipping term that defines the responsibilities of the seller and buyer. Under DDU terms, the seller delivers the goods to a specified destination in the buyer's country, covering all costs and risks associated with transportation, except for duties, taxes, and other import charges which are the responsibility of the buyer. The seller's obligations include arranging and paying for freight, insurance, and handling charges until the goods reach the agreed-upon place.\nDPU, or Delivered at Place Unloaded, is a term used in international trade that specifies the seller's responsibility to deliver and unload goods at a designated location in the buyer's country. Under DPU terms, the seller bears all costs and risks associated with transporting and unloading the goods at the agreed destination. This includes all transportation costs, including freight, insurance, and handling charges, up to and including the unloading of the goods at the destination. The buyer then takes over responsibility for import duties, taxes, customs clearance, and any further transport to the final destination. \nA dangerous goods declaration (DGD) is a legal document required for the transportation of hazardous materials or dangerous goods by air, sea, road, or rail. It provides detailed information about the nature, classification, packaging, and handling requirements of the dangerous goods being transported. The DGD helps ensure compliance with international regulations and facilitates the safe handling and transport of hazardous materials throughout the supply chain.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008dDeadheading is the practice of operating a commercial vehicle, such as a truck or a trailer, without any cargo or paying passengers. Essentially, it refers to the movement of a vehicle while it is empty, either on its way to pick up a load or after delivering a load to its destination.\nDeadweight tonnage (DWT) is a measure of a ship's carrying capacity, representing the total weight of cargo, fuel, crew, provisions, and other materials that the vessel can safely carry. \nDemurrage refers to the additional charges imposed on the owner or operator of a vessel, freight car, or truck for delaying the use of equipment or facilities beyond the agreed-upon time. In the context of maritime shipping, demurrage applies to the time that cargo remains at the port or terminal beyond the allotted free time for loading or unloading.\nDetention charges are fees incurred when a carrier's equipment, such as containers or trailers, is held beyond the agreed-upon free time at a facility, such as a port, terminal, or warehouse. These charges compensate the carrier for the additional time their equipment is detained and unavailable for other use.\nA supply chain digital twin replicates the entire supply chain network, including assets, facilities, products, and processes, in a digital environment. It enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and simulation of supply chain operations to improve efficiency, optimize decision-making, and mitigate risks.\nDimensional weight, also known as volumetric weight, is a pricing technique used by shipping carriers to calculate the cost of shipping packages based on their volume rather than just their actual weight. This method helps carriers account for the space that a package occupies in relation to its weight, ensuring fair pricing for shipping services.\nA dock receipt is a logistics document issued by a carrier or its agent to acknowledge the receipt of goods at a shipping dock or terminal for transportation. It serves as a temporary receipt until the goods are loaded onto a vessel or other mode of transportation for shipment to their destination. The dock receipt contains essential information about the cargo, such as the quantity, description, condition, and destination, along with details about the carrier, shipper, and consignee.\nA ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s draft (draught) measures the depth of the vessel below the waterline, which determines the minimum water depth required for safe navigation.\n\nDrayage refers to the transportation of goods over a short distance, typically within the same metropolitan area or between nearby facilities. It plays a crucial role in the logistics and supply chain industry, linking various points in the transportation network, such as ports, rail terminals, and distribution centers. Drayage often involves moving goods from a transportation hub like a port to a nearby warehouse or vice versa.\nDrop shipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product using the drop shipping model, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer.\nDry bulk cargo refers to unpackaged, loose commodities that are shipped in large quantities and typically consist of raw materials. These goods are usually loaded directly into the holds of a vessel without any packaging, making them different from containerized or break bulk cargo. \nA booking received via Electronic Data Interchange, a standard electronic format for exchanging business documents within the supply chain, such as purchase orders, invoices, shipping notices, and other transactional information.\nAn Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number is a unique identifier assigned to businesses engaged in international trade within the European Union (EU) and certain other countries. It serves as a means of tracking and identifying entities involved in import, export, and other customs-related activities.\nIn shipping, ETA refers to the anticipated arrival time of a vessel, truck, or aircraft at a specified port or delivery location. It is calculated based on various factors such as the departure time, transit duration, and any potential delays due to weather, customs, or other unforeseen circumstances. This prediction helps logistics professionals plan and coordinate the movement of goods, ensuring timely deliveries and efficient supply chain management.\nEXW, or Ex Works, is one of the Incoterms (International Commercial Terms) published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). It defines the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international transactions. Under EXW terms, the seller fulfills their obligation by making the goods available for pickup at their premises (factory, warehouse, etc.). The buyer assumes all risks and costs associated with transporting the goods from the seller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s location to the final destination.\nEconomic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a fundamental concept in inventory management that determines the optimal quantity of goods a company should order to minimize total inventory costs. It balances the costs of holding inventory (holding costs) and the costs of ordering inventory (ordering costs) to find the most cost-effective quantity to order at any given time.\nAn Electronic Product Code (EPC) is a unique identifier used to distinguish individual items, cases, or pallets in the supply chain. It serves as a digital identifier that provides a standardized way to track and manage products throughout their lifecycle, from manufacturing to distribution to retail.\nUsed for storing cargo in/on during transport. The equipment \"size/type\" is defined by the ISO 6346 code. The most common equipment size/type is 20'/40'/45' Dry Freight Container, but a number of different versions exist.\nConfirmation & receipt of the equipment loaded/discharged on a vessel during a port call. This information is recorded by the terminal operator and sent to the carrier. This is often done using the EDI message - COARRI. The COARRI message reports that the equipment specified have been discharged from a seagoing vessel (discharged as ordered, over landed or short landed), or have been loaded into a seagoing vessel.\nA shipping exception is an unexpected event or disruption that causes a shipment to deviate from its planned delivery schedule.\nExpedited freight refers to a specialized service in logistics and supply chain management aimed at transporting goods quickly and efficiently to meet tight delivery deadlines. It is used when standard shipping methods cannot meet the required delivery timeframe, typically due to urgent customer needs, production delays, or unforeseen circumstances.\n\nFAS, or Free Alongside Ship, is a shipping term used in international trade that specifies the seller's responsibilities and costs up to the point where goods are placed alongside the buyer's vessel at the designated port of shipment. The buyer then assumes all risks and costs from that point forward.\nFCA, or Free Carrier, is an Incoterm (International Commercial Term) used in international trade to define the point at which the seller's obligations are fulfilled and the buyer assumes responsibility for the goods. Under FCA, the seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, to the carrier or another party nominated by the buyer at a specified place. \nFCL (Full Container Load) freight involves shipping an entire container for a single shipper, offering faster and more secure transport, especially for large-volume cargo.\nFOB, or Free on Board, is a term used in international trade to indicate when ownership and liability for goods transfer from the seller to the buyer. It specifies the point at which the seller is no longer responsible for the goods. This term is crucial for determining who pays for shipping, insurance, and other logistics costs, as well as who bears the risk during transit.\nAn entity operating a feeder service - ref. Feeder vessel.\nA container feeder vessel, also known as a feeder ship, is a relatively small cargo vessel that is specifically designed for transporting containers between smaller ports or terminals to larger hub ports where mainline vessels operate. These vessels serve as a crucial link in the global shipping network by facilitating the distribution of cargo to and from regional ports that may not be accessible to larger ships due to navigational constraints or limited infrastructure.\n\nA Feedermax container ship is a medium-sized vessel used to transport containers between regional ports and major ports, connecting smaller markets to global shipping routes.\nFill rate in supply chain management refers to the measurement of how fully customer demand for a product or service is met through the availability of inventory. It indicates the percentage of customer orders or demand that can be fulfilled immediately from stock, without backorders or delays.\nA \"Flag of Convenience\" (FOC) refers to the practice of a ship's owner registering a merchant vessel in a country other than the owner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s country of origin to benefit from more favorable regulations, often related to taxes, labor laws, and safety standards. This practice allows shipowners to operate under less stringent regulations, often reducing operational costs and increasing profitability. However, FOC can also lead to concerns about safety, environmental standards, and working conditions for crew members, as the regulatory oversight in these flag states might not be as rigorous.\n4PL, or Fourth Party Logistics, refers to a logistics model where a single organization, known as the fourth-party logistics provider, takes on the responsibility of managing and coordinating the entire supply chain on behalf of the client. Unlike traditional third-party logistics (3PL) providers, who primarily handle specific logistics functions, 4PL providers offer comprehensive end-to-end supply chain management services. 4PL providers act as strategic partners, overseeing multiple 3PLs and other service providers to optimize supply chain operations, enhance efficiency, and achieve cost savings for their clients.\nA free trade zone (FTZ) is a designated area within a country where goods can be imported, stored, manufactured, or exported without being subject to the usual customs duties and tariffs. \nA freight forwarder is a vital link in the supply chain, specializing in the coordination and management of international shipments. Acting as an intermediary between shippers and carriers, freight forwarders handle various logistics tasks such as booking cargo space, arranging transportation, preparing documentation, and managing customs clearance.\nFreight visibility (also called shipment visibility) refers to the ability of supply chain professionals to track and monitor the movement of freight shipments throughout the supply chain. It involves gaining real-time insights into the location and status of goods as they move through various transportation modes and stages of the logistics process.\n\nFull truckload (FTL) freight refers to shipments that occupy the entire capacity of a truck trailer. Unlike less than truckload (LTL) shipments, FTL shipments do not share space with other cargo, allowing for direct transportation from the point of origin to the destination without intermediate stops.\nThe GLEC (Global Logistics Emissions Council) framework is a globally recognized standard developed to measure and report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from logistics activities. It provides guidelines and best practices for calculating emissions across various modes of transport, including road, rail, sea, and air. \nThe action of moving a container from a container yard, a terminal or another restricted/controlled area.\nThe German Supply Chain Act, also known as Lieferkettengesetz, is a landmark legislation enacted to promote corporate social responsibility and ensure ethical practices throughout global supply chains. Introduced in 2021, the law applies to German companies with over 3,000 employees, requiring them to monitor and address human rights abuses, environmental violations, and labor standards in their supply chains.\nA Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) is a unique identifier assigned to products in the supply chain to facilitate efficient tracking and management from production to point of sale. It provides a standardized method for identifying items globally, ensuring accurate inventory control, and enabling seamless transactions between trading partners.\n\nA Goods Receipt Note (GRN) is a document used in the process of confirming the receipt of goods from a supplier or vendor. It serves as an acknowledgment by the receiving party, typically a warehouse or a buyer, that the goods specified in the accompanying purchase order have been received in satisfactory condition. \nGreen logistics refers to the process of minimizing the environmental impact of logistics and supply chain activities, including transportation, warehousing, packaging, and distribution.\nA Handysize ship is a small to medium-sized bulk carrier designed for transporting various cargo types, capable of navigating smaller ports and shallow waters.\nGear used to do inland transportation of a container. This can include tools and apparatus used to load/discharge the container onto the intermodal type.\nSpecifications for a haulier set by a carrier in regards to a specific work order, e.g. timeline, capabilities.\nThe joint term for merchant and carrier haulage. It should be noted that a shipment can have several types of haulage throughout the transport from origin to destination.\nA haulier, also known as a trucking company or a carrier, is a business or individual that transports goods by road using trucks or lorries. Hauliers play a vital role in the transportation industry, moving goods between locations such as warehouses, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, ports, and retail stores. \nA House Bill of Lading (HBL) is a transportation document issued by a freight forwarder or Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC) to acknowledge receipt of goods for shipment. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper and the carrier and includes details such as the type, quantity, and destination of the goods being transported. \nIn supply chain logistics, a hub and spoke model refers to a system where goods or services are transported through a central hub to various spoke locations. The hub acts as a central point for collection, sorting, and distribution, while the spokes represent the routes connecting the hub to different destinations.\nPort Congestion Holds Steady at Major Hubs as Mid-Sized Ports Struggle \nPort congestion is an inevitable consequence of typhoons and hurricanes, geopolitical disruption in the Red Sea and USEC labor action.\nFollowing similar events in Bangladesh in August, both Ningbo and Shanghai ports were forced to halt operations due to Typhoon Bebinca in September. But XL ports (those with an annual throughput greater than 10M TEU) have proven their resilience and ability to absorb much of the impact of such events. Despite the weather related disruptions, both Ningbo and Shanghai ports recorded lower average vessel anchor and container dwell times in September compared to August.\nMedium sized ports, however, are more likely to be feeling the effects of the endless series of supply chain crises. Average anchor times at ports with annual throughput between 500,000 and 4,000,000 TEU consistently see average vessel anchor times in excess of their larger counterparts. In September, seven of the ten most congested ports (by anchor time) fall into this category. These ports also see more volatility in congestion levels. Looking at the difference between the min and max monthly average anchor times over the past six months, medium sized ports occupy the top three spots: Charleston (3.5 days), Chittagong (3.0 days) and Durban (2.8 days).\u00c2\u00a0\nVessel Anchor Times: September 2024\nNo XL ports reported average anchor times of more than half a day. Among the world's largest ports, Shanghai and Jebel Ali reported the longest average vessel waiting time at 0.4 days each.\u00c2\u00a0\nAmong large ports (4-10M\u00c2\u00a0TEU), Santos added nearly half a day to average anchor times, continuing a trend of worsening conditions at Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest container port. Manila registered a minor improvement but remains far more congested than competing Southeast Asian ports.\u00c2\u00a0\nVancouver (+1.1 days) was the only port to see average anchor times increase by more than a day in September. Houston (+0.5 days), Santos (+0.5 days), Charleston (+0.4 days) and Colombo (+0.4 days) registered the next biggest month-on-month increases. Notably, Chittagong shaved two days off average wait times following the floods and civic action that plagued operations in July and August.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average vessel anchor time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Santos (Brazil)\n\u00a02.5\n\u00a0 +0.5\n\u00a0Manila (Philippines)\n\u00a02.2\n\u00a0-0.1\n\u00a0Savannah (USA)\n\u00a01.1\n\u00a0-0.1\n\u00a0Piraeus (Greece)\n\u00a00.8\n\u00a0NC\n\u00a0Colombo (Sri Lanka)\n\u00a00.5\n\u00a0+0.4\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average vessel anchor time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Durban (South Africa)\n\u00a02.8\n\u00a0 +0.3\n\u00a0Chittagong (Bangladesh)\n\u00a01.9\n\u00a0-2.0\n\u00a0Vancouver (Canada)\n\u00a01.7\n\u00a0+1.1\n\u00a0Lom\u00e9 (Togo)\n\u00a00.9\n\u00a0-0.2\n\u00a0Tema (Ghana)\n\u00a00.9\n\u00a0NC\nContainer Dwell Times: September 2024\nLooking at congestion on the ground, average container dwell times exceeded seven days at 14 of 78 analyzed ports.\u00c2\u00a0\nMedium volume ports in Djibouti (10.0 days), Chittagong (9.3 days) and Guayaquil (8.6 days), took the top three spots. Long Beach recorded the longest container dwell times of North American ports at 8.6 days, while Piraeus topped European ports with 8.5 days.\nXL ports again showed their class with none of the 13 analyzed ports reporting average container dwell times in excess of five days. In fact, Singapore reported the third lowest container dwell times of all 78 ports, at 2.3 days. Shekou, Melbourne, Tanjung Perak and Sydney joined Singapore in the five ports with the lowest average container dwell times in September.\u00c2\u00a0\nOsaka (+4.5 days), Mombasa (+3.0 days), Kobe (+3.0 days), Tanger Med (+2.8 days) and Guayaquil (+2.4 days) recorded the largest month-on-month increases in average container dwell times.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average container dwell time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Long Beach (USA)\n\u00a08.6\n\u00a0+0.1\n\u00a0Piraeus (Greece)\n\u00a08.5\n\u00a0+1.5\n\u00a0Col\u00f3n (Panama)\n\u00a08.4\n\u00a0-0.3\n\u00a0Hai Phong (Vietnam)\n\u00a07.9\n\u00a0+1.6\n\u00a0Tanger Med (Morocco)\n\u00a07.8\n\u00a0+2.8\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average container dwell time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Djibouti (Djibouti)\n\u00a010.0\n\u00a0NC\n\u00a0Chittagong (Bangladesh)\n\u00a09.3\n\u00a0-3.4\n\u00a0Guayaquil (Ecuador)\n\u00a08.6\n\u00a0+2.4\n\u00a0Tema (Ghana)\n\u00a08.4\n\u00a0+0.1\n\u00a0Kingston (Jamaica)\n\u00a07.8\n\u00a0-0.1\nHow We Analyze Port Congestion\nOur port congestion index monitors three key indicators of port congestion. No single factor gives a complete picture of port congestion, but taken collectively these metrics can provide insight into how ports around the world are able to cope with supply chain pressures. \u00e2\u0080\u008d\nAnchor times provide insight into harbor congestion by measuring how long vessels are waiting, on average, before they are able to berth at a port. \n\u00e2\u0080\u008dBerth times provide insight into the time it takes for vessels to be unloaded and loaded. While larger ports typically have longer berth times due to handling larger vessels, looking at changes in berth times month over month can give insight into ports that may be dealing with operational issues. \nWhile the first two factors look at the time it takes for vessels to move through the port, container dwell times give insight into how well ports are facilitating the movement of goods out of the yard and onwards to their final destinations. \nContinue reading\nIn Numbers: The Impact of the Red Sea Crisis on European & Asian Port Congestion\nWebinar Recap: Enhancing Supply Chain Collaboration Through Visibility\nThe Busiest Container Ports in the World\nSubscribe for the latest in supply chain technology.\n"

      "\nIn this article\nABC Analysis is a method used in supply chain management to categorize inventory into three groups\u00e2\u0080\u0094A, B, and C\u00e2\u0080\u0094based on their importance. This classification helps businesses prioritize their resources and focus on the most critical items.\nAn Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN), sometimes referred to as Advance Ship Notice, is a notification sent by a supplier or manufacturer to a customer or retailer to provide detailed information about a pending shipment. The ASN serves as an electronic document that outlines the contents of the shipment before it physically arrives at the destination. \nAn agile supply chain is a flexible and responsive approach to supply chain management that enables organizations to quickly adapt to changing market conditions, customer demands, and disruptions. It focuses on enhancing speed, efficiency, and adaptability throughout the entire supply chain process, from sourcing raw materials to delivering finished products to customers.\nAn air waybill (AWB) is a vital logistics document used in air freight transportation. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper (consignor) and the airline (carrier), detailing the terms and conditions of air transportation for the shipment. The air waybill contains essential information such as the origin and destination of the cargo, the description of goods, the weight, and the freight charges.\nAn arrival notice is a notification sent by a carrier or freight forwarder to inform consignees or recipients that a shipment has arrived at its destination port or facility. This notice serves as an important communication tool in the supply chain, providing recipients with essential information about the arrival of their goods and detailing the next steps for delivery or pickup.\nAn Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a tracking system used in the maritime industry to monitor the location and movement of ships. AIS provides real-time information about vessel identification, position, course, and speed. \n\u00e2\u0080\u008dBackhauling is a transportation logistics practice where trucks carry a return load on their way back from delivering goods to their destination. Instead of returning empty, trucks utilize their empty space to transport goods from the destination back to the point of origin or another destination along the route. \nIn supply chain management, \"backorder\" refers to a situation where a customer places an order for a product that is temporarily unavailable in the seller's inventory. When an item is on backorder, it means the customer's order cannot be fulfilled immediately due to insufficient stock levels.\n\nA bay plan is a diagram that details the stowage of containers on a vessel, specifying their exact position by bay, row, and tier to ensure efficient and safe loading and unloading operations.\nA Beneficial Cargo Owner (BCO) is the entity with ownership or a beneficial interest in transported goods. While not always the shipper, the BCO reaps the benefits of the cargo's arrival. \nA bill of lading (B/L) is a legal document issued by a carrier or its agent to acknowledge receipt of goods for shipment. It serves as a contract between the shipper (seller) and the carrier (transport provider), detailing the terms and conditions of transportation, including the type, quantity, and destination of the goods.\nBlank sailing is a term used to describe the situation when a shipping line cancels a scheduled port call or an entire voyage. This can happen for various reasons, such as low demand for shipping services, operational issues, or unforeseen circumstances like bad weather or port congestion.\nA blind shipment refers to a logistics practice where certain details about the shipment, such as the sender, receiver, or contents, are intentionally obscured or withheld from one or both parties involved in the transaction. This is typically done to maintain confidentiality or to prevent competitors from obtaining sensitive information about suppliers, customers, or pricing.\nA bonded warehouse is a secured facility authorized by customs authorities where imported goods can be stored, manipulated, or undergo manufacturing operations without payment of duty.\nA booking confirmation is a document that verifies the reservation of space for cargo on a carrier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vessel, flight, or truck, ensuring all shipping arrangements are approved and scheduled.\nA request for reservation of space and equipment for a particular vessel/voyage and possibly inland transport.\nBreak bulk cargo refers to goods that are individually packaged or bundled, rather than being transported in containers or in bulk. These items are often large or irregular in size and include products like machinery, vehicles, construction materials, or heavy equipment. \nBuffer stock, also known as inventory buffer or stock buffer, refers to the extra inventory held by a company to mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by uncertainties in supply and demand. It acts as a cushion against fluctuations in customer demand, supply chain disruptions, and variations in lead times.\nBulk cargo refers to commodities that are transported unpackaged in large quantities, typically stored and handled in bulk form, rather than in individual units or containers. This category of cargo is crucial in global trade, especially for goods that are homogeneous and not easily damaged during transportation.\nThe bullwhip effect, also known as demand amplification or whiplash effect, is a phenomenon that occurs in supply chains where small fluctuations in demand at the consumer level lead to exaggerated fluctuations in demand further upstream in the supply chain. This amplification of demand variability causes inefficiencies, such as excess inventory, stockouts, and increased costs, as supply chain partners overreact to perceived demand changes.\nCIF, or Cost, Insurance, and Freight, is an international shipping agreement used in the transportation of goods. In freight shipping, CIF means that the seller takes responsibility for the cost of transporting goods to the buyer's destination port. This includes paying for shipping, handling, and insurance. The seller's obligations end when the goods reach the destination port, at which point the buyer assumes responsibility for customs clearance, import duties, and any further transport to their final destination.\nA Capesize ship is a large bulk carrier vessel designed to transport heavy raw materials across long distances, too large to transit through canals like the Panama or Suez.\nThe action of allowing cargo to leave the container yard typically authorized by the carrier. This is often confused with gate-out, but cargo release is the authorization necessary before shipments can be allowed to gate-out.\nA cargo survey is an inspection process that assesses the condition and quantity of goods during transportation to ensure compliance with shipping terms and prevent disputes.\nA shipping carrier is an organization that provides transportation services for goods. They manage the logistics of moving cargo, which includes loading, transporting, and delivering goods to the specified location. Shipping carriers handle various types of shipments, from small packages to large freight consignments, using different modes of transportation such as maritime, air, rail, and road.\nCarrier haulage refers to a transportation arrangement where the carrier, typically the ocean shipping line or its designated transport provider, is responsible for arranging and paying for the inland transportation of containers. In this scenario, the carrier takes charge of moving the container from the port of discharge to the final destination or vice versa, using their own transportation assets or subcontracted carriers.\nA carrier scorecard is a performance measurement tool used by supply chain and logistics professionals to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of their freight carriers. It provides a standardized way to assess carriers based on various performance metrics, helping organizations make informed decisions about their logistics partners\nA certificate of origin is a document issued by an authorized body or organization that certifies the country in which the goods being shipped were manufactured, produced, or processed. It serves as a declaration by the exporter to the customs authorities of the importing country, providing information about the origin of the goods and facilitating trade by ensuring compliance with trade agreements, tariffs, and regulations.\nA commercial invoice is a crucial document used in international trade transactions to provide details of the goods being shipped and their corresponding value. It serves as a formal request for payment from the buyer to the seller and is essential for customs clearance and regulatory compliance.\nIn shipping, a commodity refers to bulk goods or raw materials that are transported in large volumes as part of global trade.\nIn the realm of supply chain and logistics, the term \"Consignee\" refers to the individual, company, or entity to whom a shipment of goods is delivered. The consignee is the designated recipient or receiver of the goods, typically identified by name and address on shipping documents such as the bill of lading or delivery order.\nConsignment inventory is a supply chain arrangement where a supplier (consignor) retains ownership of goods while they are held at a customer's (consignee's) location. The consignee only pays for the goods when they are sold or consumed, and the supplier retains responsibility for managing and replenishing the inventory as needed.\nIn shipping and logistics, a consignor refers to the entity or person who is the sender or shipper of goods. The consignor is responsible for initiating the shipment of goods from one location to another, typically to a consignee or recipient.\nA container depot is a facility used for the storage, maintenance, and repair of empty shipping containers when they are not actively in use for transportation.\nContainer discharge is the process of unloading shipping containers from a vessel at a port, using cranes and other equipment, for onward transportation.\nA container freight station (CFS) is a designated facility where goods are received, sorted, and prepared for onward transportation, enhancing efficiency in logistics operations.\nShipping container grades classify containers based on their condition and suitability for transporting goods, ranging from cargo-worthy to as-is quality.\nA container packing certificate is a document that verifies the proper packing and loading of goods into a shipping container. It attests that the contents have been securely packed, arranged, and secured according to industry standards and regulatory requirements. Obtaining a container packing certificate is crucial for compliance with international shipping regulations and contractual obligations. It provides assurance that the goods have been properly prepared for transport, minimizing the risk of delays, damages, or disputes during the shipment process.\nA container rollover occurs when a shipping container is not loaded onto its scheduled vessel and is instead 'rolled over' to a subsequent vessel. This delay means the container misses its intended departure and must wait for the next available sailing, which can significantly impact lead times and delivery schedules.\nContainer stripping (devanning) is the process of unloading cargo from a shipping container at its destination for inspection, storage, or further distribution.\nContainer stuffing is the process of loading cargo into a shipping container in a safe and space-efficient manner for transportation.\nCross docking is a logistics strategy where incoming goods from suppliers are unloaded from incoming trucks or containers and directly loaded onto outbound trucks or trailers, with minimal or no storage time in between. Essentially, it involves transferring goods directly from the inbound dock to the outbound dock, bypassing the need for traditional warehousing storage.\nA customs broker is a licensed professional who specializes in facilitating the clearance of goods through customs barriers for importers and exporters. Acting as intermediaries between businesses and customs authorities, customs brokers ensure compliance with regulations and smooth passage of goods across international borders.\nCustoms clearance refers to the process of fulfilling the legal requirements necessary to facilitate the import or export of goods across international borders. This procedure ensures that shipments comply with local laws and regulations, allowing them to enter or leave a country legally. It involves various documentation, inspections, and payments of duties and taxes.\nA customs manifest lists in detail all the bills of lading issued by a carrier, its agent or master for a specific voyage and port call. It is a detailed summary of the total cargo of a vessel and is used principally for customs purposes. It acts as a declaration to customs authorities, ensuring compliance with regulations and facilitating smooth movement of goods through ports and checkpoints.\nThe latest point in time where a container has to be delivered to a terminal to be loaded on a vessel, or where certain documentation has to be provided by the Shipper.Example: CY cut-off, FCL cut-off, VGM cut-off, DG cut-off.\nCycle counting is a methodical approach to inventory management where a subset of inventory is counted on a continuous basis, typically throughout the year. Unlike traditional annual or periodic inventory counts that halt operations, cycle counting allows businesses to maintain regular operations while ensuring accurate stock levels.\nDAP, or Delivered At Place, is a term used in international trade that specifies the seller's obligation to deliver goods to a designated location in the buyer's country. In DAP terms, the seller is responsible for all costs and risks associated with delivering the goods to the agreed-upon destination. This includes arranging transportation, handling charges, and insurance up to the point of delivery. The buyer, however, is responsible for unloading the goods, handling customs clearance, and paying any import duties and taxes once the goods arrive at the destination.\nDDP (Delivered Duty Paid) shipping terms dictate that the seller assumes all responsibilities and costs associated with delivering the goods to the buyer's specified destination. This includes transportation, insurance, handling charges, and import duties and taxes. Essentially, the seller handles everything from the point of origin to the final delivery location, ensuring the goods arrive ready for use by the buyer without any additional costs or logistical burdens.\nDDU, or Delivered Duty Unpaid, is an international shipping term that defines the responsibilities of the seller and buyer. Under DDU terms, the seller delivers the goods to a specified destination in the buyer's country, covering all costs and risks associated with transportation, except for duties, taxes, and other import charges which are the responsibility of the buyer. The seller's obligations include arranging and paying for freight, insurance, and handling charges until the goods reach the agreed-upon place.\nDPU, or Delivered at Place Unloaded, is a term used in international trade that specifies the seller's responsibility to deliver and unload goods at a designated location in the buyer's country. Under DPU terms, the seller bears all costs and risks associated with transporting and unloading the goods at the agreed destination. This includes all transportation costs, including freight, insurance, and handling charges, up to and including the unloading of the goods at the destination. The buyer then takes over responsibility for import duties, taxes, customs clearance, and any further transport to the final destination. \nA dangerous goods declaration (DGD) is a legal document required for the transportation of hazardous materials or dangerous goods by air, sea, road, or rail. It provides detailed information about the nature, classification, packaging, and handling requirements of the dangerous goods being transported. The DGD helps ensure compliance with international regulations and facilitates the safe handling and transport of hazardous materials throughout the supply chain.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008dDeadheading is the practice of operating a commercial vehicle, such as a truck or a trailer, without any cargo or paying passengers. Essentially, it refers to the movement of a vehicle while it is empty, either on its way to pick up a load or after delivering a load to its destination.\nDeadweight tonnage (DWT) is a measure of a ship's carrying capacity, representing the total weight of cargo, fuel, crew, provisions, and other materials that the vessel can safely carry. \nDemurrage refers to the additional charges imposed on the owner or operator of a vessel, freight car, or truck for delaying the use of equipment or facilities beyond the agreed-upon time. In the context of maritime shipping, demurrage applies to the time that cargo remains at the port or terminal beyond the allotted free time for loading or unloading.\nDetention charges are fees incurred when a carrier's equipment, such as containers or trailers, is held beyond the agreed-upon free time at a facility, such as a port, terminal, or warehouse. These charges compensate the carrier for the additional time their equipment is detained and unavailable for other use.\nA supply chain digital twin replicates the entire supply chain network, including assets, facilities, products, and processes, in a digital environment. It enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and simulation of supply chain operations to improve efficiency, optimize decision-making, and mitigate risks.\nDimensional weight, also known as volumetric weight, is a pricing technique used by shipping carriers to calculate the cost of shipping packages based on their volume rather than just their actual weight. This method helps carriers account for the space that a package occupies in relation to its weight, ensuring fair pricing for shipping services.\nA dock receipt is a logistics document issued by a carrier or its agent to acknowledge the receipt of goods at a shipping dock or terminal for transportation. It serves as a temporary receipt until the goods are loaded onto a vessel or other mode of transportation for shipment to their destination. The dock receipt contains essential information about the cargo, such as the quantity, description, condition, and destination, along with details about the carrier, shipper, and consignee.\nA ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s draft (draught) measures the depth of the vessel below the waterline, which determines the minimum water depth required for safe navigation.\n\nDrayage refers to the transportation of goods over a short distance, typically within the same metropolitan area or between nearby facilities. It plays a crucial role in the logistics and supply chain industry, linking various points in the transportation network, such as ports, rail terminals, and distribution centers. Drayage often involves moving goods from a transportation hub like a port to a nearby warehouse or vice versa.\nDrop shipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product using the drop shipping model, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer.\nDry bulk cargo refers to unpackaged, loose commodities that are shipped in large quantities and typically consist of raw materials. These goods are usually loaded directly into the holds of a vessel without any packaging, making them different from containerized or break bulk cargo. \nA booking received via Electronic Data Interchange, a standard electronic format for exchanging business documents within the supply chain, such as purchase orders, invoices, shipping notices, and other transactional information.\nAn Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number is a unique identifier assigned to businesses engaged in international trade within the European Union (EU) and certain other countries. It serves as a means of tracking and identifying entities involved in import, export, and other customs-related activities.\nIn shipping, ETA refers to the anticipated arrival time of a vessel, truck, or aircraft at a specified port or delivery location. It is calculated based on various factors such as the departure time, transit duration, and any potential delays due to weather, customs, or other unforeseen circumstances. This prediction helps logistics professionals plan and coordinate the movement of goods, ensuring timely deliveries and efficient supply chain management.\nEXW, or Ex Works, is one of the Incoterms (International Commercial Terms) published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). It defines the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international transactions. Under EXW terms, the seller fulfills their obligation by making the goods available for pickup at their premises (factory, warehouse, etc.). The buyer assumes all risks and costs associated with transporting the goods from the seller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s location to the final destination.\nEconomic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a fundamental concept in inventory management that determines the optimal quantity of goods a company should order to minimize total inventory costs. It balances the costs of holding inventory (holding costs) and the costs of ordering inventory (ordering costs) to find the most cost-effective quantity to order at any given time.\nAn Electronic Product Code (EPC) is a unique identifier used to distinguish individual items, cases, or pallets in the supply chain. It serves as a digital identifier that provides a standardized way to track and manage products throughout their lifecycle, from manufacturing to distribution to retail.\nUsed for storing cargo in/on during transport. The equipment \"size/type\" is defined by the ISO 6346 code. The most common equipment size/type is 20'/40'/45' Dry Freight Container, but a number of different versions exist.\nConfirmation & receipt of the equipment loaded/discharged on a vessel during a port call. This information is recorded by the terminal operator and sent to the carrier. This is often done using the EDI message - COARRI. The COARRI message reports that the equipment specified have been discharged from a seagoing vessel (discharged as ordered, over landed or short landed), or have been loaded into a seagoing vessel.\nA shipping exception is an unexpected event or disruption that causes a shipment to deviate from its planned delivery schedule.\nExpedited freight refers to a specialized service in logistics and supply chain management aimed at transporting goods quickly and efficiently to meet tight delivery deadlines. It is used when standard shipping methods cannot meet the required delivery timeframe, typically due to urgent customer needs, production delays, or unforeseen circumstances.\n\nFAS, or Free Alongside Ship, is a shipping term used in international trade that specifies the seller's responsibilities and costs up to the point where goods are placed alongside the buyer's vessel at the designated port of shipment. The buyer then assumes all risks and costs from that point forward.\nFCA, or Free Carrier, is an Incoterm (International Commercial Term) used in international trade to define the point at which the seller's obligations are fulfilled and the buyer assumes responsibility for the goods. Under FCA, the seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, to the carrier or another party nominated by the buyer at a specified place. \nFCL (Full Container Load) freight involves shipping an entire container for a single shipper, offering faster and more secure transport, especially for large-volume cargo.\nFOB, or Free on Board, is a term used in international trade to indicate when ownership and liability for goods transfer from the seller to the buyer. It specifies the point at which the seller is no longer responsible for the goods. This term is crucial for determining who pays for shipping, insurance, and other logistics costs, as well as who bears the risk during transit.\nAn entity operating a feeder service - ref. Feeder vessel.\nA container feeder vessel, also known as a feeder ship, is a relatively small cargo vessel that is specifically designed for transporting containers between smaller ports or terminals to larger hub ports where mainline vessels operate. These vessels serve as a crucial link in the global shipping network by facilitating the distribution of cargo to and from regional ports that may not be accessible to larger ships due to navigational constraints or limited infrastructure.\n\nA Feedermax container ship is a medium-sized vessel used to transport containers between regional ports and major ports, connecting smaller markets to global shipping routes.\nFill rate in supply chain management refers to the measurement of how fully customer demand for a product or service is met through the availability of inventory. It indicates the percentage of customer orders or demand that can be fulfilled immediately from stock, without backorders or delays.\nA \"Flag of Convenience\" (FOC) refers to the practice of a ship's owner registering a merchant vessel in a country other than the owner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s country of origin to benefit from more favorable regulations, often related to taxes, labor laws, and safety standards. This practice allows shipowners to operate under less stringent regulations, often reducing operational costs and increasing profitability. However, FOC can also lead to concerns about safety, environmental standards, and working conditions for crew members, as the regulatory oversight in these flag states might not be as rigorous.\n4PL, or Fourth Party Logistics, refers to a logistics model where a single organization, known as the fourth-party logistics provider, takes on the responsibility of managing and coordinating the entire supply chain on behalf of the client. Unlike traditional third-party logistics (3PL) providers, who primarily handle specific logistics functions, 4PL providers offer comprehensive end-to-end supply chain management services. 4PL providers act as strategic partners, overseeing multiple 3PLs and other service providers to optimize supply chain operations, enhance efficiency, and achieve cost savings for their clients.\nA free trade zone (FTZ) is a designated area within a country where goods can be imported, stored, manufactured, or exported without being subject to the usual customs duties and tariffs. \nA freight forwarder is a vital link in the supply chain, specializing in the coordination and management of international shipments. Acting as an intermediary between shippers and carriers, freight forwarders handle various logistics tasks such as booking cargo space, arranging transportation, preparing documentation, and managing customs clearance.\nFreight visibility (also called shipment visibility) refers to the ability of supply chain professionals to track and monitor the movement of freight shipments throughout the supply chain. It involves gaining real-time insights into the location and status of goods as they move through various transportation modes and stages of the logistics process.\n\nFull truckload (FTL) freight refers to shipments that occupy the entire capacity of a truck trailer. Unlike less than truckload (LTL) shipments, FTL shipments do not share space with other cargo, allowing for direct transportation from the point of origin to the destination without intermediate stops.\nThe GLEC (Global Logistics Emissions Council) framework is a globally recognized standard developed to measure and report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from logistics activities. It provides guidelines and best practices for calculating emissions across various modes of transport, including road, rail, sea, and air. \nThe action of moving a container from a container yard, a terminal or another restricted/controlled area.\nThe German Supply Chain Act, also known as Lieferkettengesetz, is a landmark legislation enacted to promote corporate social responsibility and ensure ethical practices throughout global supply chains. Introduced in 2021, the law applies to German companies with over 3,000 employees, requiring them to monitor and address human rights abuses, environmental violations, and labor standards in their supply chains.\nA Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) is a unique identifier assigned to products in the supply chain to facilitate efficient tracking and management from production to point of sale. It provides a standardized method for identifying items globally, ensuring accurate inventory control, and enabling seamless transactions between trading partners.\n\nA Goods Receipt Note (GRN) is a document used in the process of confirming the receipt of goods from a supplier or vendor. It serves as an acknowledgment by the receiving party, typically a warehouse or a buyer, that the goods specified in the accompanying purchase order have been received in satisfactory condition. \nGreen logistics refers to the process of minimizing the environmental impact of logistics and supply chain activities, including transportation, warehousing, packaging, and distribution.\nA Handysize ship is a small to medium-sized bulk carrier designed for transporting various cargo types, capable of navigating smaller ports and shallow waters.\nGear used to do inland transportation of a container. This can include tools and apparatus used to load/discharge the container onto the intermodal type.\nSpecifications for a haulier set by a carrier in regards to a specific work order, e.g. timeline, capabilities.\nThe joint term for merchant and carrier haulage. It should be noted that a shipment can have several types of haulage throughout the transport from origin to destination.\nA haulier, also known as a trucking company or a carrier, is a business or individual that transports goods by road using trucks or lorries. Hauliers play a vital role in the transportation industry, moving goods between locations such as warehouses, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, ports, and retail stores. \nA House Bill of Lading (HBL) is a transportation document issued by a freight forwarder or Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC) to acknowledge receipt of goods for shipment. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper and the carrier and includes details such as the type, quantity, and destination of the goods being transported. \nIn supply chain logistics, a hub and spoke model refers to a system where goods or services are transported through a central hub to various spoke locations. The hub acts as a central point for collection, sorting, and distribution, while the spokes represent the routes connecting the hub to different destinations.\nPort Congestion Holds Steady at Major Hubs as Mid-Sized Ports Struggle \nPort congestion is an inevitable consequence of typhoons and hurricanes, geopolitical disruption in the Red Sea and USEC labor action.\nFollowing similar events in Bangladesh in August, both Ningbo and Shanghai ports were forced to halt operations due to Typhoon Bebinca in September. But XL ports (those with an annual throughput greater than 10M TEU) have proven their resilience and ability to absorb much of the impact of such events. Despite the weather related disruptions, both Ningbo and Shanghai ports recorded lower average vessel anchor and container dwell times in September compared to August.\nMedium sized ports, however, are more likely to be feeling the effects of the endless series of supply chain crises. Average anchor times at ports with annual throughput between 500,000 and 4,000,000 TEU consistently see average vessel anchor times in excess of their larger counterparts. In September, seven of the ten most congested ports (by anchor time) fall into this category. These ports also see more volatility in congestion levels. Looking at the difference between the min and max monthly average anchor times over the past six months, medium sized ports occupy the top three spots: Charleston (3.5 days), Chittagong (3.0 days) and Durban (2.8 days).\u00c2\u00a0\nVessel Anchor Times: September 2024\nNo XL ports reported average anchor times of more than half a day. Among the world's largest ports, Shanghai and Jebel Ali reported the longest average vessel waiting time at 0.4 days each.\u00c2\u00a0\nAmong large ports (4-10M\u00c2\u00a0TEU), Santos added nearly half a day to average anchor times, continuing a trend of worsening conditions at Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest container port. Manila registered a minor improvement but remains far more congested than competing Southeast Asian ports.\u00c2\u00a0\nVancouver (+1.1 days) was the only port to see average anchor times increase by more than a day in September. Houston (+0.5 days), Santos (+0.5 days), Charleston (+0.4 days) and Colombo (+0.4 days) registered the next biggest month-on-month increases. Notably, Chittagong shaved two days off average wait times following the floods and civic action that plagued operations in July and August.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average vessel anchor time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Santos (Brazil)\n\u00a02.5\n\u00a0 +0.5\n\u00a0Manila (Philippines)\n\u00a02.2\n\u00a0-0.1\n\u00a0Savannah (USA)\n\u00a01.1\n\u00a0-0.1\n\u00a0Piraeus (Greece)\n\u00a00.8\n\u00a0NC\n\u00a0Colombo (Sri Lanka)\n\u00a00.5\n\u00a0+0.4\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average vessel anchor time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Durban (South Africa)\n\u00a02.8\n\u00a0 +0.3\n\u00a0Chittagong (Bangladesh)\n\u00a01.9\n\u00a0-2.0\n\u00a0Vancouver (Canada)\n\u00a01.7\n\u00a0+1.1\n\u00a0Lom\u00e9 (Togo)\n\u00a00.9\n\u00a0-0.2\n\u00a0Tema (Ghana)\n\u00a00.9\n\u00a0NC\nContainer Dwell Times: September 2024\nLooking at congestion on the ground, average container dwell times exceeded seven days at 14 of 78 analyzed ports.\u00c2\u00a0\nMedium volume ports in Djibouti (10.0 days), Chittagong (9.3 days) and Guayaquil (8.6 days), took the top three spots. Long Beach recorded the longest container dwell times of North American ports at 8.6 days, while Piraeus topped European ports with 8.5 days.\nXL ports again showed their class with none of the 13 analyzed ports reporting average container dwell times in excess of five days. In fact, Singapore reported the third lowest container dwell times of all 78 ports, at 2.3 days. Shekou, Melbourne, Tanjung Perak and Sydney joined Singapore in the five ports with the lowest average container dwell times in September.\u00c2\u00a0\nOsaka (+4.5 days), Mombasa (+3.0 days), Kobe (+3.0 days), Tanger Med (+2.8 days) and Guayaquil (+2.4 days) recorded the largest month-on-month increases in average container dwell times.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average container dwell time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Long Beach (USA)\n\u00a08.6\n\u00a0+0.1\n\u00a0Piraeus (Greece)\n\u00a08.5\n\u00a0+1.5\n\u00a0Col\u00f3n (Panama)\n\u00a08.4\n\u00a0-0.3\n\u00a0Hai Phong (Vietnam)\n\u00a07.9\n\u00a0+1.6\n\u00a0Tanger Med (Morocco)\n\u00a07.8\n\u00a0+2.8\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average container dwell time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Djibouti (Djibouti)\n\u00a010.0\n\u00a0NC\n\u00a0Chittagong (Bangladesh)\n\u00a09.3\n\u00a0-3.4\n\u00a0Guayaquil (Ecuador)\n\u00a08.6\n\u00a0+2.4\n\u00a0Tema (Ghana)\n\u00a08.4\n\u00a0+0.1\n\u00a0Kingston (Jamaica)\n\u00a07.8\n\u00a0-0.1\nHow We Analyze Port Congestion\nOur port congestion index monitors three key indicators of port congestion. No single factor gives a complete picture of port congestion, but taken collectively these metrics can provide insight into how ports around the world are able to cope with supply chain pressures. \u00e2\u0080\u008d\nAnchor times provide insight into harbor congestion by measuring how long vessels are waiting, on average, before they are able to berth at a port. \n\u00e2\u0080\u008dBerth times provide insight into the time it takes for vessels to be unloaded and loaded. While larger ports typically have longer berth times due to handling larger vessels, looking at changes in berth times month over month can give insight into ports that may be dealing with operational issues. \nWhile the first two factors look at the time it takes for vessels to move through the port, container dwell times give insight into how well ports are facilitating the movement of goods out of the yard and onwards to their final destinations. \nContinue reading\nIn Numbers: The Impact of the Red Sea Crisis on European & Asian Port Congestion\nWebinar Recap: Enhancing Supply Chain Collaboration Through Visibility\nThe Busiest Container Ports in the World\nSubscribe for the latest in supply chain technology.\n"
