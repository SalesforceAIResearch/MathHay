He expects a bottom line for the three months ended in July of 67 cents a share on revenue of $30 billion.\nWall Street forecasts are pointing to a consensus bottom line of 64 cents a share a 137% increase from the last year, with revenues more than doubling to $28.55 billion.\nNvidia told investors in May that current-quarter revenue would rise to around $28 billion, at the time stronger-than-expected estimate assuaged investors' concern about delays for orders of H100 chips tied to the launch of its new Blackwell processors.\nRelated: Goldman Sachs analyst revisits Nvidia stock price target ahead of earnings\nInvestors will focus on reports that delivery of its newly launched line of Blackwell processors, which are meant to be faster, cheaper, and more efficient than its H100 Hopper predecessors, could be delayed due to design flaws.\nAnalysts had forecast Blackwell to start contributing to Nvidia's top-line growth in the third quarter and find their way into global customer data centers by the year's final three months.\nHyperscalers poised to spend big on infrastructure\nThat demand, as well as Nvidia's commanding market share, is predicted to drive the group's data center revenue as high as $150 billion next year, powered largely by this year's Blackwell launch.\nHyperscalers, the major providers of massive data centers and cloud services, are poised to spend around $500 billion over the next two years building out their massive infrastructure, according to estimates from Barclays.\nThe goal is to leverage their massive datasets to enhance sales of everything from drive-through dining to the most complicated pharmaceutical testing.\nStill, some analysts are also starting to question the pace of AI spending from hyperscalers such as Microsoft\u00a0 (MSFT) , Meta Platforms\u00a0 (META) , Amazon\u00a0 (AMZN) , and Google parent Alphabet\u00a0 (GOOGL) \u00a0and the resultant demand for the high-end chips and processors produced by Nvidia.\nRelated: Big names exit Nvidia stock as AI giant stumbles before earnings\nIves at Wedbush says Nvidia's near-term outlook will be crucial for the direction of broader tech stocks, who estimates that \"for every $1 spent on an Nvidia GPU chip there is a $8-$10 multiplier across the sector.\"\nMore AI Stocks:\nAnalyst revisits Microsoft stock price target after AI reporting change\nAnalyst resets Nvidia stock price target before earnings\nAnalysts revise Palo Alto Networks stock price targets after earnings\n\"The stage is set for tech stocks to move higher into year-end and 2025 ... as the Fed gets in position to start its rate cutting cycle, macro soft landing remains the path, and tech spending on AI remains a generational spending cycle just starting to hit the shores of the tech sector,\" Ives said.\nNvidia shares were marked 4.7% higher in early Friday trading to change hands at $129.48, a move that would extend the stock's six-month gain to around 65%.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of pain coming for stocks\nSign in to access your portfolio",

Is It a Buy Right Now?\nKey Points\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\nNvidia's stock has tended to pop after its quarterly earnings are announced.\nNvidia (NVDA -0.72%) has been one of the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks on the market, and for good reason. It has put up incredible growth numbers quarter after quarter lately, and each time, the stock has popped following those reports. With Nvidia's second-quarter FY 2025 results being announced on Aug. 28 after the markets close, investors may want to consider buying Nvidia stock before that date. \nHowever, these results may differ from some of its previous announcements, as year-over-year comparisons are becoming more difficult.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\nThe growth won't be as strong as in previous quarters\nNvidia's rise is tied to its primary product: graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs were developed by Nvidia back in the '90s as devices that could process gaming graphics more efficiently than a CPU. While GPUs excelled in this field, other uses were quickly developed for them.\nBecause a GPU can process multiple calculations in parallel, it is useful for calculation-intensive tasks like engineering simulations, drug discovery, and AI model training. The latter has caused its business to explode, and we'll get a checkup on demand next week when the company releases its most recent quarterly results.\nFor Q2, management told investors to expect $28 billion in revenue. Compared to last year's Q2 sales of $13.5 billion, that represents 107% year over year growth. That would be an impressive jump, but would represent a growth rate slowdown compared to previous quarters.\n\nNVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\nThis slowdown is occurring because we are overlapping the period when AI demand really started to take off. Still, I wouldn't consider a doubling of revenue a disappointment. Additionally, don't be surprised if Nvidia beats that target. It has consistently outperformed its guidance over the past year, and Wall Street analysts are starting to catch on to this trend. From an average of 40 analysts, they collectively think Nviida's Q2 revenue will be $28.5 billion.\nWhile year-over-year revenue growth is an important stat, there are others that I think are more important to consider, with margin at the top of that list.\nNvidia's margin will be important to examine\nNvidia's revenue growth has been nothing short of incredible, but its margin expansion has been even more impressive. With a gross margin near 80% and a profit margin approaching 60%, Nvidia has become one of the most profitable companies ever to trade on the public markets.\n\nNVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts\nWhen the Q2 report comes out, I'll be looking to see if the company has maintained or expanded these elevated levels. If investors see weakness in these margins, it's a sign that Nvidia is facing increased competition and needed to adjust the price of its GPUs to stay competitive in the market.\nI don't expect a margin drop, but if one does occur, don't be surprised if the stock gets slammed immediately after the release of information.\nIs the stock a buy now?\nWith Nvidia expected to report another strong quarter, many investors may wonder if they should invest now, before the report. Investors should first consider that investing success hardly ever comes from trying to time the market and jump in and out at just the right time.\nThey should also consider how expensive the stock is, trading at nearly 46 times forward earnings estimates.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nThe stock has a lot of growth baked into it, and Nvidia will need to report a strong Q2 and give impressive Q3 guidance to justify the optimism.\nFor many investors (including myself), the price is too high. But for others, it may still represent a buying opportunity. At this valuation, Nvidia needs to report another year or two of flawless quarters; otherwise, it could be knocked from its perch. If you believe it can do that, Nvidia's stock could still be interesting here. But with its history of reporting strong earnings, and being rewarded by investors for doing so, if you're ready to be a buyer, you might want to buy before Aug. 28.\nKeithen Drury has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

In June, Nvidia stock was sitting on a 150% year-to-date gain, which was responsible for one-third of the entire return in the S&P 500. \nBoth Nvidia and the index have been in a slump since mid-July, but there is a seismic event coming up on Aug. 28 that could reverse both of their fortunes. It's the date Nvidia reports its financial results for the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 31), and if past quarters are any indication, it could be an absolute blowout.\nNvidia designs the most powerful data center chips for processing artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, and demand from some of the world's largest tech giants continues to outstrip supply. Therefore, investors are waiting on the edge of their seats for the company's latest sales results; here's how I predict Nvidia stock will react after they hit the wires.\nImage source: Nvidia.\nNvidia dominates the market for AI data center chips\nNvidia's graphics processors (GPUs) for data centers set the benchmark for AI development. GPUs are designed for parallel processing, which means they can complete multiple tasks simultaneously. They can handle high throughput and typically have a significant amount of built-in memory, which makes them ideal for processing large volumes of data. That is key when it comes to training AI models and performing AI inference.\nAI applications could drive a productivity boom across the global economy worth trillions of dollars in the coming decade, according to many Wall Street forecasts. As a result, data center operators are replacing much of their traditional CPU-based infrastructure with GPUs to meet demand from AI developers. Nvidia's flagship H100 GPU has been the go-to choice since last year, but the company is racing to beat its own benchmarks when it comes to performance.\nNvidia's new H200 can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of the H100 while consuming half the amount of energy. Then there is the GB200, which is based on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, and it could perform AI inference at a whopping 5 times the pace of the H100. Blackwell-based chips will start shipping to customers at scale in 2025.\nNvidia has a tight grip on the data center GPU market. It had an estimated 98% market share in 2023, and even though that will shrink this year as viable competition comes online from other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices, demand is likely to continue outstripping supply.\nHere's what Wall Street expects from Nvidia's upcoming quarterly report\nNvidia generated a record $26 billion in revenue during the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), which was a 262% increase from the year-ago period. It blew Wall Street's $24.6 billion projection right out of the water. The result included $22.6 billion in data center revenue alone, which represented 427% growth on the back of surging GPU demand. \nNvidia also delivered an incredible result at the bottom line, with $6.12 in earnings per share. It was a 461% increase and it came in comfortably above the Street's $5.59 prediction. \nWall Street also underestimated Nvidia's guidance. The company told investors it expects to show $28 billion in second-quarter revenue when it reports on Aug. 28, whereas the Street pegged that number at $26.6 billion. \nAnalysts have since played catch-up, and their consensus estimate has been revised higher to $28.5 billion, which signals Nvidia's own forecast might even be too conservative. We'll know for sure in two weeks.\nNvidia stock could soar with the help of its Q2 results\nWhile the performance of a stock on any given day is mostly just noise, here's how Nvidia reacted to each of its last two earnings reports:\nBut the longer-term trend is crystal clear. Nvidia was a $360 billion company at the beginning of 2023, right before AI fever swept Wall Street, and its stock has surged more than 700% since then. In other words, a string of incredible earnings reports has created sustained upward momentum in its stock price, and I think Q2 will contribute to that trend.\nIf Nvidia exceeds Wall Street's sales estimate, its stock could jump by at least 9% the following day, as it did after its Q1 results. The response could be even more positive given the recent dip in the stock. However, investors should be more focused on the longer term.\nIf Nvidia manages to deliver $3.75 in earnings per share in fiscal 2026 (which starts in February 2025) as Wall Street expects, its stock would have to soar by 108% over the next 18 months just to maintain its current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 58.2. \nGranted, that P/E ratio is quite expensive relative to the Nasdaq-100, which trades at a P/E ratio of 29.6, but it might be temporarily justifiable given Nvidia's lightning-paced growth.\nI say \"temporarily\" because this dream run will come to an end, eventually. Competition is growing in the market for AI data center chips, and as is the case with every technology, the further development of AI past a certain point will yield diminishing returns, which will shrink demand. It's difficult to predict exactly when that will happen, but investors should be wary of holding the stock blindly in the hope of earning the same returns Nvidia delivered in the past.\nAnthony Di Pizio has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's  Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap.

All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA)   Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

Is the Stock a Buy?\nKey Points\n\nNASDAQ: TSLA\n\nTesla\nTesla has had a disappointing 2024 so far, but this latest round of news may turn it around.\nBeing a Tesla (TSLA -2.48%) shareholder isn't for the weak stomach. The company's stock movements can be erratic, and many people may worry if they're not used to the volatility.\nTesla's stock popped more than 10% the day after its recent earnings release. However, since the start of 2024 the stock is still down over 25%. \nSo, is this pop the start of a new bull run for Tesla? Or is it an overreaction?\nTesla's Q1 results were disappointing to many investors\nWhen analyzing Tesla, the first fact is that the stock does not trade solely on how the business is currently doing. Instead, Tesla's future projects and product launches are given a lot of weight.\nThis becomes evident when you look at the company's first-quarter results, which weren't great.\nRevenue was down 9% year over year, and its gross margin decreased from 19.3% to 17.4%. This continues a concerning trend, as Tesla's gross margin used to set it apart from other auto manufacturers. Now, it's in line with others.\n\nTSLA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts\nDeclining revenue and shrinking margins weighed heavily on Tesla's earnings per share (EPS), which declined 53% year over year to $0.34. Perhaps the most concerning metric is that Tesla's free cash flow fell into negative territory, meaning Tesla is now burning cash to function as a business. \nThis is all troublesome to investors, but the newest information on the conference call made many investors look right past these poor results.\nNew products have investors excited\nTesla investors envision an all-electric vehicle fleet with Tesla as the dominant player in the space. This vision also includes new technologies like automated taxis and semitrucks, although those are just ideas on paper right now.\nHowever, investors are about to get a look into one of these technologies in a few months.\nIn August, the world will get its first look at Tesla's robotaxi, which it calls the Cybercab. A lot hinges on this release, as a part of Tesla's current valuation likely includes capturing the people-and-goods transportation market.\nTesla also hinted at updating its product launch roadmap. Previously, Tesla expected these new vehicles to arrive in the second half of 2025. Now, it expects them in the first half of 2025 or even late this year. This new round of vehicles will include a \"more affordable model,\" which many investors have been waiting for. If Tesla can mass produce an electric vehicle cheaply, it may entice more drivers to buy one that is only suited for commuting shorter distances rather than long trips.\nThe investor's vision of what Tesla can be is shaping up, and we'll have a lot more information by this time next year. However, the current status of Tesla's business is a bit troublesome.\nSo, should you buy the dip? I'd only say \"yes\" if you're a Tesla believer. It isn't a bad thing to be a believer, as Tesla's vision is quite impressive. However, if the world is more hesitant to switch to an all-electric fleet, this vision may not have the financial means to support Tesla's valuation, even if its product launches are all successful.\nKeithen Drury has positions in Tesla.

To that point, TSLA is still up +14% in the last three months to outperform the S&P 500\u2019s +1% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +2%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRecent Performance Overview\nTesla\u2019s stock has stayed in correction territory following its Q2 earnings of $0.52 a share which decreased -43% from EPS of $0.91 in the comparative quarter. This also missed Q2 EPS estimates of $0.62 by -16%.\nQuarterly sales did reach a record of $25.5 billion which was a 2% increase from $24.92 billion in Q2 2023 and beat expectations by 1%. Price cuts to its EV fleet led to lower margins with CEO Elon Musk stating an increasing number of competitors have entered the market and offered substantial discounts in an attempt to undercut Tesla.\nThe auto giant does see this as a short-term headwind with annual earnings now expected to decline -26% this year but projected to rebound and climb 36% in fiscal 2025 to $3.14 per share.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Technical Tape & Valuation\nUnderlying the recent bearish move in Tesla\u2019s stock is that TSLA moved below its 50-day\u00a0simple moving average (SMA) of $209 and continued to fall after dipping beneath its\u00a0200-day\u00a0SMA of $201. Traders will certainly want to see TSLA retake these levels.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, the correction has helped to normalize Tesla\u2019s valuation with TSLA trading at 87.1X forward earnings which is 38% below its two-year high of 141.2X and closer to the median of 76.7X during this period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nTesla\u2019s stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The EV pioneer's long-term outlook is still attractive but TSLA remains in correction territory and there could be better buying opportunities ahead. That said, the leveling of Tesla\u2019s valuation should start to attract more investors.\nSee More Zacks Research for These Tickers\nNormally $25 each - click below to receive one report FREE:\nTesla, Inc.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.10%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 7, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.\nVisit Performance Disclosure for information about the performance numbers displayed above.\nVisit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.\nReal time prices by BATS.

The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's  Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap. Note that \"N/A\" values will not show up in the chart.\nTesla's  Volatility Distribution in the Vehicles & Parts Industry\nFor the Vehicles & Parts industry and Consumer Cyclical sector, Tesla's Volatility distribution charts can be found below:\n* The bar in red indicates where Tesla's Volatility falls into.\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA)   Volatility Calculation\nThe annualized volatility is calculated as following:\nWhere: \u03c3M is the monthly volatility, n is the number of months in the period, Ri is the security's historical monthly returns and R' is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns.\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD. * For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA)   Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

              "\n\n\nLouis Navellier\u2019s Day After the Election Summit Goes Live Oct. 29th\nOn October 29th at 7pm ET, Louis Navellier and a special guest will host their \u201cDay After Summit.\u201d Don\u2019t miss their urgent warning about what\u2019s coming the day AFTER the election. A rare chain reaction is set up to trigger massive volatility in the markets.\u00a0\n\n\t\tTSLA Stock Analysis: The Bull and Bear Thesis for Tesla Investors\t\n\n\t\t\tTesla stock is navigating market volatility and industry evolution in electric vehicles\t\t\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\nIn a dramatic fashion, on August 5, 2024, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) market shares dropped 12.4%. This was in direct response to the Bank of Japan hiking interest rates. The interest rate hikes wiped out trillions of dollars worth of market capitalization across big tech. However, Tesla stock\u2019s share price has since recovered, gaining 8.04% over the past five days.\u00a0\nI have taken a definitively bullish stance on companies like TSLA due to the falling volatility in the market. The sharp sell-off was characteristically fueled by panic. And many market bargains are ready to be scooped up by investors during this volatile time period.\nI give Tesla stock a buy rating due to its projected earnings and revenue increases that are on the horizon. Also, I\u2019ll delineate a sell case for Tesla stock. This will provide a balanced view of the firm\u2019s opportunities and risks in the market.\nTesla\u2019s Cyclical Wobbles and New Models\nDespite Tesla\u2019s \u201cdifficult environment,\u201d the company actually managed to exceed my expectations for its recent quarterly results in some cases. Therefore, I take a contrarian stance with Tesla stock. Many factors were cyclically affecting other electric vehicle (EV stocks) too. This includes a lack of semiconductor chips from firms such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm still managed to beat analyst expectations and achieve record quarterly revenues of $25.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year (YOY). However, it\u2019s also true that its earnings fell 43% to 52 cents per share. Therefore, it missed analyst expectations by a wide margin.\nWhere my contrarian case takes hold is in Tesla\u2019s plans for new vehicles. That includes more affordable models such as its $25,000 entry-level Redwood model. It remains on track for production in the first half of 2025. Over time, Tesla\u2019s market share has come under attack by far cheaper Chinese-made EVs. Autos produced by Byd Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) currently dominate the Asian market. Yet, consider the 10,000 vehicle production target for TSLA\u2019s Redwood model. Additionally, the company expects profitability for its Cybertruck near the end of the year. These factors shape Tesla into a position of strong recovery. Also, it provides more equal footing with its budget competitor.\nBullish Technical Momentum\nWhile Tesla stock might have disappointed the market with its earnings, I see several indicators pointing to bullish momentum in the short term. And this is evidenced by strong signs in the options market for Tesla\u2019s put and call contracts. Particularly important is the open interest for the August 16 expiration, which is this Friday. The put/call open interest ratio is 0.61, showing significantly more open interest in calls compared to puts. The implied volatility of 6.45% may suggest that investors will be in for a much smoother ride this week compared to previous ones, largely in part of the VIX falling 62.23% over the past five days.\nAnother bullish signal is that after Tesla stock dipped into oversold territory on August 7, momentum has steadily risen over the past trading session. Also, investors can find underlying strength in terms of volume. This could potentially signal a bullish reversal in the near future. However, relatively little interest is being shown TSLA by bulls or bears. So, I see a gradual upward climb for Tesla stock as opposed to violent swings in its valuation.\nReasons to Sell\nDespite my bullishness of Tesla\u2019s prospects, a compelling sell case can be made from Tesla bears. Investorplace author Faizan Farooque recently wrote that the company\u2019s aggressive price cuts have led to shrinking profit margins. And gross margins dropped from 23.8% to 17.6%, and operating margin fell from 16% to 8.2%. \nAdditionally, I believe that due to the persistent undercutting by Chinese EV makers and Tesla\u2019s efforts to keep up, it is undergoing a bit of an identity crisis. For some, Tesla stock is synonymous with American-made quality (and luxurious) EV vehicles. \nTo me, an appeal to Tesla is its luxury and high technology, but as the features of EVs become more commoditized over time, there could be less differentiating features across EVs as a whole to make a specific Tesla model stand out and justify the higher price tag. So, Tesla must create its own edge in the market and not become another me-too brand. Otherwise, it becomes a race to the bottom, and that\u2019s not a competition that Tesla will ever win against its Chinese competitors.\nHowever, I maintain my buy rating for Tesla stock as it adapts to the nascent EV market. It might no longer be considered a high-end vehicle in the future. Yet, its R&D efforts can put it on the bleeding edge of the most modern vehicles. This is especially true for its cars that rest in the higher tiers such as the Cybertruck. These polarizing and unique designs may be a hint of what we can expect from the company in the future.\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

What Options Markets Say.\nBy\nAl Root\nA Tesla Cybertruck (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)\nTesla earnings usually bring stock volatility.\nOptions markets imply shares will move about 6% up or down following today's earnings report. Shares have moved an average of about 11% following the past four quarterly reports. Of those four, shares have dropped three of those times.\nShares decreased 12.3% after the company reported weaker-than-expected second-quarter earnings in July. Tesla reported adjusted earnings per share of 52 cents. Wall Street was looking for 61 cents. Earnings also included a $622 million restructuring charge likely related to employee layoffs. That made comparability with prior quarters difficult.\nTopics\nMemberships\nTools\nCustomer Service\nNetwork\nNewsstand\nFor Business\nFor Education\nFor Advertisers\nAccount\nAbout Barron's\n",

This report once again demonstrates steady growth and a strong labor market with a three-month average of 276,000 in job gains.

Since President Biden took office, more than 15 million jobs have been created, and we\u2019re seeing those gains across industries \u2014 from construction which gained 39,000 jobs this month to local education which added 18,000 jobs in March \u2014 and recovered to pre-pandemic levels. People across the country are also feeling these gains with average hourly earnings up 4.1 percent over the year.\u00a0\n\u201cPresident Biden came into office with a plan to grow our economy from the middle out and the bottom up. Month after month, the jobs reports during the Biden-Harris administration have shown strong progress to realizing that vision\u2014a vision where all of America\u2019s workers can get a good job and find a solid place in the middle class.

Though hiring has slowed\u2014average payroll gains over the past three months were 116,000\u2014the U.S. job market continues to generate solid job gains and wage growth that is consistently beating inflation.\nFor more details on today\u2019s report, see CEA\u2019s X thread.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAt 4.2% the unemployment rate, while still low, is up half-a-point from the beginning of the year. What\u2019s behind this increase? There is no single, simple answer, but one factor behind the July increase was so-called temporary unemployment. The dynamics of unemployment over the past two months are a reminder that temporary unemployment has a less-persistent impact on the unemployment rate relative to more permanent layoffs.\nWorkers get labeled as temporarily unemployed when they aren\u2019t working, but say that they expect to be recalled to their prior employer sometime in the near future. Typically, this is a small fraction of unemployment\u2014on average 13% from 2016\u201319\u2014 with an exception being Spring and Summer 2020, when many Americans were in this position because of the pandemic. (See Figure 1.)\nIn July, temporary unemployment rose by 250,000\u2014the large majority of the overall 350,000 rise in unemployment that month. It\u2019s hard to say what caused this (it doesn\u2019t appear to be related to a hurricane), but what we know is that temporarily unemployed workers are much more likely to quickly regain employment than other unemployed workers. Over the last year, 52% of the temporarily unemployed were re-employed in the next month, and only 3% become permanent job losers (i.e., those who are involuntarily unemployed without expectation of recall to their prior employer). Indeed, this is consistent with what we saw in this morning\u2019s data for August: temporary unemployment fell back by 190,000, putting downward pressure on the overall unemployment rate.\nEven with the tick down in August\u2019s unemployment rate, it is still up from a low of 3.4% in April of last year. Some economists view this as a cause for concern because\u2014historically speaking\u2014when the unemployment rate goes up this much, it tends to keep rising.[1]\nBut there are reasons why that historical experience may not hold true in today\u2019s labor market, especially when we consider this indicator in the context of many other positive economic developments, like strong consumer spending and GDP growth (more on those in a moment).\nOne reason relates to the unusual situation of mid-2023, when the unemployment rate was at its minimum. The U.S. labor market was recovering from an unprecedented pandemic-induced recession with the aid of similarly unprecedented fiscal policy support. This drove the unemployment rate down to a level it had not reached since the beginning of the Nixon Administration. We have little relevant guidance from past experience with unemployment rising from such a low level.\nTo see this point, consider the behavior of unemployment insurance claims just last year. Before 2023, high year-over-year growth in continuing claims (i.e., the number of unemployment insurance recipients, roughly speaking) was almost always associated with a recession. (See Figure 2.) But even though that growth rate rose to about 30% in mid-2023\u2014a rate typically indicative of recession\u2014the crucial context was that mid-2022 continuing claims had been historically low due to a combination of the tight labor market and the hangover from the pandemic. As such, simply returning to a normal level meant big increases from that low baseline. And as we have seen since mid-2023, the rise in continued claims last summer was clearly not associated with a recession.\nStepping back from the details of unemployment, most indicators of economic vitality remain strong as we close out summer 2024. While payroll employment growth has cooled, it remains positive and consistent with a stable labor market providing ample opportunities to job seekers. Yearly wage growth was 3.8% in August and 4.1% for lower- and middle-wage workers. While we do not yet know inflation for August, it is extremely likely that these wage-growth rates add another month to the 15-month tally of wage growth outpacing price growth through July, meaning real wage gains.\nInitial and continuing claims for unemployment insurance remain relatively low and similar to their pre-pandemic levels. And at 83.9%, prime-age labor force participation is just below its highest level in more than twenty years.\nTurning to other, related measures of economic activity, real GDP is on very solid footing, driven by strong consumer spending (itself supported by the real wage gains just noted) and a positive trend in business investment. Reflecting this optimistic outlook, small business creation has been setting records in recent years.\nIn other words, today\u2019s jobs report along with a broad array of economic data are consistent with steady growth, easing inflationary pressures, real wage and income gains, and no notable recent increase in permanent layoffs. CEA will continue to monitor and contextualize these trends, as we work with the Biden-Harris team to maintain and build on this progress on behalf of American families.\n[1] The commonly used Sahm Indicator captures this tendency: it is calculated as the difference between the current unemployment rate and the unemployment rate minimum over the preceding twelve months (where all rates are calculated as their three-month trailing averages).\nStay Connected\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe White House\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWashington, DC 20500\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",

That\u2019s how strong our economy is.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing steady growth across sectors like Private Education & Health Services (+81,000), Leisure & Hospitality (+78,000), Government (+31,000) and Construction (+25,000). At the same time, wages have risen 4.0 percent over the past year, putting more money in working families\u2019 pockets. Since President Biden and Vice President Harris took office in January 2021, our economy has added over 16.2 million jobs, including 729,000 in manufacturing and 940,000 in construction.\u00a0\n\u201cFour years ago, students were logging into school via Zoom, trick-or-treating was canceled, and we faced unprecedented challenges. Today, as we approach Halloween 2024, our economy is on strong footing with record employment gains, shrinking unemployment gaps, and rising wages.

History Says the Stock Market Will Do This Next.\nKey Points\n\nSNPINDEX: ^GSPC\n\nS&P 500 Index\nThe stock market had an unexpectedly good September, and momentum could carry the S&P 500 higher in the fourth quarter.\nSeptember has historically been the weakest month of the year for the U.S. stock market. In the last two decades, the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.27%) has declined by an average of 0.6% during September, which is a half-percentage point worse than the next closest month.\nThat inexplicable phenomenon, aptly known as the \"September Effect,\" failed to materialize this year. Instead, the S&P 500 advanced 2% to clench its best September since 2013. And history says that momentum spill into the remaining months of 2024.\nHere's what investors should know.\nHistory says the S&P 500 is headed higher in the remaining months of 2024\nThe U.S. stock market's unexpectedly strong September was a product of solid financial results and interest rate cuts. Specifically, S&P 500 companies recorded earnings growth of 11.3% in the second quarter of 2024, the best performance since the fourth quarter of 2021.\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in four years. Lower rates should strengthen the economy by encouraging consumer spending and business investments, which itself should drive continued strength in corporate earnings.\nEnthusiasm born of those events pushed the S&P 500 higher in September, something that has happened only 11 other times in the last two decades. The chart below shows how the index performed over the three-month and 12-month periods following positive Septembers in the past.\nYear\n3-Month Return\n12-Month Return\n2004\n9%\n10%\n2005\n2%\n9%\n2006\n6%\n14%\n2007\n(4%)\n(24%)\n2009\n5%\n(26%)\n2010\n10%\n(1%)\n2012\n(1%)\n17%\n2013\n10%\n17%\n2017\n(1%)\n16%\n2018\n(14%)\n2%\n2019\n9%\n13%\nMedian\n5%\n10%\nData source: YCharts. The chart shows the S&P 500's performance during the three-month period and 12-month period following a positive return in September of the listed year.\nAs shown above, during the last two decades, the S&P 500 has achieved a median three-month return of 5% and a median 12-month return of 10% following a positive result in September. We can use that information to make an educated guess about the current situation.\nSpecifically, the S&P 500 has fallen 1% since the end of September. That leaves implied upside of 6% over the next three months and 11% over the next 12 months. Past performance is never a guarantee of future results, but those predictions are very plausible.\nThe fourth quarter has historically been the strongest quarter of the year for the stock market due to the expectation that holiday spending will help the economy. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has gained an average of 4.3% in the fourth quarter, more than doubling its performance in the next best quarter, according to Carson Group.\nAdditionally, the S&P 500 advanced 193% in the last decade, excluding dividends. That equates to 11.3% annually. So, an 11% return during the next 12-month period that ends in September 2025 would actually qualify as below average. Regardless, investors should be cautious in the current market environment.\nThe S&P 500 could be derailed by historically expensive stock prices\nMany stocks are expensive by historical standards. The S&P 500 trades at 27 times earnings, a premium to the five-year average of 23.8 times earnings and the 10-year average of 21.7 times earnings. As a result, several Wall Street strategists expect the S&P 500 to decline in the remaining months of 2024.\nThe chart below lists Wall Street's year-end price targets for the S&P 500. It also shows the implied upside or downside (compared to its current level of 5,710) associated with each forecast.\nWall Street Firm\nS&P 500 Year-End Target\nImplied Upside (Downside)\nBMO Capital Markets\n6,100\n7%\nEvercore\n6,000\n5%\nOppenheimer\n5,900\n3%\nYardeni Research\n5,800\n2%\nDeutsche Bank\n5,750\n1%\nRBC Capital\n5,700\n0%\nUBS\n5,600\n(2%)\nCiti\n5,600\n(2%)\nGoldman Sachs\n5,600\n(2%)\nBarclays\n5,600\n(2%)\nWells Fargo\n5,535\n(3%)\nBank of America\n5,400\n(5%)\nFundstrat\n5,200\n(9%)\nJPMorgan Chase\n4,200\n(26%)\nMedian\n5,200\n(2%)\nData source: Yahoo Finance.\nAs shown above, Wall Street's year-end targets for the S&P 500 imply outcomes ranging from 7% upside to 26% downside in the remaining months of 2024. But the median forecast of 5,600 implies 2% downside.\nHere's the bottom line: History says the S&P 500 will have a strong fourth quarter. But stocks are historically expensive, so the first sign of economic trouble could trigger a market correction or even a bear market. So, investors should be particularly cognizant of valuations when buying stocks in the current environment.\nJPMorgan Chase is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

Katherine holds an MBA, and is a former staff writer for Fit Small Business. She is a regular contributor to Forbes and maintains a popular lifestyle and travel blog.\nAbigail Rueger is a deputy editor on the banking team at Fortune Recommends. She is passionate about personal finance and offering consumers actionable steps for making positive life changes. Prior to joining Fortune, Abigail spent four years as an editor for Choosing Therapy, a startup dedicated to providing the best mental health information on the web.\u00a0\nSet by the Federal Reserve\u2014or the \u2018Fed\u2019\u2014the federal funds rate helps stabilize the economy during growth and recession. In recent decades, the Fed\u2019s choice to raise or lower rates has been in response to major events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the financial crisis of 2008. \nKnowing how and why the Fed changes these rates can help you better understand how their decisions affect everyday Americans.\u00a0\u00a0\nUnderstanding Fed Interest Rate Decisions\nThink of the federal fund rate as a thermostat for the economy. When the economy begins to overheat\u2014shown by rising inflation and unsustainable growth\u2014the Fed raises the \u2018temperature\u2019 by increasing interest rates, making borrowing more expensive. \nConversely, during a recession, or when the economy starts to \u2018freeze,\u2019 the Fed lowers the thermostat by cutting rates, encouraging borrowing and spending to help warm things back up.\u00a0\nThe federal funds rate helps maintain the economy\u2019s \u2018temperature\u2019\u2014not too hot, not too cold. It influences everything from mortgage rates to consumer spending.\nExpert insight\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s moves have a direct impact on consumers and businesses. When rates rise, borrowing costs go up, meaning your mortgage, car loan, credit card debt, and business debt can become more expensive. On the flip side, lower rates make it cheaper to borrow, which can help with big purchases like homes, cars, and business expansion.But it\u2019s not all bad news when rates go up\u2014savers benefit from higher returns on cash in savings accounts, CDs, and bonds, allowing their money to earn more interest. Whether you\u2019re borrowing or saving, Fed rate changes ripple through the economy and affect your financial well-being in a number of ways.\u201d \u2013 Andrew Tudor, CFP, CAP \u2013 Investment Advisor\nDrawbacks of interest rate decisions by the Fed\nThe Fed\u2019s policies, though aimed at stabilizing the broader economy, often have unintended side effects. Jason Ray, president and chief information officer (CIO) of Zenith Wealth Partners, says, \u201cWhile necessary, the Fed\u2019s actions often disproportionately benefit financial markets and asset holders, raising questions about long-term wealth inequality under its policies. \nThe Fed\u2019s balancing act often amplifies existing socioeconomic divides, especially when rate changes disproportionately impact borrowers or savers across different income levels. Is the focus on employment and inflation inadvertently deepening these structural inequalities?\u201d\nWhat impacts the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision-making process?\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has 12 members\u2014seven from the Board of Governors and five from regional Federal Reserve Banks\u2014who meet regularly to take a closer look at economic indicators. They use these indicators to help make decisions about monetary policy, such as whether or not to change the federal funds rate.\nThe key indicators that the Fed monitors are:\nThe role of the \u201cdot plot\u201d and forward guidance\nIn addition to current economic data, the FOMC also considers future expectations, known as the \u2018dot plot.\u2019 All twelve FOMC members submit their future projections for short- and long-term interest rates. This can help gauge the committee\u2019s views on the future of the economy and help guide the Fed\u2019s overall strategy.\u00a0\nForward guidance also helps the Fed signal future intentions. By communicating whether rates will go up or down in the near future, the Fed can guide future market behavior, aiming to provide some stability for the market. For example, if the Fed says rates are likely to stay low for a long time, a business might be more likely to invest because they know borrowing rates will be affordable.\u00a0\nThe Fed must balance economic growth while keeping inflation in check. It does this by making data-driven decisions based on factors like inflation, employment, GDP, and consumer behavior. In addition to these indicators, there are other considerations, like trade tensions, global events, and geopolitical risks. For example, the pandemic, the 2008 financial meltdown, and wars impacted the Fed\u2019s decisions.\nThe FOMC\u2019s decisions aren\u2019t safe from scrutiny\u2014they face this from the public, political leaders, and markets. Because the Federal Reserve is independent, it can focus on the economy\u2019s long-term health without the interference of short-term political pressure. However, its decisions have far-reaching effects on businesses, consumers, and the entire global economy.\nThe global influence of federal funds rate changes\nDecisions made by the Fed affect more than just the United States. In fact, they can impact the economy, markets, and central banks worldwide. The US dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency, and when the Fed makes policies, it also shapes global financial conditions.\u00a0\nWhen rates are raised or cut, there\u2019s a global chain reaction impacting everything from international trade to exchange rates to capital flows and foreign investment:\n2022-2024: Fed rate hikes & cuts\nThe Fed\u2019s rate policy from 2022 to 2024 marks a dramatic swing between aggressive hikes and easing measures. In 2022 and 2023, they raised rates at an unprecedented pace to cool the economy after supply chain issues and high consumer demand. By late 2023, rampant inflation showed signs of easing.\u00a0\nThen, at their meeting on September 18th, 2024, they enacted their first rate cut since the COVID-19 pandemic\u201450 basis points to help the weak labor market.\u00a0\nBy cutting rates in 2024, the Fed addressed concerns about slow economic growth, as well as rising unemployment. To prevent further deterioration of job gains and rising unemployment rates, the Fed aims to make borrowing more affordable for businesses and consumers. This encourages investments and spending, which can help create more jobs and stimulate the economy while keeping inflation manageable.\n2019-2020: Fed rate cuts\nGoing into 2020, the Fed cut rates to help stimulate the economy amidst global uncertainty. The end of 2019 marked concerns about trade tensions, with slow global growth and muted inflation, which prompted them to cut rates. But then the pandemic hit, causing them to shift from caution to emergency action. When the world shut down in March of 2020, in an unprecedented move to support the economy, the Fed slashed rates to nearly zero.\u00a0\nPaired with quantitative easing to mitigate any economic fallout once businesses started boarding up and unemployment soared, the Fed's actions were designed to flood the financial system with liquidity and encourage borrowing and spending. Cutting rates to almost zero, businesses could borrow for much cheaper than before, and allowed for consumers to finance large purchases.\u00a0\n2015-2018: Fed rate hikes\nIn the wake of near-zero rates after the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed raised rates in December 2015 for the first time since 2006. They were confident the US economy was starting to recover, thanks to steady job growth and more consumer spending. While these rate hikes were modest, they were scant for a reason: After years of extraordinary measures, they wanted to normalize the monetary policy. Then, by 2018, they'd raised the rates four times as the economy strengthened.\nHowever, by the end of 2018, a volatile market led to a more cautious stance by the Fed as trade tensions and slow global growth raised concerns about the sustainability of the economic expansion. Worried that the rate hikes could stifle any growth and propel the US into a deeper economic dive, they hit pause on tightening the economy.\n2007-2008: Fed rate cuts\nFinancial markets unraveled when the housing bubble burst, causing the Fed to make sharp rate cuts in 2007 and 2008. These were supposed to help cushion the U.S. economy amid the subprime mortgage crisis, but the response was a full-blown global financial meltdown.\u00a0\nThe Fed brought rates to near zero after cutting them from over 5% by the end of 2008. Amid bailouts and emergency lending to stabilize banks, they sought to prevent a deeper economic collapse. This period became known as The Great Recession.\u00a0\u00a0\n2005-2006: Fed rate hikes\nTo prevent the economy from overheating, the Federal Reserve steadily raised interest rates in the mid-2000s. The economy was expanding and housing prices were surging, so the Fed made a series of rate hikes from 2005 to 2006. With potential speculation in the housing market and increasing inflation, the Fed sought to curb excessive borrowing and prevent the formation of asset bubbles by steadily raising interest rates. By December 2005, they'd raised rates for 13 straight times.\nThis made borrowing more expensive, which cooled the housing market and brought rising prices under control during this period of economic instability that ran rampant with unchecked inflation and speculative activity.\u00a0\n2001-2003: Fed rate cuts\nIn the early 2000s, the Federal Reserve had a lot to contend with\u2014the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the aftermath of September 11th. From 2001 to 2003, the Fed made a series of rate cuts to help stimulate an economy rocked by back-to-back crises. They slashed rates from 6.5% to 1% during this period to support growth and encourage more borrowing and investments. In 2001 alone, they cut rates 11 times.\nWhile these extended periods of rate cuts helped the economic slowdown, they also contributed to the eventual housing market bubble that led to the financial crisis in 2008.\n1999-2000: Fed rate hikes\nWith a growing technology sector and booming economic growth, the Fed raised rates in 1999 and 2000. This helped to control inflation, especially as tech stocks experienced rapid growth. They raised rates five times between 1999 and 2000 to prevent overheating the economy. However, with the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 and the following economic downturn, they shifted to cutting rates shortly afterward.\n1998: Fed rate cuts\nWith growing concerns over the global financial system, the Fed made a series of rate cuts in 1998. A major hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, collapsed around the same time as serious instability in worldwide markets, influenced by the Asian financial crisis. The Fed's aim was to prevent the US from sinking into a recession. Totaling 75 basis points, the three rate cuts helped stabilize the markets.\nThe Fed made these cuts to encourage borrowing and investments, and by the end of 1998, the economy was relatively strong despite what was happening in external markets. However, some economists suggest that this period of extended rate cuts helped contribute to the dot-com bubble bust in the following years.\n1997: Fed rate hike\nIn 1997, the Fed raised rates in response to strong economic growth and a tightening labor market. Unemployment fell to historic lows, and when inflationary pressure increased, the Fed hiked rates to prevent overheating the economy. While they wanted to keep the stock market rising and bolster the ongoing expansion, the Fed also had to keep inflation in check.\u00a0\nThey made just one rate increase in 1997 to maintain price stability and consumer confidence. Throughout the decade, they were careful to balance growth and inflationary pressures.\n1995-1996: Fed rate cuts\nThe U.S. saw an economic expansion following the 1990s recession, so the Fed cut rates in 1995 and 1996. Earlier in the decade, the Fed grew concerned that the economy was slowing, partly due to reduced inflationary pressure. They wanted to encourage borrowing and investing so the economy could expand even further. These cuts kept inflation under control and helped reignite growth.\nThis ushered the economy into continued prosperity in the late 1990s, thanks to steady growth, low inflation, and a strong labor market. However, critics argue that these low rates led to riskier financial markets that led to the dot-com bubble.\n1994-1995: Fed rate hikes\nTo combat inflation, the Federal Reserve went on an aggressive rate-hiking cycle in 1994. With rapid economic expansion and more inflationary pressure, the federal funds rate jumped from 3% to 6% between February 1994 and February 1995. This was to prevent the economy from overheating and curb inflation, especially as wages increased and the labor market tightened.\nWhile these hikes controlled inflation, they also slowed the economy down, especially as sectors like housing and manufacturing, which are more sensitive to interest rates, saw reduced demand due to higher borrowing costs. These made loans more expensive, so home sales dropped and industrial production slowed, leading to even more economic deceleration. By early 1995, the Fed paused these rate increases to help maintain long-term stability, which fueled the expansion in the late 1990s.\n1990-1992: Fed rate cuts\nA recession began in 1990, and to stimulate the economy, the Fed made a series of rate cuts. The savings and loan crisis, Gulf War oil prices, and slowing consumer spending combined to trigger this recession. The Fed brought the federal funds rate from 8% to 3% over a two-year period to help encourage borrowing and investing in a sluggish economy.\nThis laid the groundwork for the economic recovery experienced by the mid-90s, as it was cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow, so they were encouraged to spend more. Industries reliant on consumer credit, such as the real estate market, benefited from these lower rates. This gradual economic recovery took some time to come to fruition, though many agree the Fed's actions helped prevent a deeper, more prolonged recession.\nThe takeaway\nThe federal fund rate's history shows the tough balancing act that the Fed employs to sustain economic growth while controlling inflation. During periods of rapid growth, rate hikes help curb inflation, while during economic slowdowns, rate cuts help stimulate borrowing.\u00a0\nAs a consumer and investor, knowing when and why the Federal Reserve makes adjustments to the federal funds rates can help you decide when to borrow, invest, and save. For example, if rates are high, you might want to wait to refinance your mortgage, but it might be an excellent time to stash some cash in a high-yield savings account or CD.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is the Federal Reserve?\nThe Federal Reserve oversees the United States' monetary policy as the central banking system. It regulates financial institutions, works to maintain economic stability, and manages the nation's money supply.\nWhat does the Federal Reserve do?\nThe Federal Reserve controls interest rates, works to keep inflation in check, and tries to stabilize the financial system. It also supervises banks, provides financial services to the US government, and is a lender during financial crises.\nWhy was the Federal Reserve created?\nThe Federal Reserve was formed in 1913 to provide a more stable banking system and to help stem financial panics like the one that caused the Panic of 1907. This saw widespread bank runs and deteriorated confidence in the economic system. This central authority to manage monetary policy and give emergency support to banks helped create a more resilient financial environment.\nRead more\nKatherine Haan is a former financial advisor turned small business coach.

This lowers the interest rate target to a range of 4.75% to 5%.1\nThe Fed\u2019s decision to ease monetary policy is likely to support growth and stabilize a slowing labor market. Our strategists believe this is the beginning of the Fed moving into a new stance \u2013 in the Fed\u2019s eyes, recent slowing in the labor market is now a bigger risk than inflation. This cut in policy rates, and plans to lower rates further, is designed to support economic growth.\nNoteworthy changes in the Fed\u2019s statement\nIn the FOMC statement, the Fed reiterated that the economy \u201ccontinued to expand at a solid pace\u201d and that it remains committed to \u201cachieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of two percent over the longer run.\u201d2\nHowever, the statement included noteworthy changes from the prior statement regarding inflation and the labor market. The Committee noted that it has \u201cgained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards two percent\u201d and the risks to its dual mandate \u201care roughly in\u201d balance, compared to being in \u201cbetter\u201d balance as noted in the prior statement. This follows August\u2019s inflation data which showed inflation is now at 2.5%, considerably closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target.3\nThe statement describes job gains as having \u201cslowed,\u201d a change from \u201cmoderated\u201d in the past statement, and underscores it is now \u201cstrongly committed to supporting maximum employment.\u201d4 This follows August\u2019s labor market data,\u00a0which revealed that the labor market is slowing more quickly than expected, but not breaking.\nShifts in the Summary of Economic Projections\nThe much-anticipated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed that the median FOMC participant is penciling in 50 basis points of further cuts across the remaining two meetings this year, followed by 100 basis points of cuts in 2025 and 50 basis points more in 2026 to a terminal rate of 2.9%, where they sees rates remaining through 2027.5\nOfficials raised their end of 2024 median forecast for the unemployment rate to 4.4% from 4%, a slight decline from the current rate of 4.2%.6\nThese projections reflect the Committee\u2019s belief that the risks to inflation have become broadly balanced while risks to the unemployment rate are now weighed to the upside. This will likely lead to further rate cuts for risk management purposes, to help prolong the expansion.7\nEconomic and monetary policy outlook\nEconomic variables are trending in the right direction, which allowed for the Fed to begin easing monetary policy. Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that inflation is \u201cmuch closer\u201d to its 2% target and the labor market is \u201cless tight\u201d than pre-pandemic in 2019. He highlighted that the \u201cprimary focus\u201d has shifted from \u201cbringing down inflation\u201d to supporting maximum employment.8\nGoing forward, Chair Powell underscored that the Fed\u2019s decision on the direction of rates continues to be made on a \u201cmeeting by meeting\u201d basis with data leading the way. This measured approach allows the committee to carefully assess the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.9\nOur strategists believe that there will likely be two additional rate cuts in 2024, and expect the cuts to continue into 2025. This cut in policy rates should help support labor markets from slowing too quickly.\nMarket reaction\nU.S. equities were initially higher in the afternoon following the Fed\u2019s announcement on September 18, as stocks made an intra-day all-time high, while bond yields \u2013 especially at the short end \u2013 moved lower. However, by the end of the day, the S&P 500 declined by 0.29%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 0.25% and the Nasdaq declined by 0.31%. In early trading on Thursday, the market was up big, with S&P 500 futures in the green by 1.5%.\nWhat a rate cut could mean for investors\nEven though bond yields have fallen, our strategists still think excess cash should find a better home while the Fed is cutting rates. This decision to cut 50 basis points reinforces that reinvestment risk is real, and bond yields could still move lower from here. But it\u2019s not too late \u2013 over the last 12 cutting cycles (from first cut to last cut), fixed income has outperformed cash in all but one. When the Fed cuts rates outside of recession, equities tend to deliver strong performance.\u00a0\u00a0\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \u201cFederal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement.\u201d (September 18, 2024)\nIbid.\nIbid.\nIbid.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \u201cSummary of Economic Projections\u201d (September 18, 2024).\nIbid.\nIbid.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \u201cTranscript of Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Opening Statement\u201d (September 2024).\nIbid.\nConnect with a Wealth Advisor\nOur Wealth Advisors begin by getting to know you personally.

While the rate sets short-term borrowing costs for banks, it spills over into multiple consumer products such as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.\nIn addition to this reduction, the committee indicated through its \"dot plot\" the equivalent of 50 more basis points of cuts by the end of the year, close to market pricing. The matrix of individual officials' expectations pointed to another full percentage point in cuts by the end of 2025 and a half point in 2026. In all, the dot plot shows the benchmark rate coming down about 2 percentage points beyond Wednesday's move.\n\"The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance,\" the post-meeting statement said.\nThe decision to ease came \"in light of progress on inflation and the balance of risks.\" Notably, the FOMC vote was 11-1, with Governor Michelle Bowman preferring a quarter-point move. Bowman's dissent was the first by a Fed governor since 2005, though a number of regional presidents have cast \"no\" votes during the period.\n\"We're trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with this inflation. That's what we're trying to do, and I think you could take today's action as a sign of our strong commitment to achieve that goal,\" Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference following the decision.\nTrading was volatile after the decision with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping as much as 375 points after it was released, before easing somewhat as investors digested the news and considered what it suggests about the state of the economy.\nStocks ended slightly lower on the day while Treasury yields bounced higher.\n\"This is not the beginning of a series of 50 basis point cuts. The market was thinking to itself, if you go 50, another 50 has a high likelihood. But I think [Powell] really dashed that idea to some extent,\" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \"It's not that he thinks that's not going to happen, it's that he's not he's not pre-committing to that to happen. That is the right call.\"\nThe committee noted that \"job gains have slowed and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.\" FOMC officials raised their expected unemployment rate this year to 4.4%, from the 4% projection at the last update in June, and lowered the inflation outlook to 2.3% from 2.6% previous. On core inflation, the committee took down its projection to 2.6%, a 0.2 percentage point reduction from June.\nThe committee expects the long-run neutral rate to be around 2.9%, a level that has drifted higher as the Fed has struggled to get inflation down to 2%.\nThe decision comes despite most economic indicators looking fairly solid.\nGross domestic product has been rising steadily, and the Atlanta Fed is tracking 3% growth in the third quarter based on continuing strength in consumer spending. Moreover, the Fed chose to cut even though most gauges indicate inflation well ahead of the central bank's 2% target. The Fed's preferred measure shows inflation running around 2.5%, well below its peak but still higher than policymakers would like.\nHowever, Powell and other policymakers in recent days have expressed concern about the labor market. While layoffs have shown little sign of rebounding, hiring has slowed significantly. In fact, the last time the monthly hiring rate was this low \u2013 3.5% as a share of the labor force \u2013 the unemployment rate was above 6%.\nAt his news conference following the July meeting, Powell remarked that a 50 basis point cut was \"not something we're thinking about right now.\"\nFor the moment, at least, the move helps settle a contentious debate over how forceful the Fed should have been with the initial move.\nHowever, it sets the stage for future questions over how far the central bank should go before it stops cutting. There was a wide dispersion among members for where they see rates heading in future years.\nInvestors' conviction on the move vacillated in the days leading up to the meeting. Over the past week, the odds had shifted to a half-point cut, with the probability for 50 basis points at 63% just before the decision coming down, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.\nThe Fed last reduced rates on March 16, 2020, part of an emergency response to an economic shutdown brought about by the spread of Covid-19. It began hiking in March 2022 as inflation was climbing to its highest level in more than 40 years, and last raised rates in July 2023.\u00a0During the tightening campaign, the Fed raised rates 75 basis points four consecutive times.\nThe current jobless level is 4.2%, drifting higher over the past year though still at a level that would be considered full employment.\n\"This was an atypical big cut,\" Porceli said. \"We're not knocking on recessions' door. This easing and this bit cut is about recalibrating policy for the fact that inflation has slowed so much.\"\nWith the Fed at the center of the global financial universe, Wednesday's decision likely will reverberate among other central banks, several of whom already have started cutting. The factors that drove global inflation higher were related mainly to the pandemic \u2013 crippled international supply chains, outsized demand for goods over services, and an unprecedented influx of monetary and fiscal stimulus.\nThe Bank of England, European Central Bank and Canada's central bank all have cut rates recently, though others awaited the Fed's cue.\nWhile the Fed approved the rate cut, it left in place a program in which it is slowly reducing the size of its bond holdings. The process, nicknamed \"quantitative tightening,\" has brought the Fed's balance sheet down to $7.2 trillion, a reduction of about $1.7 trillion from its peak. The Fed is allowing up to $50 billion a month in maturing Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities to roll off each month, down from the initial $95 billion when QT started.\nDon\u2019t miss these insights from CNBC PRO\nGot a confidential news tip?

              "More From Forbes\nHere\u2019s The Fed\u2019s 2024 Meeting Schedule And Interest Rate Outlook\nJerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, speaks during a news conference following a ... [+] Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Markets expect interest rates to move down in 2024, but not by much. Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to ultimately cut interest rates in 2024, but in a measured way and with action weighted toward the second half. Today, the Fed Funds target rate is 5.25% to 5.5%. Markets expect that to fall by approximately 1% by the end of 2024 \u2014 as assessed by the CME FedWatch Tool, which measures the implied expectations of the debt markets. The current range of outcomes for rates suggests a likely figure between 4% and 5% for short-term rates by December 2024.\nThe Fed\u2019s own more recent projections from September 20 are more hawkish than the market\u2019s view. They suggest rates may not decline quite as much and fall to the 4.% to 5.5% range by December 2024.\nHowever, Fed policymakers will update those projections at their next interest rate decision on December 1 when rates are expected to be held steady. Up to now, Fed officials have also argued that rates could increase again from here. That scenario is now being described more as a potential outcome under certain economic conditions than the base case for interest rates.\nThe Fed Meeting Calendar For 2024\nDuring 2024 the Fed has the typical schedule of eight meetings to determine interest rates. Of course, the Fed can adjust monetary policy whenever it chooses. That could happen if 2024 sees unusual economic events. The Fed will announce decisions on interest rates following its two-day meetings ending on:\n\n\nEach decision will be announced on the Fed\u2019s website via a written statement at 2 p.m. ET with a press conference following the announcement. The minutes of each meeting are released three weeks later.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nEvery other meeting (for 2024, it\u2019s March, June, September and December) will be accompanied by a Summary of Economic Projections. Here policymakers document their expectations for interest rates, growth, unemployment and inflation for the coming years and the longer run.\nWhat To Expect\nThe current narrative is the inflation is cooling and on track to return to the Fed\u2019s 2% annual target over the medium term. Of course, the Fed still wants to see more data confirming that view. It has asserted that rates may increase again if inflation does not move progressively lower.\nHowever, markets have increasingly taken the position over recent weeks that inflation is controlled and no more interest rate increases are coming. That\u2019s not entirely at odds with the Fed\u2019s perspective, but Fed officials still express some concern that inflation may not move consistently lower from here.\nA Soft Landing?\nThe other consideration is economic growth. The jobs market has remained robust to date, but jobs gains have slowed from high levels and could weaken further in 2024. There is some suggestion that with the yield curve flashing a recession warning and unemployment edging up, a 2024 recession may be coming.\nA recession would likely be a positive in taming inflation, but it would also present risks to the Fed\u2019s goal of maintaining full employment. If the economy sees something more severe than a so-called soft landing, and soft landings have historically been rare, then the Fed may be tempted to cut rates to help bolster the economy.\nFor now, the Fed has argued its goal is to maintain high rates for some time to manage inflation. Still, there is a potential scenario where a severe recession prompts the Fed to cut rates faster than planned.\nOverall, interest rates, as set by the Fed, are expected to move down in 2024 in neither rapid nor dramatic fashion. If inflation were to unexpectedly heat up that picture could change. A severe recession, which is also not expected, might equally prompt the Fed to cut rates at a faster pace.\n\nJoin The Conversation\nOne Community.

Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u00e2\u0080\u0094and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAppropriate monetary policy\u00e2\u0080\u009d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nPercent\nNote: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are percent changes from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 11\u00e2\u0080\u009312, 2024.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n2.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nThe confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.\n* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.\nPercentage points\nNote: Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the root mean squared error of projections for 2004 through 2023 that were released in the fall by various private and government forecasters. As described in the box \"Forecast Uncertainty,\" under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.\n1.

Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. Return to table\n3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. Return to table\nThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur.\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second and third years, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \u00e2\u0080\u009cfan charts\u00e2\u0080\u009d that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants' current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551\n"

Thanks to September's gains, the S&P 500 has posted its strongest first three quarters of the 21st century.\nEquities were given a lift this month by the Federal Reserve, which joined the ranks of global central banks easing monetary policy when it cut interest rates\u2014by 50 basis points\u2014for the first time in four years. The cut, according to officials, was a preemptive step to support the labor market, which data suggests is cooling but not falling apart.\nThe fourth quarter is historically a strong one for stocks, and analysts\u2014despite noting the likelihood of elevated volatility\u2014are broadly optimistic about the outlook.\nThe Labor Market in Focus\nAs in the third quarter, the economy is likely to be top of mind for investors throughout the fourth quarter. Wall Street will especially be looking at labor market data for evidence of deterioration that would worry the Fed.\nInitial unemployment claims will be a key data point to keep an eye on, according to analysts at Russell Investments. Claims data, which is released weekly, has less of a lag than other labor market data. \"These will provide the clearest real-time guidance on whether the U.S. economy is rebalancing or drifting towards recession,\" they say.\nInitial claims sustainably above 260,000 per week would be a red flag, in their view. The four-week average as of late September stood at about 225,000.\nFed officials, in their most recent economic projections, penciled in another half-percentage-point cut from interest rates this year. An uptick in unemployment coupled with job losses could spur the Fed into more aggressive action at one of its two policy meetings. That would bring interest rates more in line with market expectations, but would likely also spook investors and do some damage to stock portfolios.\nSoft Landing Seen Good for Stocks\nThe consensus on Wall Street is that the Fed is likely on track to achieve the soft landing it's been chasing for years, which bodes well for stocks.\nAs of late September, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow calculator estimated the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1% in the third quarter.\nSix of the last 10 rate-cutting cycles coincided with recessions. In those instances, the S&P 500 fell on average in the year after the first cut. In the four cycles that coincided with soft landings, the average return was in the high teens.\nConventional wisdom says that small-cap stocks should benefit most from interest-rate cuts since they are more likely to have floating-rate debt. However, BlackRock analysts found that large caps have outperformed small caps during rate-cutting cycles since 1984, and that the outperformance is most pronounced outside of recessions.\nAt the sector level, healthcare and consumer staples have performed the best during rate cuts, while communication services and tech have been the worst performers.\nThe S&P 500, excluding the Magnificent Seven, in the second quarter grew aggregate earnings for the first time since 2022. Third-quarter results, which companies will begin reporting in mid-October, are expected to show the profitability gap between tech mega caps and the rest of the market is continuing to narrow.\nThe Mag 7, meanwhile, faces the challenge of convincing Wall Street that their massive investments in artificial intelligence (AI) will pay off. They struggled to do so over the summer, sparking selloffs that the group has yet to fully rebound from. These stocks could continue to face pressure if their earnings fail to live up to Wall Street's lofty expectations.\nPolitics Could Stoke Volatility\nPolitical developments are likely to amplify stock volatility through the rest of the year, even if they don\u2019t fundamentally change the economic or business outlook.\nThe presidential election in November is one such event that could deliver Wall Street a short-term shock. BlackRock analysis found that, more often than not, the market's knee-jerk reaction to a presidential election is not indicative of its performance over the next year. Still, the presidential candidates have staked out positions on tariffs and corporate taxes that, if enacted, would surely change the outlook for U.S. businesses.\nConflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine could also keep the stock market on edge as long as they threaten to disrupt global trade or roil energy markets.\nExperts note, however, that volatility is a two-way street that can provide canny investors with opportunities to buy stocks at attractive valuations. Heightened volatility can also turbocharge short-term returns. Since 1990, the S&P 500 has returned 16% on average in the six months after the Cboe Volatility Index has risen to 29 or higher, compared with an average return of 5% in less volatile periods.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

The Federal Reserve (Fed) held its target federal funds interest rate steady in a range of 5.25% to 5.50% following its regularly scheduled two-day meeting, as widely expected by investors and economists. The Fed uses interest rate policy to carry out its maximum employment, price stability and moderate long-term interest rate mandates. The Fed adjusted its statement language to emphasize the improving balance of risks. The previous statement from December had maintained a policy tightening bias, indicating an intent to keep interest rates in restrictive territory, which the Fed dropped from their new statement. The Fed did, however, temper investor optimism around a March rate cut. Considerable policy tightening from a near-zero federal funds rate in early 2022 to 5.25% to 5.5% today helped drive the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, from a peak above 5.5% in 2022 to 2.9% in December. Other inflation metrics, like the Consumer Price Index (CPI), remain in the 3.5%-4.0% range due to differing calculation methodologies; the CPI is well off its high of 9.1% in June 2022. Without an update to the Fed\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections, which committee members update every other scheduled open market committee meeting, investors focused on the formal meeting statement and Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference comments. Removing a policy tightening bias from the prior version of the Fed\u2019s statement paired with new language that necessitates gaining \u201cgreater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%\u201d created a balanced message. Investors initially perceived Powell\u2019s press conference as dovish, suggesting rate cuts once additional data validates recent constructive data releases. On that topic, Powell noted, \u201cWe have seen six months of good inflation data \u2026 almost everyone on the committee is in favor of moving [rates] down this year, but the timing of that will be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2%.\u201d However, later in the press conference, Powell said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it is likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to [initiate rate cuts].\u201d Interest rate markets priced in a 45%-65% chance of a March rate cut earlier in the day but quickly fell to 30%-35% after Powell\u2019s comment. Important disclosures provided on last page 2 Situation analysis Market pricing of the expected path of the federal funds rate Sources: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, Bloomberg; 12/13/2023-1/31/2024 Stock prices and bond yields fell today, with around half the losses coming before the Fed\u2019s announcement. The S&P 500 finished the day down 1.6%, with year-to-date leaders such as the Communications and Technology sectors giving back the most. Foreign stocks lost less than most domestic indices on the day. Treasury bond yields fell (prices rose) earlier in the day after a small bank posted poor financial results and cut its dividend, marginally increasing the odds of rate cuts in the eyes of some investors. Ten-year Treasury yields fell 0.11% to 3.93% today, while two-year Treasury yields fell 0.11% to 4.23%. Monetary policy, defined as central bank interest rate target decisions, remains restrictive around the globe after aggressive rate hikes. However, rate hikes subsided in the fourth quarter as inflation across the globe continued trending lower. Investors anticipate relatively aggressive rate cuts from other major central banks in addition to the Fed, with six to seven cuts expected in 2024 from the European Central Bank and four to five cuts from the Bank of England. Global net central bank rate hikes (net hikes minus cuts), quarterly Source: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, Factset; 8/31/2004-1/31/2024 U.S. large-company stocks have posted solid performance so far in 2024, particularly those oriented to faster earnings growth. More recent mid- and small-company stock price moves appear positive, as do developed foreign stocks. Stock market breadth remains robust across most global equity markets, with more constituents participating in higher price trends than normal, and investor sentiment remains strong. Bond markets posted slightly negative returns year-to-date, with Treasury yields rebounding slightly after the steep decline in late-2023.

Equity securities are subject to stock market fluctuations that occur in response to economic and business developments. International investing involves special risks, including foreign taxation, currency risks, risks associated with possible differences in financial standards and other risks associated with future political and economic developments. Investing in emerging markets may involve greater risks than investing in more developed countries. In addition, concentration of investments in a single region may result in greater volatility. Investing in fixed income securities are subject to various risks, including changes in interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. Investment in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in lower-rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Investments in high yield bonds offer the potential for high current income and attractive total return but involve certain risks. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect a bond issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. The municipal bond market is volatile and can be significantly affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issues of municipal securities. Interest rate increases can cause the price of a bond to decrease. Income on municipal bonds is free from federal taxes but may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT), state and local taxes. There are special risks associated with investments in real assets such as commodities and real estate securities. For commodities, risks may include market price fluctuations, regulatory changes, interest rate changes, credit risk, economic changes and the impact of adverse political or financial factors. Investments in real estate securities can be subject to fluctuations in the value of the underlying properties, the effect of economic conditions on real estate values, changes in interest rates and risks related to renting properties (such as rental defaults).

              "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAre bank stocks poised for a rebound? Three picks for 2024\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n  By Philip van Doorn \n\n     Big banks still face challenges. Analysts at KBW favor those with 'inexpensive balance sheets' that can benefit from two industry trends. \n\n     Bank stocks have lagged behind the broad market for most of 2023, and the failure of three large institutions early in the year may have left a sour taste in investors' mouths. But some bank stocks are attractively priced right now, and targeted investments in the sector may turn out to be lucrative in 2024. \n\n     In a report on Dec. 6, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote that they were confident that the worst of downward earnings-estimate revisions was behind the industry. Investors typically want to see a steady increase in earnings estimates to support stock prices. But the reverse was taking place as many banks faced declining net interest margins - the spread between the interest rates they earn on loans and securities investments and what they pay for deposits or borrowings - as the Federal Reserve increased the short-term federal-funds rate and pushed long-term interest rates higher by reducing its bond portfolio. \n\n     For 2024, the KBW analysts recommend that investors hold stocks of banks with \"inexpensive balance sheets,\" as well as those banks expecting to increase their tangible book values significantly and banks with capital-markets businesses that are \"poised for a rebound.\" \n\n     Setting the stage \n\n     Last week's decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to hold firm on interest rates and the indication in the Fed's economic projections that the federal-funds rate would be cut three times in 2024 reinforced the expectation that better times are ahead for banks. \n\n     Here's a roundup of rate-cut predictions from 12 economists. \n\n     Here's a chart showing the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index BKX against that of the S&P 500 SPX this year through Friday, both with dividends reinvested: \n\n     You can see the plunge in early March for the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index and an upswing starting at the end of October and continuing this month. The March action was focused on the failures of Silicon Valley Bank of Santa Clara, Calif., on March 10 and Signature Bank of New York on March 12. Then the troubled First Republic Bank of San Francisco was closed by regulators on May 1. \n\n     The rapid rise in interest rates resulting from the Federal Reserve's change in policy early in 2022 took its toll as banks' deposit costs rose. The three failed institutions had specific problems: \n\n     Silicon Valley Bank was focused for decades on lending to and gathering deposits from venture-capital firms. The bank faced a perfect storm of deposit outflow because the VC companies' own sources of cash dried up. The bank was forced to raise cash by selling securities at a loss after bond prices had been pushed down as interest rates rose.Signature Bank of New York had a diverse business model, but its increasing focus on providing services to virtual-currency exchanges and related companies led to a damaged reputation and enough deposit outflow for state regulators to decide to close the bank.First Republic Bank was focused on serving high-net-worth clients, which included making jumbo mortgage loans, which were too large to be purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. This meant the bank was saddled with a large portfolio of loans with low interest rates, while costs for deposits were ballooning. That problem, along with paper losses on its securities portfolio, helped lead to a loss of confidence, a run on deposits and eventually a decision by state regulators to close the bank. \n\n     That bit of history may stop weighing on bank stocks, not only because of the expectation that costs for deposits will come down next year, but because of the way the stock market has been reacting to the Fed and to economic developments. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes BX:TMUBMUSD10Y has fallen to 3.91% from 4.88% at the end of October. As interest rates fall, bonds' market valuations increase. This eases pressure on banks and can boost their earnings as well as their regulatory capital ratios. \n\n     Top picks among large-cap bank stocks \n\n     David Konrad, managing director of equity research at KBW, favors three large banks, which he discussed during an interview with MarketWatch. \n\n     KeyCorp \n\n     Shares of KeyCorp (KEY) of Cleveland are down 18% this year, excluding dividends. But the share price has risen 37% over the past two months to close at $14.32 Friday. \n\n     KeyCorp pays a quarterly dividend of 20.5 cents a share. That annual dividend payout of 82 cents makes for a dividend yield of 5.73%, based on Friday's closing share price. \n\n     Konrad said that the bank has been \"earning little on its balance sheet\" and that its payout ratio (dividends to earnings per share) has been running at 80%. For the third quarter, the bank's net income available to common shareholders was 29 cents a share, down from 55 cents a year earlier. The bank reported a tax-adjusted net interest margin of 2.01% in the third quarter, narrowing from 2.74% a year earlier. \n\n     According to Konrad, \"almost 30% of their balance sheet is earning 30 basis points and will reprice by the end of 2024.\" KeyCorp had loaded up on 2-year Treasury notes before the Fed began raising interest rates and before deposit costs shot up. With so much of those securities and $30 billion in \"underwater\" interest-rate swaps maturing next year, Konrad expects KeyCorp's earnings to rise meaningfully. He said \"the payout ratio will probably be cut in half.\" \n\n     He sees a good \"risk-reward\" relationship for the stock \"as you get through the first quarter. Then capital risk subsides meaningfully as earnings increase.\" \n\n     Konrad estimates KeyCorp will earn $1.82 a share in 2024, which is ahead of the consensus earnings-per-share estimate of $1.29 among 23 analysts polled by FactSet. His price target for the stock is $15, which is only 5% ahead of the stock's closing price of $14.32 on Friday. The stock rose 8% last week. \n\n     Odeon Capital analyst Richard Bove also rates KeyCorp a buy, but with a higher 12-month price target of $15.45. In a note to clients on Thursday, Bove wrote: \"It appears that KeyCorp will be making major operating adjustments in the fourth quarter. This is likely to reduce earnings so that quarterly results may be disappointing.\" \n\n     He expects heavy action by the bank to reduce its exposure to loans considered to be higher-risk under new regulatory capital requirements. He also expects \"high severance and automation costs\" through 2024 as the bank reduces expenses, in part by laying off employees. \n\n     Those moves, an improved interest-rate environment and \"greater opportunities\" in capital markets as companies \"restructure their balance sheets,\" all should help KeyCorp's earnings to \"pop higher in 2025,\" following moderate earnings growth in 2024, Bove wrote. \n\n     Truist \n\n     Truist Financial Corp. (TFC) of Charlotte, N.C., was formed when BB&T Corp. merged with SunTrust of Atlanta in December 2019. The stock has fallen 17% this year, but it rose 29% from two months earlier to close at $36.70 on Friday. Truist pays a quarterly dividend of 52 cents share for a yield of 5.67% at Friday's close. \n\n     \"Truist is in the camp of a few banks that added duration at the wrong time, which created market-to-market capital concerns [as the value of securities investments declined] and a really low net interest margin,\" Konrad said. The bank reported a third-quarter net interest margin of 2.95%, narrowing from 3.12% a year earlier. Its third-quarter EPS to common shareholders came in at $1.07, down from $1.54 in the third quarter of 2022. \n\n     Earlier this year, Truist sold 20% of its insurance-brokerage business to Stone Point, a private-equity firm. According to a Semafor report in October, the two companies were negotiating the sale of the remaining 80% for about $10 billion. \n\n     The completion of that deal would not only increase Truist's regulatory capital ratios by about 300 basis points, it would improve its 2024 EPS to an estimated $4.40 from $3.70, Konrad said. \n\n     \"So this can be viewed as short-term,\" he said, \"but it also puts Truist in a position where they can grow.\" \n\n     Konrad has a $36 price target for Truist, which is now below the bank's closing share price of $36.70 on Friday. But Bove upgraded Truist to a buy rating Monday morning, with a price target of $40.45. \n\n     Goldman Sachs \n\n     \"Overall, we are still very positive on capital markets next year,\" Konrad said. He cited \"anemic levels for seven or eight quarters\" for the investment-banking industry. \"There is only so much time people can wait before doing transactions, capital debt or strategically,\" he added. \n\n     Shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) closed at $380.51 on Friday, up 11% for 2023. The bank pays a quarterly dividend of $2.75 a share, for a yield of 2.89%. \n\n     According to FactSet, Goldman Sachs trades for 1.1 times its tangible book value per share. That is below FactSet's P/TBV ratios of 1.3 for KeyCorp and 1.5 for Truist. But it may be of more interest that shares of Goldman archrival Morgan Stanley (MS) trade for 2 times tangible book value, according to FactSet. \n\n     Konrad sees \"less downside risk\" for Goldman because of its low valuation to book. He also believes a decline in interest rates will support capital-markets activity. Finally, he cited Goldman as a \"restructuring story,\" not only from its exit of its consumer-lending business, but from a reduction in the size of its balance sheet, to boost regulatory capital ratios. \n\n     Konrad's price target for Goldman is $400. \n\n     -Philip van Doorn \n\n     This content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

              "ESPN\nSoccer\nMessi tracker: Inter Miami games, goals, assists, more stats\nSebastian Salazar praises Lionel Messi for standing out in Inter Miami's 2-0 win against Real Salt Lake. (1:44)\nComing off arguably the biggest sports deal in American history, Lionel Messi's move to Major League Soccer was seismic for the sport's growth in the U.S. However, the Argentine superstar's challenge at Inter Miami CF will come with bigger expectations in a year where he will compete for trophies at club and even international level, with Argentina playing in the Copa America on American soil.\nEditor's Picks\n2024 MLS preview: Why is this your team's year?8dESPN\nMLS commissioner Garber Q&A: Capitalizing on Messi mania10dJeff Carlisle\nMessi shines, but can Inter Miami's veteran stars keep up the pace in MLS?7dKyle Bonagura\nSo far, Messi's Miami era couldn't have started any better. In his first two months last season, he's already helped them win one title (the Leagues Cup tournament that featured all MLS and Liga MX teams) and helped his side make the final of the U.S. Open Cup but fell 2-1 to the Houston Dynamo.\nAs for the MLS Cup? Messi and company will look to achieve that now in his second season. The expectations are now bigger with him playing in his first full season but will be alongside some new names, which includes former Barcelona teammate and one of the best strikers of his generation, Luis Su\u00e1rez.\nDespite not winning a single game in the preseason, Messi will look to take 2024 by storm to help his side win their maiden MLS Cup.\nSo far, Messi's tally is:\nGames played: 2\nGoals:\n1\nAssists:\n1\nIn all, Messi could win four trophies in his second MLS season:\nLeagues Cup\nU.S. Open Cup\nMLS Cup\nConcacaf Champions Cup: In the Round of 16\nCheck in here as ESPN tracks all of Messi's appearances for Inter Miami and provides instant analysis and reaction.\nFeb. 25: LA Galaxy 1-1 Inter Miami\nIt didn't take long for Messi to notch his first MLS goal of the season, scoring the equalizer in Sunday's 1-1 draw with LA Galaxy.\nInter Miami looked all but certain to record their first loss of the campaign before Messi and Jordi Alba -- that classic combination -- orchestrated a goal in the second minute of added time.\nPicking up the ball in midfield, Messi and Alba exchanged a series of passes before the 36-year-old Argentine poked home from eight yards out.\nFeb. 21, MLS opener: Inter Miami 2-0 Real Salt Lake\nWell, well, well. What a start for the Argentina superstar in South Florida!\nIt took Messi less than a half to notch his first assist of the season, dribbling into the heart of the RSL defense before a gentle lay-off for Robert Taylor, who cut through and finished across Zac MacMath.\nThe first goal of 2024 belongs to Robert Taylor!The set-up from Messi and a finish to make it 1-0. \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udcfa #MLSSeasonPass: https://t.co/D7skJOK7bn pic.twitter.com/cWCFmvGrjc\nOh, and there was a rude bit of dribbling over an RSL player who seemed to be injured: nice moves, Lio! The clip lit the internet on fire and helped mask a rather backs-against-the-wall second half for the Herons, who held firm despite waves of attacks until a neat counter-attack involving Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez was converted in style by Diego G\u00f3mez.\nAll in all, Inter Miami have three points in the bag from their opener. Up next: a trip to the west coast and a Feb. 25 date with LA Galaxy.",

It's nearly impossible to imagine any other male player ever reaching this incredible feat.\u00a0\nFrom his early days at Sporting CP to his stints with Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus, and currently Al Nassr, Ronaldo's career has been nothing short of legendary. His accolades include five Ballon d'Or awards, numerous titles across three of Europe's top five leagues, and five UEFA Champions League trophies.\nPart of Portugal's winning Euro 2016 side, Ronaldo also boasts the record for most international goals scored by a male player and is the only man to have played more than 200 games for his senior national team.\nOn September 5, 2024, Ronaldo struck his historic 900th goal, meeting a pinpoint cross from the left from Nuno Mendes before turning the ball home from close range, doubling Portugal's lead against Croatia in the UEFA Nations League. He was clearly emotional as he celebrated the famous moment.\nCristiano Ronaldo was emotional after scoring his 900th goal of his career \ud83e\udd79\u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/yVfDJYS0Ih\nThe Sporting News takes a look back at seven of Ronaldo's greatest goals of all time.\u00a0\nMORE: When will Cristiano Ronaldo retire?\u00a0| The leading goal-scorers in men's football history\nCristiano Ronaldo 900 goals: Best CR7 career strikes\nIn celebration of Ronaldo's achievement and his iconic No. 7\u00a0 jersey, we revisit seven of his greatest goals from his 900 \u2014 a fitting tribute to a player synonymous with sustained excellence while wearing one of the sport's most esteemed shirt numbers.\n900 GOALS \ud83d\ude31Cristiano Ronaldo becomes the first soccer player with 900 career goals. pic.twitter.com/nWBbCr8zKK\nManchester United vs. PortsmouthDate: January 30, 2008 \u00a0\nRonaldo scored this famous free-kick from around 30 yards out in a Premier League match against Portsmouth.

He picked up the ball near the halfway line, evaded multiple defenders, and calmly finished past the goalkeeper, highlighting his ability to create something out of nothing even in the tightest spaces.\nReal Madrid vs. ValenciaDate: May 4, 2014 \u00a0\nIn this La Liga match against Valencia, Ronaldo showed remarkable skill and improvisation to score this particular goal. After a low cross from Angel Di Maria, he flicked the ball backwards with his heel, sending it past the goalkeeper and into the net.\n\ud83d\udd19|OTD IN 2014:Exactly 7 years ago, Cristiano Ronaldo scored this unique goal against Valencia, Which is selected as the best goal in La Liga 2013/14 season.\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/jaUUX8rKI3\nReal Madrid vs. JuventusDate: April 3, 2018 \u00a0\nAgain during a Champions League quarterfinal match for Real Madrid against Juventus, Ronaldo executed perhaps the most perfect overhead kick.

              "Ronaldo reaches 900 career goals - the numbers behind the landmark\nCristiano Ronaldo has scored 900 goals in a career spanning 22 years\nCristiano Ronaldo reached a significant milestone on Thursday by scoring the 900th goal of his illustrious career.\nThe 39-year-old struck for Portugal in their Nations League game against Croatia, putting them 2-0 up.\nIt prompted an emotional celebration by the forward, as he dropped to his knees by the corner flag in tears.\nThe goal was his 131st for his country, while he has also scored at club level for Sporting Lisbon, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus and current club Al-Nassr.\n\"It was emotional because it's a milestone,\" Ronaldo said. \"It seems like any other milestone but only I know, and the people around me, how hard it is to work every day, to be physically and psychologically fit, to score 900 goals. \n\"It's a unique milestone in my career.\"\nScoring for more than two decades - Ronaldo's goals\nSuch is Ronaldo's longevity that if someone was born when he scored the first competitive goal of his career they would now be 21.\nHe struck a double for Portugal's Sporting on 7 October 2002 at the age of 17 years, eight months and three days in a 3-0 win against Moreirense.\nHe then moved to Manchester United, scoring 118 goals in 293 games for the Red Devils before joining Real Madrid in 2009 for a then world record 94m euros (\u00c2\u00a380m).\nIn nine years at the Spanish giants, he scored 450 goals in just 438 games before making the move to Italy to join Juventus.\nHe added another 101 goals to his tally during his three years with the Italian club before returning to United, where he would score 27 goals in 54 games.\nBut a return to the Red Devils did not have a fairytale ending - and in 2023 he made the move to Saudi Arabia with Al-Nassr, where he has got 68 goals and counting.\nIncredibly, almost half of Ronaldo's goals (437) have been scored since he turned 30  in February 2015.\nRonaldo's career goals\nHow Ronaldo scores his goals\nAccording to Opta:\nRonaldo has 164 penalties and 64 free-kicks in his 900 goals\nHe has scored 768 inside the area and 132 outside the area\nHe has scored 573 goals with his right foot, 173 with his left, 152 headers and two 'other'\nHe has 66 hat-tricks\n479 goals have been scored at home; 361 scored away from home; and 60 at neutral venues\nThe teams Ronaldo has scored most goals against in his career so far are: Sevilla (27); Atl\u00c3\u00a9tico de Madrid (25); Getafe (23); Barcelona (20); Celta de Vigo (20)\n\nRonaldo's goals over 23 seasons\nIs Ronaldo the top scorer ever?\nRonaldo celebrates on the pitch after scoring against Croatia\nThere is no central database to establish men's football's all-time top scorer, but Ronaldo was already leading the way for official games at a high level, having surpassed 800 goals during his second spell at Manchester United.\nBrazil legends Pele and Romario separately claimed to have scored more than 1,000 goals each, but filter out friendlies and those numbers drop down into the 700s.\nUnofficial statisticians RSSSF, external say Pele got 778 goals, while Romario scored 785.\nLionel Messi, Ronaldo's long-time rival, has scored 867 career goals to date.\n'I want 1,000' - Ronaldo not done yet\nNow 39, time is not on Ronaldo's side but the veteran is determined to keep playing until he has reached the figure of 1,000 career goals.\nSpeaking to his former Manchester United team-mate Rio Ferdinand in an interview on his YouTube channel, external, Ronaldo said he was confident he could hit the milestone within the next couple of years.\n\"I want to reach 1,000 goals,\" he said.\n\"If I don't have any injuries, this for me is the most important [thing]. I want that. \n\"All the goals I have scored, they have video.\"\nRonaldo could play into his 40s and there has been plenty of speculation about whether he will be still be playing for Portugal at the 2026 World Cup.\nBut he said that was not a priority, adding: \"Portugal winning the Euros is equivalent to winning a World Cup. I've already won two trophies for Portugal that I really wanted. \n\"I'm not motivated by that. I'm motivated by enjoying football and the records come naturally.\"\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser\nTop stories\nMan Utd manager latest & Ballon d'Or reaction\n'Not respected' Real Madrid absent from Ballon d'Or\nToo loyal?

              "Edition\nCristiano Ronaldo goal scoring record: List of all-time top scorers though totals are up for debate\nFeargal Brennan\nCristiano Ronaldo's career has been built on achieving the seemingly impossible with an near constant ruthless efficiency in front of goal.\nThe 39-year-old has sent goalscoring records tumbling throughout his trophy-laden career, becoming the top marksman in the history of both Real Madrid and the Portugal national team.\nAnd thanks to a career of goal scoring, Ronaldo has the all-time record for most goals in the history of men's football, as recognized by FIFA. He set the new mark on March 12, 2022 after a hat-trick for Manchester United and hasn't looked back since.\nHe is\u00a0now bagging goals for Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia to further stretch his lead atop the list of best-ever male scorers. He's still scoring for the Portuguese national team as well, netting his latest international goal in October 2024, having\u00a0reached 900 for club and country\u00a0in the September UEFA Nations League fixtures.\nMORE: List of top all-time international goalscorers: Ronaldo, Messi and others\nThe Sporting News reached out to FIFA to confirm the list, but the world governing body said it does not keep an official list of the statistics of the goals scored by individual players. That hasn't stopped other outlets, including\u00a0Goal.com, from listing the following top 10 \"FIFA-recognized goals\" totals:\n*Goals only in official matches, not including friendlies and exhibition\nStats correct as of October 22, 2024\nMORE: Updated list of Premier League top scorers\nRonaldo FIFA goals record\nRonaldo's goal-scoring exploits have had his fans \u2014 and some teammates \u2014 naming him the sport's ultimate 'GOAT'.\nThe \ud83d\udc10 @Cristiano \u2665\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/Xju55IYVfA\nHowever, the record itself is open to interpretation, with some football historians claiming it is impossible to know for certain due to the lack of accurate recording keeping in pre-20th century football.\nRonaldo overtook previous record holder Josef Bican, who scored an incredible 805 goals in the 24 years between 1931 and 1955. Although he played his first season as a pro in 2002/03, Ronaldo still shows little desire for retirement, though he did state in September 2024 that he is increasingly aware that he cannot go on forever.\nBut there is still plenty of dispute over Bican's actual numbers, with the late Brazilian icon Pele also claiming to have scored more than 1,000 career goals \u2014 though that total includes friendlies.\nMORE:\u00a0Top Champions League goal scorers\nNo consensus on goals world record for men\nIn terms of accepted recognition, Ronaldo has now established himself as the 'top goal scorer in recognized FIFA games', but the argument will rage on.\nThe Czech FA have regularly disputed Bican's figure of 805 with claims that he actually scored 821 when the final tallies were recorded.\nThe best goalscorer in football history? \ud83e\udd14The History and Statistics committee of the Czech FA counted all the goals scored by the legendary Josef Bican and we can declare he scored 821 goals in official matches.Jaroslav Kol\u00e1\u0159, the Head of the committee shares more details. pic.twitter.com/eYqTcGJf1p\nRonaldo and Lionel Messi have also surpassed that total and have record keepers on their side. The duo's figures are indisputable and not connected with amateur football, as some of Pele's goals are.\nBican's numbers illustrate the information gap between national federations and world-governing body FIFA, with his domestic supporters claiming the higher number is accurate. FIFA stated they could both be wrong with a possible total of 823, as per reports from ESPN.\nPele long claimed that his goal-scoring total was a whopping 1,283 \u2013 significantly higher than the 'official number' placed at 757. But there was never any clear proof to back up Pele's number.\nI have scored 1283 goals in my life,\nFIFA and South American body CONMEBOL have previously registered Pele with 1,281 goals in 1,363 games, but these include youth, friendly, and non-official games, which Ronaldo's figure does not include.\nAccording to the authoritative and widely cited RSSSF organization (Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation), their totals and rankings are also different.\nThe situation is made even more complicated by the Guinness Book of World Records, who hold Pele as the record setter, but with 1,279 goals, as exhibition goals are not prohibited by their count.\n.@Pele has the most football career goals at 1,279! Stick to your passions everyone: https://t.co/45XlIquRbn pic.twitter.com/9a8XMsQKQj\nOne way to interpret this jumble of information: Ronaldo is the new leader as far as 'goals in official games' with Pele's disputed numbers giving him an edge in 'overall games' including exhibitions.\nWhere has Ronaldo scored his goals?\nRonaldo has scored roughly half of his goals\u00a0at Real Madrid with 450.\nHe bagged 145 at Manchester United, as well as 133 with the Portugal national team, 101 with Juventus and five with first club Sporting CP. He has 72 goals for Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia.\nIn 2022/23 he finished fifth in the Saudi Pro League scoring table, despite joining in midseason. One season before, his 18 Premier League goals in 2021/22\u00a0were good for third in England's top division. In 2020/21, he finished as top scorer at Euro 2021 as well as in the Italian Serie A season with Juventus (29 goals).\nThere may be plenty more goals coming to add to that grand total given Ronaldo set a new goal-scoring record of 35 in the Saudi Pro League for the 2023/24 season.\nFeargal Brennan\n\n\nFeargal is a content producer for The Sporting News. He has been working with TSN since the start of 2022 after stints with Reach, Amazon UK and Squawka in a nomadic career in the football media pyramid.

That\u2019s the first thing I told them. We still have work to do, we\u2019re still pushing, we got to get better. It\u2019s nicer to get wins than to lose, but we\u2019re not where we want to be yet.\u201d\nBut the signs, at least lately, are promising, particularly when it comes to the defense. This was the sixth time in the past nine games the Bucks held an opponent under 100 points; they did it just once in the first 52.\n\u201cEverybody has to be on the same page, and I feel like the last couple of games, we\u2019re doing that and that\u2019s why our defense has taken a step,\u201d said Antetokounmpo, who had six assists and made two 3-pointers. \u201cHopefully, we can keep it up.\u201d\n\n\nDamian Lillard scored 16 points. Patrick Beverley added 14 points to help the Bucks beat the Bulls for the third time in four games this season.\nChicago\u2019s DeMar DeRozan became the 35th player in NBA history with 23,000 points. The six-time All-Star scored 12 points \u2014 all but two in the second half \u2014 and was 5 of 13 from the field after missing his first six shots.\nDeRozan got into it with Bobby Portis late in the third quarter. He picked up a flagrant foul and technical on the play, and criticized the referees after the game.\n\u201cI think as far as officiating, just call it fair,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cI think that\u2019s more so where the frustration comes from. When we come down, we feel like we getting hit. They come down and we barely touching them but they\u2019re getting the call. That kind of stings. Just the fairness of the calls I kind of think was the main focal of our frustration more so than anything.\u201d\nCoby White scored 22 points.\nVucevic had 17 points and nine rebounds before getting ejected early in the fourth quarter. Upset over a no-call when he missed a shot, he then delivered a hard foul on a driving A.J. Green and got thrown out with 9:27 remaining.\nIt was 84-76 after White hit two foul shots just under a minute into the fourth. But Green hit a 3 and the Bucks buried the Bulls from there.\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s just trust,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to trust one another. That\u2019s it, win or lose. ... (When we lose) it\u2019s gonna stink, but we have to have the same trust.\u201d\nAntetokounmpo had 23 points and eight rebounds as the Bucks grabbed a 58-44 halftime lead.\nThe two-time MVP simply had his way, whether he was making layups and dunks or setting up his teammates. He delivered a highlight reel play in the opening minutes when he drove and flipped a no-look, over-the-shoulder pass to Brook Lopez near the top of the key for a 3.\nThe Bucks led by 15 in the first quarter before the Bulls pulled within four early in the second. Milwaukee outscored Chicago 14-6 over the final four minutes of the half to break open a six-point game. Lillard started that spurt with a finger roll and two free throws. \nAntetokounmpo had an alley-oop layup in the closing minute to make it a 13-point game. DeRozan then got his first two points for Chicago when he made two free throws, but Jae Crowder nailed a corner 3 at the buzzer to send the Bucks to the locker room with a 14-point lead.\nUP NEXT\nBucks: Host the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday night.\nBulls: At Sacramento on Monday night. ___\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

              "Tracking Giannis Antetokounmpo's game-by-game performance, stats at Paris Olympics\nThrough three games, Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo and Greece are 1-2 at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\nAs we wait to hear the results from other matchups to determine what's next, it's time to highlight just how well the Greek Freak has been performing. After missing the end of the season in Milwaukee due to injury, Giannis looks to be back to being himself, as he's been dominating on the international stage during these matchups, showing how much the opportunity means to him.\nAnalyzing Giannis Antetokounmpo's stats for Greece\nGame 1. Greece vs. Canada (Canada wins 86-79)\nAntetokounmpo's most impressive performance to this point came in the opener against Canada, where he dropped 34 points on 11-of-17 field goal shooting, five rebounds and two assists. He was unstoppable on the offensive end, and even when Canada sent him to the foul line, he made them pay by shooting 12-of-15 at the stripe.\nDespite Antetokounmpo's strong effort, Greece could not overcome a Canada team loaded with star NBA talent on a roster that features Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, R.J. Barrett and Dillon Brooks, among a handful of others. Greece only had one other double-digit scorer, with Kostas Papanikolaou doing his best to help Giannis Antetokounmpo while others struggled.\nGame 2. Greece vs. Spain (Spain wins 84-77)\nAgainst Spain, Antetokounmpo wasn't quite as dominant as he was against Canada, but he still took over for Greece, dropping 27 points on 12-of-17 shooting, 11 rebounds, three assists and two steals. One could argue that he was even more commanding in this one due to his stat-sheet-stuffing, doing everything he could in every aspect of the game to try and will this team to victory.\nOnce again, Antetokounmpo did not get much help from his teammates, as only one other player clocked double-digit points. It was also going to be difficult to stop Spain, led by Santi Aldama of the Memphis Grizzlies, when they shot an astounding 48.4 percent from deep. That shooting, paired with Greece's non-Antetokounmpo struggles, sent the team to 0-2.\nGame 3. Greece vs. Australia (Greece wins 77-71)\nWith their backs against the wall, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Greece came out like a team that knew it had to win in their matchup versus Australia. Scoring-wise, Antetokounmpo wasn't as dominant as he was in the other games, having tallied 20 points, but that was because he finally got a boost from others, as three other Greece played hit double figures, led by Thomas Walkup's 18.\nWith his teammates taking a sizeable portion of the scoring load off of his shoulders, Antetokounmpo got to show off his facilitating prowess more than in the previous two games, tallying six assists. After an all-around team effort, Greece got their first win of the 2024 Paris Olympics by beating Australia, and they now wait to see the outcome of other games to determine what's next.\nGiannis Antetokounmpo's current Olympics averages: 27 points, 7.7 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 1.3 steals while shooting 68.9 percent from the field and 25 percent from deep.\nStay tuned for more Milwaukee Bucks analysis.\nmanual\n\u00c2\u00a9 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved.

              "Giannis Antetokounmpo\nGiannis Sina Ougku Antetokounmpo was born in Athens in 1994. The third oldest of five to Nigerian immigrants Charles and Veronica Antetokounmpo, Giannis comes from the quintessential basketball family. His brothers Thanasis and Kostas play for the NBA's Bucks and Lakers, respectively. Giannis's youngest brother Alexander currently plies his trade at Domenican High School in Milwaukee. Before being drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks in 2012, he appeared in 26 games for Filathlitikos AO of the Greek second division and averaged 9.5 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game while shooting 62.1 percent from two-point field goal range en route to a Greek League All-Star Game nod. Giannis has represented Greece at the highest level of international competition, participating in the FIBA World Cup in 2014 and 2019. In the latter tournament, Antetokounmpo averaged 14.8 points, 8.8 rebounds and 2.4 assists in five games, leading his country to the tournament's second round. Giannis has been active in the charitable matters, donating food at the Milwaukee Community Center and hosting charity tournaments with his brothers in Greece. You can follow him on Twitter and Instagram @Giannis_An34. Prior to joining the NBA and making his way to stardom, Antetokounmpo spent two seasons as a teenager playing in Greece. In 2011-12, he participated with the senior men's Greek B Basket League (third division) for the Filathlitikos team. Despite signing a four-year deal with CAI Zaragoza of the Spanish League in 2012, the forward stayed with Filathlitikos for the entire season. The 18-year-old played in 26 games and provided 9.5 points on 46.4 percent from the field with 5.0 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 1.0 blocks. He also played in the 2013 Greek League All-Star Game as a special selection by the coaches. The forward would compete in the 2013 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship and averaged 8.0 points, 7.6 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 10 games for Team Greece. Antetokounmpo then made himself available for that year's Draft.\n\nRotoWire provides millions of annual users with the latest fantasy sports, daily fantasy sports, and sports betting news, information, tools, and more.

              "Golden State Warriors\nCharlotte Hornets\nStephen Curry returns home, scores 23 points to lead Warriors past Hornets 115-97\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- \u2014 Stephen Curry scored 23 points with four 3-pointers in his annual homecoming game and the Golden State Warriors beat the Charlotte Hornets 115-97 on Friday night for their third straight win.\n              Curry, who grew up here and starred at nearby Davidson College before entering the NBA draft as a first-round pick in 2009, had 12 points in the pivotal third quarter as the Warriors blew open a close game.\n              Curry has always relished returning to play in Charlotte and seeing family and old friends, but the previous four games here have resulted in losses.\n              \u201cAt this stage (of my career) I can probably count on one hand how many times I get to come back here,\" Curry said. \u201cIt was nice seeing a lot of familiar faces in the crowd. And, it was nice to actually get a win.\u201d\n Andrew Wiggins had a big role in that, turning in another strong game with 20 points, eight rebounds and eight assists.\n Trayce Jackson-Davis added 18 points for the Warriors, who are in 10th place in the Western Conference standings and battling the Houston Rockets for a spot in the play-in tournament. The Rockets won their 11th straight, 101-100 over the Utah Jazz on Friday night and are a game behind the Warriors.\n Fred VanVleet had 22 points, Amen Thompson added 18 points and 14 rebounds while Jabari Smith, Jr. scored 14 points for the Rocke\n              Warriors coach Steve Kerr said that is a reflection of just how tough the West is this season.\n              \u201cWe had a similar record last year and we were the sixth seed,\u201d Kerr said.\n              Golden State limited Charlotte to 41% shooting and held its third straight opponent to fewer than 100 points.\n              \u201cI feel like we are starting out the game engaged on the floor and talking, and that has carried over,\u201d Jackson-Davis said. \n Miles Bridges had 22 points and nine rebounds to lead Charlotte, which failed in its bid to win back-to-back games for the first time since the All-Star break.\n              Curry always packs the Spectrum Center and Friday night was no exception.\n              With his brother Seth and father Dell looking on, Curry finished the game 9 of 18 from the field. Seth plays for Charlotte but is out with an ankle injury, while Dell is a broadcaster for the Hornets.\n              Curry admitted there has always been a \"curiosity\" about playing for the Hornets, where his father was a star but said his intentions are to remain in the Bay Area.\n              Charlotte rookie Brandon Miller briefly left the game with 8 1/2 minutes left after his leg got tangled up with Draymond Green while going for a rebound. He had just 12 points after making a career-high seven 3s and scoring 31 points on Monday night.\n              Green, who was ejected from the Warriors last game against Orlando, was later whistled for a foul when he appeared to push Charlotte\u2019s Grant Williams to the ground. Coach Steve Kerr challenged the call, but the play was upheld.\n              The Warriors had no problems scoring against the Hornets, repeatedly taking advantage of breakdowns by Charlotte\u2019s defense, finding wide open players underneath the basket on three different occasions.\n              \u201cTrayce (Jackson-Davis) did a great job on the boards today, gave them second opportunities, and with the Warriors, you can\u2019t do that with everybody on their team who can shoot,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cThey were making shots, they were cutting hard and they were getting second-chance points.\u201d \n              The Warriors played without Klay Thompson, who sat out with tendinitis in his right knee.\n Chris Paul got the start in his place and had 11 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, including a lob over three players to Jackson-Davis for a dunk.\n              Jackson-Davis said Paul thought he threw the ball over his head.\n              \u201cI had some sneaky bunnies and I went up and got it,\u201d Jackson-Davis said. \n              UP NEXT\n              Warriors: Visit Spurs on Sunday night.\n              Hornets: Host Clippers on Sunday night.\n              ----\n              AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba\nRegular Season Series\nGame Information\n2024-25 Pacific Standings\n2024-25 Southeast Standings\nNBA News\nToronto takes on Charlotte for conference matchup\nWashington takes on conference foe Atlanta\nPhiladelphia and Detroit square off in conference showdown\n"

              "2024 Golden State Warriors Playoffs Picture after loss vs Minnesota Timberwolves: Updated standings, schedule and\u00a0more\u00a0(March\u00a024)\nThe Golden State Warriors (36-33) faced a significant challenge as they clashed with the Minnesota Timberwolves (48-22) on Sunday night. With the Timberwolves holding the third spot in the Western Conference standings, securing a win was crucial for the Warriors, who are at risk of losing their position in the NBA Play-In Tournament.\nDespite the pressure, the Warriors displayed resilience in the first quarter, establishing a 27-18 lead over the Wolves. Veteran players Draymond Green and Klay Thompson set the tone for Golden State in the opening period, with Green contributing seven points and Thompson adding five.\nChris Paul and Gary Payton II showcased their playmaking skills for the Warriors in the first quarter, tallying four and three assists, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nSteph Curry ignited the second quarter after a slow start, pouring in 11 points to bolster the Warriors' lead to 54-46 at halftime. Andrew Wiggins and Jonathan Kuminga also made significant contributions with 11 points each in the first half.\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\nIn the third quarter, the Timberwolves mounted a comeback, narrowing the gap to three points with a score of 81-78. Mike Conley led Minnesota's resurgence with six points, while Nickeil Alexander-Walker also chipped in six points in the Timberwolves rally.\nDespite Minnesota's efforts, Steph Curry led the charge to maintain Golden State's lead, adding eight points in the quarter. Chris Paul and Klay Thompson also provided support with five points each, helping the Warriors retain control of the game.\nHowever, the Timberwolves completed the comeback, securing a 114-110 victory. Anthony Edwards played a pivotal role in Minnesota's win, contributing 23 points, eight assists, and six rebounds. Rudy Gobert and Naz Reid delivered double-double performances to aid Edwards in securing the victory.\nGolden State Warriors playoffs picture: Updated Standings\nAfter suffering from a loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Golden State Warriors now have a 36-34 record. While they still hold the 10th spot in the Western Conference, which makes them qualified for the NBA Play-In Tournament, they are on the verge of losing their place to the Houston Rockets (35-35).\nThe Rockets are currently on an eight-game winning streak. If Houston manages to extend their win streak to nine consecutive games, Golden State could lose their spot in the upcoming postseason.\nGolden State Warriors playoffs picture: Remaining schedule\nIt's going to be a challenging road ahead for the Golden State Warriors with only 12 games remaining in their regular season. The Warriors are next scheduled to face the Miami Heat (39-32) on Tuesday. This is a tricky situation for the \"Dubs\" as the Heat are also looking to improve their record and get out of the Play-In Tournament picture. With Miami only one game behind the sixth-placed Indiana Pacers, Florida's own will likely be going full throttle to secure a Playoff spot.\nAfter going up against last year's NBA Finals runners-up, the Warriors will need to deal with the Orlando Magic (42-29) next. Based on how the Magic have played so far this year, they've proven they have what it takes to keep up with the contenders in the league. Paolo Banchero has remarkably carried his team, which is why he got his first All-Star selection this year.\nThe Golden State Warriors will need to take full advantage of their matchup against the Charlotte Hornets (17-53) and San Antonio Spurs (15-56) after facing the two top teams in the Eastern Conference. Winning those two games would keep their Play-In Tournament hopes alive.\nTimberwolves Nation!

              "Sign Up for Our Newsletter\nGet breaking Lakers News direct to your inbox.\nLakers\u2019 2024-25 Season Win Totals: Where They Rank Among NBA Favorites\n Up next \nLakers Highlights: Anthony Davis Dominant In Opening Night Victory Over Timberwolves\n Author \n   Staff Writer   \nThe Los Angeles Lakers are entering the 2024-25 NBA season with renewed optimism and high expectations. The team has made significant changes, most notably by bringing in JJ Redick as their new head coach. Redick, a former NBA sharpshooter, is taking on his first head coaching role and has assembled an experienced staff to support him.\nThe Lakers are looking for big seasons from their LeBron James and Anthony Davis star duo. James re-signed with the team for two more years after an impressive performance at the 2024 Paris Olympics, where he earned MVP honors. Despite being in the latter stages of his career, James continues to defy age and expectations, particularly given that he\u2019s playing alongside his son this season.\nAnthony Davis remains a crucial piece for the Lakers, with the team hoping he can stay healthy and dominate on both ends of the court. Davis is considered a contender for the Defensive Player of the Year award, with odds of +1800.\nWhile oddsmakers have set the Lakers\u2019 projected win total at a modest 44.5 for the season, the team\u2019s mix of veteran leadership, star power, and exciting young talent has fans and players alike hoping for a successful campaign that exceeds these expectations.\nLakers Among the NBA Favorites\nThe Lakers\u2019 projected win total of 44.5 puts them behind several contenders in both conferences.\u00a0According to the consensus Betpack.com shortlist of sportsbooks, here\u2019s how they compare to some other notable teams.\nThe defending champion Celtics lead the pack with the highest projected win total. At the same time, young powerhouses like the Thunder and established contenders like the Nuggets are also expected to finish well above the Lakers.\nWestern Conference Landscape\nThe Western Conference remains highly competitive, with several teams projected to finish ahead of the Lakers:\nThe Lakers\u2019 total puts them in the middle tier of Western Conference teams, behind emerging contenders like the Thunder and established powers like the Nuggets[2][3].\nBetting Considerations\nFor bettors considering the Lakers\u2019 win total, it\u2019s important to note the odds:\nThis suggests that oddsmakers slightly favor the Lakers, falling short of 44.5 wins. Factors like team health, chemistry, and the competitive Western Conference all play into this projection.\nLast Word\nWhile the Lakers\u2019 projected win total of 44.5 may seem modest compared to top contenders, it reflects the uncertainty surrounding the team heading into the 2024-25 season. The health of stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis will be crucial, as will the performance of their supporting cast. Despite the lower projection, the Lakers\u2019 playoff experience and star power keep them in the conversation as a potential threat in the Western Conference.\nThe Lakers\u2019 win total offers an interesting opportunity for bettors. Those confident in the team\u2019s ability to stay healthy and exceed expectations might find value in the Over at +100 odds. Conversely, skeptics of the Lakers\u2019 durability and depth might lean towards the Under at -130.\nAs always, bettors must consider all factors, manage their bankroll wisely, and make informed decisions based on thorough analysis rather than emotion.\n You May Also Like \nLakers Injury Update: Rui Hachimura Placed In Concussion Protocol\nLakers News: Rajon Rondo Gives Insight Into Strategy Talks With LeBron James Leading Up To 2020 Finals Against Celtics Or Heat\nLakers Center Timofey Mozgov Still Not Pleased With Being Shut Down Last Season\nLakers News: Sam Mitchell On Kobe Bryant, \u2018I Hate Him\u2019\nSocial Links\nPoll\nLeBron James Welcomes Rams\u2019 Puka Nacua & Cooper Kupp Back Against Vikings\nLakers Unveil 2024 NBA Cup Home Court\nLakers News: Dalton Knecht Discusses Highlights From NBA Debut\nLeBron James Pleased With Lakers Playing Nearly Complete Game Vs.

              "2024 New York Yankees Schedule\nSchedule of Games Played for the 2024 New York Yankees | Baseball Almanac\n\"The 2024 New York Yankees baseball team is poised for an exciting season. The team's Opening Day roster, announced by manager Aaron Boone, reflects a blend of seasoned veterans and promising newcomers. Boone expressed optimism about the team's offensive capabilities, particularly highlighting the potential of catchers Jose Trevino and Austin Wells. The infield is anchored by Anthony Rizzo, Gleyber Torres, and Anthony Volpe, who are expected to contribute significantly both offensively and defensively. The outfield boasts the formidable duo of Aaron Judge and Juan Soto, with Judge aiming to replicate his 2022 AL MVP form and Soto expected to shine in the AL. However, the team's offseason was marred by some major injury concerns. Despite these challenges, the Yankees are hopeful for a successful season.

              "2024 Boston Red Sox Schedule\nSchedule of Games Played for the 2024 Boston Red Sox | Baseball Almanac\n\"The 2024 Boston Red Sox, a blend of youth and experience, is a team to watch. The management is hopeful about extending contracts to its young stars, indicating a commitment to nurturing talent. However, the team has faced criticism, with players like Jordan Montgomery reportedly preferring teams with stronger winning prospects. Despite this, the Red Sox have a robust roster, including promising players like Brayan Bello and Isaiah Campbell. The team's performance in the opening game, a 6\u00964 victory of the Seattle Mariners, was noteworthy. Manager Alex Cora sees the team as 'a lot younger, very athletic,' but acknowledges the essential roles of key veterans. As the season unfolds, the Red Sox will strive to strike a balance between youth and experience, aiming to prove their critics wrong and their supporters right.
