This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

However, the area of cropland and the number of crops harvested per growing season (cropping frequency) both also affect agricultural output and both also show sensitivity to climate variability and change3,4,5,6,7,8,9. We model the change in agricultural output associated with the response of crop yield, crop frequency and crop area to year-to-year climate variability in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, a key agricultural region. Roughly 70% of the change in agricultural output caused by climate was determined by changes in frequency and/or changes in area. Hot and wet conditions were associated with the largest losses and cool and dry conditions with the largest gains. All frequency and area effects had the same sign as total effects, but this was not always the case for yield effects. A focus on yields alone may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Efforts to reduce climate impacts to agriculture should seek to limit production losses not only from crop yield, but also from changes in cropland area and cropping frequency.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nWarming reduces global agricultural production by decreasing cropping frequency and yields\n                                        \n\n\nImpacts of recent climate change on crop yield can depend on local conditions in climatically diverse regions of Norway\n                                        \n\n\nContrasting area and yield responses to extreme climate contributes to climate-resilient rice production in Asia\n                                        \n\nReferences\nRosenzweig, C. et al.

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The sensitivity of agricultural output to climate change has often been estimated by modeling crop yields under climate change scenarios or with statistical analysis of the impacts of year-to-year climatic variability on crop yields. However, the area of cropland and the number of crops harvested per growing season (cropping frequency) also affect agricultural output and show sensitivity to climate variability and change. We model the change in agricultural output associated with the response of crop yield, crop frequency, and crop area to year-to-year climate variability in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, a key agricultural region. Roughly 70% of the change in agricultural output caused by climate was determined by changes in frequency and/or changes in area. Hot and wet conditions were associated with the largest losses, and cool and dry conditions with the largest gains. All frequency and area effects had the same sign as total effects, but this was not always the case for yield effects. A focus on yields alone may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Efforts to reduce climate impacts on agriculture should seek to limit production losses not only from crop yield but also from changes in cropland area and cropping frequency.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4.

The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4. Difference from average Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) for the state of Kansas during the February 12-26, 2024 period as compared to the long-term average. Source: Kansas Applied Remote Sensing (KARS), available at: https://greenreport-kars.ku.edu/.\u00a0 \n\nPossible consequences to the wheat crop\nThe effect of the high soil temperatures during February on the wheat crop will depend on several factors, particularly on temperatures during early March.\nWhere temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F and with little fluctuation during the recent period, such as in many areas throughout the southeast quarter of the state, the high temperatures should cause a gradual loss of cold hardiness. The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

However, the area of cropland and the number of crops harvested per growing season (cropping frequency) both also affect agricultural output and both also show sensitivity to climate variability and change3,4,5,6,7,8,9. We model the change in agricultural output associated with the response of crop yield, crop frequency and crop area to year-to-year climate variability in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, a key agricultural region. Roughly 70% of the change in agricultural output caused by climate was determined by changes in frequency and/or changes in area. Hot and wet conditions were associated with the largest losses and cool and dry conditions with the largest gains. All frequency and area effects had the same sign as total effects, but this was not always the case for yield effects. A focus on yields alone may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Efforts to reduce climate impacts to agriculture should seek to limit production losses not only from crop yield, but also from changes in cropland area and cropping frequency.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nWarming reduces global agricultural production by decreasing cropping frequency and yields\n                                        \n\n\nImpacts of recent climate change on crop yield can depend on local conditions in climatically diverse regions of Norway\n                                        \n\n\nContrasting area and yield responses to extreme climate contributes to climate-resilient rice production in Asia\n                                        \n\nReferences\nRosenzweig, C. et al.

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The sensitivity of agricultural output to climate change has often been estimated by modeling crop yields under climate change scenarios or with statistical analysis of the impacts of year-to-year climatic variability on crop yields. However, the area of cropland and the number of crops harvested per growing season (cropping frequency) also affect agricultural output and show sensitivity to climate variability and change. We model the change in agricultural output associated with the response of crop yield, crop frequency, and crop area to year-to-year climate variability in Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, a key agricultural region. Roughly 70% of the change in agricultural output caused by climate was determined by changes in frequency and/or changes in area. Hot and wet conditions were associated with the largest losses, and cool and dry conditions with the largest gains. All frequency and area effects had the same sign as total effects, but this was not always the case for yield effects. A focus on yields alone may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Efforts to reduce climate impacts on agriculture should seek to limit production losses not only from crop yield but also from changes in cropland area and cropping frequency.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day. \n\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in March in Paris\n\n\nEastgate, Washington, United States (4,999 miles away) is the far-away foreign place with temperatures most similar to Paris (view comparison). \n\n\nCompare Paris to another city: \n\n\n\nClouds \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe month of March in Paris experiences gradually decreasing cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy decreasing from 62% to 56%. \n\n\nThe clearest day of the month is March 31, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 44% of the time. \n\n\nFor reference, on December 29, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 74%, while on July 21, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 62%. \n\n\nCloud Cover Categories in March in Paris\n\n\n\nPrecipitation \n\n \n\n\n\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Paris, the chance of a wet day over the course of March is increasing, starting the month at 20% and ending it at 26%. \n\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 30% on May 22, and its lowest chance is 20% on March 2. \n\n\nProbability of Precipitation in March in Paris\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day. \n\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during March in Paris is essentially constant, remaining about 1.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.6 inches or falling below 0.2 inches. \n\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.2 inches on March 3. \n\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSun \n\n \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of March in Paris, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 36 seconds, and weekly increase of 25 minutes, 13 seconds. \n\n\nThe shortest day of the month is March 1, with 11 hours, 3 minutes of daylight and the longest day is March 31, with 12 hours, 51 minutes of daylight. \n\n\nHours of Daylight and Twilight in March in Paris\n\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Paris is 7:31 AM on March 1 and the earliest sunrise is 1 hour, 0 minutes earlier at 6:31 AM on March 30. \n\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:34 PM on March 1 and the latest sunset is 1 hour, 46 minutes later at 8:20 PM on March 31. \n\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) ends at 3:00 AM on March 31, 2024, shifting sunrise and sunset to be an hour earlier. \n\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:46 AM and sets 16 hours, 11 minutes later, at 9:57 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:41 AM and sets 8 hours, 15 minutes later, at 4:56 PM. \n\n\nSunrise & Sunset with Twilight and Daylight Saving Time in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation. \n\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in March in Paris\n\n\n\nMoon \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for March 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon. \n\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in March in Paris\n\n\n\nHumidity \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night. \n\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining around 0% throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on July 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time. \n\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in March in Paris\n\n\n\nWind \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages. \n\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.7 miles per hour throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on January 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on August 7, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour. \n\n\nAverage Wind Speed in March in Paris\n\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Paris throughout March is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 33% on March 12. \n\n\nWind Direction in March in Paris\n\n\n\nGrowing Season \n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (\u2265 32\u00c2\u00b0F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere). \n\n\nThe growing season in Paris typically lasts for 8.0 months (243 days), from around March 21 to around November 19, rarely starting before February 16 or after April 19, and rarely ending before October 23 or after December 20. \n\n\nDuring March in Paris, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 64% over the course of the month. \n\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Paris\n\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50\u00c2\u00b0F and a cap of 86\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Paris are gradually increasing during March, increasing by 50\u00c2\u00b0F, from 21\u00c2\u00b0F to 71\u00c2\u00b0F, over the course of the month. \n\n\nGrowing Degree Days in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSolar Energy \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation. \n\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Paris is increasing during March, rising by 1.4 kWh, from 2.6 kWh to 4.0 kWh, over the course of the month. \n\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in March in Paris\n\n\n\nTopography \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Paris are 48.853 deg latitude, 2.349 deg longitude, and 138 ft elevation. \n\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Paris contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 233 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 159 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (633 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (883 feet). \n\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Paris is covered by artificial surfaces (97%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (91%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and trees (23%). \n\n\n\nData Sources \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Paris, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. \n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Paris. \n\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Paris according to the International Standard Atmosphere  , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis   between the two locations. \n\n\nThe estimated value at Paris is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Paris and a given station. \n\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are: \n\n\nV\u00c3\u00a9lizy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Villacoublay Air Base (LFPV, 23%, 9 mi, southwest, 446 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis Orly Airport (LFPO, 34%, 9 mi, south, 151 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0093Le Bourget Airport (LFPB, 35%, 9 mi, northeast, 79 ft elevation change)\n\n\nPontoise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Cormeilles Aerodrom (LFPT, 9%, 22 mi, northwest, 187 ft elevation change)\n\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Paris and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data. \n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition  , by Jean Meeus. \n\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis  . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid. \n\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database  , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \n\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)  , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database  . \n\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com  . \n\n\nMaps are \u00a9 OpenStreetMap   contributors. \n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose.

Additionally, the bulletin also includes highlights regarding the boreal summer (June-July-August). Most of the reported findings are based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, using billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.\u00a0\n\n          August 2024 \u2013 Surface air temperature and sea surface temperature highlights:\u00a0\n  \n\nGlobal Temperatures\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally (together with August 2023), with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 16.82\u00b0C, 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August.\u202f\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was 1.51\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level and is the 13th month in a 14-month period for which the global-average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. *\u00a0\nThe global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record for any 12-month period, at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. These values are identical to those recorded for the previous two 12-month periods, ending in June and July 2024.\u00a0\nThe year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.23\u00b0C warmer than the same period in 2023. The average anomaly for the remaining months of this year would need to drop by at least 0.30\u00b0C for 2024 not to be warmer than 2023. This has never happened in the entire ERA5 dataset, making it increasingly likely that 2024 is going to be the warmest year on record.\u00a0\n*Datasets other than ERA5 may not confirm the 13 months above 1.5\u00b0C highlighted here, due to the relatively small margins above 1.5\u00b0C of ERA5 global temperatures for July and August 2023 and May, June, and August 2024 and differences among the various datasets.\u00a0\nEurope and other regions\u00a0\nThe average temperature for European land for August 2024 was 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August, making the month the second warmest August on record for Europe after August 2022, which was 1.73\u00b0C above average.\u00a0\u00a0\nEuropean temperatures were most above average over southern and eastern Europe, but below average over northwestern parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway.\u00a0\u00a0\nOutside Europe, temperatures were most above average over eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia.\u00a0\u00a0\nTemperatures were below average over far eastern Russia and Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan and the Sahel.\u00a0\nSea surface temperature\u00a0\nThe average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest value on record for the month, and only 0.07\u00b0C below August 2023.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe equatorial Pacific had below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs across the oceans remained unusually high over many regions.\u00a0\nAccording to Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S): \"During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record. This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest year on record. The temperature-related extreme events witnessed this summer will only become more intense, with more devastating consequences for people and the planet unless we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"\u00a0\nMonthly year-to-date global surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1991-2020 for the ten warmest years on record. 2024 is shown with a red line, 2023 with a yellow line, and all other years with grey lines. Each data point shows the average anomaly from January to the corresponding month. E.g. the value for August 2024 corresponds to the average anomaly from January to August 2024. Data source: ERA5.

The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day. \n\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in March in Paris\n\n\nEastgate, Washington, United States (4,999 miles away) is the far-away foreign place with temperatures most similar to Paris (view comparison). \n\n\nCompare Paris to another city: \n\n\n\nClouds \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe month of March in Paris experiences gradually decreasing cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy decreasing from 62% to 56%. \n\n\nThe clearest day of the month is March 31, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 44% of the time. \n\n\nFor reference, on December 29, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 74%, while on July 21, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 62%. \n\n\nCloud Cover Categories in March in Paris\n\n\n\nPrecipitation \n\n \n\n\n\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Paris, the chance of a wet day over the course of March is increasing, starting the month at 20% and ending it at 26%. \n\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 30% on May 22, and its lowest chance is 20% on March 2. \n\n\nProbability of Precipitation in March in Paris\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day. \n\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during March in Paris is essentially constant, remaining about 1.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.6 inches or falling below 0.2 inches. \n\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.2 inches on March 3. \n\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSun \n\n \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of March in Paris, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 36 seconds, and weekly increase of 25 minutes, 13 seconds. \n\n\nThe shortest day of the month is March 1, with 11 hours, 3 minutes of daylight and the longest day is March 31, with 12 hours, 51 minutes of daylight. \n\n\nHours of Daylight and Twilight in March in Paris\n\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Paris is 7:31 AM on March 1 and the earliest sunrise is 1 hour, 0 minutes earlier at 6:31 AM on March 30. \n\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:34 PM on March 1 and the latest sunset is 1 hour, 46 minutes later at 8:20 PM on March 31. \n\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) ends at 3:00 AM on March 31, 2024, shifting sunrise and sunset to be an hour earlier. \n\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:46 AM and sets 16 hours, 11 minutes later, at 9:57 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:41 AM and sets 8 hours, 15 minutes later, at 4:56 PM. \n\n\nSunrise & Sunset with Twilight and Daylight Saving Time in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation. \n\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in March in Paris\n\n\n\nMoon \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for March 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon. \n\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in March in Paris\n\n\n\nHumidity \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night. \n\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining around 0% throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on July 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time. \n\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in March in Paris\n\n\n\nWind \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages. \n\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.7 miles per hour throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on January 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on August 7, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour. \n\n\nAverage Wind Speed in March in Paris\n\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Paris throughout March is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 33% on March 12. \n\n\nWind Direction in March in Paris\n\n\n\nGrowing Season \n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (\u2265 32\u00c2\u00b0F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere). \n\n\nThe growing season in Paris typically lasts for 8.0 months (243 days), from around March 21 to around November 19, rarely starting before February 16 or after April 19, and rarely ending before October 23 or after December 20. \n\n\nDuring March in Paris, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 64% over the course of the month. \n\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Paris\n\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50\u00c2\u00b0F and a cap of 86\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Paris are gradually increasing during March, increasing by 50\u00c2\u00b0F, from 21\u00c2\u00b0F to 71\u00c2\u00b0F, over the course of the month. \n\n\nGrowing Degree Days in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSolar Energy \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation. \n\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Paris is increasing during March, rising by 1.4 kWh, from 2.6 kWh to 4.0 kWh, over the course of the month. \n\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in March in Paris\n\n\n\nTopography \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Paris are 48.853 deg latitude, 2.349 deg longitude, and 138 ft elevation. \n\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Paris contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 233 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 159 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (633 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (883 feet). \n\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Paris is covered by artificial surfaces (97%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (91%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and trees (23%). \n\n\n\nData Sources \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Paris, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. \n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Paris. \n\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Paris according to the International Standard Atmosphere  , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis   between the two locations. \n\n\nThe estimated value at Paris is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Paris and a given station. \n\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are: \n\n\nV\u00c3\u00a9lizy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Villacoublay Air Base (LFPV, 23%, 9 mi, southwest, 446 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis Orly Airport (LFPO, 34%, 9 mi, south, 151 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0093Le Bourget Airport (LFPB, 35%, 9 mi, northeast, 79 ft elevation change)\n\n\nPontoise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Cormeilles Aerodrom (LFPT, 9%, 22 mi, northwest, 187 ft elevation change)\n\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Paris and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data. \n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition  , by Jean Meeus. \n\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis  . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid. \n\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database  , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \n\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)  , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database  . \n\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com  . \n\n\nMaps are \u00a9 OpenStreetMap   contributors. \n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site. \n\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands. \n\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader. \n\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page. \n\n\nLanguage\n\n\u00a9 Cedar Lake Ventures, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're permitted to use this graph as long as you provide prominent attribution with a link back close to the use of the graph.

This month was 1.51\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, marking the 13th month in a 14-month period where global temperatures exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. The year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, the highest on record for this period.In Europe, August 2024 was the second warmest on record, with temperatures 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Southern and eastern Europe experienced the highest anomalies, while northwestern parts of Ireland, the UK, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway were below average. Globally, temperatures were most above average in eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia, and below average in far eastern Russia, Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan, and the Sahel.The average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest on record for the month. The equatorial Pacific showed below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs remained unusually high in many regions.Hydrologically, August 2024 was drier than average over most of continental Europe, including southern UK and Ireland, the Alps, the Balkans, northwest Russia, and eastern Fennoscandia, with droughts and wildfires in the south and east. Conversely, Iceland, northern UK and Ireland, much of Fennoscandia, the northern seaboard of continental Europe, and western Russia and T\u00fcrkiye experienced above-average precipitation, leading to floods and damage in some areas. Outside Europe, eastern North America, central Russia, eastern China, and eastern Australia were wetter than average, while Mexico, southern North America, regions of Russia, China, most of South America, and Southern Africa were drier than average, with wildfires in Canada, Siberia, and Brazil.The global-average temperature for boreal summer (June\u2013August) 2024 was the highest on record at 0.69\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, surpassing the previous record from June\u2013August 2023 (0.66\u00b0C). The average temperature for European land for summer 2024 was the highest on record at 1.54\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Summer 2024 was predominantly wetter than average in western and northern Europe, while most of the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe experienced drier-than-average conditions, sometimes associated with drought.The Copernicus Climate Change Service provides detailed monthly climate bulletins based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft, and weather stations worldwide. The service is part of the EU's Copernicus Earth observation programme, which aims to provide reliable and up-to-date information about the planet and its environment.",

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth\u2019s Best Employer, and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work.

(NYSE, TSX: SHOP), announced today financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship,\" said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. \"More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify's unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations. We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin. We delivered across every metric,\" said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. \"Our results underscore our commitment to providing exceptional value to our merchants through focused operating execution and efficiency. As a high-growth global technology leader in commerce, we remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and investing in opportunities to achieve sustainable growth and long-term profitability.\"\nSecond-Quarter Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to the second quarter of 2023)\nGross Merchandise Volume1 (\"GMV\") increased 22% to $67.2 billion\nRevenue increased 21% to $2.0 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 25% after adjusting for the sale of our logistics businesses\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 19% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the growth of GMV and continued penetration of Shopify Payments\nGross Payments Volume2 (\"GPV\") grew to $41.1 billion, representing 61% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $31.7 billion, or 58%\nSubscription Solutions revenue increased 27% to $563 million, driven by growth in the number of merchants and pricing increases on our subscription plans\nMonthly Recurring Revenue3\u00a0(\"MRR\") as of June 30, 2024 increased 25% to $169 million, driven by growth in merchants. Shopify Plus contributed $52 million, or 31%, of MRR\nGross profit dollars grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.1% compared to 49.3%, driven primarily by the lack of the dilutive impact of the logistics businesses and changes in pricing plans partially offset by continued growth of payments\nFree cash flow4 was $333 million compared to free cash flow of $97 million\nFree cash flow margin4\u00a0for the quarter was 16% compared to free cash flow margin of 6%\nCash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and we had a net cash position of $4.1 billion after consideration of our outstanding convertible notes\n2024 Outlook\nThe outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control. Please see \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect:\nRevenue to grow at a low-to-mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;\nGross margin to be higher by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q2 2024;\nGAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;\nStock-based compensation to be $120 million; and\nFree cash flow margin to be similar to Q2 2024.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the financial tables below for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures.\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nFree Cash Flow Reconciliation\nThe following table illustrates how free cash flow is calculated in this press release:\n\u00a0\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Analysis\nThe following table converts our GMV, revenues, gross profit and (loss) income from operations using the comparative period's monthly average exchange rates. The table below setting out the effect of foreign exchange rates on GMV and our consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\u00a0\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\u00a0\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\r\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\r\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR. Please refer to \u201cKey Performance Indicators\u201d below for more information.\r\n4. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin are non-GAAP financial measures.

Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results\n\nConsolidated results came in at the high end or ahead of guidance for key performance metrics\nBROOKLYN, N.Y., July 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ETSY), which operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world, today announced results for its second quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024.\n\"We are pleased that second quarter consolidated results included sequential acceleration of Etsy marketplace year-over-year GMS, higher consolidated revenue both year-over-year and sequentially, and strong adjusted EBITDA profitability,\" said Josh Silverman, Etsy, Inc. Chief Executive Officer. \"Gifting is proving to be a winning theme - driving growth as a key source of differentiation for Etsy. We are making excellent progress with other bold moves and investments meant to raise consideration among buyers - to help us stand apart more than ever. While this is a challenging environment for our type of goods, we are focused on reigniting Etsy marketplace growth and gaining market share.\"\nSecond quarter 2024 performance highlights include:\n\"We are investing in strategic growth areas including Gifting, highlighting the best of Etsy through Quality initiatives, launching a new Loyalty Program, expanding our App, and more, while also carefully managing expenses to deliver very healthy profit,\" said Rachel Glaser, Chief Financial Officer. \"In fact, second quarter adjusted EBITDA was about 28%, ahead of our guidance and up 130 bps from last year, as we gained leverage year-over-year on employee costs and cost of revenue, which was partially offset by higher level of performance marketing investments to help fuel buyer growth and frequency. The Etsy marketplace's record level of active buyers has held up quite well, and we added approximately 12 million new and reactivated buyers during the quarter.\"\n______________________________________\n1\u00a0Etsy Gifting GMS: Estimate based upon word 'gift' in the listing title, shipped with a gift message, or other signal the item was purchased as a gift.\n2\u00a0Source: Consumer Edge spend data from sampling of credit card transactions from online 'gifting' peers Zola, Zazzle, Minted, Uncommon Goods, Hallmark, and Mark and Graham.\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Summary(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThe financial results of Elo7 have been included in our consolidated financial results for the prior year periods, as Elo7 was sold on August 10, 2023.

In 2024, we are focused on building buyer consideration by making it easier to 'find the best stuff' on Etsy, driving association that Etsy sellers offer great value, and making shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable. The below highlights some of our key initiatives:\nProduct Highlights:\nIn order to drive\u00a0buyer Consideration, we are making progress in our efforts to position Etsy as an indispensable partner for Gifting, with broad based investments positively impacting our performance:\nWe launched a \"Made for You\" microsite to increase consideration and help buyers get the most out of shopping on Etsy. It features our latest product improvements, including Gift Mode, the Deals Tab, the Etsy's Picks badge, and Etsy Purchase Protection.\u00a0The microsite was launched globally in June, is available in 11 languages, and has already attracted hundreds of thousands of users.\nTo help buyers 'find the best stuff on Etsy,' we invested in the following Quality initiatives:\nAligned with our efforts to make shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable, and also to drive international growth, we recently secured a new preferred shipping partnership with a third party to simplify cross-border logistics for Turkish sellers. We continued to expand Etsy Payments globally, with about 98% of our GMS now processed through our platform.\nWe worked to continue to build trust in our marketplace with a roll out of our new seller set-up fee in additional regions. This fee, meant to strengthen our new shop onboarding process, and in combination with added trust and safety enforcement - resulted in a significant decline in fraudulent onboarding, while continuing to provide ample access for creative entrepreneurs to start businesses on Etsy.\nMarketing Highlights:\nWe further developed plans to launch our new Etsy Insider Loyalty program, currently scheduled to be introduced in invitation-only beta form to targeted occasional Etsy U.S. buyers in mid-September. Etsy Insider will be buyer-fee based, offering free U.S. domestic shipping on millions of items, item discounts, first access merchandise and other benefits, with a goal to drive frequency and loyalty over time.\nWe now manage all of Etsy's paid search campaigns in-house, enabling us to reallocate the significant external costs of managing these campaigns directly into the campaigns themselves.\nTo support our U.S. sellers, we launched a targeted marketing campaign to promote the availability of a seller financing program offered via a third party partner. We've observed strong initial engagement from the campaign signaling interest and need for additional capital among our seller community.\nEtsy's Creator Collective program, which incentivizes creators and influencers to drive purchases, social conversation, and unique content for Etsy by providing affiliate links to any page on Etsy.com and boosting top posts, has reached over 260,000 participants.\nReverb\nDepop\nConsolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance\u00a0\nQ3 24 Guidance\nGMS \nWe currently estimate that Consolidated GMS will decline in the low single digit range on a year-over-year basis. \nTake Rate\nSimilar to Q2 24\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n~27%\nRegarding our full-year 2024 outlook, we reiterate that consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin should come in at least the same as the 2023 result.\nPlease note that our guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain unchanged at current levels.\nWith respect to our expectations under \"Consolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance \" and outlook for the remainder of 2024 above, reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA; in particular, stock-based compensation expense, foreign exchange (gain) loss, interest and other non-operating income, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, acquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses, and other non-recurring expenses.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\u00a0\nEtsy will host a video webcast conference call to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, which will be live-streamed via our Investor Relations website (investors.etsy.com) under the Events section. A copy of the earnings call presentation will also be posted to our website.\nA replay of the video webcast will be available through the same link following the conference call starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time this evening, for at least three months thereafter.\nAbout Etsy\nEtsy, Inc. operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world.

asset impairment charges;\u00a0restructuring and other exit (income) costs; and retroactive non-income tax expense. We also provide Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP financial measure that presents Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because they are key measures used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans, determine incentive compensation, and assess the health of our business. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more in our platforms.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business as they remove the impact of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net income, revenue, and our other GAAP results.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and the Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNet income\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 53,005\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 61,915\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 116,009\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 136,452\nExcluding:\nInterest and other non-operating income, net \n(3,947)\n(5,934)\n(9,257)\n(11,623)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n25,972\n(56,501)\n42,623\n(49,767)\nDepreciation and amortization\n27,087\n22,946\n53,933\n46,118\nStock-based compensation expense (1)\n74,717\n77,281\n145,400\n145,964\nForeign exchange (gain) loss\n(4,861)\n(1,852)\n(11,116)\n765\nAcquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses \n234\n289\n2,132\n578\nAsset impairment charges\n\u2014\n68,091\n\u2014\n68,091\nRestructuring and other exit (income) costs \n(76)\n\u2014\n342\n\u2014\nRetroactive non-income tax expense\u00a0 (2)\n7,244\n\u2014\n7,244\n\u2014\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 179,375\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 166,235\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 347,310\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 336,578\nDivided by:\nRevenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 647,806\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 628,876\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,293,760\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,269,753\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n27.7\u00a0%\n26.4\u00a0%\n26.8\u00a0%\n26.5\u00a0%\n(1)\nStock-based compensation expense included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented below is as follows:\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCost of revenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,787\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,171\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16,491\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 15,417\nMarketing\n5,882\n6,107\n12,319\n11,369\nProduct development\n38,441\n38,220\n72,505\n74,929\nGeneral and administrative\n21,607\n24,783\n44,085\n44,249\nStock-based compensation expense \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 74,717\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 77,281\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,400\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,964\n(2)\nRetroactive non-income tax expense related to the digital services tax legislation in Canada, which was enacted on June 28, 2024 retroactive to January 1, 2022.\n\u00a0\n View original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/etsy-inc-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211378.html\nSOURCE  Etsy, Inc.\n\nEmail Alerts\n\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

    "Document3": "Etsy Doubles Down On Handmade To Build A Moat Around Its Marketplace\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 13: \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.,  said ... [+] CEO Josh Silverman. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nThe Etsy marketplace, the flagship of Esty Inc., which also includes resale site Depop and musical instrument specialist Reverb, was founded in 2005 to connect buyers with makers, artists, designers and crafters selling their unique handmade, originally designed new or specially-selected vintage items.\nHowever, as its seller community grew, inventory exploded and it expanded globally, the marketplace became increasingly difficult for customers to maneuver. Most significantly, it became flooded with goods that didn\u2019t meet the criteria that each item had to come with the maker\u2019s personal touch.\nEtsy\u2019s founding mission was to \u201ckeep commerce human\u201d and after hitting speedbumps over the last two years, it is doubling down on that mission or as CEO Josh Silverman said in the recent earnings call, \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.\u201d\nDisappointing Performance\nIn the first quarter 2024 ended March 31, Etsy marketplace reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sale (GMS) over the same period last year, from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion in 2024. Last year\u2019s first quarter was a bad one too, down 4.7% from $2.8 billion in 2022.\nFiscal 2023 was another disappointment. Esty marketplace GMS dropped 2% from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, while the number of active sellers exploded from 5.4 million to 7 million. Active buyers advanced 3% to 92 million.\nOn a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2022\u2019s loss was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge to write down the acquisition value of Depop and Brazilian-marketplace Elo7, both acquired at premium prices in 2021. Elo7 was divested in mid-2023 for an undisclosed sum. The company doesn\u2019t report revenues or net income on a brand level; however, Etsy marketplace accounted for 88% of GMS in 2023 and 86% in first quarter 2024.\nNonetheless, Esty Inc. ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting some 225 employees. \u201cWhile the Etsy marketplace is still more than double the size it was in 2019, we needed to acknowledge and adjust for today\u2019s realities,\u201d Silverman said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment, and GMS has remained essentially flat since 2021. This means we are not bringing our sellers more sales, which is the single most important thing we can do for them.\u201d\nThose challenges continued in the first quarter 2024, if not worsened, as he said in the earnings call, it was \u201canother challenging quarter for our type of goods, signaling to us that buyers shopped a bit less with us than they did in the prior year.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cMacro economic conditions also continue quite challenging in our other top markets, the U.K. and Germany. These headwinds are real. They do not appear to be abating and are impacting our sales.\n\u201cWhile so far, 2024 is still proving to be a cyclically challenging period for us, rest assured that we are clear eyed about what we need to accomplish to set Etsy back on a growth path.\u201d\nCourse Correction\nSilverman explained Etsy\u2019s path to growth starts with cleaning up the marketplace by removing sellers and listings that violate its handmade policy; what he phrased as decluttering Etsy\u2019s aisles.\nSo far the marketplace has removed millions of listings \u2013 115% more than in the previous year \u2013 and cut \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of sellers from its roles.\nWith less junk cluttering its virtual aisles, Etsy can better curate customers\u2019 selections based upon their shopping mission and elevate the visibility of items that are more relevant to the shoppers\u2019 needs and desires.\nFor example, Etsy\u2019s customers regularly frequent the site to find unique gift ideas and it just launched a Gift Mode platform to make gifts easier to find by product, gift occasion and recipient profile.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nWhile it aims to emphasize the human connection in Etsy customers\u2019 shopping journey, it is turning to digitally-powered large language models and GenAI tools to enhance the online shopping experience and match the shopping mission with available inventory.\n\u201cWe have a very significant opportunity to focus more on window shopping, gauging buyer experiences to spark imagination, capture impulse buys, get to know your tastes and preferences better and expand your understanding of the breadth of products available on Etsy, making Etsy more fun, engaging, inspiring and surprising,\u201d he said in the call.\nHoning The Human Connection\nFollowing the earnings call, Silverman sent a message to sellers explaining Etsy\u2019s new Creativity Standards, which he said represented not a policy change but heightened enforcement of existing guidelines.\nAll items for listing on Etsy must be either:\n\n\nAnd each item will now carry details on listing pages specifying whether its is Made by, Designed by, Sourced by or Handpicked by. He explained, \u201cVintage falls into the \u2018handpicked\u2019 category. And most craft and party supplies will live in the \u2018sourced by\u2019 section.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cOur research shows that the top thing buyers want to learn about is your involvement in your items. We\u2019ve also heard from you, sellers, asking us to better distinguish between items crafted solely by you and items made using production partners or other tools. This way, your unique craft shines through.\u201d\nTo make sure sellers are serious about complying with the guidelines, Etsy marketplace has established a $15 setup fee for new sellers. And it also will launch a loyalty program later in the year for frequent shoppers.\nToo Late?\nAll of which are admirable and much needed efforts by Silverman and his team to set Etsy back on course, but the question remains how did they let it go so far in the wrong direction?\nEtsy\u2019s been a prime destination to gifters for years, so what took it so long to turn on that spigot?\nIt consistently reports growth in active buyers and recovery of lapsed buyers, so why wasn\u2019t a loyalty program put on the front burner in 2021 when Etsy Inc. active buyers rose nearly 18% to 96 million?\nAnd as far back as 2022, it announced \u201cstepped-up Handmade Policy enforcement.\u201d Yet it\u2019s taken two years to put teeth into those policies.\nIn the latest earnings call, Silverman revealed that Etsy was sitting on more than 100 million lapsed buyers, but once a customer loses faith in a company, it\u2019s incredibly hard to regain their trust.\nWhen founded, Etsy had a unique point of differentiation and a secure moat around its business through its handmade, human commerce business model. Regrettably, Etsy let that slip to become more like Amazon, Shopify and Chinese-upstarts Shein and Temu.\nIt\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to convince those 100+ millions that Etsy\u2019s got its mojo back and they should return.\n\u201cEtsy should have taken more significant steps years ago, and now it faces tough competition, risking a further downward spiral,\u201d shared Juan Pellerano, chief marketing officer at Swap, which supports e-commerce operations for direct-to-consumer brands.\n\u201cIt finds itself in a challenging position due to the maturity of its business model. Although Etsy\u2019s pricing support for its merchants is commendable, it comes too late,\u201d he continued.\nSadly, Etsy finds itself in a hole it dug for itself and now it has to do the harder work to dig itself back out again.\n",

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The table below setting out the effect of foreign exchange rates on GMV and our consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

    "Summarized_Document3": "The Etsy marketplace, founded in 2005, connects buyers with makers, artists, designers, and crafters selling unique handmade, originally designed, or specially-selected vintage items. However, as the seller community grew and inventory expanded globally, the marketplace became cluttered with goods that didn't meet Etsy's handmade criteria. In response, Etsy is doubling down on its founding mission to 'keep commerce human,' as stated by CEO Josh Silverman. In the first quarter of 2024, Etsy reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sales (GMS) from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion. Fiscal 2023 also saw a 2% drop in GMS from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, despite an increase in active sellers from 5.4 million to 7 million and a 3% rise in active buyers to 92 million. On a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023. The loss in 2022 was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge related to the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7. Etsy ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting 225 employees. Silverman acknowledged the challenging macro and competitive environment, noting that GMS has remained flat since 2021. To address these challenges, Etsy is removing millions of listings and cutting 'tens of thousands' of sellers to declutter its marketplace. The company is also leveraging digital tools like large language models and GenAI to enhance the shopping experience. Additionally, Etsy introduced new Creativity Standards to better distinguish between items crafted solely by sellers and those made using production partners. A $15 setup fee for new sellers and a loyalty program for frequent shoppers are also being implemented. Despite these efforts, questions remain about why Etsy took so long to address these issues. The company faces tough competition and must work hard to regain the trust of over 100 million lapsed buyers.",

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\n2.

We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments.

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.

    "Document3": "Etsy Doubles Down On Handmade To Build A Moat Around Its Marketplace\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 13: \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.,  said ... [+] CEO Josh Silverman. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nThe Etsy marketplace, the flagship of Esty Inc., which also includes resale site Depop and musical instrument specialist Reverb, was founded in 2005 to connect buyers with makers, artists, designers and crafters selling their unique handmade, originally designed new or specially-selected vintage items.\nHowever, as its seller community grew, inventory exploded and it expanded globally, the marketplace became increasingly difficult for customers to maneuver. Most significantly, it became flooded with goods that didn\u2019t meet the criteria that each item had to come with the maker\u2019s personal touch.\nEtsy\u2019s founding mission was to \u201ckeep commerce human\u201d and after hitting speedbumps over the last two years, it is doubling down on that mission or as CEO Josh Silverman said in the recent earnings call, \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.\u201d\nDisappointing Performance\nIn the first quarter 2024 ended March 31, Etsy marketplace reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sale (GMS) over the same period last year, from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion in 2024. Last year\u2019s first quarter was a bad one too, down 4.7% from $2.8 billion in 2022.\nFiscal 2023 was another disappointment. Esty marketplace GMS dropped 2% from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, while the number of active sellers exploded from 5.4 million to 7 million. Active buyers advanced 3% to 92 million.\nOn a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2022\u2019s loss was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge to write down the acquisition value of Depop and Brazilian-marketplace Elo7, both acquired at premium prices in 2021. Elo7 was divested in mid-2023 for an undisclosed sum. The company doesn\u2019t report revenues or net income on a brand level; however, Etsy marketplace accounted for 88% of GMS in 2023 and 86% in first quarter 2024.\nNonetheless, Esty Inc. ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting some 225 employees. \u201cWhile the Etsy marketplace is still more than double the size it was in 2019, we needed to acknowledge and adjust for today\u2019s realities,\u201d Silverman said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment, and GMS has remained essentially flat since 2021. This means we are not bringing our sellers more sales, which is the single most important thing we can do for them.\u201d\nThose challenges continued in the first quarter 2024, if not worsened, as he said in the earnings call, it was \u201canother challenging quarter for our type of goods, signaling to us that buyers shopped a bit less with us than they did in the prior year.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cMacro economic conditions also continue quite challenging in our other top markets, the U.K. and Germany. These headwinds are real. They do not appear to be abating and are impacting our sales.\n\u201cWhile so far, 2024 is still proving to be a cyclically challenging period for us, rest assured that we are clear eyed about what we need to accomplish to set Etsy back on a growth path.\u201d\nCourse Correction\nSilverman explained Etsy\u2019s path to growth starts with cleaning up the marketplace by removing sellers and listings that violate its handmade policy; what he phrased as decluttering Etsy\u2019s aisles.\nSo far the marketplace has removed millions of listings \u2013 115% more than in the previous year \u2013 and cut \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of sellers from its roles.\nWith less junk cluttering its virtual aisles, Etsy can better curate customers\u2019 selections based upon their shopping mission and elevate the visibility of items that are more relevant to the shoppers\u2019 needs and desires.\nFor example, Etsy\u2019s customers regularly frequent the site to find unique gift ideas and it just launched a Gift Mode platform to make gifts easier to find by product, gift occasion and recipient profile.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nWhile it aims to emphasize the human connection in Etsy customers\u2019 shopping journey, it is turning to digitally-powered large language models and GenAI tools to enhance the online shopping experience and match the shopping mission with available inventory.\n\u201cWe have a very significant opportunity to focus more on window shopping, gauging buyer experiences to spark imagination, capture impulse buys, get to know your tastes and preferences better and expand your understanding of the breadth of products available on Etsy, making Etsy more fun, engaging, inspiring and surprising,\u201d he said in the call.\nHoning The Human Connection\nFollowing the earnings call, Silverman sent a message to sellers explaining Etsy\u2019s new Creativity Standards, which he said represented not a policy change but heightened enforcement of existing guidelines.\nAll items for listing on Etsy must be either:\n\n\nAnd each item will now carry details on listing pages specifying whether its is Made by, Designed by, Sourced by or Handpicked by. He explained, \u201cVintage falls into the \u2018handpicked\u2019 category. And most craft and party supplies will live in the \u2018sourced by\u2019 section.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cOur research shows that the top thing buyers want to learn about is your involvement in your items. We\u2019ve also heard from you, sellers, asking us to better distinguish between items crafted solely by you and items made using production partners or other tools. This way, your unique craft shines through.\u201d\nTo make sure sellers are serious about complying with the guidelines, Etsy marketplace has established a $15 setup fee for new sellers. And it also will launch a loyalty program later in the year for frequent shoppers.\nToo Late?\nAll of which are admirable and much needed efforts by Silverman and his team to set Etsy back on course, but the question remains how did they let it go so far in the wrong direction?\nEtsy\u2019s been a prime destination to gifters for years, so what took it so long to turn on that spigot?\nIt consistently reports growth in active buyers and recovery of lapsed buyers, so why wasn\u2019t a loyalty program put on the front burner in 2021 when Etsy Inc. active buyers rose nearly 18% to 96 million?\nAnd as far back as 2022, it announced \u201cstepped-up Handmade Policy enforcement.\u201d Yet it\u2019s taken two years to put teeth into those policies.\nIn the latest earnings call, Silverman revealed that Etsy was sitting on more than 100 million lapsed buyers, but once a customer loses faith in a company, it\u2019s incredibly hard to regain their trust.\nWhen founded, Etsy had a unique point of differentiation and a secure moat around its business through its handmade, human commerce business model. Regrettably, Etsy let that slip to become more like Amazon, Shopify and Chinese-upstarts Shein and Temu.\nIt\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to convince those 100+ millions that Etsy\u2019s got its mojo back and they should return.\n\u201cEtsy should have taken more significant steps years ago, and now it faces tough competition, risking a further downward spiral,\u201d shared Juan Pellerano, chief marketing officer at Swap, which supports e-commerce operations for direct-to-consumer brands.\n\u201cIt finds itself in a challenging position due to the maturity of its business model. Although Etsy\u2019s pricing support for its merchants is commendable, it comes too late,\u201d he continued.\nSadly, Etsy finds itself in a hole it dug for itself and now it has to do the harder work to dig itself back out again.\n",

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\n2.

    "Summarized_Document3": "The Etsy marketplace, founded in 2005, connects buyers with makers, artists, designers, and crafters selling unique handmade, originally designed, or specially-selected vintage items. However, as the seller community grew and inventory expanded globally, the marketplace became cluttered with goods that didn't meet Etsy's handmade criteria. In response, Etsy is doubling down on its founding mission to 'keep commerce human,' as stated by CEO Josh Silverman. In the first quarter of 2024, Etsy reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sales (GMS) from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion. Fiscal 2023 also saw a 2% drop in GMS from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, despite an increase in active sellers from 5.4 million to 7 million and a 3% rise in active buyers to 92 million. On a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023. The loss in 2022 was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge related to the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7. Etsy ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting 225 employees. Silverman acknowledged the challenging macro and competitive environment, noting that GMS has remained flat since 2021. To address these challenges, Etsy is removing millions of listings and cutting 'tens of thousands' of sellers to declutter its marketplace. The company is also leveraging digital tools like large language models and GenAI to enhance the shopping experience. Additionally, Etsy introduced new Creativity Standards to better distinguish between items crafted solely by sellers and those made using production partners. A $15 setup fee for new sellers and a loyalty program for frequent shoppers are also being implemented. Despite these efforts, questions remain about why Etsy took so long to address these issues. The company faces tough competition and must work hard to regain the trust of over 100 million lapsed buyers.",

    "Document3": "Etsy Doubles Down On Handmade To Build A Moat Around Its Marketplace\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 13: \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.,  said ... [+] CEO Josh Silverman. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nThe Etsy marketplace, the flagship of Esty Inc., which also includes resale site Depop and musical instrument specialist Reverb, was founded in 2005 to connect buyers with makers, artists, designers and crafters selling their unique handmade, originally designed new or specially-selected vintage items.\nHowever, as its seller community grew, inventory exploded and it expanded globally, the marketplace became increasingly difficult for customers to maneuver. Most significantly, it became flooded with goods that didn\u2019t meet the criteria that each item had to come with the maker\u2019s personal touch.\nEtsy\u2019s founding mission was to \u201ckeep commerce human\u201d and after hitting speedbumps over the last two years, it is doubling down on that mission or as CEO Josh Silverman said in the recent earnings call, \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.\u201d\nDisappointing Performance\nIn the first quarter 2024 ended March 31, Etsy marketplace reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sale (GMS) over the same period last year, from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion in 2024. Last year\u2019s first quarter was a bad one too, down 4.7% from $2.8 billion in 2022.\nFiscal 2023 was another disappointment. Esty marketplace GMS dropped 2% from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, while the number of active sellers exploded from 5.4 million to 7 million. Active buyers advanced 3% to 92 million.\nOn a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2022\u2019s loss was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge to write down the acquisition value of Depop and Brazilian-marketplace Elo7, both acquired at premium prices in 2021. Elo7 was divested in mid-2023 for an undisclosed sum. The company doesn\u2019t report revenues or net income on a brand level; however, Etsy marketplace accounted for 88% of GMS in 2023 and 86% in first quarter 2024.\nNonetheless, Esty Inc. ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting some 225 employees. \u201cWhile the Etsy marketplace is still more than double the size it was in 2019, we needed to acknowledge and adjust for today\u2019s realities,\u201d Silverman said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment, and GMS has remained essentially flat since 2021. This means we are not bringing our sellers more sales, which is the single most important thing we can do for them.\u201d\nThose challenges continued in the first quarter 2024, if not worsened, as he said in the earnings call, it was \u201canother challenging quarter for our type of goods, signaling to us that buyers shopped a bit less with us than they did in the prior year.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cMacro economic conditions also continue quite challenging in our other top markets, the U.K. and Germany. These headwinds are real. They do not appear to be abating and are impacting our sales.\n\u201cWhile so far, 2024 is still proving to be a cyclically challenging period for us, rest assured that we are clear eyed about what we need to accomplish to set Etsy back on a growth path.\u201d\nCourse Correction\nSilverman explained Etsy\u2019s path to growth starts with cleaning up the marketplace by removing sellers and listings that violate its handmade policy; what he phrased as decluttering Etsy\u2019s aisles.\nSo far the marketplace has removed millions of listings \u2013 115% more than in the previous year \u2013 and cut \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of sellers from its roles.\nWith less junk cluttering its virtual aisles, Etsy can better curate customers\u2019 selections based upon their shopping mission and elevate the visibility of items that are more relevant to the shoppers\u2019 needs and desires.\nFor example, Etsy\u2019s customers regularly frequent the site to find unique gift ideas and it just launched a Gift Mode platform to make gifts easier to find by product, gift occasion and recipient profile.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nWhile it aims to emphasize the human connection in Etsy customers\u2019 shopping journey, it is turning to digitally-powered large language models and GenAI tools to enhance the online shopping experience and match the shopping mission with available inventory.\n\u201cWe have a very significant opportunity to focus more on window shopping, gauging buyer experiences to spark imagination, capture impulse buys, get to know your tastes and preferences better and expand your understanding of the breadth of products available on Etsy, making Etsy more fun, engaging, inspiring and surprising,\u201d he said in the call.\nHoning The Human Connection\nFollowing the earnings call, Silverman sent a message to sellers explaining Etsy\u2019s new Creativity Standards, which he said represented not a policy change but heightened enforcement of existing guidelines.\nAll items for listing on Etsy must be either:\n\n\nAnd each item will now carry details on listing pages specifying whether its is Made by, Designed by, Sourced by or Handpicked by. He explained, \u201cVintage falls into the \u2018handpicked\u2019 category. And most craft and party supplies will live in the \u2018sourced by\u2019 section.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cOur research shows that the top thing buyers want to learn about is your involvement in your items. We\u2019ve also heard from you, sellers, asking us to better distinguish between items crafted solely by you and items made using production partners or other tools. This way, your unique craft shines through.\u201d\nTo make sure sellers are serious about complying with the guidelines, Etsy marketplace has established a $15 setup fee for new sellers. And it also will launch a loyalty program later in the year for frequent shoppers.\nToo Late?\nAll of which are admirable and much needed efforts by Silverman and his team to set Etsy back on course, but the question remains how did they let it go so far in the wrong direction?\nEtsy\u2019s been a prime destination to gifters for years, so what took it so long to turn on that spigot?\nIt consistently reports growth in active buyers and recovery of lapsed buyers, so why wasn\u2019t a loyalty program put on the front burner in 2021 when Etsy Inc. active buyers rose nearly 18% to 96 million?\nAnd as far back as 2022, it announced \u201cstepped-up Handmade Policy enforcement.\u201d Yet it\u2019s taken two years to put teeth into those policies.\nIn the latest earnings call, Silverman revealed that Etsy was sitting on more than 100 million lapsed buyers, but once a customer loses faith in a company, it\u2019s incredibly hard to regain their trust.\nWhen founded, Etsy had a unique point of differentiation and a secure moat around its business through its handmade, human commerce business model. Regrettably, Etsy let that slip to become more like Amazon, Shopify and Chinese-upstarts Shein and Temu.\nIt\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to convince those 100+ millions that Etsy\u2019s got its mojo back and they should return.\n\u201cEtsy should have taken more significant steps years ago, and now it faces tough competition, risking a further downward spiral,\u201d shared Juan Pellerano, chief marketing officer at Swap, which supports e-commerce operations for direct-to-consumer brands.\n\u201cIt finds itself in a challenging position due to the maturity of its business model. Although Etsy\u2019s pricing support for its merchants is commendable, it comes too late,\u201d he continued.\nSadly, Etsy finds itself in a hole it dug for itself and now it has to do the harder work to dig itself back out again.\n",

    "Summarized_Document3": "The Etsy marketplace, founded in 2005, connects buyers with makers, artists, designers, and crafters selling unique handmade, originally designed, or specially-selected vintage items. However, as the seller community grew and inventory expanded globally, the marketplace became cluttered with goods that didn't meet Etsy's handmade criteria. In response, Etsy is doubling down on its founding mission to 'keep commerce human,' as stated by CEO Josh Silverman. In the first quarter of 2024, Etsy reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sales (GMS) from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion. Fiscal 2023 also saw a 2% drop in GMS from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, despite an increase in active sellers from 5.4 million to 7 million and a 3% rise in active buyers to 92 million. On a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023. The loss in 2022 was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge related to the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7. Etsy ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting 225 employees. Silverman acknowledged the challenging macro and competitive environment, noting that GMS has remained flat since 2021. To address these challenges, Etsy is removing millions of listings and cutting 'tens of thousands' of sellers to declutter its marketplace. The company is also leveraging digital tools like large language models and GenAI to enhance the shopping experience. Additionally, Etsy introduced new Creativity Standards to better distinguish between items crafted solely by sellers and those made using production partners. A $15 setup fee for new sellers and a loyalty program for frequent shoppers are also being implemented. Despite these efforts, questions remain about why Etsy took so long to address these issues. The company faces tough competition and must work hard to regain the trust of over 100 million lapsed buyers.",

And other retailers struggled to compete during the summer shopping holiday.\nKey takeaways:\nConsumers worldwide spent nearly $13 billion with Amazon.com Inc. during the retail giant\u2019s ninth-annual Prime Day, according to an early Digital Commerce 360 analysis. This year\u2019s two-day sale marked yet another record-breaking event, and although year-over-year growth was modest when compared with the performance of prior Prime Days, it was a small uptick over 2022.\nAmazon is No. 3 in Digital Commerce 360\u2019s new\u00a02023 Global Online Marketplaces Report, which ranks the 100 largest global marketplaces by 2023 third-party GMV.\nHow much did Amazon make on Prime Day?\nDigital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon\u2019s sales on Prime Day hit $12.90 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 11 and 12. That\u2019s up 6.7% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2022, which ran July 12 and 13. Last year, sales grew 8.1% over the 2021 event to $12.09 billion. In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon\u2019s 2020 event.\nPrime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus. The pandemic impacted retailers\u2019 supply chains and inventory, shifted consumers\u2019 shopping priorities and led more shoppers to Amazon.com to purchase essential items.\nThis year, shoppers purchased more than 375 million items worldwide during the 2023 event. That\u2019s up from 300 million last year, Amazon says.\nWhat is Prime Day?\nAmazon, No. 1 in the\u00a0Digital Commerce 360 Top 1000, launched Prime Day in July 2015 to celebrate the web behemoth\u2019s 20th year in business, offering deals on a bunch of products to mark the occasion. As the event evolved, Prime Day turned into a highly anticipated summer sale designed to drum up more business for Amazon \u2014 and the retailer\u2019s marketplace sellers \u2014 before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shopping traffic from deal-seeking consumers.\nThe inaugural Prime Day lasted for 24 hours and encompassed nine countries including the U.S. In 2017, the sale was extended for 30 hours and expanded to a few more markets, and in 2018, Prime Day was a 36-hour event. By 2019, Amazon began running its current two-day sale spanning 18 countries. And this year, more than 20 markets participated.\nWith discounts available only to paying members, Prime Day also is a vehicle for Amazon to sign up more consumers for its popular loyalty plan. The $139-a-year or $14.99-a-month Prime membership program offers perks like free one- or two-day shipping, digital photo storage, and video and music streaming.\nOther retailers sales slow on Prime Day\nAmazon isn\u2019t alone in doing big sales on weekdays in July. Many of its top competitors held sales during the same period, with No. 2 Walmart Inc. returning to the promotional holiday this year after sitting out last year.\nHowever, many retailers saw a smaller Prime Day bump in traffic this year compared to last year, according to Digital Commerce 360\u2019s analysis of Similarweb traffic numbers. Last year, for example, Target Corp. (No. 5 in the Top 1000) grew traffic 42.3% over a control period two weeks prior to Prime Day. This year, traffic was up just 26.9%. Costco Wholesale Corp. (No. 6) went from a 24.6% bump last year to 16.7% this year. Best Buy Co. (No. 7), which usually gets huge increases in traffic as shoppers compare prices on big-ticket items, saw its bump drop to 51.2% from 85.0% last year.\nWalmart, which didn\u2019t participate in Prime Day promos last year, saw its change in traffic grow by half, up to 24.9% from 16.7%. But even Amazon had a smaller increase in traffic compared to the control period, down less than 1% compared to 2022\u2019s bump.\nSome of this is a difference in promo strategy. Retailers were heavily promotional during the 4th of July holiday period this year, with more offering Independence Day sales than competing with Prime Day. Also, top competitors offered week-long sales, meaning shoppers could focus on Amazon during its two-day sale and turn to Target, Walmart and Costco afterward to pick up other deals.\nFor the full week, Target\u2019s bump was still lower than last year, but the decline was much softer, with an 18.6% decline for the week compared to a 36.5% decline for the two-day period. Walmart\u2019s bump similarly grew when looking at the full week, up 56.0% for the week compared to a 49.2% increase for the two-day period.\nHow we got here\nHere are some insights that helped Digital Commerce 360 derive its Amazon Prime Day sales estimates:\nConsumer spending up on Amazon during Prime Day\nAccording to figures from a Numerator panel, Prime Day shoppers\u2019 spending on the site went up in 2023. The firm derives its insights from purchasing patterns on the Amazon platform. For the full 48-hour period, the average order value registered $54.05, up 3.4% from $52.26 during Prime Day 2021. Nearly a fifth of households placed five or more orders during the two-day period.\nUS Ecommerce: Poised for Takeoff? Insights from Digital Commerce 360\nNumerator data is based on 98,462 Prime Day orders placed through Amazon and spanning 34,185 unique households as well as a survey of more than 4,200 verified buyers.\nOutside of Amazon, sales weren\u2019t so rosy. Salesforce says non-Amazon sales in the U.S. were down 10% year over year for the first day of the sales holiday and down 7% on the second, with average discounts dropping to 18% this year compared to 30% last year.\u00a0According to the Commerce Cloud provider, discounting was higher during the 4th of July period, peaking at 25% on the holiday.\nStill, overall U.S. ecommerce spending was up 6.1% for the Prime Day period, according to Adobe Analytics. The insights arm of technology company Adobe Inc. said U.S. ecommerce sales hit $12.7 billion for the two days, a new Prime Day record based on Adobe Analytics data of 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites and 100 million SKUs.\nAmazon said the first day of the sales event marked its largest single-day sales ever.\nMerchants weigh in\nAndrey Klen is pleased with how things went for his company on Amazon.com during Prime Day this year. The co-founder and chief marketing officer of Petcube said \u201cPrime Day performed much better in comparison to the previous year. Compared to an average day, we\u2019ve seen a double-digit multiple on sales. We were able to beat optimistic high growth projections on our main product.\u201d\nKlen said sales numbers suggest that shoppers were excited about Prime Day this year and had planned purchases of Petcube products well in advance of the two-day sales event.\n\u201cWe had lower conversion a couple of days prior to Prime Day, followed by the massive explosion for the first hours on the date. Most likely, people were adding the products to the cart beforehand,\u201d Klen said.\nThrasio Holdings Inc., an investment company that has purchased a number of Amazon merchants, said some of its brands had their best days ever during the event.\n\u201cThese were the two most profitable days in Thrasio history,\u201d Thrasio CEO\u00a0Greg Greeley said in a written statement.\nThrasio\u2019s latest acquisition \u2014 a seller of insect-repellent spray called Ranger Ready Repellents \u2014 had a record-breaking day on Amazon and tripled its Prime Day 2022 sales.\nDo you rank in our databases?\nSubmit your data\u00a0and we\u2019ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.\nSign up\nStay on top of the latest developments in the ecommerce industry.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the financial tables below for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures.\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nFree Cash Flow Reconciliation\nThe following table illustrates how free cash flow is calculated in this press release:\n\u00a0\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Analysis\nThe following table converts our GMV, revenues, gross profit and (loss) income from operations using the comparative period's monthly average exchange rates. The table below setting out the effect of foreign exchange rates on GMV and our consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\u00a0\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\u00a0\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\r\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\r\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

And it\u2019s easy to set up an Etsy ad campaign! These are the steps you can follow:\nEtsy ad campaigns help users find your items. Your ads will appear on Category and Market pages and Etsy searches. Sellers also have control over who sees their ad campaigns for maximum reach.\nBut what makes a results-driven Etsy ad campaign is how you manage your budget. You may not have the means to set your budget to $50 daily. $1 to $2 may be more financially feasible.\nIn this case, don\u2019t promote all your listings on such a tight budget. Pick your best-selling items and advertise those. As you generate more income, you can increase your budget.\nUsing this strategy prevents you from blowing through a wad of cash trying to sell on Etsy. And that can quickly happen without controlling how much you invest in ad spending compared to how much profit you generate.\nHere\u2019s what Etsy\u2019s ad dashboard looks like:\nBrie Moore, the owner of\u00a0Breezy Tee, used an Esty ad campaign to help her shop reach its ultimate potential. She was eager to turn a profit and spent $1 to $2 advertising 30 listings. But she didn\u2019t get the reach she expected because her budget was far too little for marketing all those items.\nHowever, Brie didn\u2019t expand her budget but chose to be more selective in what items she promoted. When her best-selling items achieved impressive results for her ad campaign, she increased her daily ad spend budget by 50 cents.\nBrie also developed a rule that worked \u2013 she would never spend more than 20% of her revenue on her ad budget. To stay ahead of which items made the ad budget cut, Brie measured sales and not just ad clicks!\nThis frugal approach did the trick. Now Brie has the capital to invest in top-tier models and photography to scale her Etsy store.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #2: Make Shopping Seamless\nOnline buyers want convenience, and you must achieve this in your Etsy store. Remember, you don\u2019t just want once-off buyers. You want consumers to have a fantastic experience, so they return.\u00a0\nAnd to achieve seamless shopping for your Etsy buyers you should:\nThe owner of\u00a0Herma May, an Etsy store specializing in signature fragrances\u00a0achieved success by providing effortless Etsy shopping. She includes freebies in customer orders, uses Etsy store collections, and invests a lot of time in understanding what her buyers want.\u00a0\nThis Etsy store seller also provides ideas on how customers could use her fragrances and never leaves out any information about these products. She also includes a \u201ccustomer care\u201d card for every order, explaining how to use her fragrances for an improved customer experience.\nTaking it a step further, this seller uses unique packaging for every one of her fragrances. This tactic makes it easier for returning buyers to choose a fragrance as they\u2019re quickly attracted to distinct packaging they\u2019ve never seen before.\nFrom the fruits of her labor, this Etsy seller now has a five-star rating on Etsy, and most of her consumers are loyal buyers.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #3: Leverage Instagram Marketing\u00a0\nInstagram is a bustling social media platform for pretty much every business. And that includes your Etsy store. The main reason is that Esty and Instagram share a significant factor influencing customers\u2019 purchasing behaviors \u2013 good-quality images.\nTo use Instagram marketing to promote your Etsy products, you should:\nThe owner of the Etsy store,\u00a0Little Maggie Moo, wasn\u2019t gaining the reach she wanted through Etsy alone. But this didn\u2019t deter her from selling the Esty products she believed in. Instead, she took to Instagram and started marketing her items.\nShe passionately shares high-quality pictures of her products to attract her audience. Because this Etsy store is all about baby clothes, she uses images of her clothes on happy babies. Doing this creates a visual idea of what her products can deliver.\nBut that\u2019s not all she does. The owner of Little Maggie Moo interacts with other business accounts she\u2019s passionate about. This Etsy seller also consistently engages with her followers. She shares exciting work and strikes up conversations in her a comments section.\u00a0\nPlus, she also networks with other Etsy store owners offering products related to hers. Once promoting their products and sharing their content, some of these Etsy store owners return the favor! All this effort helped steadily increase her Instagram followers and optimize her engagement.\nBut what did it do for her Etsy store?\nShe generated over 4000 sales!\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #4: Don\u2019t Forget SEO\nThere\u2019s a heck load of competition on Etsy, and you need to cut through the noise! And here\u2019s where trusty ol\u2019 SEO comes in.\nEtsy\u2019s search tool is pretty powerful, and buyers can find products in one of two ways:\nAs you can tell, many technicalities go behind Etsy\u2019s search engine to ensure it helps buyers find the products they\u2019re looking for. This is excellent news for your business, as you can use top SEO techniques to reach more users.\nSome of the best SEO tactics for Etsy marketing include:\nThe founder of an Etsy jewelry store,\u00a0Ringcrush, has generated over 100,000 sales since her launch in 2016! And guess what she says is her secret? Good SEO tactics like the techniques mentioned above!\nThis Etsy seller uses SEO to guide what she creates and how she markets her content, based on trending content!\nAnd here\u2019s another example!\nA different Etsy shop owner makes\u00a0$1500 to $2000 per week, thanks to her product sales. She chalks this up to her efforts to achieve maximum reach, which was only possible through a sound SEO strategy.\nPart of her strategy includes consistent and accurate keyword and hashtag research. She recommends always using these SEO elements in your listing to help stand out from your competition.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #5: Provide As Much Support as Possible\nHere\u2019s another effective Etsy marketing strategy related to delivering exceptional customer support.\u00a0\nRather than only focusing on your customer\u2019s experience while they shop, you should also consider the experience you provide after they buy your products. Taking this extra step helps maintain returning customers, and what every successful business needs!\nOnce customers have bought your Etsy products, keep them engaged through:\nUsing these techniques above will make your customers feel appreciated by your business. And if you know anything about customer appreciation, it certainly adds to brand loyalty!\nOwning two Etsy stores, Unmeasured Designs and Unmeasured Events, Tash uses a hands-on approach to maintain returning buyers. She\u2019s been on Etsy since 2017 and has racked up over $112,000 in sales.\nThe work behind her success boils down to keeping engaged with her customers after they\u2019ve made a purchase. She does this through email newsletters. Her buyers now have a point of contact to send her queries or concerns about her products.\nThanks to this approach, Tash keeps her consumers closely connected, and in turn, loyal to her businesses.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #6: Pay Close Attention to Analytics\u00a0\nEtsy analytics are very telling, and you shouldn\u2019t ignore them! If you don\u2019t know how to access Etsy analytics, here\u2019s how:\nWith access to all this valuable information, you can modify your approach to people interested in your Esty listings. You may find that you\u2019ve been targeting the wrong buyers, or the products you\u2019re investing in advertising aren\u2019t the best choices.\u00a0\nAlso, based on your analytics, don\u2019t be afraid to remove listings. If you see an item isn\u2019t performing well, you can try to optimize it, But if this problem persists, find a more profitable product.\nTo amp up your Etsy analytics, you can integrate Google analytics into Etsy. There are also many more tools and software you can use for more robust Etsy reporting.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s an example of Etsy stats:\nAmy Yee, the owner of Maeven Vintage, took full advantage of Esty\u2019s stats. She evaluates customer data like buyer locations, and purchasing habits while searching for keywords to inspire her products. Amy also uses Etsy to find popular vintage items and how much they sell for.\u00a0\nShe used this information to develop a long-term plan on how she would set her budget, market her store and create her items. With a foolproof business plan developed on the foundation of Esty stats, Amy Yee could expand her Etsy businesses into several pop-up shops around New York.\nAnd, this also helped her land in many publications and magazines!\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #7: Get Orders Delivered to Buyers ASAP\nThis may seem like general knowledge, but for some sellers, it isn\u2019t! Late orders are against Etsy\u2019s seller service standards, so it can harm your ability to sell on this platform,\u00a0\nAnd not forgetting, buyers will give you bad reviews, making you less of a contender to them and Etsy\u2019s search engine algorithm.\nIf you don\u2019t think this is a common mistake, then let me help prove it:\nIt takes about 3 to 7 working days to get Esty products, and you should do everything possible to make this happen. In an instance where something super unforeseeable happens, let your buyers know and make it up to them.\nYou could give them a discount or a freebie as a way to apologize. Doing this will show you are sincere about a late delivery, and defuse angry customers!\nJess Yuda, the owner of Planner Peace,\u00a0makes over $12,000 per month\u00a0from her Etsy store. But this is possible because of how seriously she takes customer service, and in turn, on-time deliveries.\u00a0\nThis Etsy seller does her best to deliver products within 3 to 5 working days. And to achieve this, she works with reliable delivery providers she\u2019s built rapport with. At any time Jess can\u2019t fulfill her quick delivery turnaround time, she informs her customers and sends them freebies!\nFrom this strategy, you can see how a small example of Etsy marketing contributes to a generous profit.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #8: Organization is Key\nWhen your Etsy store starts to take off, you must employ stricter organizational methods. Quickly losing count of your orders, revenue, expenses, and inventory will set you back from success.\nHands-on organization will also help you scale your business, as you have more resources to draw business proposals and plans.\u00a0\nTo organize your Etsy store, you can do the following:\nOnce you apply these Etsy organizational techniques, you\u2019ll find it much easier to scale and manage your store!\nThe owner of an Etsy store,\u00a0Jenna Crucitti Designs, proves the power of good organizational skills for Etsy\u2019s marketing success.\u00a0\nOnce hitting 2700 Etsy sales and earning more than $10,000 in profit, this Etsy shop owner decided she needed to organize her strategy for maximum results and productivity. As this transformed into a full-time job, it gave her even more reason to get organized!\nSo, Jenna took to QuickBooks to document all her monthly finances. And helping her process, she separates her personal finances from her store\u2019s spending and earnings.\nBut wait!\u00a0\nIt gets even better!\nNow, Jenna also uses her organizational techniques to help her claim tax deductions and gain tax benefits!\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #9: Ensure You Use High-Quality Photography\nWe briefly glanced over this while exploring Instagram marketing for selling Etsy products. But exceptional photography plays a huge role in Etsy, and deserves to be a strategy on its own.\nIf you use good-quality images on Etsy, you stand a greater chance of closing a sale.\u00a0\nHere are the top reasons why Etsy sellers need top-quality images:\nYou don\u2019t have to hire a professional photographer to take your Etsy product pictures. I mean, that would help, but it\u2019s not necessary when you\u2019re starting. All you need is a great camera (it can be a phone\u2019s camera), beautiful lighting, and as many tries as it takes, to get that \u201cWOW\u201d angle.\nIf you\u2019re struggling, YouTube has loads of resources on how to take amazing pictures using a phone!\nThey call her Etsy\u2019s most profitable seller, and her name is\u2026.Alicia Shaffer! Alicia racks up $70,000 worth of sales every month, and pins her success on fantastic photography.\nRather than only photographing the product, she showcases how it looks as part of an outfit. And she also exchanges the simple white background for various outdoor settings as this compliments her items.\nTo develop the perfect eye for her products, this OG Etsy seller evaluated her competitors\u2019 images and checked what worked and what didn\u2019t.\u00a0\nAs she\u2019s achieved quite a bit of success, Alicia now uses top-tier photographers, models, and sets to put her products at the forefront of her competitors.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #10: Use Exciting Email Newsletters\nEmail marketing is an excellent communication channel to include in your Etsy marketing strategy. When you use email, you build better relationships with your buyers and excite them about your products.\nEmail newsletters for an Etsy marketing campaign also effectively remind your buyers about your brand. Successful Etsy marketing relies on repeat buyers, and email newsletters achieve this.\nUsing email newsletters to engage your Etsy buyers, take steps like:\nDon\u2019t forget to include your branding and brand voice in your email newsletters. You want to leave an impression on your buyers so they know what to expect from your business!\nAfter sending a drawn-out series of bland email newsletters, Cassie Uhl, an Etsy shop seller, noticed she\u2019s not getting her ideal response. But this isn\u2019t where she stopped. Instead, she started sending emails that went beyond trying to secure sales.\nCassie Uhl focuses her newsletters on connecting to her buyers and making them feel like family. She shares her blog content, suggests products that add more value to her buyers, and ultimately, brings her readers into her creative process.\nAnother smart move from this Esty seller is that she aligns her content calendar with her email newsletters, so sharing relevant information is easier. Because of this wholesome approach, Cassie Uhl developed loyal customers and stronger brand-to-consumer relationships.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #11: Diversify Your Offerings\nYou don\u2019t have to stick to one item for your Etsy store. You can diversify your offerings based on what you\u2019re passionate about and how all these products relate to each other. But you don\u2019t want to promote items that are too unrelated as this may confuse your buyers.\nFor example, if you\u2019re selling handmade football balls, you could also sell handmade quirky socks and silly football T-shirts.\u00a0\nWhen you diversify your offerings, you create multiple revenue streams, leading to higher profits.\u00a0\nIf you want to diversify your products consider factors like:\nAnd here\u2019s another aspect to consider \u2013 you can also open another Etsy store to sell products that don\u2019t relate to your current store. Obviously, this will take work, but it\u2019s still welcoming another revenue stream.\u00a0\nVana Chupp opened an Etsy store offering custom silhouettes. But she found her passion didn\u2019t end there and started a second Etsy store offering graphic design art and providing coaching to women aspiring to become business owners.\nShe started by developing herself as an expert in one area and grew her Etsy store until she could diversify her offerings. Now she also sells various books based on her artworks alongside her graphic design pieces and silhouettes.\nWhile this is certainly a much more complex strategy, it\u2019s best to consider it when you want to scale your Etsy store. And using the \u201cbig picture\u201d approach has worked well for this Etsy seller!\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #12: Leverage Press Releases and Free Publicity\nPress releases mean more free publicity, and this is what you need to skyrocket your Etsy store sales. The more people know about your store, the better, and you need to secure coverage in online and offline publications and magazines to achieve this.\nIf you don\u2019t know how to leverage press releases for your Etsy store, here\u2019s how:\nHoning your pitch and becoming familiar with the publications will determine if you secure press coverage or not. So, you want to take your time with this and ensure your pitch highlights your best values and proves how you can add value to their readers.\u00a0\nWhen Erin Flett launched her first Etsy store, she only sold 30 products in her first year. Pretty daunting, right!\nBut she realized that she needed more publicity. To get her Etsy store out there, she did her homework and found the best publications for her products. Erin started networking with professionals related to those publications through LinkedIn, or email (if she could find an email address).\nErin spent a lot of time understanding the content and voices of the publications she wanted to pitch to, and crafted her messages accordingly. She pitched to all sorts of businesses, and every time, her angle was unique and custom to the receiver. Boosting her chances, she also included photos!\nThanks to all this effort, Erin has earned more than $3000 in sales and has featured on the covers of four of the best-selling magazines in the US!\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #13: Branding, Branding, and More Branding\nBranding is vital for your Etsy marketing campaign because you want to optimize customer experience. With consistent branding throughout your Etsy marketing efforts, you can develop a brand identity that customers can become familiar with.\nThink about this in your own life: You trust the brands you use because they have an established identity.\nTo develop branding for your Etsy store, consider factors like:\nOnce you\u2019ve nailed those elements down, you can build a brand identity and use this across your entire Etsy store and other social channels you choose for marketing.\u00a0\nAfter Iris Pohlgeers started her vintage Etsy store, she received constructive criticism on her images and style. This feedback inspired her to consider a new approach for her store\u2019s design.\u00a0\nShe brainstormed a color palette that encompassed her stores values and used this across her Etsy store. Iris also used her new-found branding to inspire her images and how they looked. She uses a consistent background for all her images so her shop is distinctive.\u00a0\nIris also ensures her branding is formatted for mobile and desktop! Because of her efforts to develop consistent branding, Iris has experienced exponential growth and confirms that her branding played a huge role.\u00a0\nSummary 13 Etsy Marketing Strategies\nConclusion\nEtsy marketing isn\u2019t a simple endeavor with the vast competition this online marketplace has.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon nears $13 billion in Prime Day sales\nAmazon boosted its overall Prime Day sales to record numbers, but growth is slowing. Consumers worldwide spent nearly $13 billion with Amazon.com Inc. during the retail giant\u2019s ninth-annual Prime Day, according to an early Digital Commerce 360 analysis. This year\u2019s two-day sale marked yet another record-breaking event, with a 6.7% year-over-year increase to $12.90 billion globally during the event on July 11 and 12, 2024. This is up from $12.09 billion in 2022 and $11.19 billion in 2021.\n\nPrime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. The pandemic impacted retailers\u2019 supply chains and inventory, shifted consumers\u2019 shopping priorities, and led more shoppers to Amazon.com to purchase essential items.\n\nThis year, shoppers purchased more than 375 million items worldwide during the 2023 event, up from 300 million last year. The average order value was $54.05, up 3.4% from $52.26 during Prime Day 2021. Nearly a fifth of households placed five or more orders during the two-day period.\n\nOther retailers saw a smaller Prime Day bump in traffic this year compared to last year. For example, Target Corp. grew traffic 26.9% this year compared to 42.3% last year. Costco Wholesale Corp. saw a bump of 16.7% this year compared to 24.6% last year. Best Buy Co. saw its bump drop to 51.2% from 85.0% last year. Walmart saw its change in traffic grow by half, up to 24.9% from 16.7%.\n\nSales outside of Amazon weren\u2019t as strong. Salesforce reported non-Amazon sales in the U.S. were down 10% year over year for the first day of the sales holiday and down 7% on the second. However, overall U.S. ecommerce spending was up 6.1% for the Prime Day period, hitting $12.7 billion for the two days, a new Prime Day record based on Adobe Analytics data.\n\nMerchants like Petcube and Thrasio Holdings Inc. reported significant sales increases during Prime Day. Petcube saw a double-digit multiple on sales compared to an average day, and Thrasio\u2019s brands had their best days ever during the event.\n\nIn summary, Amazon's Prime Day 2024 had a significant impact on total revenue in July 2024, with nearly $13 billion in sales, marking a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Other retailers experienced mixed results, with some seeing smaller traffic increases and others reporting declines in sales.",

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Expressed in US millions)\n\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), Shopify uses certain non-GAAP and other financial measures to provide additional information in order to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.

Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

And other retailers struggled to compete during the summer shopping holiday.\nKey takeaways:\nConsumers worldwide spent nearly $13 billion with Amazon.com Inc. during the retail giant\u2019s ninth-annual Prime Day, according to an early Digital Commerce 360 analysis. This year\u2019s two-day sale marked yet another record-breaking event, and although year-over-year growth was modest when compared with the performance of prior Prime Days, it was a small uptick over 2022.\nAmazon is No. 3 in Digital Commerce 360\u2019s new\u00a02023 Global Online Marketplaces Report, which ranks the 100 largest global marketplaces by 2023 third-party GMV.\nHow much did Amazon make on Prime Day?\nDigital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon\u2019s sales on Prime Day hit $12.90 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 11 and 12. That\u2019s up 6.7% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2022, which ran July 12 and 13. Last year, sales grew 8.1% over the 2021 event to $12.09 billion. In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon\u2019s 2020 event.\nPrime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus. The pandemic impacted retailers\u2019 supply chains and inventory, shifted consumers\u2019 shopping priorities and led more shoppers to Amazon.com to purchase essential items.\nThis year, shoppers purchased more than 375 million items worldwide during the 2023 event. That\u2019s up from 300 million last year, Amazon says.\nWhat is Prime Day?\nAmazon, No. 1 in the\u00a0Digital Commerce 360 Top 1000, launched Prime Day in July 2015 to celebrate the web behemoth\u2019s 20th year in business, offering deals on a bunch of products to mark the occasion. As the event evolved, Prime Day turned into a highly anticipated summer sale designed to drum up more business for Amazon \u2014 and the retailer\u2019s marketplace sellers \u2014 before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shopping traffic from deal-seeking consumers.\nThe inaugural Prime Day lasted for 24 hours and encompassed nine countries including the U.S. In 2017, the sale was extended for 30 hours and expanded to a few more markets, and in 2018, Prime Day was a 36-hour event. By 2019, Amazon began running its current two-day sale spanning 18 countries. And this year, more than 20 markets participated.\nWith discounts available only to paying members, Prime Day also is a vehicle for Amazon to sign up more consumers for its popular loyalty plan. The $139-a-year or $14.99-a-month Prime membership program offers perks like free one- or two-day shipping, digital photo storage, and video and music streaming.\nOther retailers sales slow on Prime Day\nAmazon isn\u2019t alone in doing big sales on weekdays in July. Many of its top competitors held sales during the same period, with No. 2 Walmart Inc. returning to the promotional holiday this year after sitting out last year.\nHowever, many retailers saw a smaller Prime Day bump in traffic this year compared to last year, according to Digital Commerce 360\u2019s analysis of Similarweb traffic numbers. Last year, for example, Target Corp. (No. 5 in the Top 1000) grew traffic 42.3% over a control period two weeks prior to Prime Day. This year, traffic was up just 26.9%. Costco Wholesale Corp. (No. 6) went from a 24.6% bump last year to 16.7% this year. Best Buy Co. (No. 7), which usually gets huge increases in traffic as shoppers compare prices on big-ticket items, saw its bump drop to 51.2% from 85.0% last year.\nWalmart, which didn\u2019t participate in Prime Day promos last year, saw its change in traffic grow by half, up to 24.9% from 16.7%. But even Amazon had a smaller increase in traffic compared to the control period, down less than 1% compared to 2022\u2019s bump.\nSome of this is a difference in promo strategy. Retailers were heavily promotional during the 4th of July holiday period this year, with more offering Independence Day sales than competing with Prime Day. Also, top competitors offered week-long sales, meaning shoppers could focus on Amazon during its two-day sale and turn to Target, Walmart and Costco afterward to pick up other deals.\nFor the full week, Target\u2019s bump was still lower than last year, but the decline was much softer, with an 18.6% decline for the week compared to a 36.5% decline for the two-day period. Walmart\u2019s bump similarly grew when looking at the full week, up 56.0% for the week compared to a 49.2% increase for the two-day period.\nHow we got here\nHere are some insights that helped Digital Commerce 360 derive its Amazon Prime Day sales estimates:\nConsumer spending up on Amazon during Prime Day\nAccording to figures from a Numerator panel, Prime Day shoppers\u2019 spending on the site went up in 2023. The firm derives its insights from purchasing patterns on the Amazon platform. For the full 48-hour period, the average order value registered $54.05, up 3.4% from $52.26 during Prime Day 2021. Nearly a fifth of households placed five or more orders during the two-day period.\nUS Ecommerce: Poised for Takeoff? Insights from Digital Commerce 360\nNumerator data is based on 98,462 Prime Day orders placed through Amazon and spanning 34,185 unique households as well as a survey of more than 4,200 verified buyers.\nOutside of Amazon, sales weren\u2019t so rosy.

By focusing on customer acquisition, market segmentation, and brand positioning, Alibaba has established a dominant presence in the e-commerce landscape. With its comprehensive approach, the company excels in both the B2B and B2C markets, catering to businesses of all sizes and individual consumers.\nOne of the key factors behind Alibaba\u2019s success is its digital marketing solutions, which include SEO, online advertising, and social media marketing. By leveraging these tools, Alibaba drives brand promotion and boosts sales, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of the industry. The company\u2019s commitment to customer acquisition and market segmentation has solidified its position as a leader in the e-commerce space.\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion efforts have enabled it to compete with international e-commerce giants. With a network that reaches over 150 countries in the global logistics industry, Alibaba has formed partnerships with companies in retail, logistics, and technology sectors to reach more consumers and offer a wider range of products and services.\nFurthermore, Alibaba\u2019s brand positioning efforts through online advertising have helped it become a trusted and reliable partner for businesses and consumers. The company\u2019s innovative tactics, such as the annual November 11 sale, have played a significant role in generating record-breaking revenues. In fact, Alibaba earned $14.3 billion (\u20ac13.45 billion) revenue in just 24 hours, making it the highest revenue gained in one shopping day worldwide.\nUnder the visionary leadership of CEO Daniel Zhang, Alibaba continues to thrive. With over 24,000 employees in 70 offices worldwide, the company remains committed to its mission of reaching over 500 million consumers in 200 countries.\nKey Takeaways:\nAlibaba\u2019s Dominance in E-commerce\nWhen it comes to e-commerce, Alibaba is a force to be reckoned with. This multinational conglomerate has carved out a dominant position in both the B2B and B2C markets, solidifying its e-commerce dominance in China and beyond.\nAlibaba\u2019s success can be attributed to its customer-centric approach, placing the needs of users at the heart of its strategy. By creating a user-friendly platform, Alibaba has been able to attract and retain a large user base, offering them a seamless shopping experience.\nIn 2014, Alibaba went public with a staggering 83% market share in China\u2019s e-commerce market. Since then, the landscape has changed with the rise of competitors like Pinduoduo and JD.com. However, Alibaba has managed to maintain a significant market share, currently standing at 39.5%. While its market share has decreased, it is still a force to be reckoned with.\nAlibaba\u2019s continuous growth is fueled by its strong performance in the B2B and B2C sectors. One of its key strengths is its well-integrated supply chain, which allows for efficient operations and reduced costs. Moreover, Alibaba\u2019s Chinese e-commerce unit, Taobao & Tmall Group, experienced a 4% growth in revenue during the fourth quarter, demonstrating its resilience in a competitive market.\nTo enhance user experience and stay ahead of the competition, Alibaba focuses on improved product discovery tools and personalized recommendations. This customer-centric approach ensures that users find exactly what they\u2019re looking for, keeping them engaged and satisfied.\nMarket Share Comparison\nExamining the market share landscape, we can see that while Alibaba\u2019s share has decreased, it still maintains a significant lead over its competitors. Pinduoduo has witnessed substantial growth, increasing its market share from 11% to 16% in 2021. Meanwhile, JD.com has remained stable within the range of 16-18%.\nAs Alibaba continues to navigate the ever-changing e-commerce landscape, it faces competition not only from domestic players but also from global giants like Temu and SHEIN. However, Alibaba\u2019s strong brand positioning and global expansion efforts, including its focus on the US market, give it a competitive edge.\nAll in all, Alibaba\u2019s dominance in e-commerce is a result of its customer-centric approach, user-friendly platform, and continuous efforts to enhance the overall shopping experience. With its unwavering focus on innovation and global expansion, Alibaba is set to maintain its position as a leader in the e-commerce industry.\nAlibaba\u2019s Global Expansion\nAs Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce arm, AliExpress, operates in 150 countries, the company has been successful in its global expansion efforts. By forging strategic partnerships and making strategic investments, Alibaba has extended its reach beyond China, aiming to capture new markets and compete with major players like Amazon.\nOne key strategy Alibaba employs in its global expansion is forming strategic partnerships with established brands and companies. For instance, Tmall Luxury Pavilion, launched in 2017, has attracted 80 luxury brands, including Burberry and Versace, to sell their products directly to Chinese consumers. This strategic partnership has allowed Alibaba to tap into the luxury market and cater to the increasing demand for high-end goods in China.\nAnother important aspect of Alibaba\u2019s global expansion is its focus on connecting small and medium-sized brands from around the world with Alibaba customers in China. Through Taobao Global, Alibaba partners with these brands, providing them with access to a massive consumer base in China, while also bringing a diverse range of products to Chinese consumers.\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion is not limited to China or Asia. The company has made significant investments in online marketplaces in Southeast Asia, such as Lazada, where Alibaba invested $4 billion. This investment has allowed Alibaba to gain a strong foothold in the Southeast Asian market and expand its global reach.\nAdditionally, Alibaba has acquired e-commerce sites like Daraz in South Asia, made investments in companies like Tokopedia in Indonesia and Paytm in India, and partnered with MegaFon and Russia\u2019s Mail.Ru Group to establish AliExpress Russia. These moves highlight Alibaba\u2019s commitment to expanding its presence in key markets and capitalizing on the growth opportunities they offer.\nCompetitive analysis also plays a crucial role in Alibaba\u2019s global expansion strategy. By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of its competitors, such as Amazon and eBay, Alibaba can identify areas for improvement and innovation. This competitive analysis allows Alibaba to stay ahead in the global e-commerce landscape and navigate the challenges posed by regional competitors.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Global Expansion\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion is not without its challenges. Regulatory hurdles related to foreign investments, e-commerce, and data privacy pose obstacles that Alibaba must navigate and overcome. Furthermore, competition from global players like Amazon and regional competitors requires Alibaba to invest significantly in customer support and innovation.\nAnother crucial aspect of Alibaba\u2019s global expansion is adapting its strategies to local markets and consumer preferences. Navigating cultural differences is vital for Alibaba to succeed in new markets and ensure its strategies resonate with local consumers.\nIn summary, Alibaba\u2019s global expansion efforts have been driven by strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and investments in key markets. With its presence in 150 countries, Alibaba is successfully competing with major players in the e-commerce industry. By conducting comprehensive competitive analysis and adapting to local markets, Alibaba continues to expand its global footprint and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce.\nAlibaba\u2019s Brand Positioning\nAlibaba, a global leader in e-commerce, has strategically positioned itself as a trusted and reliable brand through innovative online advertising campaigns.

With a commitment to innovation, Alibaba continually enhances its platform to provide an unparalleled user experience.\nThe company\u2019s brand positioning is further reinforced by its strong emphasis on trust and credibility. Alibaba\u2019s secure payment options and stringent quality control measures contribute to its reputation as a reliable partner.\nFounder Jack Ma\u2019s significant recognition and popularity have also played a crucial role in building Alibaba\u2019s brand image. His entrepreneurial journey and success have made him a household name, further enhancing the company\u2019s credibility.\nAlibaba\u2019s brand positioning has enabled it to surpass retail giants like Walmart in global sales and achieve the world\u2019s biggest IPO in 2014. Today, the company holds a place within the global top 10 market cap.\nTo support its brand positioning, Alibaba has expanded its operations into major global markets, allowing it to reach a larger customer base. The company\u2019s presence in nearly 240 countries worldwide is a testament to its global dominance.\nTo visually represent Alibaba\u2019s brand positioning, the image below showcases the company\u2019s logo, embodying trust, innovation, and credibility:\nIn conclusion, Alibaba has successfully positioned itself as a trusted and innovative brand through strategic online advertising campaigns.

And it\u2019s easy to set up an Etsy ad campaign! These are the steps you can follow:\nEtsy ad campaigns help users find your items. Your ads will appear on Category and Market pages and Etsy searches. Sellers also have control over who sees their ad campaigns for maximum reach.\nBut what makes a results-driven Etsy ad campaign is how you manage your budget. You may not have the means to set your budget to $50 daily. $1 to $2 may be more financially feasible.\nIn this case, don\u2019t promote all your listings on such a tight budget. Pick your best-selling items and advertise those. As you generate more income, you can increase your budget.\nUsing this strategy prevents you from blowing through a wad of cash trying to sell on Etsy. And that can quickly happen without controlling how much you invest in ad spending compared to how much profit you generate.\nHere\u2019s what Etsy\u2019s ad dashboard looks like:\nBrie Moore, the owner of\u00a0Breezy Tee, used an Esty ad campaign to help her shop reach its ultimate potential. She was eager to turn a profit and spent $1 to $2 advertising 30 listings. But she didn\u2019t get the reach she expected because her budget was far too little for marketing all those items.\nHowever, Brie didn\u2019t expand her budget but chose to be more selective in what items she promoted. When her best-selling items achieved impressive results for her ad campaign, she increased her daily ad spend budget by 50 cents.\nBrie also developed a rule that worked \u2013 she would never spend more than 20% of her revenue on her ad budget. To stay ahead of which items made the ad budget cut, Brie measured sales and not just ad clicks!\nThis frugal approach did the trick. Now Brie has the capital to invest in top-tier models and photography to scale her Etsy store.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #2: Make Shopping Seamless\nOnline buyers want convenience, and you must achieve this in your Etsy store. Remember, you don\u2019t just want once-off buyers. You want consumers to have a fantastic experience, so they return.\u00a0\nAnd to achieve seamless shopping for your Etsy buyers you should:\nThe owner of\u00a0Herma May, an Etsy store specializing in signature fragrances\u00a0achieved success by providing effortless Etsy shopping. She includes freebies in customer orders, uses Etsy store collections, and invests a lot of time in understanding what her buyers want.\u00a0\nThis Etsy store seller also provides ideas on how customers could use her fragrances and never leaves out any information about these products. She also includes a \u201ccustomer care\u201d card for every order, explaining how to use her fragrances for an improved customer experience.\nTaking it a step further, this seller uses unique packaging for every one of her fragrances. This tactic makes it easier for returning buyers to choose a fragrance as they\u2019re quickly attracted to distinct packaging they\u2019ve never seen before.\nFrom the fruits of her labor, this Etsy seller now has a five-star rating on Etsy, and most of her consumers are loyal buyers.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #3: Leverage Instagram Marketing\u00a0\nInstagram is a bustling social media platform for pretty much every business. And that includes your Etsy store. The main reason is that Esty and Instagram share a significant factor influencing customers\u2019 purchasing behaviors \u2013 good-quality images.\nTo use Instagram marketing to promote your Etsy products, you should:\nThe owner of the Etsy store,\u00a0Little Maggie Moo, wasn\u2019t gaining the reach she wanted through Etsy alone. But this didn\u2019t deter her from selling the Esty products she believed in. Instead, she took to Instagram and started marketing her items.\nShe passionately shares high-quality pictures of her products to attract her audience. Because this Etsy store is all about baby clothes, she uses images of her clothes on happy babies. Doing this creates a visual idea of what her products can deliver.\nBut that\u2019s not all she does. The owner of Little Maggie Moo interacts with other business accounts she\u2019s passionate about. This Etsy seller also consistently engages with her followers. She shares exciting work and strikes up conversations in her a comments section.\u00a0\nPlus, she also networks with other Etsy store owners offering products related to hers. Once promoting their products and sharing their content, some of these Etsy store owners return the favor! All this effort helped steadily increase her Instagram followers and optimize her engagement.\nBut what did it do for her Etsy store?\nShe generated over 4000 sales!\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #4: Don\u2019t Forget SEO\nThere\u2019s a heck load of competition on Etsy, and you need to cut through the noise! And here\u2019s where trusty ol\u2019 SEO comes in.\nEtsy\u2019s search tool is pretty powerful, and buyers can find products in one of two ways:\nAs you can tell, many technicalities go behind Etsy\u2019s search engine to ensure it helps buyers find the products they\u2019re looking for. This is excellent news for your business, as you can use top SEO techniques to reach more users.\nSome of the best SEO tactics for Etsy marketing include:\nThe founder of an Etsy jewelry store,\u00a0Ringcrush, has generated over 100,000 sales since her launch in 2016! And guess what she says is her secret? Good SEO tactics like the techniques mentioned above!\nThis Etsy seller uses SEO to guide what she creates and how she markets her content, based on trending content!\nAnd here\u2019s another example!\nA different Etsy shop owner makes\u00a0$1500 to $2000 per week, thanks to her product sales. She chalks this up to her efforts to achieve maximum reach, which was only possible through a sound SEO strategy.\nPart of her strategy includes consistent and accurate keyword and hashtag research. She recommends always using these SEO elements in your listing to help stand out from your competition.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #5: Provide As Much Support as Possible\nHere\u2019s another effective Etsy marketing strategy related to delivering exceptional customer support.\u00a0\nRather than only focusing on your customer\u2019s experience while they shop, you should also consider the experience you provide after they buy your products. Taking this extra step helps maintain returning customers, and what every successful business needs!\nOnce customers have bought your Etsy products, keep them engaged through:\nUsing these techniques above will make your customers feel appreciated by your business. And if you know anything about customer appreciation, it certainly adds to brand loyalty!\nOwning two Etsy stores, Unmeasured Designs and Unmeasured Events, Tash uses a hands-on approach to maintain returning buyers. She\u2019s been on Etsy since 2017 and has racked up over $112,000 in sales.\nThe work behind her success boils down to keeping engaged with her customers after they\u2019ve made a purchase. She does this through email newsletters. Her buyers now have a point of contact to send her queries or concerns about her products.\nThanks to this approach, Tash keeps her consumers closely connected, and in turn, loyal to her businesses.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #6: Pay Close Attention to Analytics\u00a0\nEtsy analytics are very telling, and you shouldn\u2019t ignore them! If you don\u2019t know how to access Etsy analytics, here\u2019s how:\nWith access to all this valuable information, you can modify your approach to people interested in your Esty listings. You may find that you\u2019ve been targeting the wrong buyers, or the products you\u2019re investing in advertising aren\u2019t the best choices.\u00a0\nAlso, based on your analytics, don\u2019t be afraid to remove listings. If you see an item isn\u2019t performing well, you can try to optimize it, But if this problem persists, find a more profitable product.\nTo amp up your Etsy analytics, you can integrate Google analytics into Etsy. There are also many more tools and software you can use for more robust Etsy reporting.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s an example of Etsy stats:\nAmy Yee, the owner of Maeven Vintage, took full advantage of Esty\u2019s stats. She evaluates customer data like buyer locations, and purchasing habits while searching for keywords to inspire her products. Amy also uses Etsy to find popular vintage items and how much they sell for.\u00a0\nShe used this information to develop a long-term plan on how she would set her budget, market her store and create her items. With a foolproof business plan developed on the foundation of Esty stats, Amy Yee could expand her Etsy businesses into several pop-up shops around New York.\nAnd, this also helped her land in many publications and magazines!\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #7: Get Orders Delivered to Buyers ASAP\nThis may seem like general knowledge, but for some sellers, it isn\u2019t! Late orders are against Etsy\u2019s seller service standards, so it can harm your ability to sell on this platform,\u00a0\nAnd not forgetting, buyers will give you bad reviews, making you less of a contender to them and Etsy\u2019s search engine algorithm.\nIf you don\u2019t think this is a common mistake, then let me help prove it:\nIt takes about 3 to 7 working days to get Esty products, and you should do everything possible to make this happen. In an instance where something super unforeseeable happens, let your buyers know and make it up to them.\nYou could give them a discount or a freebie as a way to apologize. Doing this will show you are sincere about a late delivery, and defuse angry customers!\nJess Yuda, the owner of Planner Peace,\u00a0makes over $12,000 per month\u00a0from her Etsy store. But this is possible because of how seriously she takes customer service, and in turn, on-time deliveries.\u00a0\nThis Etsy seller does her best to deliver products within 3 to 5 working days. And to achieve this, she works with reliable delivery providers she\u2019s built rapport with. At any time Jess can\u2019t fulfill her quick delivery turnaround time, she informs her customers and sends them freebies!\nFrom this strategy, you can see how a small example of Etsy marketing contributes to a generous profit.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #8: Organization is Key\nWhen your Etsy store starts to take off, you must employ stricter organizational methods. Quickly losing count of your orders, revenue, expenses, and inventory will set you back from success.\nHands-on organization will also help you scale your business, as you have more resources to draw business proposals and plans.\u00a0\nTo organize your Etsy store, you can do the following:\nOnce you apply these Etsy organizational techniques, you\u2019ll find it much easier to scale and manage your store!\nThe owner of an Etsy store,\u00a0Jenna Crucitti Designs, proves the power of good organizational skills for Etsy\u2019s marketing success.\u00a0\nOnce hitting 2700 Etsy sales and earning more than $10,000 in profit, this Etsy shop owner decided she needed to organize her strategy for maximum results and productivity. As this transformed into a full-time job, it gave her even more reason to get organized!\nSo, Jenna took to QuickBooks to document all her monthly finances. And helping her process, she separates her personal finances from her store\u2019s spending and earnings.\nBut wait!\u00a0\nIt gets even better!\nNow, Jenna also uses her organizational techniques to help her claim tax deductions and gain tax benefits!\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #9: Ensure You Use High-Quality Photography\nWe briefly glanced over this while exploring Instagram marketing for selling Etsy products. But exceptional photography plays a huge role in Etsy, and deserves to be a strategy on its own.\nIf you use good-quality images on Etsy, you stand a greater chance of closing a sale.\u00a0\nHere are the top reasons why Etsy sellers need top-quality images:\nYou don\u2019t have to hire a professional photographer to take your Etsy product pictures. I mean, that would help, but it\u2019s not necessary when you\u2019re starting. All you need is a great camera (it can be a phone\u2019s camera), beautiful lighting, and as many tries as it takes, to get that \u201cWOW\u201d angle.\nIf you\u2019re struggling, YouTube has loads of resources on how to take amazing pictures using a phone!\nThey call her Etsy\u2019s most profitable seller, and her name is\u2026.Alicia Shaffer! Alicia racks up $70,000 worth of sales every month, and pins her success on fantastic photography.\nRather than only photographing the product, she showcases how it looks as part of an outfit. And she also exchanges the simple white background for various outdoor settings as this compliments her items.\nTo develop the perfect eye for her products, this OG Etsy seller evaluated her competitors\u2019 images and checked what worked and what didn\u2019t.\u00a0\nAs she\u2019s achieved quite a bit of success, Alicia now uses top-tier photographers, models, and sets to put her products at the forefront of her competitors.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #10: Use Exciting Email Newsletters\nEmail marketing is an excellent communication channel to include in your Etsy marketing strategy. When you use email, you build better relationships with your buyers and excite them about your products.\nEmail newsletters for an Etsy marketing campaign also effectively remind your buyers about your brand. Successful Etsy marketing relies on repeat buyers, and email newsletters achieve this.\nUsing email newsletters to engage your Etsy buyers, take steps like:\nDon\u2019t forget to include your branding and brand voice in your email newsletters. You want to leave an impression on your buyers so they know what to expect from your business!\nAfter sending a drawn-out series of bland email newsletters, Cassie Uhl, an Etsy shop seller, noticed she\u2019s not getting her ideal response. But this isn\u2019t where she stopped. Instead, she started sending emails that went beyond trying to secure sales.\nCassie Uhl focuses her newsletters on connecting to her buyers and making them feel like family. She shares her blog content, suggests products that add more value to her buyers, and ultimately, brings her readers into her creative process.\nAnother smart move from this Esty seller is that she aligns her content calendar with her email newsletters, so sharing relevant information is easier. Because of this wholesome approach, Cassie Uhl developed loyal customers and stronger brand-to-consumer relationships.\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #11: Diversify Your Offerings\nYou don\u2019t have to stick to one item for your Etsy store. You can diversify your offerings based on what you\u2019re passionate about and how all these products relate to each other. But you don\u2019t want to promote items that are too unrelated as this may confuse your buyers.\nFor example, if you\u2019re selling handmade football balls, you could also sell handmade quirky socks and silly football T-shirts.\u00a0\nWhen you diversify your offerings, you create multiple revenue streams, leading to higher profits.\u00a0\nIf you want to diversify your products consider factors like:\nAnd here\u2019s another aspect to consider \u2013 you can also open another Etsy store to sell products that don\u2019t relate to your current store. Obviously, this will take work, but it\u2019s still welcoming another revenue stream.\u00a0\nVana Chupp opened an Etsy store offering custom silhouettes. But she found her passion didn\u2019t end there and started a second Etsy store offering graphic design art and providing coaching to women aspiring to become business owners.\nShe started by developing herself as an expert in one area and grew her Etsy store until she could diversify her offerings. Now she also sells various books based on her artworks alongside her graphic design pieces and silhouettes.\nWhile this is certainly a much more complex strategy, it\u2019s best to consider it when you want to scale your Etsy store. And using the \u201cbig picture\u201d approach has worked well for this Etsy seller!\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #12: Leverage Press Releases and Free Publicity\nPress releases mean more free publicity, and this is what you need to skyrocket your Etsy store sales. The more people know about your store, the better, and you need to secure coverage in online and offline publications and magazines to achieve this.\nIf you don\u2019t know how to leverage press releases for your Etsy store, here\u2019s how:\nHoning your pitch and becoming familiar with the publications will determine if you secure press coverage or not. So, you want to take your time with this and ensure your pitch highlights your best values and proves how you can add value to their readers.\u00a0\nWhen Erin Flett launched her first Etsy store, she only sold 30 products in her first year. Pretty daunting, right!\nBut she realized that she needed more publicity. To get her Etsy store out there, she did her homework and found the best publications for her products. Erin started networking with professionals related to those publications through LinkedIn, or email (if she could find an email address).\nErin spent a lot of time understanding the content and voices of the publications she wanted to pitch to, and crafted her messages accordingly. She pitched to all sorts of businesses, and every time, her angle was unique and custom to the receiver. Boosting her chances, she also included photos!\nThanks to all this effort, Erin has earned more than $3000 in sales and has featured on the covers of four of the best-selling magazines in the US!\u00a0\nEtsy Marketing Strategy #13: Branding, Branding, and More Branding\nBranding is vital for your Etsy marketing campaign because you want to optimize customer experience. With consistent branding throughout your Etsy marketing efforts, you can develop a brand identity that customers can become familiar with.\nThink about this in your own life: You trust the brands you use because they have an established identity.\nTo develop branding for your Etsy store, consider factors like:\nOnce you\u2019ve nailed those elements down, you can build a brand identity and use this across your entire Etsy store and other social channels you choose for marketing.\u00a0\nAfter Iris Pohlgeers started her vintage Etsy store, she received constructive criticism on her images and style. This feedback inspired her to consider a new approach for her store\u2019s design.\u00a0\nShe brainstormed a color palette that encompassed her stores values and used this across her Etsy store. Iris also used her new-found branding to inspire her images and how they looked. She uses a consistent background for all her images so her shop is distinctive.\u00a0\nIris also ensures her branding is formatted for mobile and desktop! Because of her efforts to develop consistent branding, Iris has experienced exponential growth and confirms that her branding played a huge role.\u00a0\nSummary 13 Etsy Marketing Strategies\nConclusion\nEtsy marketing isn\u2019t a simple endeavor with the vast competition this online marketplace has.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon nears $13 billion in Prime Day sales\nAmazon boosted its overall Prime Day sales to record numbers, but growth is slowing. Consumers worldwide spent nearly $13 billion with Amazon.com Inc. during the retail giant\u2019s ninth-annual Prime Day, according to an early Digital Commerce 360 analysis. This year\u2019s two-day sale marked yet another record-breaking event, with a 6.7% year-over-year increase to $12.90 billion globally during the event on July 11 and 12, 2024. This is up from $12.09 billion in 2022 and $11.19 billion in 2021.\n\nPrime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. The pandemic impacted retailers\u2019 supply chains and inventory, shifted consumers\u2019 shopping priorities, and led more shoppers to Amazon.com to purchase essential items.\n\nThis year, shoppers purchased more than 375 million items worldwide during the 2023 event, up from 300 million last year. The average order value was $54.05, up 3.4% from $52.26 during Prime Day 2021. Nearly a fifth of households placed five or more orders during the two-day period.\n\nOther retailers saw a smaller Prime Day bump in traffic this year compared to last year. For example, Target Corp. grew traffic 26.9% this year compared to 42.3% last year. Costco Wholesale Corp. saw a bump of 16.7% this year compared to 24.6% last year. Best Buy Co. saw its bump drop to 51.2% from 85.0% last year. Walmart saw its change in traffic grow by half, up to 24.9% from 16.7%.\n\nSales outside of Amazon weren\u2019t as strong. Salesforce reported non-Amazon sales in the U.S. were down 10% year over year for the first day of the sales holiday and down 7% on the second. However, overall U.S. ecommerce spending was up 6.1% for the Prime Day period, hitting $12.7 billion for the two days, a new Prime Day record based on Adobe Analytics data.\n\nMerchants like Petcube and Thrasio Holdings Inc. reported significant sales increases during Prime Day. Petcube saw a double-digit multiple on sales compared to an average day, and Thrasio\u2019s brands had their best days ever during the event.\n\nIn summary, Amazon's Prime Day 2024 had a significant impact on total revenue in July 2024, with nearly $13 billion in sales, marking a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Other retailers experienced mixed results, with some seeing smaller traffic increases and others reporting declines in sales.",

This website provides an impartial, fact-based overview of K-12 education in the Buckeye State. We hope these data will help to inform conversations about improving education throughout the state. If you have ideas on how this could be improved and made more useful to you, write to us at ohiogadfly@fordhaminstitute.org. For more information about the Institute and its work, please visit www.fordhaminstitute.org/ohio\nView the Report\nStudentEnrollment\n\nOhio Public School Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has 1.6 million public school students of varying backgrounds and characteristics.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23). Note: Public school enrollment statistics include traditional district, public charter, and independent STEM school students, but do not include students attending joint-vocational districts and educational service centers, pupils attending non-public schools, or home schooled students. More information about those enrollments are found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSchool Options\u00e2\u0080\u009d section.\nPublic School Enrollment by Grade\u00a0Level\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has roughly 100,000 to 130,000 public school students per grade level.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23).\nPublic School Enrollment Trends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, overall public school enrollment has declined by nearly 10 percent. Enrollment for Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest race/ethnic student groups, white and African American students, has also declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent change from 2006 to 2023. The chart displays the spring part of the school year, a convention often used in this guide.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, public school enrollment has increased significantly among Hispanic, multiracial, and Asian/Pacific Islander students.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends by Selected Characteristics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, English learner enrollment has more than doubled, while the number of students with disabilities has slightly increased. The number of students identified as gifted has declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nLow Income Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe percentage of students identified as economically disadvantaged has increased since 2005-06. However, the percentage of Ohio children living in poverty has remained mostly static.\nSource: Economically disadvantaged data are from Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23); childhood poverty data are from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Kids Count Data Center and based on U.S. Census poverty estimates (data were not reported for 2020 and are not yet available for 2023). Notes: Ohio identifies students as \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomically disadvantaged\u00e2\u0080\u009d via federal meal programs, open to pupils from households with incomes at or below 185% of federal poverty. However, in 2010, Congress passed the Community Eligibility Provision which allows certain schools to deem all students as disadvantaged (even higher-income children) for the purposes of meals eligibility. In contrast, children in poverty are from households at or below 100% federal poverty.\nOhio School Districts and Typologies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor analytic purposes, the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce categorizes districts into eight typologies based on their geographic and socio-economic characteristics. This publication displays various statistics by typology to illustrate patterns of enrollment and achievement across the state.\nSource: Ohio DEW, School District Typology. Note: This map displays the border of each district and its corresponding typology.\nPublic School Students by Typology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28 percent of Ohio students reside in urban areas and 35 percent are from suburban communities; 21 percent live in small towns while 15 percent are from rural areas.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: Public charter and STEM schools are assigned to the typology of the district in which the school is located, as reported in DEW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s community school directory. Online charters\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as e-schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094are not included in a typology, since they can enroll students statewide.\nPublic School Students in Urban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents living in urban areas come from various racial and ethnic backgrounds, and almost nine in ten are identified as economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the urban typologies (i.e., urban: very high poverty and urban: high poverty).\nPublic School Students in Suburban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents from suburban areas are majority white, with modest racial and ethnic diversity. About one in five suburban students are economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the suburban typologies (i.e., suburban: very low poverty and suburban: low poverty).\nPublic School Students in Small Town Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe large majority of students from small towns are white and more than two in five are economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the small town typologies (i.e., small town: high poverty and small town: low poverty).\nPublic School Students in Rural Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents from rural areas are overwhelmingly white and just under half are identified as economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the rural typologies (i.e., rural: average poverty and rural: high poverty).\nOhio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twenty-Five Largest Districts by Enrollment (2022-23)\nNote: Ohio Virtual Academy, a statewide e-school, is considered equivalent to a school district. This table does not include charter or STEM students as part of the district\u00e2\u0080\u0099s student population. Enrollment changes of less than +/- 1 percent are considered to have had no substantive change (marked as \u00e2\u0080\u009c--\u00e2\u0080\u009c).\nSchoolOptions\n\nEnrollment by Educational Model\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoughly 80 percent of Ohio students attend traditional public school districts, while more than 110,000 students attend charter schools and more than 200,000 students attend non-public schools or homeschool.\nSources: All data are for 2022-23 and drawn from various sources from Ohio DEW.\nPublic Charter Schools\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has 334 charter schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as community schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094serving more than 110,000 students.\nSources: Ohio DEW downloadable file titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuilding Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d was used to calculate enrollments for 2022-23 and the community school directory was used to identify the type of charter school. Historical enrollment data were drawn from DEW, Community School Annual Report: 2021-2022.\nCharacteristics of Charter School Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoughly 80 percent of charter school students are economically disadvantaged, and a majority are Black or Hispanic. Nearly 70 percent of charter school students attend brick-and-mortar charters located in urban communities.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23). Note: All statistics in this table include online charter schools; they are not assigned to district typologies, however, because they can draw students from all areas of the state.\nInterdistrict Open Enrollment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFour in five Ohio districts participate in interdistrict open enrollment. Approximately 80,000 students open enroll, with participation generally, until recently, increasing over time.\nSources: Two sources were used for this chart, based on the availability of data. For 2002-03 to 2011-12, data from the Ohio Auditor of State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 report, Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Open Enrollment were used. For 2012-13 to 2022-23, enrollments are calculated based on school districts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 funding reports; see Ohio DEW, Traditional Public Schools Funding.\nPrivate School Scholarships\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore than 80,000 students used state-funded scholarships (often referred to as vouchers) to attend private schools in 2022-23.\nSource: Historical Historical data through 2020-21 are from American Federation for Children, School Choice Yearbook (2021). Ohio DEW began recently reporting more detailed voucher data and beginning with 2021-22, numbers are from Advanced Reports. Note: The chart displays the total number of students in the various scholarship programs. For more information on each program, see Ohio DEW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s webpage, Scholarships.\nHomeschooling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNearly 50,000 students participate in homeschooling; the number of homeschoolers significantly increased in 2020-21 and has decreased slightly since then.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Homeschool Student Data. Note: Students attending online charter schools are not considered homeschool students.\nStudent Achievement:National Exams\n\nNational Exams: NAEP 2022\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApproximately 30 to 40 percent of Ohio students reach the national standard for proficiency, just above the national average.\nSource: National Assessment of Educational Progress, Data Explorer (2022). Note: The figure displays proficiency rates\u00e2\u0080\u0094the percentage of students achieving NAEP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rigorous proficiency benchmark. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), considered the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Report Card,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is administered to a representative sample of fourth and eighth grade students in each state every two years in reading and math.\nOhio Compared to Other States\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNationally, Ohio ranks between 11th and 20th in fourth and eighth grade math and reading. Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national position has typically been between 10th and 20th for the past two decades.\nSource: National Assessment of Educational Progress, Data Explorer.

Today, most college and university students in the U.S. take at least some classes online.\nOnline degrees have a broad reach, encompassing new higher education concepts like microcredentials and massive open online courses (MOOCs), along with traditional college degrees.\nDistance learners, too, are a diverse group. As a remote student, your peers may include traditional college-age students, working parents, military service members, established professionals and lifelong learners.\nThis fast-growing field clearly holds wide appeal, but how big is online learning, exactly?\nThis article examines the popularity of online learning, charting how fast the field has grown in recent years and exploring the motivations behind distance learning. If you\u2019re a prospective or current online student, a parent or an educator\u2014or if you\u2019re just curious about the online learning phenomenon\u2014these are the key statistics to know.\nKey Takeaways\nOnline Learning by the Numbers\nAll types of colleges and universities offer classes online. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), public colleges enrolled about 8.5 million online students in 2021. Another 2.7 million remote learners attended private schools, including 1.9 million at nonprofit institutions and nearly 800,000 at for-profit schools.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the availability of online learning in higher education starting in 2020. NCES reports that 75% of all postsecondary students in the U.S.\u2014over 14 million learners\u2014took online classes in fall 2020 as the pandemic restricted in-person learning, whereas only 36% had enrolled in distance education in fall 2019.\nWith many schools opening classrooms for in-person learning again in 2021, the percentage of students enrolled in distance learning courses dropped to about 60%\u2014still much higher than in pre-pandemic years.\nOnline enrollment levels vary depending on where students live. Alaska, Hawai\u2019i and New Hampshire boast the highest percentages of online students in the United States.\nOnline Schools vs. Traditional College\nMany online degree seekers attend traditional schools, but as of 2020, about 15% of all U.S. college students attended primarily online institutions. NCES defines primarily online schools as those enrolling 90% or more of their student body in distance education. About 11% of U.S. colleges and universities\u2014422 institutions in total\u2014fit this profile.\nOften catering to working students, some online schools have always offered fully remote programs. Others began as traditional campus-based institutions, later establishing online divisions that grew to dwarf their brick-and-mortar counterparts.\nIn 2020, primarily online schools enrolled over 1.5 million full-time degree seekers. Another 1.2 million learners took classes part time. Female students outnumbered male students among both full-time and part-time enrollees, making up about 62% of all learners.\nOnline Learning Through the Years\nIn 2020, the onset of Covid-19 disrupted traditional education, abruptly forcing students, instructors and administrators to adapt to remote learning models.\nEven before the pandemic, however, remote learning had been growing steadily for almost a decade as daily life became more digitized and remote learning technology and infrastructure improved.\nIn 2012\u2014a watershed year in online education that saw the founding of MOOC giants edX and Coursera\u2014over 25% of U.S. college and university students took at least one distance learning course, NCES reports. By 2019, that number had risen to 36%, about half of whom attended exclusively online.\nIn 2020, the number of online students at traditional higher education institutions exploded as schools shifted courses online amid lockdown restrictions. During that year, about 46% of U.S. learners studied entirely online, and another 28% took at least some courses remotely. As of 2021, remote learning numbers remained high, with about 60% of college students taking some or all of their classes online.\nMany traditional degree-seeking students returned to in-person learning when schools reopened in 2021, but online education as a whole continued to grow.\nThe World Economic Forum reports that in 2016, Coursera had 21 million registered users. By 2019, 44 million learners used the MOOC platform. This number leaped to 71 million in 2020, but unlike online college enrollment numbers, Coursera\u2019s enrollment did not drop in 2021. Instead, the platform gained even more users, totaling 92 million in 2022.\nOnline Degrees\nRemote learning programs serve this growing body of online students with degree programs at all levels. NCES reports that in the 2019-20 academic year, primarily online colleges conferred:\nMale-identifying students earned 37% to 39% of these degrees, with female-identifying students earning 61% to 63%.\nStudents at primarily online schools make up 14.7% of all college and university enrollees. They earn:\nOnline doctoral programs are relatively uncommon; remote learners earn only 7.6% of all doctorates.\nOnline Learning by Race\nOnline schools serve a racially diverse student body, with more than half of all learners identifying as nonwhite. These institutions enroll minority learners at higher rates than conventional schools across most reported categories, as shown in the chart below.\nIlana Hamilton is a writer and editor specializing in education and career topics.

Alari\ufb011\u2709& Steve Song2 This study is a comparative analysis of online distance learning and traditional in-person education at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on understanding how different educational modalities affect student achievement. The justi\ufb01cation for this study lies in the rapid shift towards online learning, especially highlighted by the educational changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the \ufb01nal test scores of freshman students in \ufb01ve core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years, the research provides empirical insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of online versus traditional edu-cation. Initial observations suggested that students in online settings scored lower in most courses. However, after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores using multiple linear regression, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the crucial need for a nuanced, data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems. It brings to light the fact that the success of educational methodologies is highly contingent on speci\ufb01c contextual factors. This \ufb01nding advocates for educational administrators and policymakers to exercise careful and informed judgment when adopting online learning modalities. It encourages them to thoroughly evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes. This approach ensures that decisions about implementing online edu-cation are made with a comprehensive understanding of its diverse and context-speci\ufb01c impacts, aiming to optimize educational effectiveness and student success.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 OPEN 1 Department of Sports and Recreation Management, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Division of Research and Doctoral Studies, Concordia University Chicago, 7400 Augusta Street, River Forest, IL 60305, USA. \u2709email: balari\ufb01@ksu.edu.sa HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he year 2020 marked an extraordinary period, character-ized by the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and institutions worldwide had to adapt to unforeseen challenges across various domains, including health, economy, and education. In response, many educational institutions quickly transitioned to distance teaching (also known as e-learning, online learning, or virtual classrooms) to ensure continued access to education for their students. However, despite this rapid and widespread shift to online learning, a compre-hensive examination of its effects on student achievement in comparison to traditional in-person instruction remains largely unexplored.\nIn research examining student outcomes in the context of online learning, the prevailing trend is the consistent observation that online learners often achieve less favorable results when compared to their peers in traditional classroom settings (e.g., Fischer et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017; Edvardsson and Oskarsson, 2008). However, it is important to note that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of research on online learning has primarily focused on its potential impact (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., 2020; Di Pietro et al., 2020) or explored various perspectives (Aucejo et al., 2020; Radha et al., 2020) concerning distance education. These studies have often omitted a comprehensive and nuanced examination of its concrete academic consequences, particularly in terms of test scores and grades.\nGiven the dearth of research on the academic impact of online learning, especially in light of Covid-19 in the educational arena, the present study aims to address that gap by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person teaching in \ufb01ve required freshmen-level courses at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. To accomplish this objective, the current study compared the \ufb01nal exam results of 8297 freshman students who were enrolled in the \ufb01ve courses in person in 2020 to their 8425 \ufb01rst-year counterparts who has taken the same courses at the same institution in 2021 but in an online format.\nThe \ufb01nal test results of the \ufb01ve courses (i.e., University Skills 101, Entrepreneurship 101, Computer Skills 101, Computer Skills 101, and Fitness and Health Culture 101) were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors such as gender, class size and admission scores, which have been cited in past research to be correlated with student achievement (e.g., Meinck and Brese, 2019; Jepsen, 2015) Additionally, as the preparatory year at King Saud University is divided into \ufb01ve tracks\u2014health, nursing, science, business, and humanity, the study classi\ufb01ed students based on their respective disciplines.\nMotivation for the study The rapid expansion of distance learning in higher education, particularly highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Volk et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017), underscores the need for alternative educational approaches during crises. Such disrup-tions can catalyze innovation and the adoption of distance learning as a contingency plan (Christensen et al., 2015). King Saud University, like many institutions worldwide, faced the challenge of transitioning abruptly to online learning in response to the pandemic.\nE-learning has gained prominence in higher education due to technological advancements, offering institutions a competitive edge (Valverde-Berrocoso et al., 2020). Especially during condi-tions like the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic communication was utilized across the globe as a feasible means to overcome barriers and enhance interactions (Bozkurt, 2019).\nDistance learning, characterized by \ufb02exibility, became crucial when traditional in-person classes are hindered by unforeseen circumstance such as the ones posed by COVID-19 (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015). Scholars argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, often referred to as self-directed learning (Hiemstra, 1994) or self-education (Gadamer, 2001). Additional advantages include accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and \ufb02exibility (Sadeghi, 2019).\nHowever, distance learning is not immune to its own set of challenges.\nTechnical impediments, encompassing network issues, device limitations, and communication hiccups, represent formidable hurdles (Sadeghi, 2019). Furthermore, concerns about potential distractions in the online learning environment, fueled by the ubiquity of the internet and social media, have surfaced (Hall et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017). The absence of traditional face-to-face interactions among students and between students and instructors is also viewed as a potential drawback (Sadeghi, 2019).\nGiven the evolving understanding of the pros and cons of distance learning, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning, speci\ufb01cally in terms of student achievement, as compared to in-person classroom learning at King Saud University, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest higher education institutions.\nAcademic achievement: in-person vs online learning The primary driving force behind the rapid integration of tech-nology in education has been its emphasis on student perfor-mance (Lai and Bower, 2019). Over the past decade, numerous studies have undertaken comparisons of student academic achievement in online and in-person settings (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021). This section offers a concise review of the disparities in academic achievement between college students engaged in in-person and online learning, as identi\ufb01ed in existing research.\nA number of studies point to the superiority of traditional in-person education over online learning in terms of academic outcomes. For example, Fischer et al. (2020) conducted a com-prehensive study involving 72,000 university students across 433 subjects, revealing that online students tend to achieve slightly lower academic results than their in-class counterparts.\nSimilarly, Bettinger et al. (2017) found that students at for-pro\ufb01t online universities generally underperformed when compared to their in-person peers. Supporting this trend, Figlio et al. (2013) indicated that in-person instruction consistently produced better results, particularly among speci\ufb01c subgroups like males, lower-performing students, and Hispanic learners.\nAdditionally, Kaupp\u2019s (2012) research in California community colleges demonstrated that online students faced lower completion and success rates compared to their traditional in-person counterparts (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, other studies present evidence of online students outperforming their in-person peers. For example, Iglesias-Pradas et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of 43 bachelor courses at Telecommunication Engineering College in Malaysia, revealing that online students achieved higher academic out-comes than their in-person counterparts. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gonzalez et al. (2020) found that students engaged in online learning performed better than those who had previously taken the same subjects in traditional in-class settings.\nExpanding on this topic, several studies have reported mixed results when comparing the academic performance of online and in-person students, with various student and instructor factors emerging as in\ufb02uential variables. Chesser et al. (2020) noted that student traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion play a substantial role in academic achievement, ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 regardless of the learning environment\u2014be it traditional in-person classrooms or online settings. Furthermore, Cacault et al.\n(2021) discovered that online students with higher academic pro\ufb01ciency tend to outperform those with lower academic cap-abilities, suggesting that differences in students\u2019 academic abilities may impact their performance. In contrast, Bergstrand and Savage (2013) found that online classes received lower overall ratings and exhibited a less respectful learning environment when compared to in-person instruction. Nevertheless, they also observed that the teaching ef\ufb01ciency of both in-class and online courses varied signi\ufb01cantly depending on the instructors\u2019 back-grounds and approaches. These \ufb01ndings underscore the multi-faceted nature of the online vs. in-person learning debate, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.\nTheoretical framework. Constructivism is a well-established learning theory that places learners at the forefront of their educational experience, emphasizing their active role in con-structing knowledge through interactions with their environment (Duffy and Jonassen, 2009). According to constructivist princi-ples, learners build their understanding by assimilating new information into their existing cognitive frameworks (Vygotsky, 1978). This theory highlights the importance of context, active engagement, and the social nature of learning (Dewey, 1938).\nConstructivist approaches often involve hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and opportunities for collaborative exploration (Brooks and Brooks, 1999).\nIn the realm of education, subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emerges as a vital perspective that acknowledges the distinctive nature of different academic disciplines (Shulman, 1986). It suggests that teaching methods should be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of each subject, recognizing that subjects like mathematics, literature, or science require different approaches to facilitate effective learning (Shulman, 1987). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emphasizes that the methods of instruction should mirror the ways experts in a particular \ufb01eld think, reason, and engage with their subject matter (Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005).\nWhen applying these principles to the design of instruction for online and in-person learning environments, the signi\ufb01cance of adapting methods becomes even more pronounced. Online learning often requires unique approaches due to its reliance on technology, asynchronous interactions, and potential for reduced social presence (Anderson, 2003). In-person learning, on the other hand, bene\ufb01ts from face-to-face interactions and immediate feedback (Allen and Seaman, 2016). Here, the interplay of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy becomes evident.\nOnline learning. In an online environment, constructivist principles can be upheld by creating interactive online activities that promote exploration, re\ufb02ection, and collaborative learning (Salmon, 2000). Discussion forums, virtual labs, and multimedia presentations can provide opportunities for students to actively engage with the subject matter (Harasim, 2017). By integrating subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy, educators can design online content that mirrors the discipline\u2019s methodologies while leveraging technology for authentic experiences (Koehler and Mishra, 2009).\nFor instance, an online history course might incorporate virtual museum tours, primary source analysis, and collaborative time-line projects.\nIn-person learning. In a traditional brick-and-mortar class-room setting, constructivist methods can be implemented through group activities, problem-solving tasks, and in-depth discussions that encourage active participation (Jonassen et al., 2003). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy complements this by shaping instructional methods to align with the inherent characteristics of the subject (Hattie, 2009). For instance, in a physics class, hands-on experiments and real-world applications can bring theoretical concepts to life (Hake, 1998).\nIn sum, the fusion of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy offers a versatile approach to instructional design that adapts to different learning environments (Garrison, 2011). By incorporating the principles of both theories, educators can tailor their methods to suit the unique demands of online and in-person learning, ultimately providing students with engaging and effective learning experiences that align with the nature of the subject matter and the mode of instruction.\nCourse description The Self-Development Skills Department at King Saud University (KSU) offers \ufb01ve mandatory freshman-level courses. These courses aim to foster advanced thinking skills and cultivate sci-enti\ufb01c research abilities in students. They do so by imparting essential skills, identifying higher-level thinking patterns, and facilitating hands-on experience in scienti\ufb01c research. The design of these classes is centered around aiding students\u2019 smooth transition into university life. Brief descriptions of these courses are as follows: University Skills 101 (CI 101) is a three-hour credit course designed to nurture essential academic, communication, and Fig. 1 Comparison of Final Exam Results for the Five Courses Mandatory Freshman Courses in King Saud University by Year (2020 and 2021). The \ufb01gure compared student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, using independent-samples t-tests; the results show a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 3 personal skills among all preparatory year students at King Saud University. The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the practical abilities they need to excel in their academic pursuits and navigate their university lives effectively. CI 101 comprises 12 sessions and is an integral part of the curriculum for all incoming freshmen, ensuring a standardized foundation for skill development.\nFitness and Health 101 (FAJB 101) is a one-hour credit course.\nFAJB 101 focuses on the aspects of self-development skills in terms of health and physical, and the skills related to personal health, nutrition, sports, preventive, psychological, reproductive, and \ufb01rst aid. This course aims to motivate students\u2019 learning process through entertainment, sports activities, and physical exercises to maintain their health. This course is required for all incoming freshmen students at King Saud University.\nEntrepreneurship 101 (ENT 101) is a one-hour- credit course.\nENT 101 aims to develop students\u2019 skills related to entrepre-neurship. The course provides students with knowledge and skills to generate and transform ideas and innovations into practical commercial projects in business settings. The entrepreneurship course consists of 14 sessions and is taught only to students in the business track.\nComputer Skills 101 (CT 101) is a three-hour credit course.\nThis provides students with the basic computer skills, e.g., com-ponents, operating systems, applications, and communication backup. The course explores data visualization, introductory level of modern programming with algorithms and information security. CT 101 course is taught for all tracks except those in the human track.\nComputer Skills 102 (CT 102) is a three-hour credit course. It provides IT skills to the students to utilize computers with high ef\ufb01ciency, develop students\u2019 research and scienti\ufb01c skills, and increase capability to design basic educational software. CT 102 course focuses on operating systems such as Microsoft Of\ufb01ce.\nThis course is only taught for students in the human track.\nStructure and activities. These courses ranged from one to three hours. A one-hour credit means that students must take an hour of the class each week during the academic semester. The same arrangement would apply to two and three credit-hour courses.\nThe types of activities in each course are shown in Table 1.\nAt King Saud University, each semester spans 15 weeks in duration. The total number of semester hours allocated to each course serves as an indicator of its signi\ufb01cance within the broader context of the academic program, including the diverse tracks available to students. Throughout the two years under study (i.e., 2020 and 2021), course placements (fall or spring), course content, and the organizational structure remained consistent and uniform.\nData Participants. The study\u2019s data comes from test scores of a cohort of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students enrolled at King Saud Uni-versity in Saudi Arabia over the span of two academic years: 2020 and 2021. Among these students, 8297 were engaged in tradi-tional, in-person learning in 2020, while 8425 had transitioned to online instruction for the same courses in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the student population consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. However, in 2021, there was a reversal in these proportions, with female students accounting for 48.5% and male students comprising 51.5% of the total participants.\nRegarding student enrollment in the \ufb01ve courses, Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown by average class size, admission scores, and the number of students enrolled in the courses during the two years covered by this study. While the total number of students in each course remained relatively consistent across the two years, there were noticeable \ufb02uctuations in average class sizes.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, four out of the \ufb01ve courses experienced substantial increases in class size, with some nearly doubling in size (e.g., ENT_101 and CT_102), while one course (CT_101) showed a reduction in its average class size.\nIn this study, it must be noted that while some students enrolled in up to three different courses within the same academic year, none repeated the same exam in both years. Speci\ufb01cally, students who failed to pass their courses in 2020 were required to complete them in summer sessions and were consequently not included in this study\u2019s dataset. To ensure clarity and precision in our analysis, the research focused exclusively on student test scores to evaluate and compare the academic effectiveness of online and traditional in-person learning methods. This approach was chosen to provide a clear, direct comparison of the educational impacts associated with each teaching format.\nMethods. Descriptive analysis of the \ufb01nal exam scores for the two years (2020 and 2021) were conducted. Additionally, comparison of student outcomes in in-person classes in 2020 to their online platform peers in 2021 were conducted using an independent-samples t-test. Subsequently, in order to address potential Table 1 Learning activities and total course hours per semester.\nLearning Activities Courses Lecture Laboratory Total Semester Hours CT_101 50% 50% 45 CT_102 50% 50% 45 ENT_101 100% 0% 15 FAJB_101 100% 0% 15 CI_101 100% 0% 45 CI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nTable 2 Class size, gender distribution, and admission scores by courses in 2020 and 2021.\nCourses Average Class Size Gender Distribution Admission Scores 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 FAJB 101 23.1 46.1 M = 53.8%, F = 46.2% M = 58.3%, F = 41.7% 89.58 87.95 CI 101 21.6 35.2 M = 54%, F = 46% M = 58%, F = 42% 89.57 87.96 ENT 101 33.7 66.7 M = 68.1%, F = 31.9% M = 69.7%, F = 30.3% 87.94 90.19 CT 101 42.7 22.3 M = 62.7%, F = 37.3% M = 64.2%, F = 35.8% 90.84 88.22 CT 102 21.1 46.5 M = 51.4%, F = 48% M = 57%, F = 43% 87.85 86.85 Source: Deanship of Admission and Registration Affairs at King Saud University.\nCI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 disparities between the two groups arising from variables such as gender, class size, and admission scores (which serve as an indicator of students\u2019 academic aptitude and pre-enrollment knowledge), multiple regression analyses were conducted. In these multivariate analyses, outcomes of both in-person and online cohorts were assessed within their respective tracks. By carefully considering essential aforementioned variables linked to student performance, the study aimed to ensure a comprehensive and equitable evaluation.\nStudy instrument. The study obtained students\u2019 \ufb01nal exam scores for the years 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) from the school\u2019s records of\ufb01ce through their examination management system. In the preparatory year at King Saud University, \ufb01nal exams for all courses are developed by committees composed of faculty members from each department. To ensure valid com-parisons, the \ufb01nal exam questions, crafted by departmental committees of professors, remained consistent and uniform for the two years under examination.\nTable 3 provides a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of all \ufb01ve tests included in our analysis. These tests exhibit a strong degree of internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coef\ufb01cients spanning a range from 0.77 to 0.86. This robust and consistent internal consistency measurement underscores the dependable nature of these tests, af\ufb01rming their reliability and suitability for the study\u2019s objectives.\nIn terms of assessing test validity, content validity was ensured through a thorough review by university subject matter experts, resulting in test items that align well with the content domain and learning objectives. Additionally, criterion-related validity was established by correlating students\u2019 admissions test scores with their \ufb01nal required freshman test scores in the \ufb01ve subject areas, showing a moderate and acceptable relationship (0.37 to 0.56) between the test scores and the external admissions test. Finally, construct validity was con\ufb01rmed through reviews by experienced subject instructors, leading to improvements in test content. With guidance from university subject experts, construct validity was established, af\ufb01rming the effectiveness of the \ufb01nal tests in assessing students\u2019 subject knowledge at the end of their coursework.\nCollectively, these validity and reliability measures af\ufb01rm the soundness and integrity of the \ufb01nal subject tests, establishing their suitability as effective assessment tools for evaluating students\u2019 knowledge in their \ufb01ve mandatory freshman courses at King Saud University.\nProcedure. After obtaining research approval from the Research Committee at King Saud University, the coordinators of the \ufb01ve courses (CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101) supplied the researchers with the \ufb01nal exam scores of all \ufb01rst-year preparatory year students at King Saud University for the initial semester of the academic years 2020 and 2021. The sample encompassed all students who had completed these \ufb01ve courses during both years, resulting in a total of 16,722 students forming the \ufb01nal group of participants.\nLimitations. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the research was conducted within a well-resourced major public university. As such, the experiences with online classes at other types of institutions (e.g., community colleges, private institutions) may vary signi\ufb01cantly. Additionally, the limited data pertaining to in-class teaching practices and the diversity of learning activities across different courses represents a gap that could have provided valuable insights for a more thor-ough interpretation and explanation of the study\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\nFindings To compare student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, independent-samples t-tests were conducted.\nTable 4 shows a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nThe biggest decline was with CT_102 with 3.58 points, and the smallest decline was with CI_101 with 0.18 points.\nHowever, such simple comparison of means between the two years (via t-tests) by subjects does not account for the differences in gender composition, class size, and admission scores between the two academic years, all of which have been associated with student outcomes (e.g., Ho and Kelman, 2014; De Paola et al., 2013). To account for such potential confounding variables, multiple regressions were conducted to compare the 2 years\u2019 results while controlling for these three factors associated with student achievement.\nTable 5 presents the regression results, illustrating the variation in \ufb01nal exam scores between 2020 and 2021, while controlling for gender, class size, and admission scores.

Conversely, in the case of ENT_101, online students in 2021 scored 0.69 points lower than their 2020 in-person counterparts. With CT_102, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences in \ufb01nal exam scores between the two cohorts of students.\nDiscussion The study sought to assess the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning in the higher education setting in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed the \ufb01nal exam scores of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students in King Saud University in \ufb01ve required subjects (i.e., CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101). The study initially performed a simple comparison of mean scores by tracks by year (via t-tests) and then a number of multiple regression analyses which controlled for class size, gender composition, and admission scores.\nOverall, the study\u2019s more in-depth \ufb01ndings using multiple regression painted a wholly different picture than the results obtained using t-tests. After controlling for class size, gender composition, and admissions scores, online students in 2021 performed better than their in-person instruction peers in 2020 in University Skills (CI_101), Fitness and Health (FAJB_101), and Computer Skills (CT_101), whereas in-person students out-performed their online peers in Entrepreneurship (ENT_101).\nThere was no meaningful difference in outcomes for students in the Computer Skills (CT_102) course for the two years.\nIn light of these \ufb01ndings, it raises the question: why do we observe minimal differences (less than a one-point gain or loss) in student outcomes in courses like University Skills, Fitness and Health, Entrepreneurship, and Advanced Computer Skills based on the mode of instruction? Is it possible that when subjects are primarily at a basic or introductory level, as is the case with these courses, the mode of instruction may have a limited impact as long as the concepts are effectively communicated in a manner familiar and accessible to students?\nIn today\u2019s digital age, one could argue that students in more developed countries, such as Saudi Arabia, generally possess the skills and capabilities to effectively engage with materials pre-sented in both in-person and online formats. However, there is a notable exception in the Basic Computer Skills course, where the online cohort outperformed their in-person counterparts by more than 5 points. Insights from interviews with the instructors of this course suggest that this result may be attributed to the course\u2019s basic and conceptual nature, coupled with the availability of instructional videos that students could revisit at their own pace.\nGiven that students enter this course with varying levels of computer skills, self-paced learning may have allowed them to cover course materials at their preferred speed, concentrating on less familiar topics while swiftly progressing through concepts they already understood. The advantages of such self-paced learning have been documented by scholars like Tullis and Ben-jamin (2011), who found that self-paced learners often outper-form those who spend the same amount of time studying identical materials. This approach allows learners to allocate their time more effectively according to their individual learning pace, providing greater ownership and control over their learning experience. As such, in courses like introductory computer skills, it can be argued that becoming familiar with fundamental and conceptual topics may not require extensive in-class Table 5 Regression Summary of Freshman Final Exam Results in 2020 (In Person) and 2021(Online) by Courses, Controlling for Gender Composition, Class Size, and Admission Scores in King Saud University.\nCI_101 FAJB_101 ENT_101 CT_101 CT_102 \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta Constant \u22121820.97*** --\u22121145.93*** --1382.01*** --\u221210709.12*** --\u22121360.93*** --Year 0.89*** 0.07 0.56** 0.05 \u22120.69*** \u22120.06 5.28*** 0.32 0.66 0.04 Gender 4.18*** 0.31 4.20*** 0.34 3.80*** 0.31 2.38*** 0.14 4.07*** 0.23 Class Size 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02*** 0.08 0.16*** 0.23 \u22120.13*** \u22120.20 Admission Scores 0.62*** 0.42 0.55*** 0.41 0.44*** 0.35 0.75*** 0.43 0.78*** 0.37 Adjusted-R2 0.32 0.35 0.30 0.28 0.24 Gender was represented with male = 0 and female = 1.

Instead, it may be more about exposure to and digestion of materials in a format and at a pace tailored to stu-dents with diverse backgrounds, knowledge levels, and skill sets.\nFurther investigation is needed to more fully understand why some classes bene\ufb01tted from online instruction while others did not, and vice versa. Perhaps, it could be posited that some content areas are more conducive to in-person (or online) format while others are not. Or it could be that the different results of the two modes of learning were driven by students of varying academic abilities and engagement, with low-achieving students being more vulnerable to the limitations of online learning (e.g., Kofoed et al., 2021). Whatever the reasons, the results of the current study can be enlightened by a more in-depth analysis of the various factors associated with such different forms of learning. Moreover, although not clear cut, what the current study does provide is additional evidence against any dire consequences to student learning (at least in the higher ed setting) as a result of sudden increase in online learning with possible bene\ufb01ts of its wider use being showcased.\nBased on the \ufb01ndings of this study, we recommend that edu-cational leaders adopt a measured approach to online learning\u2014a stance that neither fully embraces nor outright denounces it. The impact on students\u2019 experiences and engagement appears to vary depending on the subjects and methods of instruction, sometimes hindering, other times promoting effective learning, while some classes remain relatively unaffected.\nRather than taking a one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, educational leaders should be open to exploring the nuances behind these outcomes. This involves examining why certain courses thrived with online delivery, while others either experienced a decline in student achievement or remained largely unaffected. By exploring these differentiated outcomes associated with diverse instructional formats, leaders in higher education institutions and beyond can make informed decisions about resource allo-cation. For instance, resources could be channeled towards in-person learning for courses that bene\ufb01t from it, while simul-taneously expanding online access for courses that have demonstrated improved outcomes through its virtual format.\nThis strategic approach not only optimizes resource allocation but could also open up additional revenue streams for the institution.\nConsidering the enduring presence of online learning, both before the pandemic and its accelerated adoption due to Covid-19, there is an increasing need for institutions of learning and scholars in higher education, as well as other \ufb01elds, to prioritize the study of its effects and optimal utilization. This study, which compares student outcomes between two cohorts exposed to in-person and online instruction (before and during Covid-19) at the largest university in Saudi Arabia, represents a meaningful step in this direction.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.\nReceived: 7 June 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023; References Allen IE, Seaman J (2016) Online report card: Tracking online education in the United States.

    "Document2": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning. Accommodate learning styles8 Active learning strategies9 Collaborative learning10 Differentiated instruction11 Flipped classroom model12 Partner/group activities13 Peer-to-peer interaction14 Project based learning15 Short recorded lessons16 Video communication17 3 Hybrid Learning: Integrating the Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals in Distance Learning The school community18 includes a range of administrators and staff who support students\u2019 social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

Lower Cost of Living\nFlorida offers a moderate cost of living, with a cost-of-living index of 102.4%. The cost-of-living index measures the cost of housing, food, healthcare, and other basic expenses in a state compared to the national average. Florida has the 33rd lowest cost of living.\n3. More Diverse Classrooms\nMany Florida colleges accept online learners from across state lines or even internationally, which allows you to make connections across the nation and world. Online programs attract a diverse selection of students to learn with and from.\n4. Flexible and Convenient Format\nYou can earn your degree online without traveling to campus or attend a hybrid program that incorporates in-person learning.

In fact, the private sector in Florida added 42,800 jobs in July 2023. Students attending college in Florida will graduate into a healthy job market.\nFrequently Asked Questions About Online Colleges in Florida\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the easiest online college to get into in Florida?\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, is one of the easiest online colleges to get into in the Sunshine State. The college admitted 100% of applicants in the fall of 2023.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the University of Miami, which admitted 19% of the 48,286 applicants in the fall of 2023, has one of the most selective admission processes in Florida, according to NCES.

Transfer students to the main campus need at least 60 college credits, while UF Online accepts lower-division transfer students with only 12 credits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIs online college free in Florida?\n\t\t\t\t\t\nNo, an online degree is not free in Florida. That said, you can find non-credit online courses at institutions such as South Florida State College. Florida students may also apply for fee waivers or exemptions, which provide discounts or an entirely free education.

    "Summarized_Document1": "This study compares online and in-person learning at King Saud University, focusing on the impact on student achievement. The research analyzed final test scores of 16,722 freshman students in five core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years. Initial observations indicated lower scores for online students, but after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the need for a data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems, considering the variable effects on learning outcomes.The study's motivation stems from the rapid shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for alternative educational approaches. Distance learning offers flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness but also faces challenges like technical issues and potential distractions. The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning at King Saud University.Theoretical frameworks of constructivism and subject-specific pedagogy were applied to understand the differences in learning environments. Constructivism emphasizes active learning and context, while subject-specific pedagogy tailors teaching methods to the characteristics of each subject. These principles were used to design instruction for both online and in-person learning environments.The study's data comes from test scores of 16,722 first-year students at King Saud University over two academic years: 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online). The final exam results of five courses were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors like gender, class size, and admission scores. Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare student outcomes.Findings showed a statistically significant drop in test scores from 2020 to 2021 for all courses except Computer Skills 101. However, after controlling for confounding variables, online students in 2021 performed better in University Skills 101, Fitness and Health 101, and Computer Skills 101, while in-person students outperformed online peers in Entrepreneurship 101. There was no significant difference in outcomes for Computer Skills 102.The study suggests that the mode of instruction may have limited impact on basic or introductory courses, as long as concepts are effectively communicated. The advantages of self-paced learning in online environments were highlighted, particularly for courses like introductory computer skills. The study recommends a measured approach to online learning, exploring the nuances behind different outcomes and optimizing resource allocation based on course-specific needs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence against any dire consequences to student learning due to the shift to online learning, with potential benefits for certain courses. Educational leaders should adopt a strategic approach, considering the specific needs of each course and the potential advantages of online learning.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for educators, transitioning many school districts from in-person instruction to distance learning models, including hybrid combinations of in-person and virtual learning. Educators must implement these new models to meet students' academic, physical, social, and emotional needs, often requiring collaboration with other professionals within their school or district. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, key features, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of professional support for student learning. Hyflex Learning Hyflex learning offers a flexible course structure allowing students to attend sessions in the classroom, participate online, or both. It is characterized by flexible attendance modes and lends itself more to synchronous learning. Students can participate face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning) or at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology is used for real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, learning activities, communication, and assignment management. Blended Learning Blended learning combines face-to-face instruction with online instruction, lending itself more to asynchronous learning. Students attend partial face-to-face classes (synchronous learning) and complete online learning at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology delivers additional content, facilitates learning activities, communicates with students, and manages resources and assignments. Terminology Cloud storage: Internet-based computing model for storing, managing, and sharing files online. Learning management system (LMS): Platform for deploying and tracking online training, accessible to both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette: Appropriate online social behavior. Student response tool: Tool for receiving real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning: Synchronous learning occurs in real-time with active participation, while asynchronous learning occurs on the student's schedule. Video conferencing: Technology for face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Practices for Hybrid Learning Hyflex and blended learning share many pedagogical practices, but key differences exist. Hyflex relies more on synchronous learning, using real-time student response tools, while blended learning's asynchronous nature does not. Practices include accommodating learning styles, active learning strategies, collaborative learning, differentiated instruction, flipped classroom model, partner/group activities, peer-to-peer interaction, project-based learning, short recorded lessons, and video communication. Hybrid Learning: Integrating Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals The school community includes administrators and staff supporting students' social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. Online instruction does not eliminate the need for socialization, physical activity, or access to services from social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Hyflex and blended learning models offer opportunities to support instruction and build community by connecting students with other professionals. Consider involving librarians/media specialists, physical education teachers, specialized instruction support personnel (SISP), education support professionals (ESPs), paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, and arts and music educators in supporting student learning. Resources: Various resources are provided, including tools for diverse learners, learning management systems, netiquette guidelines, formative assessment tools, synchronous and asynchronous learning strategies, video conferencing best practices, and more.",

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "ARTICLE Online vs in-person learning in higher education: effects on student achievement and recommendations for leadership Bandar N. Alari\ufb011\u2709& Steve Song2 This study is a comparative analysis of online distance learning and traditional in-person education at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on understanding how different educational modalities affect student achievement. The justi\ufb01cation for this study lies in the rapid shift towards online learning, especially highlighted by the educational changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the \ufb01nal test scores of freshman students in \ufb01ve core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years, the research provides empirical insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of online versus traditional edu-cation. Initial observations suggested that students in online settings scored lower in most courses. However, after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores using multiple linear regression, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the crucial need for a nuanced, data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems. It brings to light the fact that the success of educational methodologies is highly contingent on speci\ufb01c contextual factors. This \ufb01nding advocates for educational administrators and policymakers to exercise careful and informed judgment when adopting online learning modalities. It encourages them to thoroughly evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes. This approach ensures that decisions about implementing online edu-cation are made with a comprehensive understanding of its diverse and context-speci\ufb01c impacts, aiming to optimize educational effectiveness and student success.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 OPEN 1 Department of Sports and Recreation Management, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Division of Research and Doctoral Studies, Concordia University Chicago, 7400 Augusta Street, River Forest, IL 60305, USA. \u2709email: balari\ufb01@ksu.edu.sa HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he year 2020 marked an extraordinary period, character-ized by the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and institutions worldwide had to adapt to unforeseen challenges across various domains, including health, economy, and education. In response, many educational institutions quickly transitioned to distance teaching (also known as e-learning, online learning, or virtual classrooms) to ensure continued access to education for their students. However, despite this rapid and widespread shift to online learning, a compre-hensive examination of its effects on student achievement in comparison to traditional in-person instruction remains largely unexplored.\nIn research examining student outcomes in the context of online learning, the prevailing trend is the consistent observation that online learners often achieve less favorable results when compared to their peers in traditional classroom settings (e.g., Fischer et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017; Edvardsson and Oskarsson, 2008). However, it is important to note that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of research on online learning has primarily focused on its potential impact (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., 2020; Di Pietro et al., 2020) or explored various perspectives (Aucejo et al., 2020; Radha et al., 2020) concerning distance education. These studies have often omitted a comprehensive and nuanced examination of its concrete academic consequences, particularly in terms of test scores and grades.\nGiven the dearth of research on the academic impact of online learning, especially in light of Covid-19 in the educational arena, the present study aims to address that gap by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person teaching in \ufb01ve required freshmen-level courses at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. To accomplish this objective, the current study compared the \ufb01nal exam results of 8297 freshman students who were enrolled in the \ufb01ve courses in person in 2020 to their 8425 \ufb01rst-year counterparts who has taken the same courses at the same institution in 2021 but in an online format.\nThe \ufb01nal test results of the \ufb01ve courses (i.e., University Skills 101, Entrepreneurship 101, Computer Skills 101, Computer Skills 101, and Fitness and Health Culture 101) were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors such as gender, class size and admission scores, which have been cited in past research to be correlated with student achievement (e.g., Meinck and Brese, 2019; Jepsen, 2015) Additionally, as the preparatory year at King Saud University is divided into \ufb01ve tracks\u2014health, nursing, science, business, and humanity, the study classi\ufb01ed students based on their respective disciplines.\nMotivation for the study The rapid expansion of distance learning in higher education, particularly highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Volk et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017), underscores the need for alternative educational approaches during crises. Such disrup-tions can catalyze innovation and the adoption of distance learning as a contingency plan (Christensen et al., 2015). King Saud University, like many institutions worldwide, faced the challenge of transitioning abruptly to online learning in response to the pandemic.\nE-learning has gained prominence in higher education due to technological advancements, offering institutions a competitive edge (Valverde-Berrocoso et al., 2020). Especially during condi-tions like the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic communication was utilized across the globe as a feasible means to overcome barriers and enhance interactions (Bozkurt, 2019).\nDistance learning, characterized by \ufb02exibility, became crucial when traditional in-person classes are hindered by unforeseen circumstance such as the ones posed by COVID-19 (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015). Scholars argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, often referred to as self-directed learning (Hiemstra, 1994) or self-education (Gadamer, 2001). Additional advantages include accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and \ufb02exibility (Sadeghi, 2019).\nHowever, distance learning is not immune to its own set of challenges.\nTechnical impediments, encompassing network issues, device limitations, and communication hiccups, represent formidable hurdles (Sadeghi, 2019). Furthermore, concerns about potential distractions in the online learning environment, fueled by the ubiquity of the internet and social media, have surfaced (Hall et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017). The absence of traditional face-to-face interactions among students and between students and instructors is also viewed as a potential drawback (Sadeghi, 2019).\nGiven the evolving understanding of the pros and cons of distance learning, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning, speci\ufb01cally in terms of student achievement, as compared to in-person classroom learning at King Saud University, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest higher education institutions.\nAcademic achievement: in-person vs online learning The primary driving force behind the rapid integration of tech-nology in education has been its emphasis on student perfor-mance (Lai and Bower, 2019). Over the past decade, numerous studies have undertaken comparisons of student academic achievement in online and in-person settings (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021). This section offers a concise review of the disparities in academic achievement between college students engaged in in-person and online learning, as identi\ufb01ed in existing research.\nA number of studies point to the superiority of traditional in-person education over online learning in terms of academic outcomes. For example, Fischer et al. (2020) conducted a com-prehensive study involving 72,000 university students across 433 subjects, revealing that online students tend to achieve slightly lower academic results than their in-class counterparts.\nSimilarly, Bettinger et al. (2017) found that students at for-pro\ufb01t online universities generally underperformed when compared to their in-person peers. Supporting this trend, Figlio et al. (2013) indicated that in-person instruction consistently produced better results, particularly among speci\ufb01c subgroups like males, lower-performing students, and Hispanic learners.\nAdditionally, Kaupp\u2019s (2012) research in California community colleges demonstrated that online students faced lower completion and success rates compared to their traditional in-person counterparts (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, other studies present evidence of online students outperforming their in-person peers. For example, Iglesias-Pradas et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of 43 bachelor courses at Telecommunication Engineering College in Malaysia, revealing that online students achieved higher academic out-comes than their in-person counterparts. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gonzalez et al. (2020) found that students engaged in online learning performed better than those who had previously taken the same subjects in traditional in-class settings.\nExpanding on this topic, several studies have reported mixed results when comparing the academic performance of online and in-person students, with various student and instructor factors emerging as in\ufb02uential variables. Chesser et al. (2020) noted that student traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion play a substantial role in academic achievement, ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 regardless of the learning environment\u2014be it traditional in-person classrooms or online settings. Furthermore, Cacault et al.\n(2021) discovered that online students with higher academic pro\ufb01ciency tend to outperform those with lower academic cap-abilities, suggesting that differences in students\u2019 academic abilities may impact their performance. In contrast, Bergstrand and Savage (2013) found that online classes received lower overall ratings and exhibited a less respectful learning environment when compared to in-person instruction. Nevertheless, they also observed that the teaching ef\ufb01ciency of both in-class and online courses varied signi\ufb01cantly depending on the instructors\u2019 back-grounds and approaches. These \ufb01ndings underscore the multi-faceted nature of the online vs. in-person learning debate, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.\nTheoretical framework. Constructivism is a well-established learning theory that places learners at the forefront of their educational experience, emphasizing their active role in con-structing knowledge through interactions with their environment (Duffy and Jonassen, 2009). According to constructivist princi-ples, learners build their understanding by assimilating new information into their existing cognitive frameworks (Vygotsky, 1978). This theory highlights the importance of context, active engagement, and the social nature of learning (Dewey, 1938).\nConstructivist approaches often involve hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and opportunities for collaborative exploration (Brooks and Brooks, 1999).\nIn the realm of education, subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emerges as a vital perspective that acknowledges the distinctive nature of different academic disciplines (Shulman, 1986). It suggests that teaching methods should be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of each subject, recognizing that subjects like mathematics, literature, or science require different approaches to facilitate effective learning (Shulman, 1987). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emphasizes that the methods of instruction should mirror the ways experts in a particular \ufb01eld think, reason, and engage with their subject matter (Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005).\nWhen applying these principles to the design of instruction for online and in-person learning environments, the signi\ufb01cance of adapting methods becomes even more pronounced. Online learning often requires unique approaches due to its reliance on technology, asynchronous interactions, and potential for reduced social presence (Anderson, 2003). In-person learning, on the other hand, bene\ufb01ts from face-to-face interactions and immediate feedback (Allen and Seaman, 2016). Here, the interplay of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy becomes evident.\nOnline learning. In an online environment, constructivist principles can be upheld by creating interactive online activities that promote exploration, re\ufb02ection, and collaborative learning (Salmon, 2000). Discussion forums, virtual labs, and multimedia presentations can provide opportunities for students to actively engage with the subject matter (Harasim, 2017). By integrating subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy, educators can design online content that mirrors the discipline\u2019s methodologies while leveraging technology for authentic experiences (Koehler and Mishra, 2009).\nFor instance, an online history course might incorporate virtual museum tours, primary source analysis, and collaborative time-line projects.\nIn-person learning. In a traditional brick-and-mortar class-room setting, constructivist methods can be implemented through group activities, problem-solving tasks, and in-depth discussions that encourage active participation (Jonassen et al., 2003). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy complements this by shaping instructional methods to align with the inherent characteristics of the subject (Hattie, 2009). For instance, in a physics class, hands-on experiments and real-world applications can bring theoretical concepts to life (Hake, 1998).\nIn sum, the fusion of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy offers a versatile approach to instructional design that adapts to different learning environments (Garrison, 2011). By incorporating the principles of both theories, educators can tailor their methods to suit the unique demands of online and in-person learning, ultimately providing students with engaging and effective learning experiences that align with the nature of the subject matter and the mode of instruction.\nCourse description The Self-Development Skills Department at King Saud University (KSU) offers \ufb01ve mandatory freshman-level courses. These courses aim to foster advanced thinking skills and cultivate sci-enti\ufb01c research abilities in students. They do so by imparting essential skills, identifying higher-level thinking patterns, and facilitating hands-on experience in scienti\ufb01c research. The design of these classes is centered around aiding students\u2019 smooth transition into university life. Brief descriptions of these courses are as follows: University Skills 101 (CI 101) is a three-hour credit course designed to nurture essential academic, communication, and Fig. 1 Comparison of Final Exam Results for the Five Courses Mandatory Freshman Courses in King Saud University by Year (2020 and 2021). The \ufb01gure compared student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, using independent-samples t-tests; the results show a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 3 personal skills among all preparatory year students at King Saud University. The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the practical abilities they need to excel in their academic pursuits and navigate their university lives effectively. CI 101 comprises 12 sessions and is an integral part of the curriculum for all incoming freshmen, ensuring a standardized foundation for skill development.\nFitness and Health 101 (FAJB 101) is a one-hour credit course.\nFAJB 101 focuses on the aspects of self-development skills in terms of health and physical, and the skills related to personal health, nutrition, sports, preventive, psychological, reproductive, and \ufb01rst aid. This course aims to motivate students\u2019 learning process through entertainment, sports activities, and physical exercises to maintain their health. This course is required for all incoming freshmen students at King Saud University.\nEntrepreneurship 101 (ENT 101) is a one-hour- credit course.\nENT 101 aims to develop students\u2019 skills related to entrepre-neurship. The course provides students with knowledge and skills to generate and transform ideas and innovations into practical commercial projects in business settings. The entrepreneurship course consists of 14 sessions and is taught only to students in the business track.\nComputer Skills 101 (CT 101) is a three-hour credit course.\nThis provides students with the basic computer skills, e.g., com-ponents, operating systems, applications, and communication backup. The course explores data visualization, introductory level of modern programming with algorithms and information security. CT 101 course is taught for all tracks except those in the human track.\nComputer Skills 102 (CT 102) is a three-hour credit course. It provides IT skills to the students to utilize computers with high ef\ufb01ciency, develop students\u2019 research and scienti\ufb01c skills, and increase capability to design basic educational software. CT 102 course focuses on operating systems such as Microsoft Of\ufb01ce.\nThis course is only taught for students in the human track.\nStructure and activities. These courses ranged from one to three hours. A one-hour credit means that students must take an hour of the class each week during the academic semester. The same arrangement would apply to two and three credit-hour courses.\nThe types of activities in each course are shown in Table 1.\nAt King Saud University, each semester spans 15 weeks in duration. The total number of semester hours allocated to each course serves as an indicator of its signi\ufb01cance within the broader context of the academic program, including the diverse tracks available to students. Throughout the two years under study (i.e., 2020 and 2021), course placements (fall or spring), course content, and the organizational structure remained consistent and uniform.\nData Participants. The study\u2019s data comes from test scores of a cohort of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students enrolled at King Saud Uni-versity in Saudi Arabia over the span of two academic years: 2020 and 2021. Among these students, 8297 were engaged in tradi-tional, in-person learning in 2020, while 8425 had transitioned to online instruction for the same courses in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the student population consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. However, in 2021, there was a reversal in these proportions, with female students accounting for 48.5% and male students comprising 51.5% of the total participants.\nRegarding student enrollment in the \ufb01ve courses, Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown by average class size, admission scores, and the number of students enrolled in the courses during the two years covered by this study. While the total number of students in each course remained relatively consistent across the two years, there were noticeable \ufb02uctuations in average class sizes.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, four out of the \ufb01ve courses experienced substantial increases in class size, with some nearly doubling in size (e.g., ENT_101 and CT_102), while one course (CT_101) showed a reduction in its average class size.\nIn this study, it must be noted that while some students enrolled in up to three different courses within the same academic year, none repeated the same exam in both years. Speci\ufb01cally, students who failed to pass their courses in 2020 were required to complete them in summer sessions and were consequently not included in this study\u2019s dataset. To ensure clarity and precision in our analysis, the research focused exclusively on student test scores to evaluate and compare the academic effectiveness of online and traditional in-person learning methods. This approach was chosen to provide a clear, direct comparison of the educational impacts associated with each teaching format.\nMethods. Descriptive analysis of the \ufb01nal exam scores for the two years (2020 and 2021) were conducted. Additionally, comparison of student outcomes in in-person classes in 2020 to their online platform peers in 2021 were conducted using an independent-samples t-test. Subsequently, in order to address potential Table 1 Learning activities and total course hours per semester.\nLearning Activities Courses Lecture Laboratory Total Semester Hours CT_101 50% 50% 45 CT_102 50% 50% 45 ENT_101 100% 0% 15 FAJB_101 100% 0% 15 CI_101 100% 0% 45 CI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nTable 2 Class size, gender distribution, and admission scores by courses in 2020 and 2021.\nCourses Average Class Size Gender Distribution Admission Scores 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 FAJB 101 23.1 46.1 M = 53.8%, F = 46.2% M = 58.3%, F = 41.7% 89.58 87.95 CI 101 21.6 35.2 M = 54%, F = 46% M = 58%, F = 42% 89.57 87.96 ENT 101 33.7 66.7 M = 68.1%, F = 31.9% M = 69.7%, F = 30.3% 87.94 90.19 CT 101 42.7 22.3 M = 62.7%, F = 37.3% M = 64.2%, F = 35.8% 90.84 88.22 CT 102 21.1 46.5 M = 51.4%, F = 48% M = 57%, F = 43% 87.85 86.85 Source: Deanship of Admission and Registration Affairs at King Saud University.\nCI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 disparities between the two groups arising from variables such as gender, class size, and admission scores (which serve as an indicator of students\u2019 academic aptitude and pre-enrollment knowledge), multiple regression analyses were conducted. In these multivariate analyses, outcomes of both in-person and online cohorts were assessed within their respective tracks. By carefully considering essential aforementioned variables linked to student performance, the study aimed to ensure a comprehensive and equitable evaluation.\nStudy instrument. The study obtained students\u2019 \ufb01nal exam scores for the years 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) from the school\u2019s records of\ufb01ce through their examination management system. In the preparatory year at King Saud University, \ufb01nal exams for all courses are developed by committees composed of faculty members from each department. To ensure valid com-parisons, the \ufb01nal exam questions, crafted by departmental committees of professors, remained consistent and uniform for the two years under examination.\nTable 3 provides a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of all \ufb01ve tests included in our analysis. These tests exhibit a strong degree of internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coef\ufb01cients spanning a range from 0.77 to 0.86. This robust and consistent internal consistency measurement underscores the dependable nature of these tests, af\ufb01rming their reliability and suitability for the study\u2019s objectives.\nIn terms of assessing test validity, content validity was ensured through a thorough review by university subject matter experts, resulting in test items that align well with the content domain and learning objectives. Additionally, criterion-related validity was established by correlating students\u2019 admissions test scores with their \ufb01nal required freshman test scores in the \ufb01ve subject areas, showing a moderate and acceptable relationship (0.37 to 0.56) between the test scores and the external admissions test. Finally, construct validity was con\ufb01rmed through reviews by experienced subject instructors, leading to improvements in test content. With guidance from university subject experts, construct validity was established, af\ufb01rming the effectiveness of the \ufb01nal tests in assessing students\u2019 subject knowledge at the end of their coursework.\nCollectively, these validity and reliability measures af\ufb01rm the soundness and integrity of the \ufb01nal subject tests, establishing their suitability as effective assessment tools for evaluating students\u2019 knowledge in their \ufb01ve mandatory freshman courses at King Saud University.\nProcedure. After obtaining research approval from the Research Committee at King Saud University, the coordinators of the \ufb01ve courses (CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101) supplied the researchers with the \ufb01nal exam scores of all \ufb01rst-year preparatory year students at King Saud University for the initial semester of the academic years 2020 and 2021. The sample encompassed all students who had completed these \ufb01ve courses during both years, resulting in a total of 16,722 students forming the \ufb01nal group of participants.\nLimitations. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the research was conducted within a well-resourced major public university. As such, the experiences with online classes at other types of institutions (e.g., community colleges, private institutions) may vary signi\ufb01cantly. Additionally, the limited data pertaining to in-class teaching practices and the diversity of learning activities across different courses represents a gap that could have provided valuable insights for a more thor-ough interpretation and explanation of the study\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\nFindings To compare student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, independent-samples t-tests were conducted.\nTable 4 shows a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nThe biggest decline was with CT_102 with 3.58 points, and the smallest decline was with CI_101 with 0.18 points.\nHowever, such simple comparison of means between the two years (via t-tests) by subjects does not account for the differences in gender composition, class size, and admission scores between the two academic years, all of which have been associated with student outcomes (e.g., Ho and Kelman, 2014; De Paola et al., 2013). To account for such potential confounding variables, multiple regressions were conducted to compare the 2 years\u2019 results while controlling for these three factors associated with student achievement.\nTable 5 presents the regression results, illustrating the variation in \ufb01nal exam scores between 2020 and 2021, while controlling for gender, class size, and admission scores.

Conversely, in the case of ENT_101, online students in 2021 scored 0.69 points lower than their 2020 in-person counterparts. With CT_102, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences in \ufb01nal exam scores between the two cohorts of students.\nDiscussion The study sought to assess the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning in the higher education setting in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed the \ufb01nal exam scores of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students in King Saud University in \ufb01ve required subjects (i.e., CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101). The study initially performed a simple comparison of mean scores by tracks by year (via t-tests) and then a number of multiple regression analyses which controlled for class size, gender composition, and admission scores.\nOverall, the study\u2019s more in-depth \ufb01ndings using multiple regression painted a wholly different picture than the results obtained using t-tests. After controlling for class size, gender composition, and admissions scores, online students in 2021 performed better than their in-person instruction peers in 2020 in University Skills (CI_101), Fitness and Health (FAJB_101), and Computer Skills (CT_101), whereas in-person students out-performed their online peers in Entrepreneurship (ENT_101).\nThere was no meaningful difference in outcomes for students in the Computer Skills (CT_102) course for the two years.\nIn light of these \ufb01ndings, it raises the question: why do we observe minimal differences (less than a one-point gain or loss) in student outcomes in courses like University Skills, Fitness and Health, Entrepreneurship, and Advanced Computer Skills based on the mode of instruction? Is it possible that when subjects are primarily at a basic or introductory level, as is the case with these courses, the mode of instruction may have a limited impact as long as the concepts are effectively communicated in a manner familiar and accessible to students?\nIn today\u2019s digital age, one could argue that students in more developed countries, such as Saudi Arabia, generally possess the skills and capabilities to effectively engage with materials pre-sented in both in-person and online formats. However, there is a notable exception in the Basic Computer Skills course, where the online cohort outperformed their in-person counterparts by more than 5 points. Insights from interviews with the instructors of this course suggest that this result may be attributed to the course\u2019s basic and conceptual nature, coupled with the availability of instructional videos that students could revisit at their own pace.\nGiven that students enter this course with varying levels of computer skills, self-paced learning may have allowed them to cover course materials at their preferred speed, concentrating on less familiar topics while swiftly progressing through concepts they already understood. The advantages of such self-paced learning have been documented by scholars like Tullis and Ben-jamin (2011), who found that self-paced learners often outper-form those who spend the same amount of time studying identical materials. This approach allows learners to allocate their time more effectively according to their individual learning pace, providing greater ownership and control over their learning experience. As such, in courses like introductory computer skills, it can be argued that becoming familiar with fundamental and conceptual topics may not require extensive in-class Table 5 Regression Summary of Freshman Final Exam Results in 2020 (In Person) and 2021(Online) by Courses, Controlling for Gender Composition, Class Size, and Admission Scores in King Saud University.\nCI_101 FAJB_101 ENT_101 CT_101 CT_102 \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta Constant \u22121820.97*** --\u22121145.93*** --1382.01*** --\u221210709.12*** --\u22121360.93*** --Year 0.89*** 0.07 0.56** 0.05 \u22120.69*** \u22120.06 5.28*** 0.32 0.66 0.04 Gender 4.18*** 0.31 4.20*** 0.34 3.80*** 0.31 2.38*** 0.14 4.07*** 0.23 Class Size 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02*** 0.08 0.16*** 0.23 \u22120.13*** \u22120.20 Admission Scores 0.62*** 0.42 0.55*** 0.41 0.44*** 0.35 0.75*** 0.43 0.78*** 0.37 Adjusted-R2 0.32 0.35 0.30 0.28 0.24 Gender was represented with male = 0 and female = 1.

Instead, it may be more about exposure to and digestion of materials in a format and at a pace tailored to stu-dents with diverse backgrounds, knowledge levels, and skill sets.\nFurther investigation is needed to more fully understand why some classes bene\ufb01tted from online instruction while others did not, and vice versa. Perhaps, it could be posited that some content areas are more conducive to in-person (or online) format while others are not. Or it could be that the different results of the two modes of learning were driven by students of varying academic abilities and engagement, with low-achieving students being more vulnerable to the limitations of online learning (e.g., Kofoed et al., 2021). Whatever the reasons, the results of the current study can be enlightened by a more in-depth analysis of the various factors associated with such different forms of learning. Moreover, although not clear cut, what the current study does provide is additional evidence against any dire consequences to student learning (at least in the higher ed setting) as a result of sudden increase in online learning with possible bene\ufb01ts of its wider use being showcased.\nBased on the \ufb01ndings of this study, we recommend that edu-cational leaders adopt a measured approach to online learning\u2014a stance that neither fully embraces nor outright denounces it. The impact on students\u2019 experiences and engagement appears to vary depending on the subjects and methods of instruction, sometimes hindering, other times promoting effective learning, while some classes remain relatively unaffected.\nRather than taking a one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, educational leaders should be open to exploring the nuances behind these outcomes. This involves examining why certain courses thrived with online delivery, while others either experienced a decline in student achievement or remained largely unaffected. By exploring these differentiated outcomes associated with diverse instructional formats, leaders in higher education institutions and beyond can make informed decisions about resource allo-cation. For instance, resources could be channeled towards in-person learning for courses that bene\ufb01t from it, while simul-taneously expanding online access for courses that have demonstrated improved outcomes through its virtual format.\nThis strategic approach not only optimizes resource allocation but could also open up additional revenue streams for the institution.\nConsidering the enduring presence of online learning, both before the pandemic and its accelerated adoption due to Covid-19, there is an increasing need for institutions of learning and scholars in higher education, as well as other \ufb01elds, to prioritize the study of its effects and optimal utilization. This study, which compares student outcomes between two cohorts exposed to in-person and online instruction (before and during Covid-19) at the largest university in Saudi Arabia, represents a meaningful step in this direction.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.\nReceived: 7 June 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023; References Allen IE, Seaman J (2016) Online report card: Tracking online education in the United States.

    "Document3": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning. Accommodate learning styles8 Active learning strategies9 Collaborative learning10 Differentiated instruction11 Flipped classroom model12 Partner/group activities13 Peer-to-peer interaction14 Project based learning15 Short recorded lessons16 Video communication17 3 Hybrid Learning: Integrating the Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals in Distance Learning The school community18 includes a range of administrators and staff who support students\u2019 social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

    "Summarized_Document2": "This study compares online and in-person learning at King Saud University, focusing on the impact on student achievement. The research analyzed final test scores of 16,722 freshman students in five core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years. Initial observations indicated lower scores for online students, but after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the need for a data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems, considering the variable effects on learning outcomes.The study's motivation stems from the rapid shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for alternative educational approaches. Distance learning offers flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness but also faces challenges like technical issues and potential distractions. The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning at King Saud University.Theoretical frameworks of constructivism and subject-specific pedagogy were applied to understand the differences in learning environments. Constructivism emphasizes active learning and context, while subject-specific pedagogy tailors teaching methods to the characteristics of each subject. These principles were used to design instruction for both online and in-person learning environments.The study's data comes from test scores of 16,722 first-year students at King Saud University over two academic years: 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online). The final exam results of five courses were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors like gender, class size, and admission scores. Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare student outcomes.Findings showed a statistically significant drop in test scores from 2020 to 2021 for all courses except Computer Skills 101. However, after controlling for confounding variables, online students in 2021 performed better in University Skills 101, Fitness and Health 101, and Computer Skills 101, while in-person students outperformed online peers in Entrepreneurship 101. There was no significant difference in outcomes for Computer Skills 102.The study suggests that the mode of instruction may have limited impact on basic or introductory courses, as long as concepts are effectively communicated. The advantages of self-paced learning in online environments were highlighted, particularly for courses like introductory computer skills. The study recommends a measured approach to online learning, exploring the nuances behind different outcomes and optimizing resource allocation based on course-specific needs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence against any dire consequences to student learning due to the shift to online learning, with potential benefits for certain courses.

    "Summarized_Document3": "Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for educators, transitioning many school districts from in-person instruction to distance learning models, including hybrid combinations of in-person and virtual learning. Educators must implement these new models to meet students' academic, physical, social, and emotional needs, often requiring collaboration with other professionals within their school or district. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, key features, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of professional support for student learning. Hyflex Learning Hyflex learning offers a flexible course structure allowing students to attend sessions in the classroom, participate online, or both. It is characterized by flexible attendance modes and lends itself more to synchronous learning. Students can participate face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning) or at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology is used for real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, learning activities, communication, and assignment management. Blended Learning Blended learning combines face-to-face instruction with online instruction, lending itself more to asynchronous learning. Students attend partial face-to-face classes (synchronous learning) and complete online learning at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology delivers additional content, facilitates learning activities, communicates with students, and manages resources and assignments. Terminology Cloud storage: Internet-based computing model for storing, managing, and sharing files online. Learning management system (LMS): Platform for deploying and tracking online training, accessible to both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette: Appropriate online social behavior. Student response tool: Tool for receiving real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning: Synchronous learning occurs in real-time with active participation, while asynchronous learning occurs on the student's schedule. Video conferencing: Technology for face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Practices for Hybrid Learning Hyflex and blended learning share many pedagogical practices, but key differences exist. Hyflex relies more on synchronous learning, using real-time student response tools, while blended learning's asynchronous nature does not. Practices include accommodating learning styles, active learning strategies, collaborative learning, differentiated instruction, flipped classroom model, partner/group activities, peer-to-peer interaction, project-based learning, short recorded lessons, and video communication. Hybrid Learning: Integrating Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals The school community includes administrators and staff supporting students' social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. Online instruction does not eliminate the need for socialization, physical activity, or access to services from social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Hyflex and blended learning models offer opportunities to support instruction and build community by connecting students with other professionals. Consider involving librarians/media specialists, physical education teachers, specialized instruction support personnel (SISP), education support professionals (ESPs), paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, and arts and music educators in supporting student learning. Resources: Various resources are provided, including tools for diverse learners, learning management systems, netiquette guidelines, formative assessment tools, synchronous and asynchronous learning strategies, video conferencing best practices, and more.",

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "ARTICLE Online vs in-person learning in higher education: effects on student achievement and recommendations for leadership Bandar N. Alari\ufb011\u2709& Steve Song2 This study is a comparative analysis of online distance learning and traditional in-person education at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on understanding how different educational modalities affect student achievement. The justi\ufb01cation for this study lies in the rapid shift towards online learning, especially highlighted by the educational changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the \ufb01nal test scores of freshman students in \ufb01ve core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years, the research provides empirical insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of online versus traditional edu-cation. Initial observations suggested that students in online settings scored lower in most courses. However, after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores using multiple linear regression, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the crucial need for a nuanced, data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems. It brings to light the fact that the success of educational methodologies is highly contingent on speci\ufb01c contextual factors. This \ufb01nding advocates for educational administrators and policymakers to exercise careful and informed judgment when adopting online learning modalities. It encourages them to thoroughly evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes. This approach ensures that decisions about implementing online edu-cation are made with a comprehensive understanding of its diverse and context-speci\ufb01c impacts, aiming to optimize educational effectiveness and student success.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 OPEN 1 Department of Sports and Recreation Management, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Division of Research and Doctoral Studies, Concordia University Chicago, 7400 Augusta Street, River Forest, IL 60305, USA. \u2709email: balari\ufb01@ksu.edu.sa HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he year 2020 marked an extraordinary period, character-ized by the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and institutions worldwide had to adapt to unforeseen challenges across various domains, including health, economy, and education. In response, many educational institutions quickly transitioned to distance teaching (also known as e-learning, online learning, or virtual classrooms) to ensure continued access to education for their students. However, despite this rapid and widespread shift to online learning, a compre-hensive examination of its effects on student achievement in comparison to traditional in-person instruction remains largely unexplored.\nIn research examining student outcomes in the context of online learning, the prevailing trend is the consistent observation that online learners often achieve less favorable results when compared to their peers in traditional classroom settings (e.g., Fischer et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017; Edvardsson and Oskarsson, 2008). However, it is important to note that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of research on online learning has primarily focused on its potential impact (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., 2020; Di Pietro et al., 2020) or explored various perspectives (Aucejo et al., 2020; Radha et al., 2020) concerning distance education. These studies have often omitted a comprehensive and nuanced examination of its concrete academic consequences, particularly in terms of test scores and grades.\nGiven the dearth of research on the academic impact of online learning, especially in light of Covid-19 in the educational arena, the present study aims to address that gap by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person teaching in \ufb01ve required freshmen-level courses at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. To accomplish this objective, the current study compared the \ufb01nal exam results of 8297 freshman students who were enrolled in the \ufb01ve courses in person in 2020 to their 8425 \ufb01rst-year counterparts who has taken the same courses at the same institution in 2021 but in an online format.\nThe \ufb01nal test results of the \ufb01ve courses (i.e., University Skills 101, Entrepreneurship 101, Computer Skills 101, Computer Skills 101, and Fitness and Health Culture 101) were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors such as gender, class size and admission scores, which have been cited in past research to be correlated with student achievement (e.g., Meinck and Brese, 2019; Jepsen, 2015) Additionally, as the preparatory year at King Saud University is divided into \ufb01ve tracks\u2014health, nursing, science, business, and humanity, the study classi\ufb01ed students based on their respective disciplines.\nMotivation for the study The rapid expansion of distance learning in higher education, particularly highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Volk et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017), underscores the need for alternative educational approaches during crises. Such disrup-tions can catalyze innovation and the adoption of distance learning as a contingency plan (Christensen et al., 2015). King Saud University, like many institutions worldwide, faced the challenge of transitioning abruptly to online learning in response to the pandemic.\nE-learning has gained prominence in higher education due to technological advancements, offering institutions a competitive edge (Valverde-Berrocoso et al., 2020). Especially during condi-tions like the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic communication was utilized across the globe as a feasible means to overcome barriers and enhance interactions (Bozkurt, 2019).\nDistance learning, characterized by \ufb02exibility, became crucial when traditional in-person classes are hindered by unforeseen circumstance such as the ones posed by COVID-19 (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015). Scholars argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, often referred to as self-directed learning (Hiemstra, 1994) or self-education (Gadamer, 2001). Additional advantages include accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and \ufb02exibility (Sadeghi, 2019).\nHowever, distance learning is not immune to its own set of challenges.\nTechnical impediments, encompassing network issues, device limitations, and communication hiccups, represent formidable hurdles (Sadeghi, 2019). Furthermore, concerns about potential distractions in the online learning environment, fueled by the ubiquity of the internet and social media, have surfaced (Hall et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017). The absence of traditional face-to-face interactions among students and between students and instructors is also viewed as a potential drawback (Sadeghi, 2019).\nGiven the evolving understanding of the pros and cons of distance learning, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning, speci\ufb01cally in terms of student achievement, as compared to in-person classroom learning at King Saud University, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest higher education institutions.\nAcademic achievement: in-person vs online learning The primary driving force behind the rapid integration of tech-nology in education has been its emphasis on student perfor-mance (Lai and Bower, 2019). Over the past decade, numerous studies have undertaken comparisons of student academic achievement in online and in-person settings (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021). This section offers a concise review of the disparities in academic achievement between college students engaged in in-person and online learning, as identi\ufb01ed in existing research.\nA number of studies point to the superiority of traditional in-person education over online learning in terms of academic outcomes. For example, Fischer et al. (2020) conducted a com-prehensive study involving 72,000 university students across 433 subjects, revealing that online students tend to achieve slightly lower academic results than their in-class counterparts.\nSimilarly, Bettinger et al. (2017) found that students at for-pro\ufb01t online universities generally underperformed when compared to their in-person peers. Supporting this trend, Figlio et al. (2013) indicated that in-person instruction consistently produced better results, particularly among speci\ufb01c subgroups like males, lower-performing students, and Hispanic learners.\nAdditionally, Kaupp\u2019s (2012) research in California community colleges demonstrated that online students faced lower completion and success rates compared to their traditional in-person counterparts (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, other studies present evidence of online students outperforming their in-person peers. For example, Iglesias-Pradas et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of 43 bachelor courses at Telecommunication Engineering College in Malaysia, revealing that online students achieved higher academic out-comes than their in-person counterparts. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gonzalez et al. (2020) found that students engaged in online learning performed better than those who had previously taken the same subjects in traditional in-class settings.\nExpanding on this topic, several studies have reported mixed results when comparing the academic performance of online and in-person students, with various student and instructor factors emerging as in\ufb02uential variables. Chesser et al. (2020) noted that student traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion play a substantial role in academic achievement, ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 regardless of the learning environment\u2014be it traditional in-person classrooms or online settings. Furthermore, Cacault et al.\n(2021) discovered that online students with higher academic pro\ufb01ciency tend to outperform those with lower academic cap-abilities, suggesting that differences in students\u2019 academic abilities may impact their performance. In contrast, Bergstrand and Savage (2013) found that online classes received lower overall ratings and exhibited a less respectful learning environment when compared to in-person instruction. Nevertheless, they also observed that the teaching ef\ufb01ciency of both in-class and online courses varied signi\ufb01cantly depending on the instructors\u2019 back-grounds and approaches. These \ufb01ndings underscore the multi-faceted nature of the online vs. in-person learning debate, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.\nTheoretical framework. Constructivism is a well-established learning theory that places learners at the forefront of their educational experience, emphasizing their active role in con-structing knowledge through interactions with their environment (Duffy and Jonassen, 2009). According to constructivist princi-ples, learners build their understanding by assimilating new information into their existing cognitive frameworks (Vygotsky, 1978). This theory highlights the importance of context, active engagement, and the social nature of learning (Dewey, 1938).\nConstructivist approaches often involve hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and opportunities for collaborative exploration (Brooks and Brooks, 1999).\nIn the realm of education, subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emerges as a vital perspective that acknowledges the distinctive nature of different academic disciplines (Shulman, 1986). It suggests that teaching methods should be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of each subject, recognizing that subjects like mathematics, literature, or science require different approaches to facilitate effective learning (Shulman, 1987). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emphasizes that the methods of instruction should mirror the ways experts in a particular \ufb01eld think, reason, and engage with their subject matter (Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005).\nWhen applying these principles to the design of instruction for online and in-person learning environments, the signi\ufb01cance of adapting methods becomes even more pronounced. Online learning often requires unique approaches due to its reliance on technology, asynchronous interactions, and potential for reduced social presence (Anderson, 2003). In-person learning, on the other hand, bene\ufb01ts from face-to-face interactions and immediate feedback (Allen and Seaman, 2016). Here, the interplay of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy becomes evident.\nOnline learning. In an online environment, constructivist principles can be upheld by creating interactive online activities that promote exploration, re\ufb02ection, and collaborative learning (Salmon, 2000). Discussion forums, virtual labs, and multimedia presentations can provide opportunities for students to actively engage with the subject matter (Harasim, 2017). By integrating subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy, educators can design online content that mirrors the discipline\u2019s methodologies while leveraging technology for authentic experiences (Koehler and Mishra, 2009).\nFor instance, an online history course might incorporate virtual museum tours, primary source analysis, and collaborative time-line projects.\nIn-person learning. In a traditional brick-and-mortar class-room setting, constructivist methods can be implemented through group activities, problem-solving tasks, and in-depth discussions that encourage active participation (Jonassen et al., 2003). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy complements this by shaping instructional methods to align with the inherent characteristics of the subject (Hattie, 2009). For instance, in a physics class, hands-on experiments and real-world applications can bring theoretical concepts to life (Hake, 1998).\nIn sum, the fusion of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy offers a versatile approach to instructional design that adapts to different learning environments (Garrison, 2011). By incorporating the principles of both theories, educators can tailor their methods to suit the unique demands of online and in-person learning, ultimately providing students with engaging and effective learning experiences that align with the nature of the subject matter and the mode of instruction.\nCourse description The Self-Development Skills Department at King Saud University (KSU) offers \ufb01ve mandatory freshman-level courses. These courses aim to foster advanced thinking skills and cultivate sci-enti\ufb01c research abilities in students. They do so by imparting essential skills, identifying higher-level thinking patterns, and facilitating hands-on experience in scienti\ufb01c research. The design of these classes is centered around aiding students\u2019 smooth transition into university life. Brief descriptions of these courses are as follows: University Skills 101 (CI 101) is a three-hour credit course designed to nurture essential academic, communication, and Fig. 1 Comparison of Final Exam Results for the Five Courses Mandatory Freshman Courses in King Saud University by Year (2020 and 2021). The \ufb01gure compared student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, using independent-samples t-tests; the results show a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 3 personal skills among all preparatory year students at King Saud University. The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the practical abilities they need to excel in their academic pursuits and navigate their university lives effectively. CI 101 comprises 12 sessions and is an integral part of the curriculum for all incoming freshmen, ensuring a standardized foundation for skill development.\nFitness and Health 101 (FAJB 101) is a one-hour credit course.\nFAJB 101 focuses on the aspects of self-development skills in terms of health and physical, and the skills related to personal health, nutrition, sports, preventive, psychological, reproductive, and \ufb01rst aid. This course aims to motivate students\u2019 learning process through entertainment, sports activities, and physical exercises to maintain their health. This course is required for all incoming freshmen students at King Saud University.\nEntrepreneurship 101 (ENT 101) is a one-hour- credit course.\nENT 101 aims to develop students\u2019 skills related to entrepre-neurship. The course provides students with knowledge and skills to generate and transform ideas and innovations into practical commercial projects in business settings. The entrepreneurship course consists of 14 sessions and is taught only to students in the business track.\nComputer Skills 101 (CT 101) is a three-hour credit course.\nThis provides students with the basic computer skills, e.g., com-ponents, operating systems, applications, and communication backup. The course explores data visualization, introductory level of modern programming with algorithms and information security. CT 101 course is taught for all tracks except those in the human track.\nComputer Skills 102 (CT 102) is a three-hour credit course. It provides IT skills to the students to utilize computers with high ef\ufb01ciency, develop students\u2019 research and scienti\ufb01c skills, and increase capability to design basic educational software. CT 102 course focuses on operating systems such as Microsoft Of\ufb01ce.\nThis course is only taught for students in the human track.\nStructure and activities. These courses ranged from one to three hours. A one-hour credit means that students must take an hour of the class each week during the academic semester. The same arrangement would apply to two and three credit-hour courses.\nThe types of activities in each course are shown in Table 1.\nAt King Saud University, each semester spans 15 weeks in duration. The total number of semester hours allocated to each course serves as an indicator of its signi\ufb01cance within the broader context of the academic program, including the diverse tracks available to students. Throughout the two years under study (i.e., 2020 and 2021), course placements (fall or spring), course content, and the organizational structure remained consistent and uniform.\nData Participants. The study\u2019s data comes from test scores of a cohort of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students enrolled at King Saud Uni-versity in Saudi Arabia over the span of two academic years: 2020 and 2021. Among these students, 8297 were engaged in tradi-tional, in-person learning in 2020, while 8425 had transitioned to online instruction for the same courses in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the student population consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. However, in 2021, there was a reversal in these proportions, with female students accounting for 48.5% and male students comprising 51.5% of the total participants.\nRegarding student enrollment in the \ufb01ve courses, Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown by average class size, admission scores, and the number of students enrolled in the courses during the two years covered by this study. While the total number of students in each course remained relatively consistent across the two years, there were noticeable \ufb02uctuations in average class sizes.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, four out of the \ufb01ve courses experienced substantial increases in class size, with some nearly doubling in size (e.g., ENT_101 and CT_102), while one course (CT_101) showed a reduction in its average class size.\nIn this study, it must be noted that while some students enrolled in up to three different courses within the same academic year, none repeated the same exam in both years. Speci\ufb01cally, students who failed to pass their courses in 2020 were required to complete them in summer sessions and were consequently not included in this study\u2019s dataset. To ensure clarity and precision in our analysis, the research focused exclusively on student test scores to evaluate and compare the academic effectiveness of online and traditional in-person learning methods. This approach was chosen to provide a clear, direct comparison of the educational impacts associated with each teaching format.\nMethods. Descriptive analysis of the \ufb01nal exam scores for the two years (2020 and 2021) were conducted. Additionally, comparison of student outcomes in in-person classes in 2020 to their online platform peers in 2021 were conducted using an independent-samples t-test. Subsequently, in order to address potential Table 1 Learning activities and total course hours per semester.\nLearning Activities Courses Lecture Laboratory Total Semester Hours CT_101 50% 50% 45 CT_102 50% 50% 45 ENT_101 100% 0% 15 FAJB_101 100% 0% 15 CI_101 100% 0% 45 CI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nTable 2 Class size, gender distribution, and admission scores by courses in 2020 and 2021.\nCourses Average Class Size Gender Distribution Admission Scores 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 FAJB 101 23.1 46.1 M = 53.8%, F = 46.2% M = 58.3%, F = 41.7% 89.58 87.95 CI 101 21.6 35.2 M = 54%, F = 46% M = 58%, F = 42% 89.57 87.96 ENT 101 33.7 66.7 M = 68.1%, F = 31.9% M = 69.7%, F = 30.3% 87.94 90.19 CT 101 42.7 22.3 M = 62.7%, F = 37.3% M = 64.2%, F = 35.8% 90.84 88.22 CT 102 21.1 46.5 M = 51.4%, F = 48% M = 57%, F = 43% 87.85 86.85 Source: Deanship of Admission and Registration Affairs at King Saud University.\nCI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 disparities between the two groups arising from variables such as gender, class size, and admission scores (which serve as an indicator of students\u2019 academic aptitude and pre-enrollment knowledge), multiple regression analyses were conducted. In these multivariate analyses, outcomes of both in-person and online cohorts were assessed within their respective tracks. By carefully considering essential aforementioned variables linked to student performance, the study aimed to ensure a comprehensive and equitable evaluation.\nStudy instrument. The study obtained students\u2019 \ufb01nal exam scores for the years 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) from the school\u2019s records of\ufb01ce through their examination management system. In the preparatory year at King Saud University, \ufb01nal exams for all courses are developed by committees composed of faculty members from each department. To ensure valid com-parisons, the \ufb01nal exam questions, crafted by departmental committees of professors, remained consistent and uniform for the two years under examination.\nTable 3 provides a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of all \ufb01ve tests included in our analysis. These tests exhibit a strong degree of internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coef\ufb01cients spanning a range from 0.77 to 0.86. This robust and consistent internal consistency measurement underscores the dependable nature of these tests, af\ufb01rming their reliability and suitability for the study\u2019s objectives.\nIn terms of assessing test validity, content validity was ensured through a thorough review by university subject matter experts, resulting in test items that align well with the content domain and learning objectives. Additionally, criterion-related validity was established by correlating students\u2019 admissions test scores with their \ufb01nal required freshman test scores in the \ufb01ve subject areas, showing a moderate and acceptable relationship (0.37 to 0.56) between the test scores and the external admissions test. Finally, construct validity was con\ufb01rmed through reviews by experienced subject instructors, leading to improvements in test content. With guidance from university subject experts, construct validity was established, af\ufb01rming the effectiveness of the \ufb01nal tests in assessing students\u2019 subject knowledge at the end of their coursework.\nCollectively, these validity and reliability measures af\ufb01rm the soundness and integrity of the \ufb01nal subject tests, establishing their suitability as effective assessment tools for evaluating students\u2019 knowledge in their \ufb01ve mandatory freshman courses at King Saud University.\nProcedure. After obtaining research approval from the Research Committee at King Saud University, the coordinators of the \ufb01ve courses (CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101) supplied the researchers with the \ufb01nal exam scores of all \ufb01rst-year preparatory year students at King Saud University for the initial semester of the academic years 2020 and 2021. The sample encompassed all students who had completed these \ufb01ve courses during both years, resulting in a total of 16,722 students forming the \ufb01nal group of participants.\nLimitations. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the research was conducted within a well-resourced major public university. As such, the experiences with online classes at other types of institutions (e.g., community colleges, private institutions) may vary signi\ufb01cantly. Additionally, the limited data pertaining to in-class teaching practices and the diversity of learning activities across different courses represents a gap that could have provided valuable insights for a more thor-ough interpretation and explanation of the study\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\nFindings To compare student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, independent-samples t-tests were conducted.\nTable 4 shows a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nThe biggest decline was with CT_102 with 3.58 points, and the smallest decline was with CI_101 with 0.18 points.\nHowever, such simple comparison of means between the two years (via t-tests) by subjects does not account for the differences in gender composition, class size, and admission scores between the two academic years, all of which have been associated with student outcomes (e.g., Ho and Kelman, 2014; De Paola et al., 2013). To account for such potential confounding variables, multiple regressions were conducted to compare the 2 years\u2019 results while controlling for these three factors associated with student achievement.\nTable 5 presents the regression results, illustrating the variation in \ufb01nal exam scores between 2020 and 2021, while controlling for gender, class size, and admission scores.

Conversely, in the case of ENT_101, online students in 2021 scored 0.69 points lower than their 2020 in-person counterparts. With CT_102, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences in \ufb01nal exam scores between the two cohorts of students.\nDiscussion The study sought to assess the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning in the higher education setting in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed the \ufb01nal exam scores of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students in King Saud University in \ufb01ve required subjects (i.e., CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101). The study initially performed a simple comparison of mean scores by tracks by year (via t-tests) and then a number of multiple regression analyses which controlled for class size, gender composition, and admission scores.\nOverall, the study\u2019s more in-depth \ufb01ndings using multiple regression painted a wholly different picture than the results obtained using t-tests. After controlling for class size, gender composition, and admissions scores, online students in 2021 performed better than their in-person instruction peers in 2020 in University Skills (CI_101), Fitness and Health (FAJB_101), and Computer Skills (CT_101), whereas in-person students out-performed their online peers in Entrepreneurship (ENT_101).\nThere was no meaningful difference in outcomes for students in the Computer Skills (CT_102) course for the two years.\nIn light of these \ufb01ndings, it raises the question: why do we observe minimal differences (less than a one-point gain or loss) in student outcomes in courses like University Skills, Fitness and Health, Entrepreneurship, and Advanced Computer Skills based on the mode of instruction? Is it possible that when subjects are primarily at a basic or introductory level, as is the case with these courses, the mode of instruction may have a limited impact as long as the concepts are effectively communicated in a manner familiar and accessible to students?\nIn today\u2019s digital age, one could argue that students in more developed countries, such as Saudi Arabia, generally possess the skills and capabilities to effectively engage with materials pre-sented in both in-person and online formats. However, there is a notable exception in the Basic Computer Skills course, where the online cohort outperformed their in-person counterparts by more than 5 points. Insights from interviews with the instructors of this course suggest that this result may be attributed to the course\u2019s basic and conceptual nature, coupled with the availability of instructional videos that students could revisit at their own pace.\nGiven that students enter this course with varying levels of computer skills, self-paced learning may have allowed them to cover course materials at their preferred speed, concentrating on less familiar topics while swiftly progressing through concepts they already understood. The advantages of such self-paced learning have been documented by scholars like Tullis and Ben-jamin (2011), who found that self-paced learners often outper-form those who spend the same amount of time studying identical materials. This approach allows learners to allocate their time more effectively according to their individual learning pace, providing greater ownership and control over their learning experience.

Instead, it may be more about exposure to and digestion of materials in a format and at a pace tailored to stu-dents with diverse backgrounds, knowledge levels, and skill sets.\nFurther investigation is needed to more fully understand why some classes bene\ufb01tted from online instruction while others did not, and vice versa. Perhaps, it could be posited that some content areas are more conducive to in-person (or online) format while others are not. Or it could be that the different results of the two modes of learning were driven by students of varying academic abilities and engagement, with low-achieving students being more vulnerable to the limitations of online learning (e.g., Kofoed et al., 2021). Whatever the reasons, the results of the current study can be enlightened by a more in-depth analysis of the various factors associated with such different forms of learning. Moreover, although not clear cut, what the current study does provide is additional evidence against any dire consequences to student learning (at least in the higher ed setting) as a result of sudden increase in online learning with possible bene\ufb01ts of its wider use being showcased.\nBased on the \ufb01ndings of this study, we recommend that edu-cational leaders adopt a measured approach to online learning\u2014a stance that neither fully embraces nor outright denounces it. The impact on students\u2019 experiences and engagement appears to vary depending on the subjects and methods of instruction, sometimes hindering, other times promoting effective learning, while some classes remain relatively unaffected.\nRather than taking a one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, educational leaders should be open to exploring the nuances behind these outcomes. This involves examining why certain courses thrived with online delivery, while others either experienced a decline in student achievement or remained largely unaffected. By exploring these differentiated outcomes associated with diverse instructional formats, leaders in higher education institutions and beyond can make informed decisions about resource allo-cation. For instance, resources could be channeled towards in-person learning for courses that bene\ufb01t from it, while simul-taneously expanding online access for courses that have demonstrated improved outcomes through its virtual format.\nThis strategic approach not only optimizes resource allocation but could also open up additional revenue streams for the institution.\nConsidering the enduring presence of online learning, both before the pandemic and its accelerated adoption due to Covid-19, there is an increasing need for institutions of learning and scholars in higher education, as well as other \ufb01elds, to prioritize the study of its effects and optimal utilization. This study, which compares student outcomes between two cohorts exposed to in-person and online instruction (before and during Covid-19) at the largest university in Saudi Arabia, represents a meaningful step in this direction.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.\nReceived: 7 June 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023; References Allen IE, Seaman J (2016) Online report card: Tracking online education in the United States.

We then ranked each school according to the top variables college students selected in our College Choice and Admissions Survey. To learn more, check out our full rankings methodology or read the summary below.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRanking Methodology Summary\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTo qualify for our rankings lists, each school must be an accredited public or private, nonprofit institution. Each eligible school was then ranked based on a formula measuring:\n\n\nIn addition, we only included colleges with graduation rates in the top third of all online colleges.\nFlorida College Tuition\nCollege tuition runs far cheaper in Florida than the national average. Undergraduates attending public four-year colleges in Florida in 2022-2023 paid $4,540 for tuition and fees, about $5,000 less than the national average.\nPrivate college students in Florida also pay less, spending an average of $30,928 in tuition and fees, while the national average for private college tuition was $35,248 in 2022-2023.\nFlorida online colleges may offer a more affordable education since you don't need to pay for transportation and on-campus housing fees, though online learners sometimes need to pay technology fees not charged to on-campus students.\nIn addition, online tuition often costs less than studying on campus. For instance, in-state undergrads at the University of Florida pay $6,380 per year, while in-state undergrads at UF Online pay $3,876 per year. In this case, attending the University of Florida Online will save you nearly 50% in tuition.\nWhy Study Online in Florida?\nOnline learning offers many benefits beyond convenience, affordability, and flexibility. Here are five reasons you should consider online universities in Florida.\n1. Study at Your Own Pace\nOnline learning blends independent study with live or prerecorded lectures, discussions, and virtual assistance. As an online learner, you may work primarily asynchronously, meeting deadlines each week, or attend live classes, where you can interact with instructors and classmates.\n2. Lower Cost of Living\nFlorida offers a moderate cost of living, with a cost-of-living index of 102.4%. The cost-of-living index measures the cost of housing, food, healthcare, and other basic expenses in a state compared to the national average. Florida has the 33rd lowest cost of living.\n3. More Diverse Classrooms\nMany Florida colleges accept online learners from across state lines or even internationally, which allows you to make connections across the nation and world. Online programs attract a diverse selection of students to learn with and from.\n4. Flexible and Convenient Format\nYou can earn your degree online without traveling to campus or attend a hybrid program that incorporates in-person learning. Students can choose classes that work around their work schedule and family life.\n5. Growing Job Market\nFlorida saw a 2.6% job growth rate from July 2022-2023, compared to 1.9% nationally, according to the Florida governor's office. In fact, the private sector in Florida added 42,800 jobs in July 2023.

    "Summarized_Document2": "This study compares online and in-person learning at King Saud University, focusing on the impact on student achievement. The research analyzed final test scores of 16,722 freshman students in five core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years. Initial observations indicated lower scores for online students, but after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the need for a data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems, considering the variable effects on learning outcomes.The study's motivation stems from the rapid shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for alternative educational approaches. Distance learning offers flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness but also faces challenges like technical issues and potential distractions. The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning at King Saud University.Theoretical frameworks of constructivism and subject-specific pedagogy were applied to understand the differences in learning environments. Constructivism emphasizes active learning and context, while subject-specific pedagogy tailors teaching methods to the characteristics of each subject. These principles were used to design instruction for both online and in-person learning environments.The study's data comes from test scores of 16,722 first-year students at King Saud University over two academic years: 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online). The final exam results of five courses were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors like gender, class size, and admission scores. Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare student outcomes.Findings showed a statistically significant drop in test scores from 2020 to 2021 for all courses except Computer Skills 101. However, after controlling for confounding variables, online students in 2021 performed better in University Skills 101, Fitness and Health 101, and Computer Skills 101, while in-person students outperformed online peers in Entrepreneurship 101. There was no significant difference in outcomes for Computer Skills 102.The study suggests that the mode of instruction may have limited impact on basic or introductory courses, as long as concepts are effectively communicated. The advantages of self-paced learning in online environments were highlighted, particularly for courses like introductory computer skills. The study recommends a measured approach to online learning, exploring the nuances behind different outcomes and optimizing resource allocation based on course-specific needs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence against any dire consequences to student learning due to the shift to online learning, with potential benefits for certain courses. Educational leaders should adopt a strategic approach, considering the specific needs of each course and the potential advantages of online learning.",

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning. Accommodate learning styles8 Active learning strategies9 Collaborative learning10 Differentiated instruction11 Flipped classroom model12 Partner/group activities13 Peer-to-peer interaction14 Project based learning15 Short recorded lessons16 Video communication17 3 Hybrid Learning: Integrating the Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals in Distance Learning The school community18 includes a range of administrators and staff who support students\u2019 social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

We then ranked each school according to the top variables college students selected in our College Choice and Admissions Survey. To learn more, check out our full rankings methodology or read the summary below.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRanking Methodology Summary\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTo qualify for our rankings lists, each school must be an accredited public or private, nonprofit institution. Each eligible school was then ranked based on a formula measuring:\n\n\nIn addition, we only included colleges with graduation rates in the top third of all online colleges.\nFlorida College Tuition\nCollege tuition runs far cheaper in Florida than the national average. Undergraduates attending public four-year colleges in Florida in 2022-2023 paid $4,540 for tuition and fees, about $5,000 less than the national average.\nPrivate college students in Florida also pay less, spending an average of $30,928 in tuition and fees, while the national average for private college tuition was $35,248 in 2022-2023.\nFlorida online colleges may offer a more affordable education since you don't need to pay for transportation and on-campus housing fees, though online learners sometimes need to pay technology fees not charged to on-campus students.\nIn addition, online tuition often costs less than studying on campus. For instance, in-state undergrads at the University of Florida pay $6,380 per year, while in-state undergrads at UF Online pay $3,876 per year. In this case, attending the University of Florida Online will save you nearly 50% in tuition.\nWhy Study Online in Florida?\nOnline learning offers many benefits beyond convenience, affordability, and flexibility. Here are five reasons you should consider online universities in Florida.\n1. Study at Your Own Pace\nOnline learning blends independent study with live or prerecorded lectures, discussions, and virtual assistance. As an online learner, you may work primarily asynchronously, meeting deadlines each week, or attend live classes, where you can interact with instructors and classmates.\n2. Lower Cost of Living\nFlorida offers a moderate cost of living, with a cost-of-living index of 102.4%. The cost-of-living index measures the cost of housing, food, healthcare, and other basic expenses in a state compared to the national average. Florida has the 33rd lowest cost of living.\n3. More Diverse Classrooms\nMany Florida colleges accept online learners from across state lines or even internationally, which allows you to make connections across the nation and world. Online programs attract a diverse selection of students to learn with and from.\n4. Flexible and Convenient Format\nYou can earn your degree online without traveling to campus or attend a hybrid program that incorporates in-person learning. Students can choose classes that work around their work schedule and family life.\n5. Growing Job Market\nFlorida saw a 2.6% job growth rate from July 2022-2023, compared to 1.9% nationally, according to the Florida governor's office. In fact, the private sector in Florida added 42,800 jobs in July 2023. Students attending college in Florida will graduate into a healthy job market.\nFrequently Asked Questions About Online Colleges in Florida\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the easiest online college to get into in Florida?\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, is one of the easiest online colleges to get into in the Sunshine State. The college admitted 100% of applicants in the fall of 2023.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the University of Miami, which admitted 19% of the 48,286 applicants in the fall of 2023, has one of the most selective admission processes in Florida, according to NCES. UM offers 10 online master's and doctoral programs and 12 certificates.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIs it hard to get into the University of Florida Online?\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe University of Florida Online is easier to get into than the University of Florida main campus.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for educators, transitioning many school districts from in-person instruction to distance learning models, including hybrid combinations of in-person and virtual learning. Educators must implement these new models to meet students' academic, physical, social, and emotional needs, often requiring collaboration with other professionals within their school or district. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, key features, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of professional support for student learning. Hyflex Learning Hyflex learning offers a flexible course structure allowing students to attend sessions in the classroom, participate online, or both. It is characterized by flexible attendance modes and lends itself more to synchronous learning. Students can participate face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning) or at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology is used for real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, learning activities, communication, and assignment management. Blended Learning Blended learning combines face-to-face instruction with online instruction, lending itself more to asynchronous learning. Students attend partial face-to-face classes (synchronous learning) and complete online learning at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology delivers additional content, facilitates learning activities, communicates with students, and manages resources and assignments. Terminology Cloud storage: Internet-based computing model for storing, managing, and sharing files online. Learning management system (LMS): Platform for deploying and tracking online training, accessible to both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette: Appropriate online social behavior. Student response tool: Tool for receiving real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning: Synchronous learning occurs in real-time with active participation, while asynchronous learning occurs on the student's schedule. Video conferencing: Technology for face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Practices for Hybrid Learning Hyflex and blended learning share many pedagogical practices, but key differences exist. Hyflex relies more on synchronous learning, using real-time student response tools, while blended learning's asynchronous nature does not. Practices include accommodating learning styles, active learning strategies, collaborative learning, differentiated instruction, flipped classroom model, partner/group activities, peer-to-peer interaction, project-based learning, short recorded lessons, and video communication. Hybrid Learning: Integrating Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals The school community includes administrators and staff supporting students' social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. Online instruction does not eliminate the need for socialization, physical activity, or access to services from social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Hyflex and blended learning models offer opportunities to support instruction and build community by connecting students with other professionals. Consider involving librarians/media specialists, physical education teachers, specialized instruction support personnel (SISP), education support professionals (ESPs), paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, and arts and music educators in supporting student learning. Resources: Various resources are provided, including tools for diverse learners, learning management systems, netiquette guidelines, formative assessment tools, synchronous and asynchronous learning strategies, video conferencing best practices, and more.",

Or maybe you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet but want to develop a target score.\nOne of the best ways to understand your SAT scores is to understand your SAT score percentiles. You can learn to maximize your study time, find the biggest score gains, and impress your dream school by understanding percentile rankings. Read on for a guide to maximizing your SAT score\u2014and your college admissions chances\u2014by using SAT score percentiles.\nBonus: Want to get a perfect SAT score? Read our famous guide on how to score a perfect 1600 on the SAT. You'll learn top strategies from the country's leading expert on the SAT, Allen Cheng, a Harvard grad and perfect scorer. No matter your level, you'll find useful advice here - this strategy guide has been read by over 500,000 people.\nRead the 1600 SAT guide today and start improving your score.\nWhat Are SAT Score Percentiles?\nIn addition to the composite score you get on the SAT (i.e., that number between 400 and 1600), you'll get a percentile ranking, ranging from 1 to 99. The SAT gives you a percentile ranking for your overall composite score as well as for each of the two section scores: Reading and Writing and Math.\nYour percentile tells you how you did on the SAT compared with everyone else who took the test. For example, if you got a composite percentile of 76, this means you scored higher than 76% of students on the whole test. If you got a percentile of 47 on the Math section, you did better than 47% of students on SAT Math.\nAn example of an SAT score report with percentiles.(College Board / College Board)\nYour percentile score is not like a grade out of 100. For instance, if you get a percentile of 90, this doesn't mean you got exactly 90% of the questions right. It just means that compared with everyone who took the SAT, you scored higher than 90% of them. (For more info on how the SAT is scored, see our scoring guide.)\nSo, why do percentiles matter? Colleges use percentiles to compare you with other students. If you got, say, an SAT score in the 90th percentile, this would make you competitive for many schools since you scored better than 90% of students nationwide.\nPaying attention to your percentile ranking, as well as your composite score, can give you the best idea of your performance and help you make strategic choices about which colleges to apply to.\nWhat Are the Percentile Ranges for the SAT?\nOK, so you get that percentile rankings are important. But if you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet or have taken it and plan to retake it, what composite SAT score should you shoot for in order to get a certain percentile ranking?\nLuckily, the College Board releases data about composite scores and matching percentile rankings to help you figure this out. These numbers change slightly from year to year, but we have the most recent info from 2024.\nWe've summarized the SAT percentile ranges, based on students who've taken the exam in the past three school years. \u00a0Just find your score to see your estimated percentile.\nSomething to note about these percentile ranks is that they change the fastest with the middle scores. For example, the difference between 1450 and 1600\u2014the highest possible score\u2014is only 4 percentile points, 96 to 99.\nHowever, the same point gap between 1100 and 1250 has a vast percentile difference\u201461 to 81. This means that if you scored 1100 or lower, increasing your overall composite by just 150 points would give a vast boost to your percentile rank and your admissions competitiveness!\nNeed more help with SAT Prep? Send your parent or guardian our guide to the SAT to get them thinking about the test prep process.\nSAT Percentile Charts by Section\nWe also have data on percentile rankings for score ranges in Reading and Writing\u00a0and Math. Check out the chart below to see how your scores stack up.\nSource: SAT Understanding Scores 2023\nAgain, note that the ranks change dramatically toward the middle scores: 500 in Reading and Writing is only the 43th percentile, but 600 is 73rd. In other words, a 100-point improvement\u2014which is very manageable with some smart studying\u2014could transform your score from poor to good.\nNote that the Math curve is more competitive near the top than the Reading and Writing curve is. A 760 is in the 96th percentile on Math but in the 99th percentile on Reading and Writing, and a 700 is in the 91st percentile on Math but in the 93rd percentile on Reading and Writing. This means that if you were aiming for the same percentile on both sections, you'd have to get a higher score on Math than you would on Reading and Writing.\nFor more info on SAT scores and rankings, check out our guide to average SAT scores in which we also look at score breakdowns by gender and ethnic group.\nHow Can Knowing Your SAT Percentile Help You?\nWe know that percentiles are important and that, in some cases, a relatively small composite score increase can have a huge effect on your percentile ranking.\nHowever, your target composite score for the colleges you want to apply to is the most important. While percentiles help college admissions officers compare your scores, schools also have their own score ranges that typically don\u2019t change much from year to year.\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search \"[School Name] SAT scores PrepScholar\" on Google to find our Admission Requirements page with its SAT/ACT score ranges and info on GPA ranges and overall competitiveness. For more tips on how to use this strategy (and for a table you can fill out for your specific colleges), see our guide on what a good SAT score is.\nBut what about colleges that are test optional? Our experts explain how SAT scores can still help you get into test optional schools in this article.\nMaximize your study time by setting a personal SAT target score.\nFinally, SAT percentile rankings can be a useful tool for you. Especially if you\u2019re deciding whether or not to retake the SAT, percentiles really help put your SAT scores in context. For example, the difference between your 700 in Reading and Writing and 600 in Math might not seem enormous, but that\u00a0score is in the 93rd percentile, while that Math score is in the 76th percentile. A huge difference!\nThis means you can get more bang for your buck if you focus on the Math section for your retake. Increasing your Math score by 100 points can raise your percentile from 76 to 91. However, raising your Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800, though super impressive, only improves your percentile ranking by 5%.\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore Reading and Writing\u2014in fact, a gain of just 50 points would put you in the 99th percentile! But recognizing that you stand to gain more with Math can ultimately help you prioritize your study time better.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nNow that you know the ins and outs of national SAT percentiles, check out what the average SAT scores are, and take a look at the average SAT scores in your state.\nTrying to figure out your SAT target score? Or maybe you took the SAT but aren't sure whether your score is competitive.

Remember, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only see these scores if you take the ACT optional writing test.\nAverage ACT Scores by State\nBelow is a chart that illustrates the most recent statistics on average ACT scores across various states. An important thing to consider is the proportion of students participating in the exam within each state. For instance, in states where the ACT is mandatory for all high school juniors, the average scores might appear lower due to universal testing.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nAverage ACT Scores for Top-25 Schools in the US\nLet's take a look at the average ACT scores for the top 25 schools in the United States.\nHighest Possible ACT Score\u00c2\u00a0\nThe highest ACT score is 36. The current national average ACT score is 19.9. Achieving a perfect ACT score is no easy feat. To give you some perspective, approximately 5,579 students achieved a perfect ACT score out of over 1.6 million test-takers: only about 0.33% of test-takers get a perfect ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, this doesn't mean achieving the highest ACT score is impossible. Sticking to a consistent study schedule, analyzing questions you get wrong during practice, and consulting helpful ACT guides and materials can better prepare you for the test.\nACT Scores By Percentile\u00c2\u00a0\nACT score percentiles can show you the percentage of students you scored higher than and what percentage scored higher than you. To read the ACT percentile chart below, find a score on either side you want to evaluate, then check the number in the category.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor example, a 23 on the English test places you in the 76th percentile: you scored at or higher than 76% of test-takers, and 24% scored higher than you.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nSource: ACT.org\nBased on the table, you can see that ACT score percentiles tend not to change very much at either end of the spectrum. For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive).\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile.\u00c2\u00a0\nOverall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time.\u00c2\u00a0\nAre you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies.\nFAQs\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs!\u00c2\u00a0\n1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good?\u00c2\u00a0\nAlthough a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\n2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness.\u00c2\u00a0\n3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application.\u00c2\u00a0\n4. What Is a Low ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nLike what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low.\u00c2\u00a0\n5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to?\u00c2\u00a0\nOnce your ACT score is released, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant!\u00c2\u00a0\n6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT?\u00c2\u00a0\nIf your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant.\n7. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Lowest Possible ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nThe lowest ACT score possible is 1.\n8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section?\nThe average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc.\n9. What is The Average Science ACT Score?\nThe average science ACT score is 20.\nFinal Thoughts\nNow that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.\u00c2\u00a0 A good way to go about it is to test your skills with our Free ACT Practice Questions Pop Quiz.

Let\u2019s go!\nWhat is a good LSAT score in 2024?\u00a0\nBefore we get into scores, let\u2019s take a look at some of the statistics surrounding LSAT scores:\nLSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180.\nWith that big of a range, what kind of score should you aim for?\nRealistically, you should try to get a score of at least 150. That\u2019s the score that will get you into any accredited law school.\nBut if your dream school is among the best in America, you should aim higher.\nTo get into any of the top 25 law schools in America, you need to score at least 160.\nAnd if you want to attend a top 10 law school, you should try to score even higher \u2013 at least 170.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re taking the LSAT for the first time, you might be wondering how your score will compare to others.\u00a0\nKeep reading to find out.\u00a0\nWhat is the average LSAT score for first-time takers?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0Law School Admission Council\u00a0(LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151.\nOf course, if you\u2019re unhappy with your LSAT score, you can always\u00a0take it again.\nJust remember that you\u2019re limited to taking it three times in a single testing year (August to June) and five times in the past five years.\nIn total, you can take the LSAT seven times in your lifetime.\nBut is taking it again\u00a0really\u00a0worth it? Contrary to popular belief, doing so won\u2019t always help.\nRemember, first-time test takers score 151.\nPeople who take the LSAT for a second time score an average of 151.7, which is a slight increase.\nAnd while you might think that taking it for a third time would increase your score, that\u2019s not always true.\nIn fact, people who take the LSAT for a third time earn the lowest scores.\nThat\u2019s why I always tell my clients to really consider if retaking it is right for them. After all, your score isn\u2019t going to make or break your chances of acceptance, but we\u2019ll talk about that a bit later.\nLet\u2019s move on to the LSAT score you need to get accepted into your dream law school.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for law school?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0American Bar Association\u00a0(ABA), the median LSAT score of full-time first-year JD students in the fall of 2022 was 158.5.\u00a0\nThe 75th percentile score was 160.9, and the 25th percentile score was 154.8.\nThat\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t get into the program of your choice with a lower score. An LSAT score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program.\nYou just need to have the right kind of application.\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed the median LSAT score, let\u2019s move on to the highest scores.\nWhat is the highest LSAT score?\u00a0\nLSAT scores can range anywhere from 120 to 180.\nGetting a perfect 180 on the LSAT is practically unheard of. In fact, just 0.1% of test-takers have achieved it.\nA 170 is considered a great score, as it would mean you got at least 90 of the 101 questions on the test right.\u00a0\nDoing so would put you in the top 2-3% of test takers, meaning you would get into most law schools.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s discuss the kind of LSAT scores you would need to be accepted into the top 10 law schools in the country.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for the top 10 law schools?\u00a0\nIf you want to\u00a0attend one of the top 10 law schools in the country, you should aim for an LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the low, median, and high LSAT scores at each school.\nStanford University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nYale University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0175\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0178\nUniversity of Chicago\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (Carey)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0167\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nDuke University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0168\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0170\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0171\nHarvard University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0174\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nNew York University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0174\nColumbia University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Virginia\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nNorthwestern University (Pritzker)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0172\nAs you can see, each of these schools has a median LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nBut even with a lower score, you can still get in.\nKeep reading to learn how.\nHow important are LSAT scores for law school admissions?\nIt\u2019s true that a higher score will increase your chances of acceptance into the law school of your choice.\nTypically, a score that falls within the 150 range is considered average. While it will get you accepted into most law schools, it could make it difficult to stand out.\nA score of at least 160 is considered strong, and most law schools have median scores within this range. However, keep in mind that scholarships may require higher scores.\nLast but not least, a score of 170 or more puts you comfortably among the top 2-3% of test-takers and will certainly get the attention of some of the best law schools in the country.\nBut I want to let you in on a secret: Your admission doesn\u2019t hinge solely on your LSAT score.\nYour\u00a0undergraduate GPA\u00a0also plays a part in it.\nAccording to the ABA,\u00a0the average GPA among admitted law school students\u00a0is around 3.6. But just like LSAT scores, that average varies across schools.\nAmong students who get into top-tier law schools like the ones mentioned earlier, the average GPA is 3.8 or higher.\nWhile both your GPA and LSAT scores are important factors in determining how successful you would be as a law school student, schools tend to weigh the LSAT more heavily.\nBut even if you score a couple of points lower than the median LSAT score or GPA at your number one school of choice, don\u2019t let it keep you from applying.\nThe law school admission process is a holistic one, which means that they\u2019ll look at more than just your score.\nIt all comes down to being able to prove you have what it takes to succeed as a law student in your application. With the right strategy, application elements like your personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation will help you stand out.\nNow that we\u2019ve touched on average LSAT scores and the kind of scores needed for top schools, let\u2019s move on to the three different types of LSAT scores.\nHow does LSAT work?\u00a0\nWhen talking about LSAT scores, most people only talk about the numbers, like 150, 170, or 180.\nBut there are actually\u00a0three\u00a0types of LSAT scores you should be aware of.\nThe first is called the raw score. Your raw score reflects the number of questions you answered correctly on the test.\nFor instance, if an LSAT was made up of 100 questions and you got 85 correct, you would score an 85.\nThe second type of score is a scaled score, which is the kind of score you\u2019re probably most familiar with.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0the kind of score that reads 150, 170, or 180.\u00a0\nA scaled score is what you get when you convert your raw score into an LSAT score based on the Score Conversion Chart. In this chart, scores range from 120 to 180.\nFinally, there\u2019s a percentile score, which shows how well you tested compared to others who have taken the LSAT over the last three years.\u00a0\nNext steps\nThere you have it! Everything you need to know about what makes for a good LSAT score.\nDon\u2019t let the pressure of a high LSAT score keep you from trying.\nAfter all, even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right kind of application strategy.\nDon\u2019t believe me?\u00a0\nI\u2019ve worked with several students who have scored well beneath the median and still gone on to receive admission letters.\nIf you want to make sure you\u2019re a top candidate, sign up for my\u00a0on-demand workshop today.

    "Summarized_Document1": "SAT Percentiles and Score Rankings (Updated 2024)\n\nUnderstanding your SAT scores and percentiles is crucial for maximizing your study time and improving your college admissions chances. Percentile rankings, ranging from 1 to 99, indicate how you performed compared to other test-takers. For example, a composite percentile of 76 means you scored higher than 76% of students.\n\nPercentiles are not the same as grades. A 90th percentile score means you scored better than 90% of students, not that you got 90% of the questions right. Colleges use these percentiles to compare applicants. A high percentile can make you competitive for many schools.\n\nThe College Board provides data on composite scores and their corresponding percentiles. For instance, a score of 1450 to 1600 falls within the 96th to 99th percentiles, while a score of 1100 to 1250 ranges from the 61st to 81st percentiles. This means a 150-point increase from 1100 can significantly boost your percentile rank.\n\nPercentile rankings also vary by section. For Reading and Writing, a score of 500 is in the 43rd percentile, while 600 is in the 73rd percentile. In Math, a 760 is in the 96th percentile, but a 700 is in the 91st percentile. This indicates that improving your Math score can have a more significant impact on your overall percentile.\n\nKnowing your SAT percentile can help you decide whether to retake the test and where to focus your study efforts. For example, improving a Math score from 600 to 700 can raise your percentile from 76 to 91, while increasing a Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800 only improves your percentile by 5%.\n\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search for the school's name along with 'SAT scores PrepScholar' to find relevant information. Even for test-optional schools, SAT scores can still enhance your application.\n\nIn summary, understanding and utilizing SAT percentiles can help you set realistic goals, prioritize your study time, and improve your chances of getting into your desired colleges.",

    "Summarized_Document3": "Are you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results? If so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What is a good LSAT score? LSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180. Realistically, you should aim for at least 150 to get into any accredited law school. For top 25 law schools, aim for at least 160, and for top 10 law schools, aim for at least 170. According to the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151. If you\u2019re unhappy with your score, you can retake it, but note that scores typically don\u2019t improve significantly on subsequent attempts. The median LSAT score for full-time first-year JD students in fall 2022 was 158.5, with the 75th percentile at 160.9 and the 25th percentile at 154.8. A score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program. LSAT scores range from 120 to 180, with a perfect 180 being extremely rare (0.1% of test-takers). A score of 170 or higher is considered excellent and places you in the top 2-3% of test-takers. For the top 10 law schools, the median LSAT scores are as follows: Stanford University (173), Yale University (175), University of Chicago (173), University of Pennsylvania (172), Duke University (170), Harvard University (174), New York University (172), Columbia University (173), University of Virginia (171), and Northwestern University (171). LSAT scores are important for law school admissions, but your undergraduate GPA also plays a significant role. The average GPA among admitted law school students is around 3.6, with top-tier schools averaging 3.8 or higher. The LSAT has three types of scores: raw score (number of correct answers), scaled score (converted from raw score, ranging from 120 to 180), and percentile score (compared to other test-takers over the last three years). Even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right application strategy, including a strong personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation.",

However, the SAT remains a common standard, with colleges making score submissions optional rather than completely abandoning the practice.[2], [3]\nThis report outlines key statistics about the SAT, including the national average score, scores broken down by demographic, and average scores among enrollees at top schools.\nTable of Contents\nWhat Is the Average SAT Score?\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016.Note Reference [1]\nDid You Know...\nFrom 2006-2016, the SAT was scored on a 2400-point scale.\nIt returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017.\nThe current average SAT score of 1028 reflects the scores of students who graduated from high school in 2023.\nAverage SAT Scores by State\nThe percentage of high school students who took the SAT differed significantly by state. For example, in Mississippi and North Dakota, only 1% of students took the SAT. In contrast, 100% of students took the SAT in the District of Columbia, and 95% of students in Rhode Island.\nAverage SAT Scores by State, Graduating Class of 2023\nAverage SAT Score by School\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at your top colleges can be helpful when it comes to setting goals. If you've already taken the SAT, you can see how your score compares to the typical scores at some of your top college choices to better understand where you stand in comparison to the previously admitted class.\nCollege admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications. Standardized test scores are just one aspect of an application if they are considered at all.\nDid You Know...\nToday, fewer colleges are requiring standardized test scores for admissions.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which schools closed and concerns emerged about whether students had adequate access to testing, colleges became more lax about their testing policies.\nIn September 2019, before the pandemic, more than 1,000 colleges were test-optional. According to the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest), over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free as of the 2023-2024 application cycle.[6]\nThis means almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions no longer require tests.\nAverage SAT Score for Ivy Leagues\nThe Ivy Leagues are some of the U.S.'s oldest and most prestigious universities. The eight private colleges are all located in the Northeast and are known for their highly selective, single-digit acceptance rates.\nAs of 2022-2023 application cycle, standardized test scores are optional at all Ivy League colleges. The data below reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores.\nAverage SAT Scores for Other Selective Universities\nBelow are average SAT scores for other selective schools throughout the U.S. Many of these schools' average SAT scores are comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\nSAT Score Demographics\nSometimes, it is helpful to see SAT scores broken down by specific groups to notice trends. This section explores average SAT scores by race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income.\nUnderstanding Differences in Average SAT Scores Across Demographics\nWhether the SAT is implicitly biased to favor wealthy and white students has long been a subject of debate. A 2023 study by a team of researchers based at Harvard University, however, was able to back this argument with data. They found that \"Ivy-Plus\" colleges \u2014 a group of 12 highly selective, private schools including the eight Ivy League schools and the University of Chicago, Duke, MIT, and Stanford \u2014 were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to students from low- or middle-income families even when they had comparable test scores.[7]\nIn a class of 1,650 students, there were roughly 114 \"extra students\" from the top 1% despite them having comparable standardized test scores to students of lower income brackets.Note Reference [7] Higher admission rates for these students from high-income families were primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\nGetting a degree from an \"Ivy-Plus\" school can lead to many opportunities. Less than 1% of Americans attend one of these 12 highly selective, private institutions, yet graduates of these schools make up nearly 12% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 25% of current U.S. senators, and over 70% of Supreme Court Justices. By changing admissions practices, \"Ivy-Plus\" institutions could shift the makeup of the country's highest earners and leaders.Note Reference [7]\nStudents largely support changes in admissions practices, including the elimination of legacy-based admissions.\nAverage SAT Score by Race/Ethnicity\nSAT scores broken down by race/ethnicity showed similar trends to those of the ACT.\nAverage SAT Score by Gender\nMen have consistently outscored women in the SAT since 2017. However, women have scored higher on the ERW section every year. Men scored higher on the math section.\nCollege admissions officers consider total SAT scores but also scores by section.\nAverage SAT Score by First Language\nThose who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow four-point margin. In 2022, native English speakers who grew up only speaking English had the highest total SAT score.\nAverage SAT Score by Highest Level of Parental Education\nThe highest level of education that one's parents received appears to heavily influence how students perform on the SAT.\nDid You Know...\nFirst-generation college students \u2014 students whose immediate family members do not have four-year degrees \u2014 make up more than 40% of all college students.\nImposter syndrome can be a common challenge for these students, but getting guidance from academic counselors or professors can help relieve some of that stress.\nIn addition, many schools provide resources, such as academic advising or scholarship opportunities specific to first-generation students. Check with your financial aid office or career center to see what your campus has to offer.\nAverage SAT Score by Family Income\nSAT performance also correlates with family income.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the SAT\nHow many times can you take the SAT?\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT.[8] The organization that administers the SAT, College Board, recommends that students take the test at least twice because many schools \"superscore\" your results. That means they combine your highest math score with your highest ERW score even if they are from different tests.Note Reference [8]\nIt's common for students to take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and another time in the fall of their senior year.\nWhat is the highest SAT score?\nThe math and ERW sections are each 800 points each, making the total possible score 1600.[9] As of January 2021, the optional SAT essay was discontinued, along with SAT subject tests.[10] Your two scores, one from math and one from ERW, make up your total SAT score.\nIs the SAT or ACT easier?\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways. For example, they are both approximately three hours long, and both tests cover reading and math. Some key differences include the number of questions (the ACT has 215 while the SAT has 154) and the scoring scale (the ACT is scored from 1-36 while the SAT is scored from 400-1600).\nAnother major difference is that the ACT has an additional science section that the SAT doesn't have.\nKeeping in mind these differences, you can decide which test is a better fit for you. You can also check the websites of prospective colleges and see if they state which test the majority of their accepted students took.\nReferences\nLatest News\nCampus-GPT: How 2 University of California Campuses Are Designing Their Own Specialized AI Tools\nEmployment of Recent Law School Graduates Hits 10-Year High\nIs Yield Protection Real?\nUNC Greensboro Provides Free Childcare for Student-Parents\nRelated Stories\nWhat Is a Good SAT Score?\nHow Much Does College Cost?

Or maybe you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet but want to develop a target score.\nOne of the best ways to understand your SAT scores is to understand your SAT score percentiles. You can learn to maximize your study time, find the biggest score gains, and impress your dream school by understanding percentile rankings. Read on for a guide to maximizing your SAT score\u2014and your college admissions chances\u2014by using SAT score percentiles.\nBonus: Want to get a perfect SAT score? Read our famous guide on how to score a perfect 1600 on the SAT. You'll learn top strategies from the country's leading expert on the SAT, Allen Cheng, a Harvard grad and perfect scorer. No matter your level, you'll find useful advice here - this strategy guide has been read by over 500,000 people.\nRead the 1600 SAT guide today and start improving your score.\nWhat Are SAT Score Percentiles?\nIn addition to the composite score you get on the SAT (i.e., that number between 400 and 1600), you'll get a percentile ranking, ranging from 1 to 99. The SAT gives you a percentile ranking for your overall composite score as well as for each of the two section scores: Reading and Writing and Math.\nYour percentile tells you how you did on the SAT compared with everyone else who took the test. For example, if you got a composite percentile of 76, this means you scored higher than 76% of students on the whole test. If you got a percentile of 47 on the Math section, you did better than 47% of students on SAT Math.\nAn example of an SAT score report with percentiles.(College Board / College Board)\nYour percentile score is not like a grade out of 100. For instance, if you get a percentile of 90, this doesn't mean you got exactly 90% of the questions right. It just means that compared with everyone who took the SAT, you scored higher than 90% of them. (For more info on how the SAT is scored, see our scoring guide.)\nSo, why do percentiles matter? Colleges use percentiles to compare you with other students. If you got, say, an SAT score in the 90th percentile, this would make you competitive for many schools since you scored better than 90% of students nationwide.\nPaying attention to your percentile ranking, as well as your composite score, can give you the best idea of your performance and help you make strategic choices about which colleges to apply to.\nWhat Are the Percentile Ranges for the SAT?\nOK, so you get that percentile rankings are important. But if you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet or have taken it and plan to retake it, what composite SAT score should you shoot for in order to get a certain percentile ranking?\nLuckily, the College Board releases data about composite scores and matching percentile rankings to help you figure this out. These numbers change slightly from year to year, but we have the most recent info from 2024.\nWe've summarized the SAT percentile ranges, based on students who've taken the exam in the past three school years. \u00a0Just find your score to see your estimated percentile.\nSomething to note about these percentile ranks is that they change the fastest with the middle scores. For example, the difference between 1450 and 1600\u2014the highest possible score\u2014is only 4 percentile points, 96 to 99.\nHowever, the same point gap between 1100 and 1250 has a vast percentile difference\u201461 to 81. This means that if you scored 1100 or lower, increasing your overall composite by just 150 points would give a vast boost to your percentile rank and your admissions competitiveness!\nNeed more help with SAT Prep? Send your parent or guardian our guide to the SAT to get them thinking about the test prep process.\nSAT Percentile Charts by Section\nWe also have data on percentile rankings for score ranges in Reading and Writing\u00a0and Math. Check out the chart below to see how your scores stack up.\nSource: SAT Understanding Scores 2023\nAgain, note that the ranks change dramatically toward the middle scores: 500 in Reading and Writing is only the 43th percentile, but 600 is 73rd. In other words, a 100-point improvement\u2014which is very manageable with some smart studying\u2014could transform your score from poor to good.\nNote that the Math curve is more competitive near the top than the Reading and Writing curve is. A 760 is in the 96th percentile on Math but in the 99th percentile on Reading and Writing, and a 700 is in the 91st percentile on Math but in the 93rd percentile on Reading and Writing. This means that if you were aiming for the same percentile on both sections, you'd have to get a higher score on Math than you would on Reading and Writing.\nFor more info on SAT scores and rankings, check out our guide to average SAT scores in which we also look at score breakdowns by gender and ethnic group.\nHow Can Knowing Your SAT Percentile Help You?\nWe know that percentiles are important and that, in some cases, a relatively small composite score increase can have a huge effect on your percentile ranking.\nHowever, your target composite score for the colleges you want to apply to is the most important. While percentiles help college admissions officers compare your scores, schools also have their own score ranges that typically don\u2019t change much from year to year.\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search \"[School Name] SAT scores PrepScholar\" on Google to find our Admission Requirements page with its SAT/ACT score ranges and info on GPA ranges and overall competitiveness. For more tips on how to use this strategy (and for a table you can fill out for your specific colleges), see our guide on what a good SAT score is.\nBut what about colleges that are test optional? Our experts explain how SAT scores can still help you get into test optional schools in this article.\nMaximize your study time by setting a personal SAT target score.\nFinally, SAT percentile rankings can be a useful tool for you. Especially if you\u2019re deciding whether or not to retake the SAT, percentiles really help put your SAT scores in context. For example, the difference between your 700 in Reading and Writing and 600 in Math might not seem enormous, but that\u00a0score is in the 93rd percentile, while that Math score is in the 76th percentile. A huge difference!\nThis means you can get more bang for your buck if you focus on the Math section for your retake. Increasing your Math score by 100 points can raise your percentile from 76 to 91. However, raising your Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800, though super impressive, only improves your percentile ranking by 5%.\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore Reading and Writing\u2014in fact, a gain of just 50 points would put you in the 99th percentile! But recognizing that you stand to gain more with Math can ultimately help you prioritize your study time better.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nNow that you know the ins and outs of national SAT percentiles, check out what the average SAT scores are, and take a look at the average SAT scores in your state.\nTrying to figure out your SAT target score? Or maybe you took the SAT but aren't sure whether your score is competitive.

Let\u2019s go!\nWhat is a good LSAT score in 2024?\u00a0\nBefore we get into scores, let\u2019s take a look at some of the statistics surrounding LSAT scores:\nLSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180.\nWith that big of a range, what kind of score should you aim for?\nRealistically, you should try to get a score of at least 150. That\u2019s the score that will get you into any accredited law school.\nBut if your dream school is among the best in America, you should aim higher.\nTo get into any of the top 25 law schools in America, you need to score at least 160.\nAnd if you want to attend a top 10 law school, you should try to score even higher \u2013 at least 170.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re taking the LSAT for the first time, you might be wondering how your score will compare to others.\u00a0\nKeep reading to find out.\u00a0\nWhat is the average LSAT score for first-time takers?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0Law School Admission Council\u00a0(LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151.\nOf course, if you\u2019re unhappy with your LSAT score, you can always\u00a0take it again.\nJust remember that you\u2019re limited to taking it three times in a single testing year (August to June) and five times in the past five years.\nIn total, you can take the LSAT seven times in your lifetime.\nBut is taking it again\u00a0really\u00a0worth it? Contrary to popular belief, doing so won\u2019t always help.\nRemember, first-time test takers score 151.\nPeople who take the LSAT for a second time score an average of 151.7, which is a slight increase.\nAnd while you might think that taking it for a third time would increase your score, that\u2019s not always true.\nIn fact, people who take the LSAT for a third time earn the lowest scores.\nThat\u2019s why I always tell my clients to really consider if retaking it is right for them. After all, your score isn\u2019t going to make or break your chances of acceptance, but we\u2019ll talk about that a bit later.\nLet\u2019s move on to the LSAT score you need to get accepted into your dream law school.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for law school?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0American Bar Association\u00a0(ABA), the median LSAT score of full-time first-year JD students in the fall of 2022 was 158.5.\u00a0\nThe 75th percentile score was 160.9, and the 25th percentile score was 154.8.\nThat\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t get into the program of your choice with a lower score. An LSAT score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program.\nYou just need to have the right kind of application.\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed the median LSAT score, let\u2019s move on to the highest scores.\nWhat is the highest LSAT score?\u00a0\nLSAT scores can range anywhere from 120 to 180.\nGetting a perfect 180 on the LSAT is practically unheard of. In fact, just 0.1% of test-takers have achieved it.\nA 170 is considered a great score, as it would mean you got at least 90 of the 101 questions on the test right.\u00a0\nDoing so would put you in the top 2-3% of test takers, meaning you would get into most law schools.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s discuss the kind of LSAT scores you would need to be accepted into the top 10 law schools in the country.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for the top 10 law schools?\u00a0\nIf you want to\u00a0attend one of the top 10 law schools in the country, you should aim for an LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the low, median, and high LSAT scores at each school.\nStanford University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nYale University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0175\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0178\nUniversity of Chicago\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (Carey)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0167\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nDuke University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0168\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0170\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0171\nHarvard University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0174\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nNew York University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0174\nColumbia University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Virginia\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nNorthwestern University (Pritzker)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0172\nAs you can see, each of these schools has a median LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nBut even with a lower score, you can still get in.\nKeep reading to learn how.\nHow important are LSAT scores for law school admissions?\nIt\u2019s true that a higher score will increase your chances of acceptance into the law school of your choice.\nTypically, a score that falls within the 150 range is considered average. While it will get you accepted into most law schools, it could make it difficult to stand out.\nA score of at least 160 is considered strong, and most law schools have median scores within this range. However, keep in mind that scholarships may require higher scores.\nLast but not least, a score of 170 or more puts you comfortably among the top 2-3% of test-takers and will certainly get the attention of some of the best law schools in the country.\nBut I want to let you in on a secret: Your admission doesn\u2019t hinge solely on your LSAT score.\nYour\u00a0undergraduate GPA\u00a0also plays a part in it.\nAccording to the ABA,\u00a0the average GPA among admitted law school students\u00a0is around 3.6. But just like LSAT scores, that average varies across schools.\nAmong students who get into top-tier law schools like the ones mentioned earlier, the average GPA is 3.8 or higher.\nWhile both your GPA and LSAT scores are important factors in determining how successful you would be as a law school student, schools tend to weigh the LSAT more heavily.\nBut even if you score a couple of points lower than the median LSAT score or GPA at your number one school of choice, don\u2019t let it keep you from applying.\nThe law school admission process is a holistic one, which means that they\u2019ll look at more than just your score.\nIt all comes down to being able to prove you have what it takes to succeed as a law student in your application. With the right strategy, application elements like your personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation will help you stand out.\nNow that we\u2019ve touched on average LSAT scores and the kind of scores needed for top schools, let\u2019s move on to the three different types of LSAT scores.\nHow does LSAT work?\u00a0\nWhen talking about LSAT scores, most people only talk about the numbers, like 150, 170, or 180.\nBut there are actually\u00a0three\u00a0types of LSAT scores you should be aware of.\nThe first is called the raw score. Your raw score reflects the number of questions you answered correctly on the test.\nFor instance, if an LSAT was made up of 100 questions and you got 85 correct, you would score an 85.\nThe second type of score is a scaled score, which is the kind of score you\u2019re probably most familiar with.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0the kind of score that reads 150, 170, or 180.\u00a0\nA scaled score is what you get when you convert your raw score into an LSAT score based on the Score Conversion Chart. In this chart, scores range from 120 to 180.\nFinally, there\u2019s a percentile score, which shows how well you tested compared to others who have taken the LSAT over the last three years.\u00a0\nNext steps\nThere you have it! Everything you need to know about what makes for a good LSAT score.\nDon\u2019t let the pressure of a high LSAT score keep you from trying.\nAfter all, even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right kind of application strategy.\nDon\u2019t believe me?\u00a0\nI\u2019ve worked with several students who have scored well beneath the median and still gone on to receive admission letters.\nIf you want to make sure you\u2019re a top candidate, sign up for my\u00a0on-demand workshop today.

    "Summarized_Document1": "All About SAT Scores: National Average and Full Statistics\n\nMore than 1.9 million high school students took the SAT in 2023, with the majority being juniors and seniors. In comparison, 1.4 million students took the ACT in the same year. Despite a growing number of colleges no longer requiring standardized test scores, the SAT remains a common standard, with score submissions being optional rather than completely abandoned.\n\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016. The SAT returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017. The percentage of high school students who took the SAT varied significantly by state, with 100% participation in the District of Columbia and 95% in Rhode Island, compared to only 1% in Mississippi and North Dakota.\n\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at top colleges can help set goals. College admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications, with standardized test scores being just one aspect. As of the 2023-2024 application cycle, over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free, representing almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions.\n\nThe Ivy League schools, known for their highly selective acceptance rates, have made standardized test scores optional. The data reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores. Other selective universities in the U.S. have average SAT scores comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\n\nSAT scores broken down by demographics show trends across race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income. A 2023 study by Harvard University found that Ivy-Plus colleges were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to those from low- or middle-income families with comparable test scores. This was primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\n\nMen have consistently outscored women on the SAT since 2017, with men scoring higher on the math section and women scoring higher on the ERW section. Those who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow margin. The highest level of parental education appears to heavily influence SAT performance, with first-generation college students making up more than 40% of all college students.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT. The College Board recommends taking the test at least twice, as many schools superscore results. The highest possible SAT score is 1600, with the math and ERW sections each worth 800 points. The optional SAT essay and subject tests were discontinued in January 2021.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways, but the ACT includes an additional science section. Deciding which test to take depends on individual strengths and the preferences of prospective colleges.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "SAT Percentiles and Score Rankings (Updated 2024)\n\nUnderstanding your SAT scores and percentiles is crucial for maximizing your study time and improving your college admissions chances. Percentile rankings, ranging from 1 to 99, indicate how you performed compared to other test-takers. For example, a composite percentile of 76 means you scored higher than 76% of students.\n\nPercentiles are not the same as grades. A 90th percentile score means you scored better than 90% of students, not that you got 90% of the questions right. Colleges use these percentiles to compare applicants. A high percentile can make you competitive for many schools.\n\nThe College Board provides data on composite scores and their corresponding percentiles. For instance, a score of 1450 to 1600 falls within the 96th to 99th percentiles, while a score of 1100 to 1250 ranges from the 61st to 81st percentiles. This means a 150-point increase from 1100 can significantly boost your percentile rank.\n\nPercentile rankings also vary by section. For Reading and Writing, a score of 500 is in the 43rd percentile, while 600 is in the 73rd percentile. In Math, a 760 is in the 96th percentile, but a 700 is in the 91st percentile. This indicates that improving your Math score can have a more significant impact on your overall percentile.\n\nKnowing your SAT percentile can help you decide whether to retake the test and where to focus your study efforts. For example, improving a Math score from 600 to 700 can raise your percentile from 76 to 91, while increasing a Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800 only improves your percentile by 5%.\n\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search for the school's name along with 'SAT scores PrepScholar' to find relevant information. Even for test-optional schools, SAT scores can still enhance your application.\n\nIn summary, understanding and utilizing SAT percentiles can help you set realistic goals, prioritize your study time, and improve your chances of getting into your desired colleges.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "Are you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results? If so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What is a good LSAT score? LSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180. Realistically, you should aim for at least 150 to get into any accredited law school. For top 25 law schools, aim for at least 160, and for top 10 law schools, aim for at least 170. According to the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151. If you\u2019re unhappy with your score, you can retake it, but note that scores typically don\u2019t improve significantly on subsequent attempts. The median LSAT score for full-time first-year JD students in fall 2022 was 158.5, with the 75th percentile at 160.9 and the 25th percentile at 154.8. A score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program. LSAT scores range from 120 to 180, with a perfect 180 being extremely rare (0.1% of test-takers). A score of 170 or higher is considered excellent and places you in the top 2-3% of test-takers. For the top 10 law schools, the median LSAT scores are as follows: Stanford University (173), Yale University (175), University of Chicago (173), University of Pennsylvania (172), Duke University (170), Harvard University (174), New York University (172), Columbia University (173), University of Virginia (171), and Northwestern University (171). LSAT scores are important for law school admissions, but your undergraduate GPA also plays a significant role. The average GPA among admitted law school students is around 3.6, with top-tier schools averaging 3.8 or higher. The LSAT has three types of scores: raw score (number of correct answers), scaled score (converted from raw score, ranging from 120 to 180), and percentile score (compared to other test-takers over the last three years). Even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right application strategy, including a strong personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation.",

However, the SAT remains a common standard, with colleges making score submissions optional rather than completely abandoning the practice.[2], [3]\nThis report outlines key statistics about the SAT, including the national average score, scores broken down by demographic, and average scores among enrollees at top schools.\nTable of Contents\nWhat Is the Average SAT Score?\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016.Note Reference [1]\nDid You Know...\nFrom 2006-2016, the SAT was scored on a 2400-point scale.\nIt returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017.\nThe current average SAT score of 1028 reflects the scores of students who graduated from high school in 2023.\nAverage SAT Scores by State\nThe percentage of high school students who took the SAT differed significantly by state. For example, in Mississippi and North Dakota, only 1% of students took the SAT. In contrast, 100% of students took the SAT in the District of Columbia, and 95% of students in Rhode Island.\nAverage SAT Scores by State, Graduating Class of 2023\nAverage SAT Score by School\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at your top colleges can be helpful when it comes to setting goals. If you've already taken the SAT, you can see how your score compares to the typical scores at some of your top college choices to better understand where you stand in comparison to the previously admitted class.\nCollege admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications. Standardized test scores are just one aspect of an application if they are considered at all.\nDid You Know...\nToday, fewer colleges are requiring standardized test scores for admissions.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which schools closed and concerns emerged about whether students had adequate access to testing, colleges became more lax about their testing policies.\nIn September 2019, before the pandemic, more than 1,000 colleges were test-optional. According to the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest), over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free as of the 2023-2024 application cycle.[6]\nThis means almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions no longer require tests.\nAverage SAT Score for Ivy Leagues\nThe Ivy Leagues are some of the U.S.'s oldest and most prestigious universities. The eight private colleges are all located in the Northeast and are known for their highly selective, single-digit acceptance rates.\nAs of 2022-2023 application cycle, standardized test scores are optional at all Ivy League colleges. The data below reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores.\nAverage SAT Scores for Other Selective Universities\nBelow are average SAT scores for other selective schools throughout the U.S. Many of these schools' average SAT scores are comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\nSAT Score Demographics\nSometimes, it is helpful to see SAT scores broken down by specific groups to notice trends. This section explores average SAT scores by race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income.\nUnderstanding Differences in Average SAT Scores Across Demographics\nWhether the SAT is implicitly biased to favor wealthy and white students has long been a subject of debate. A 2023 study by a team of researchers based at Harvard University, however, was able to back this argument with data. They found that \"Ivy-Plus\" colleges \u2014 a group of 12 highly selective, private schools including the eight Ivy League schools and the University of Chicago, Duke, MIT, and Stanford \u2014 were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to students from low- or middle-income families even when they had comparable test scores.[7]\nIn a class of 1,650 students, there were roughly 114 \"extra students\" from the top 1% despite them having comparable standardized test scores to students of lower income brackets.Note Reference [7] Higher admission rates for these students from high-income families were primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\nGetting a degree from an \"Ivy-Plus\" school can lead to many opportunities. Less than 1% of Americans attend one of these 12 highly selective, private institutions, yet graduates of these schools make up nearly 12% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 25% of current U.S. senators, and over 70% of Supreme Court Justices. By changing admissions practices, \"Ivy-Plus\" institutions could shift the makeup of the country's highest earners and leaders.Note Reference [7]\nStudents largely support changes in admissions practices, including the elimination of legacy-based admissions.\nAverage SAT Score by Race/Ethnicity\nSAT scores broken down by race/ethnicity showed similar trends to those of the ACT.\nAverage SAT Score by Gender\nMen have consistently outscored women in the SAT since 2017. However, women have scored higher on the ERW section every year. Men scored higher on the math section.\nCollege admissions officers consider total SAT scores but also scores by section.\nAverage SAT Score by First Language\nThose who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow four-point margin. In 2022, native English speakers who grew up only speaking English had the highest total SAT score.\nAverage SAT Score by Highest Level of Parental Education\nThe highest level of education that one's parents received appears to heavily influence how students perform on the SAT.\nDid You Know...\nFirst-generation college students \u2014 students whose immediate family members do not have four-year degrees \u2014 make up more than 40% of all college students.\nImposter syndrome can be a common challenge for these students, but getting guidance from academic counselors or professors can help relieve some of that stress.\nIn addition, many schools provide resources, such as academic advising or scholarship opportunities specific to first-generation students. Check with your financial aid office or career center to see what your campus has to offer.\nAverage SAT Score by Family Income\nSAT performance also correlates with family income.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the SAT\nHow many times can you take the SAT?\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT.[8] The organization that administers the SAT, College Board, recommends that students take the test at least twice because many schools \"superscore\" your results. That means they combine your highest math score with your highest ERW score even if they are from different tests.Note Reference [8]\nIt's common for students to take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and another time in the fall of their senior year.\nWhat is the highest SAT score?\nThe math and ERW sections are each 800 points each, making the total possible score 1600.[9] As of January 2021, the optional SAT essay was discontinued, along with SAT subject tests.[10] Your two scores, one from math and one from ERW, make up your total SAT score.\nIs the SAT or ACT easier?\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways. For example, they are both approximately three hours long, and both tests cover reading and math. Some key differences include the number of questions (the ACT has 215 while the SAT has 154) and the scoring scale (the ACT is scored from 1-36 while the SAT is scored from 400-1600).\nAnother major difference is that the ACT has an additional science section that the SAT doesn't have.\nKeeping in mind these differences, you can decide which test is a better fit for you. You can also check the websites of prospective colleges and see if they state which test the majority of their accepted students took.\nReferences\nLatest News\nCampus-GPT: How 2 University of California Campuses Are Designing Their Own Specialized AI Tools\nEmployment of Recent Law School Graduates Hits 10-Year High\nIs Yield Protection Real?\nUNC Greensboro Provides Free Childcare for Student-Parents\nRelated Stories\nWhat Is a Good SAT Score?\nHow Much Does College Cost?

This guide will teach you all you need to know about ACT scores!\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nIf you want to evaluate how you compare to other test-takers, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll teach you everything you need to know about your scores, including average ACT scores, percentiles, highest ACT scores possible, and much more.\nAverage ACT Scores (2024)\nACT scores range from 1 to 36 in each category (except for writing, out of 12). The average of your four scores determines your ACT composite score. According to ACT Score National Ranks, the average score in each category is:\u00c2\u00a0\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to know how the ACT is scored. \u00c2\u00a0First, the number of questions you got correct in each section is counted and converted to scale scores.\nThe average ACT score is 19.9. These rankings are based on almost 4.5 million \u00e2\u0080\u009cACT-tested high school graduates of 2021, 2022, and 2023.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe ACT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website also released score information for students who decided to take the optional writing test, which contributes to an English Language Arts score (ELA). The average writing and ELA scores are 6.2 and 18.3, respectively. Remember, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only see these scores if you take the ACT optional writing test.\nAverage ACT Scores by State\nBelow is a chart that illustrates the most recent statistics on average ACT scores across various states. An important thing to consider is the proportion of students participating in the exam within each state. For instance, in states where the ACT is mandatory for all high school juniors, the average scores might appear lower due to universal testing.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nAverage ACT Scores for Top-25 Schools in the US\nLet's take a look at the average ACT scores for the top 25 schools in the United States.\nHighest Possible ACT Score\u00c2\u00a0\nThe highest ACT score is 36. The current national average ACT score is 19.9. Achieving a perfect ACT score is no easy feat. To give you some perspective, approximately 5,579 students achieved a perfect ACT score out of over 1.6 million test-takers: only about 0.33% of test-takers get a perfect ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, this doesn't mean achieving the highest ACT score is impossible. Sticking to a consistent study schedule, analyzing questions you get wrong during practice, and consulting helpful ACT guides and materials can better prepare you for the test.\nACT Scores By Percentile\u00c2\u00a0\nACT score percentiles can show you the percentage of students you scored higher than and what percentage scored higher than you. To read the ACT percentile chart below, find a score on either side you want to evaluate, then check the number in the category.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor example, a 23 on the English test places you in the 76th percentile: you scored at or higher than 76% of test-takers, and 24% scored higher than you.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nSource: ACT.org\nBased on the table, you can see that ACT score percentiles tend not to change very much at either end of the spectrum. For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive).\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile.\u00c2\u00a0\nOverall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time.\u00c2\u00a0\nAre you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies.\nFAQs\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs!\u00c2\u00a0\n1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good?\u00c2\u00a0\nAlthough a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\n2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness.\u00c2\u00a0\n3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application.\u00c2\u00a0\n4. What Is a Low ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nLike what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low.\u00c2\u00a0\n5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to?\u00c2\u00a0\nOnce your ACT score is released, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant!\u00c2\u00a0\n6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT?\u00c2\u00a0\nIf your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant.\n7. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Lowest Possible ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nThe lowest ACT score possible is 1.\n8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section?\nThe average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc.\n9. What is The Average Science ACT Score?\nThe average science ACT score is 20.\nFinal Thoughts\nNow that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.\u00c2\u00a0 A good way to go about it is to test your skills with our Free ACT Practice Questions Pop Quiz.

Let\u2019s go!\nWhat is a good LSAT score in 2024?\u00a0\nBefore we get into scores, let\u2019s take a look at some of the statistics surrounding LSAT scores:\nLSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180.\nWith that big of a range, what kind of score should you aim for?\nRealistically, you should try to get a score of at least 150. That\u2019s the score that will get you into any accredited law school.\nBut if your dream school is among the best in America, you should aim higher.\nTo get into any of the top 25 law schools in America, you need to score at least 160.\nAnd if you want to attend a top 10 law school, you should try to score even higher \u2013 at least 170.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re taking the LSAT for the first time, you might be wondering how your score will compare to others.\u00a0\nKeep reading to find out.\u00a0\nWhat is the average LSAT score for first-time takers?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0Law School Admission Council\u00a0(LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151.\nOf course, if you\u2019re unhappy with your LSAT score, you can always\u00a0take it again.\nJust remember that you\u2019re limited to taking it three times in a single testing year (August to June) and five times in the past five years.\nIn total, you can take the LSAT seven times in your lifetime.\nBut is taking it again\u00a0really\u00a0worth it? Contrary to popular belief, doing so won\u2019t always help.\nRemember, first-time test takers score 151.\nPeople who take the LSAT for a second time score an average of 151.7, which is a slight increase.\nAnd while you might think that taking it for a third time would increase your score, that\u2019s not always true.\nIn fact, people who take the LSAT for a third time earn the lowest scores.\nThat\u2019s why I always tell my clients to really consider if retaking it is right for them. After all, your score isn\u2019t going to make or break your chances of acceptance, but we\u2019ll talk about that a bit later.\nLet\u2019s move on to the LSAT score you need to get accepted into your dream law school.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for law school?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0American Bar Association\u00a0(ABA), the median LSAT score of full-time first-year JD students in the fall of 2022 was 158.5.\u00a0\nThe 75th percentile score was 160.9, and the 25th percentile score was 154.8.\nThat\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t get into the program of your choice with a lower score. An LSAT score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program.\nYou just need to have the right kind of application.\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed the median LSAT score, let\u2019s move on to the highest scores.\nWhat is the highest LSAT score?\u00a0\nLSAT scores can range anywhere from 120 to 180.\nGetting a perfect 180 on the LSAT is practically unheard of. In fact, just 0.1% of test-takers have achieved it.\nA 170 is considered a great score, as it would mean you got at least 90 of the 101 questions on the test right.\u00a0\nDoing so would put you in the top 2-3% of test takers, meaning you would get into most law schools.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s discuss the kind of LSAT scores you would need to be accepted into the top 10 law schools in the country.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for the top 10 law schools?\u00a0\nIf you want to\u00a0attend one of the top 10 law schools in the country, you should aim for an LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the low, median, and high LSAT scores at each school.\nStanford University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nYale University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0175\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0178\nUniversity of Chicago\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (Carey)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0167\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nDuke University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0168\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0170\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0171\nHarvard University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0174\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nNew York University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0174\nColumbia University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Virginia\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nNorthwestern University (Pritzker)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0172\nAs you can see, each of these schools has a median LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nBut even with a lower score, you can still get in.\nKeep reading to learn how.\nHow important are LSAT scores for law school admissions?\nIt\u2019s true that a higher score will increase your chances of acceptance into the law school of your choice.\nTypically, a score that falls within the 150 range is considered average. While it will get you accepted into most law schools, it could make it difficult to stand out.\nA score of at least 160 is considered strong, and most law schools have median scores within this range. However, keep in mind that scholarships may require higher scores.\nLast but not least, a score of 170 or more puts you comfortably among the top 2-3% of test-takers and will certainly get the attention of some of the best law schools in the country.\nBut I want to let you in on a secret: Your admission doesn\u2019t hinge solely on your LSAT score.\nYour\u00a0undergraduate GPA\u00a0also plays a part in it.\nAccording to the ABA,\u00a0the average GPA among admitted law school students\u00a0is around 3.6. But just like LSAT scores, that average varies across schools.\nAmong students who get into top-tier law schools like the ones mentioned earlier, the average GPA is 3.8 or higher.\nWhile both your GPA and LSAT scores are important factors in determining how successful you would be as a law school student, schools tend to weigh the LSAT more heavily.\nBut even if you score a couple of points lower than the median LSAT score or GPA at your number one school of choice, don\u2019t let it keep you from applying.\nThe law school admission process is a holistic one, which means that they\u2019ll look at more than just your score.\nIt all comes down to being able to prove you have what it takes to succeed as a law student in your application. With the right strategy, application elements like your personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation will help you stand out.\nNow that we\u2019ve touched on average LSAT scores and the kind of scores needed for top schools, let\u2019s move on to the three different types of LSAT scores.\nHow does LSAT work?\u00a0\nWhen talking about LSAT scores, most people only talk about the numbers, like 150, 170, or 180.\nBut there are actually\u00a0three\u00a0types of LSAT scores you should be aware of.\nThe first is called the raw score. Your raw score reflects the number of questions you answered correctly on the test.\nFor instance, if an LSAT was made up of 100 questions and you got 85 correct, you would score an 85.\nThe second type of score is a scaled score, which is the kind of score you\u2019re probably most familiar with.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0the kind of score that reads 150, 170, or 180.\u00a0\nA scaled score is what you get when you convert your raw score into an LSAT score based on the Score Conversion Chart. In this chart, scores range from 120 to 180.\nFinally, there\u2019s a percentile score, which shows how well you tested compared to others who have taken the LSAT over the last three years.\u00a0\nNext steps\nThere you have it! Everything you need to know about what makes for a good LSAT score.\nDon\u2019t let the pressure of a high LSAT score keep you from trying.\nAfter all, even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right kind of application strategy.\nDon\u2019t believe me?\u00a0\nI\u2019ve worked with several students who have scored well beneath the median and still gone on to receive admission letters.\nIf you want to make sure you\u2019re a top candidate, sign up for my\u00a0on-demand workshop today.

    "Summarized_Document1": "All About SAT Scores: National Average and Full Statistics\n\nMore than 1.9 million high school students took the SAT in 2023, with the majority being juniors and seniors. In comparison, 1.4 million students took the ACT in the same year. Despite a growing number of colleges no longer requiring standardized test scores, the SAT remains a common standard, with score submissions being optional rather than completely abandoned.\n\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016. The SAT returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017. The percentage of high school students who took the SAT varied significantly by state, with 100% participation in the District of Columbia and 95% in Rhode Island, compared to only 1% in Mississippi and North Dakota.\n\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at top colleges can help set goals. College admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications, with standardized test scores being just one aspect. As of the 2023-2024 application cycle, over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free, representing almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions.\n\nThe Ivy League schools, known for their highly selective acceptance rates, have made standardized test scores optional. The data reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores. Other selective universities in the U.S. have average SAT scores comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\n\nSAT scores broken down by demographics show trends across race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income. A 2023 study by Harvard University found that Ivy-Plus colleges were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to those from low- or middle-income families with comparable test scores. This was primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\n\nMen have consistently outscored women on the SAT since 2017, with men scoring higher on the math section and women scoring higher on the ERW section. Those who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow margin. The highest level of parental education appears to heavily influence SAT performance, with first-generation college students making up more than 40% of all college students.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT. The College Board recommends taking the test at least twice, as many schools superscore results. The highest possible SAT score is 1600, with the math and ERW sections each worth 800 points. The optional SAT essay and subject tests were discontinued in January 2021.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways, but the ACT includes an additional science section. Deciding which test to take depends on individual strengths and the preferences of prospective colleges.",

For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u2019ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive). However, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile. Overall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time. Are you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies. FAQs If you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs! 1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good? Although a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score. 2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College? While even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness. 3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score? While it\u2019s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application. 4. What Is a Low ACT Score? Like what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low. 5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to? Once your ACT score is released, you\u2019ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant! 6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT? If your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant. 7. What\u2019s the Lowest Possible ACT Score? The lowest ACT score possible is 1. 8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section? The average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc. 9. What is The Average Science ACT Score? The average science ACT score is 20. Final Thoughts Now that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher. If you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.

    "Summarized_Document3": "Are you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results? If so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What is a good LSAT score? LSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180. Realistically, you should aim for at least 150 to get into any accredited law school. For top 25 law schools, aim for at least 160, and for top 10 law schools, aim for at least 170. According to the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151. If you\u2019re unhappy with your score, you can retake it, but note that scores typically don\u2019t improve significantly on subsequent attempts. The median LSAT score for full-time first-year JD students in fall 2022 was 158.5, with the 75th percentile at 160.9 and the 25th percentile at 154.8. A score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program. LSAT scores range from 120 to 180, with a perfect 180 being extremely rare (0.1% of test-takers). A score of 170 or higher is considered excellent and places you in the top 2-3% of test-takers. For the top 10 law schools, the median LSAT scores are as follows: Stanford University (173), Yale University (175), University of Chicago (173), University of Pennsylvania (172), Duke University (170), Harvard University (174), New York University (172), Columbia University (173), University of Virginia (171), and Northwestern University (171). LSAT scores are important for law school admissions, but your undergraduate GPA also plays a significant role. The average GPA among admitted law school students is around 3.6, with top-tier schools averaging 3.8 or higher. The LSAT has three types of scores: raw score (number of correct answers), scaled score (converted from raw score, ranging from 120 to 180), and percentile score (compared to other test-takers over the last three years). Even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right application strategy, including a strong personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation.",

However, the SAT remains a common standard, with colleges making score submissions optional rather than completely abandoning the practice.[2], [3]\nThis report outlines key statistics about the SAT, including the national average score, scores broken down by demographic, and average scores among enrollees at top schools.\nTable of Contents\nWhat Is the Average SAT Score?\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016.Note Reference [1]\nDid You Know...\nFrom 2006-2016, the SAT was scored on a 2400-point scale.\nIt returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017.\nThe current average SAT score of 1028 reflects the scores of students who graduated from high school in 2023.\nAverage SAT Scores by State\nThe percentage of high school students who took the SAT differed significantly by state. For example, in Mississippi and North Dakota, only 1% of students took the SAT. In contrast, 100% of students took the SAT in the District of Columbia, and 95% of students in Rhode Island.\nAverage SAT Scores by State, Graduating Class of 2023\nAverage SAT Score by School\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at your top colleges can be helpful when it comes to setting goals. If you've already taken the SAT, you can see how your score compares to the typical scores at some of your top college choices to better understand where you stand in comparison to the previously admitted class.\nCollege admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications. Standardized test scores are just one aspect of an application if they are considered at all.\nDid You Know...\nToday, fewer colleges are requiring standardized test scores for admissions.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which schools closed and concerns emerged about whether students had adequate access to testing, colleges became more lax about their testing policies.\nIn September 2019, before the pandemic, more than 1,000 colleges were test-optional. According to the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest), over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free as of the 2023-2024 application cycle.[6]\nThis means almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions no longer require tests.\nAverage SAT Score for Ivy Leagues\nThe Ivy Leagues are some of the U.S.'s oldest and most prestigious universities. The eight private colleges are all located in the Northeast and are known for their highly selective, single-digit acceptance rates.\nAs of 2022-2023 application cycle, standardized test scores are optional at all Ivy League colleges. The data below reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores.\nAverage SAT Scores for Other Selective Universities\nBelow are average SAT scores for other selective schools throughout the U.S. Many of these schools' average SAT scores are comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\nSAT Score Demographics\nSometimes, it is helpful to see SAT scores broken down by specific groups to notice trends. This section explores average SAT scores by race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income.\nUnderstanding Differences in Average SAT Scores Across Demographics\nWhether the SAT is implicitly biased to favor wealthy and white students has long been a subject of debate. A 2023 study by a team of researchers based at Harvard University, however, was able to back this argument with data. They found that \"Ivy-Plus\" colleges \u2014 a group of 12 highly selective, private schools including the eight Ivy League schools and the University of Chicago, Duke, MIT, and Stanford \u2014 were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to students from low- or middle-income families even when they had comparable test scores.[7]\nIn a class of 1,650 students, there were roughly 114 \"extra students\" from the top 1% despite them having comparable standardized test scores to students of lower income brackets.Note Reference [7] Higher admission rates for these students from high-income families were primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\nGetting a degree from an \"Ivy-Plus\" school can lead to many opportunities. Less than 1% of Americans attend one of these 12 highly selective, private institutions, yet graduates of these schools make up nearly 12% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 25% of current U.S. senators, and over 70% of Supreme Court Justices. By changing admissions practices, \"Ivy-Plus\" institutions could shift the makeup of the country's highest earners and leaders.Note Reference [7]\nStudents largely support changes in admissions practices, including the elimination of legacy-based admissions.\nAverage SAT Score by Race/Ethnicity\nSAT scores broken down by race/ethnicity showed similar trends to those of the ACT.\nAverage SAT Score by Gender\nMen have consistently outscored women in the SAT since 2017. However, women have scored higher on the ERW section every year. Men scored higher on the math section.\nCollege admissions officers consider total SAT scores but also scores by section.\nAverage SAT Score by First Language\nThose who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow four-point margin. In 2022, native English speakers who grew up only speaking English had the highest total SAT score.\nAverage SAT Score by Highest Level of Parental Education\nThe highest level of education that one's parents received appears to heavily influence how students perform on the SAT.\nDid You Know...\nFirst-generation college students \u2014 students whose immediate family members do not have four-year degrees \u2014 make up more than 40% of all college students.\nImposter syndrome can be a common challenge for these students, but getting guidance from academic counselors or professors can help relieve some of that stress.\nIn addition, many schools provide resources, such as academic advising or scholarship opportunities specific to first-generation students. Check with your financial aid office or career center to see what your campus has to offer.\nAverage SAT Score by Family Income\nSAT performance also correlates with family income.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the SAT\nHow many times can you take the SAT?\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT.[8] The organization that administers the SAT, College Board, recommends that students take the test at least twice because many schools \"superscore\" your results. That means they combine your highest math score with your highest ERW score even if they are from different tests.Note Reference [8]\nIt's common for students to take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and another time in the fall of their senior year.\nWhat is the highest SAT score?\nThe math and ERW sections are each 800 points each, making the total possible score 1600.[9] As of January 2021, the optional SAT essay was discontinued, along with SAT subject tests.[10] Your two scores, one from math and one from ERW, make up your total SAT score.\nIs the SAT or ACT easier?\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways. For example, they are both approximately three hours long, and both tests cover reading and math. Some key differences include the number of questions (the ACT has 215 while the SAT has 154) and the scoring scale (the ACT is scored from 1-36 while the SAT is scored from 400-1600).\nAnother major difference is that the ACT has an additional science section that the SAT doesn't have.\nKeeping in mind these differences, you can decide which test is a better fit for you. You can also check the websites of prospective colleges and see if they state which test the majority of their accepted students took.\nReferences\nLatest News\nCampus-GPT: How 2 University of California Campuses Are Designing Their Own Specialized AI Tools\nEmployment of Recent Law School Graduates Hits 10-Year High\nIs Yield Protection Real?\nUNC Greensboro Provides Free Childcare for Student-Parents\nRelated Stories\nWhat Is a Good SAT Score?\nHow Much Does College Cost?

Or maybe you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet but want to develop a target score.\nOne of the best ways to understand your SAT scores is to understand your SAT score percentiles. You can learn to maximize your study time, find the biggest score gains, and impress your dream school by understanding percentile rankings. Read on for a guide to maximizing your SAT score\u2014and your college admissions chances\u2014by using SAT score percentiles.\nBonus: Want to get a perfect SAT score? Read our famous guide on how to score a perfect 1600 on the SAT. You'll learn top strategies from the country's leading expert on the SAT, Allen Cheng, a Harvard grad and perfect scorer. No matter your level, you'll find useful advice here - this strategy guide has been read by over 500,000 people.\nRead the 1600 SAT guide today and start improving your score.\nWhat Are SAT Score Percentiles?\nIn addition to the composite score you get on the SAT (i.e., that number between 400 and 1600), you'll get a percentile ranking, ranging from 1 to 99. The SAT gives you a percentile ranking for your overall composite score as well as for each of the two section scores: Reading and Writing and Math.\nYour percentile tells you how you did on the SAT compared with everyone else who took the test. For example, if you got a composite percentile of 76, this means you scored higher than 76% of students on the whole test. If you got a percentile of 47 on the Math section, you did better than 47% of students on SAT Math.\nAn example of an SAT score report with percentiles.(College Board / College Board)\nYour percentile score is not like a grade out of 100. For instance, if you get a percentile of 90, this doesn't mean you got exactly 90% of the questions right. It just means that compared with everyone who took the SAT, you scored higher than 90% of them. (For more info on how the SAT is scored, see our scoring guide.)\nSo, why do percentiles matter? Colleges use percentiles to compare you with other students. If you got, say, an SAT score in the 90th percentile, this would make you competitive for many schools since you scored better than 90% of students nationwide.\nPaying attention to your percentile ranking, as well as your composite score, can give you the best idea of your performance and help you make strategic choices about which colleges to apply to.\nWhat Are the Percentile Ranges for the SAT?\nOK, so you get that percentile rankings are important. But if you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet or have taken it and plan to retake it, what composite SAT score should you shoot for in order to get a certain percentile ranking?\nLuckily, the College Board releases data about composite scores and matching percentile rankings to help you figure this out. These numbers change slightly from year to year, but we have the most recent info from 2024.\nWe've summarized the SAT percentile ranges, based on students who've taken the exam in the past three school years. \u00a0Just find your score to see your estimated percentile.\nSomething to note about these percentile ranks is that they change the fastest with the middle scores. For example, the difference between 1450 and 1600\u2014the highest possible score\u2014is only 4 percentile points, 96 to 99.\nHowever, the same point gap between 1100 and 1250 has a vast percentile difference\u201461 to 81. This means that if you scored 1100 or lower, increasing your overall composite by just 150 points would give a vast boost to your percentile rank and your admissions competitiveness!\nNeed more help with SAT Prep? Send your parent or guardian our guide to the SAT to get them thinking about the test prep process.\nSAT Percentile Charts by Section\nWe also have data on percentile rankings for score ranges in Reading and Writing\u00a0and Math. Check out the chart below to see how your scores stack up.\nSource: SAT Understanding Scores 2023\nAgain, note that the ranks change dramatically toward the middle scores: 500 in Reading and Writing is only the 43th percentile, but 600 is 73rd. In other words, a 100-point improvement\u2014which is very manageable with some smart studying\u2014could transform your score from poor to good.\nNote that the Math curve is more competitive near the top than the Reading and Writing curve is. A 760 is in the 96th percentile on Math but in the 99th percentile on Reading and Writing, and a 700 is in the 91st percentile on Math but in the 93rd percentile on Reading and Writing. This means that if you were aiming for the same percentile on both sections, you'd have to get a higher score on Math than you would on Reading and Writing.\nFor more info on SAT scores and rankings, check out our guide to average SAT scores in which we also look at score breakdowns by gender and ethnic group.\nHow Can Knowing Your SAT Percentile Help You?\nWe know that percentiles are important and that, in some cases, a relatively small composite score increase can have a huge effect on your percentile ranking.\nHowever, your target composite score for the colleges you want to apply to is the most important. While percentiles help college admissions officers compare your scores, schools also have their own score ranges that typically don\u2019t change much from year to year.\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search \"[School Name] SAT scores PrepScholar\" on Google to find our Admission Requirements page with its SAT/ACT score ranges and info on GPA ranges and overall competitiveness. For more tips on how to use this strategy (and for a table you can fill out for your specific colleges), see our guide on what a good SAT score is.\nBut what about colleges that are test optional? Our experts explain how SAT scores can still help you get into test optional schools in this article.\nMaximize your study time by setting a personal SAT target score.\nFinally, SAT percentile rankings can be a useful tool for you. Especially if you\u2019re deciding whether or not to retake the SAT, percentiles really help put your SAT scores in context. For example, the difference between your 700 in Reading and Writing and 600 in Math might not seem enormous, but that\u00a0score is in the 93rd percentile, while that Math score is in the 76th percentile. A huge difference!\nThis means you can get more bang for your buck if you focus on the Math section for your retake. Increasing your Math score by 100 points can raise your percentile from 76 to 91. However, raising your Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800, though super impressive, only improves your percentile ranking by 5%.\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore Reading and Writing\u2014in fact, a gain of just 50 points would put you in the 99th percentile! But recognizing that you stand to gain more with Math can ultimately help you prioritize your study time better.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nNow that you know the ins and outs of national SAT percentiles, check out what the average SAT scores are, and take a look at the average SAT scores in your state.\nTrying to figure out your SAT target score? Or maybe you took the SAT but aren't sure whether your score is competitive. Our guide can help you develop a personal SAT target score based on the colleges you're applying to.\nReaching for the stars?

    "Summarized_Document1": "All About SAT Scores: National Average and Full Statistics\n\nMore than 1.9 million high school students took the SAT in 2023, with the majority being juniors and seniors. In comparison, 1.4 million students took the ACT in the same year. Despite a growing number of colleges no longer requiring standardized test scores, the SAT remains a common standard, with score submissions being optional rather than completely abandoned.\n\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016. The SAT returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017. The percentage of high school students who took the SAT varied significantly by state, with 100% participation in the District of Columbia and 95% in Rhode Island, compared to only 1% in Mississippi and North Dakota.\n\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at top colleges can help set goals. College admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications, with standardized test scores being just one aspect. As of the 2023-2024 application cycle, over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free, representing almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions.\n\nThe Ivy League schools, known for their highly selective acceptance rates, have made standardized test scores optional. The data reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores. Other selective universities in the U.S. have average SAT scores comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\n\nSAT scores broken down by demographics show trends across race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income. A 2023 study by Harvard University found that Ivy-Plus colleges were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to those from low- or middle-income families with comparable test scores. This was primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\n\nMen have consistently outscored women on the SAT since 2017, with men scoring higher on the math section and women scoring higher on the ERW section. Those who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow margin. The highest level of parental education appears to heavily influence SAT performance, with first-generation college students making up more than 40% of all college students.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT. The College Board recommends taking the test at least twice, as many schools superscore results. The highest possible SAT score is 1600, with the math and ERW sections each worth 800 points. The optional SAT essay and subject tests were discontinued in January 2021.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways, but the ACT includes an additional science section. Deciding which test to take depends on individual strengths and the preferences of prospective colleges.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "SAT Percentiles and Score Rankings (Updated 2024)\n\nUnderstanding your SAT scores and percentiles is crucial for maximizing your study time and improving your college admissions chances. Percentile rankings, ranging from 1 to 99, indicate how you performed compared to other test-takers. For example, a composite percentile of 76 means you scored higher than 76% of students.\n\nPercentiles are not the same as grades. A 90th percentile score means you scored better than 90% of students, not that you got 90% of the questions right. Colleges use these percentiles to compare applicants. A high percentile can make you competitive for many schools.\n\nThe College Board provides data on composite scores and their corresponding percentiles. For instance, a score of 1450 to 1600 falls within the 96th to 99th percentiles, while a score of 1100 to 1250 ranges from the 61st to 81st percentiles. This means a 150-point increase from 1100 can significantly boost your percentile rank.\n\nPercentile rankings also vary by section. For Reading and Writing, a score of 500 is in the 43rd percentile, while 600 is in the 73rd percentile. In Math, a 760 is in the 96th percentile, but a 700 is in the 91st percentile. This indicates that improving your Math score can have a more significant impact on your overall percentile.\n\nKnowing your SAT percentile can help you decide whether to retake the test and where to focus your study efforts. For example, improving a Math score from 600 to 700 can raise your percentile from 76 to 91, while increasing a Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800 only improves your percentile by 5%.\n\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search for the school's name along with 'SAT scores PrepScholar' to find relevant information. Even for test-optional schools, SAT scores can still enhance your application.\n\nIn summary, understanding and utilizing SAT percentiles can help you set realistic goals, prioritize your study time, and improve your chances of getting into your desired colleges.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "Students aiming for top engineering schools should be aware of the required GRE scores. Not all engineering programs require the GRE; for instance, some programs at Harvard and MIT do not. The GRE is beneficial for aspiring engineers as it is widely used for admissions. The math section is easier for those with a technical background, but the Verbal and Analytical Writing sections are more challenging. Quantitative scores are more critical for engineering admissions than verbal scores. However, verbal scores still impact the overall GRE score, which is important for top universities.For better chances of admission to top engineering programs, candidates should aim for a Quantitative score between 161-166. An 80th percentile score, according to ETS data for 2019-2020, is a verbal score of 158 and a quantitative score of 162. The average Quantitative score for the top ten engineering programs is 166, while for programs ranked 11 to 50, it is 164. Top engineering schools require Quantitative scores between 164-168.For Mechanical Engineering programs, students should aim for a Quantitative score of 165 and a Verbal score of 150. A GRE score above 320 with 161-166 in Quantitative Reasoning is considered good for engineering schools. A perfect score of 340 is excellent, but scores as low as 320 are still competitive.A good GRE Quantitative Reasoning score for engineering schools is above 161, with 170 being excellent. Similarly, a good Verbal Reasoning score is above 158, with 170 being excellent. GRE prep courses can help improve scores by providing targeted instruction and practice.In summary, for engineering program admissions, focus on achieving high Quantitative scores, but do not neglect the Verbal section. Aim for scores above 320 overall, with Quantitative scores between 161-166 for the best chances at top programs.",

However, the SAT remains a common standard, with colleges making score submissions optional rather than completely abandoning the practice.[2], [3]\nThis report outlines key statistics about the SAT, including the national average score, scores broken down by demographic, and average scores among enrollees at top schools.\nTable of Contents\nWhat Is the Average SAT Score?\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016.Note Reference [1]\nDid You Know...\nFrom 2006-2016, the SAT was scored on a 2400-point scale.\nIt returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017.\nThe current average SAT score of 1028 reflects the scores of students who graduated from high school in 2023.\nAverage SAT Scores by State\nThe percentage of high school students who took the SAT differed significantly by state. For example, in Mississippi and North Dakota, only 1% of students took the SAT. In contrast, 100% of students took the SAT in the District of Columbia, and 95% of students in Rhode Island.\nAverage SAT Scores by State, Graduating Class of 2023\nAverage SAT Score by School\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at your top colleges can be helpful when it comes to setting goals. If you've already taken the SAT, you can see how your score compares to the typical scores at some of your top college choices to better understand where you stand in comparison to the previously admitted class.\nCollege admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications. Standardized test scores are just one aspect of an application if they are considered at all.\nDid You Know...\nToday, fewer colleges are requiring standardized test scores for admissions.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which schools closed and concerns emerged about whether students had adequate access to testing, colleges became more lax about their testing policies.\nIn September 2019, before the pandemic, more than 1,000 colleges were test-optional. According to the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest), over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free as of the 2023-2024 application cycle.[6]\nThis means almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions no longer require tests.\nAverage SAT Score for Ivy Leagues\nThe Ivy Leagues are some of the U.S.'s oldest and most prestigious universities. The eight private colleges are all located in the Northeast and are known for their highly selective, single-digit acceptance rates.\nAs of 2022-2023 application cycle, standardized test scores are optional at all Ivy League colleges. The data below reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores.\nAverage SAT Scores for Other Selective Universities\nBelow are average SAT scores for other selective schools throughout the U.S. Many of these schools' average SAT scores are comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\nSAT Score Demographics\nSometimes, it is helpful to see SAT scores broken down by specific groups to notice trends. This section explores average SAT scores by race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income.\nUnderstanding Differences in Average SAT Scores Across Demographics\nWhether the SAT is implicitly biased to favor wealthy and white students has long been a subject of debate. A 2023 study by a team of researchers based at Harvard University, however, was able to back this argument with data. They found that \"Ivy-Plus\" colleges \u2014 a group of 12 highly selective, private schools including the eight Ivy League schools and the University of Chicago, Duke, MIT, and Stanford \u2014 were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to students from low- or middle-income families even when they had comparable test scores.[7]\nIn a class of 1,650 students, there were roughly 114 \"extra students\" from the top 1% despite them having comparable standardized test scores to students of lower income brackets.Note Reference [7] Higher admission rates for these students from high-income families were primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\nGetting a degree from an \"Ivy-Plus\" school can lead to many opportunities. Less than 1% of Americans attend one of these 12 highly selective, private institutions, yet graduates of these schools make up nearly 12% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 25% of current U.S. senators, and over 70% of Supreme Court Justices. By changing admissions practices, \"Ivy-Plus\" institutions could shift the makeup of the country's highest earners and leaders.Note Reference [7]\nStudents largely support changes in admissions practices, including the elimination of legacy-based admissions.\nAverage SAT Score by Race/Ethnicity\nSAT scores broken down by race/ethnicity showed similar trends to those of the ACT.\nAverage SAT Score by Gender\nMen have consistently outscored women in the SAT since 2017. However, women have scored higher on the ERW section every year. Men scored higher on the math section.\nCollege admissions officers consider total SAT scores but also scores by section.\nAverage SAT Score by First Language\nThose who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow four-point margin. In 2022, native English speakers who grew up only speaking English had the highest total SAT score.\nAverage SAT Score by Highest Level of Parental Education\nThe highest level of education that one's parents received appears to heavily influence how students perform on the SAT.\nDid You Know...\nFirst-generation college students \u2014 students whose immediate family members do not have four-year degrees \u2014 make up more than 40% of all college students.\nImposter syndrome can be a common challenge for these students, but getting guidance from academic counselors or professors can help relieve some of that stress.\nIn addition, many schools provide resources, such as academic advising or scholarship opportunities specific to first-generation students. Check with your financial aid office or career center to see what your campus has to offer.\nAverage SAT Score by Family Income\nSAT performance also correlates with family income.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the SAT\nHow many times can you take the SAT?\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT.[8] The organization that administers the SAT, College Board, recommends that students take the test at least twice because many schools \"superscore\" your results. That means they combine your highest math score with your highest ERW score even if they are from different tests.Note Reference [8]\nIt's common for students to take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and another time in the fall of their senior year.\nWhat is the highest SAT score?\nThe math and ERW sections are each 800 points each, making the total possible score 1600.[9] As of January 2021, the optional SAT essay was discontinued, along with SAT subject tests.[10] Your two scores, one from math and one from ERW, make up your total SAT score.\nIs the SAT or ACT easier?\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways. For example, they are both approximately three hours long, and both tests cover reading and math. Some key differences include the number of questions (the ACT has 215 while the SAT has 154) and the scoring scale (the ACT is scored from 1-36 while the SAT is scored from 400-1600).\nAnother major difference is that the ACT has an additional science section that the SAT doesn't have.\nKeeping in mind these differences, you can decide which test is a better fit for you. You can also check the websites of prospective colleges and see if they state which test the majority of their accepted students took.\nReferences\nLatest News\nCampus-GPT: How 2 University of California Campuses Are Designing Their Own Specialized AI Tools\nEmployment of Recent Law School Graduates Hits 10-Year High\nIs Yield Protection Real?\nUNC Greensboro Provides Free Childcare for Student-Parents\nRelated Stories\nWhat Is a Good SAT Score?\nHow Much Does College Cost?

    "Document3": "What is a Good LSAT Score? 2024 Data\nAre you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results?\nIf so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What\u00a0is\u00a0a good LSAT score?\nThen you\u2019re in the right place.\nReady? Let\u2019s go!\nWhat is a good LSAT score in 2024?\u00a0\nBefore we get into scores, let\u2019s take a look at some of the statistics surrounding LSAT scores:\nLSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180.\nWith that big of a range, what kind of score should you aim for?\nRealistically, you should try to get a score of at least 150. That\u2019s the score that will get you into any accredited law school.\nBut if your dream school is among the best in America, you should aim higher.\nTo get into any of the top 25 law schools in America, you need to score at least 160.\nAnd if you want to attend a top 10 law school, you should try to score even higher \u2013 at least 170.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re taking the LSAT for the first time, you might be wondering how your score will compare to others.\u00a0\nKeep reading to find out.\u00a0\nWhat is the average LSAT score for first-time takers?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0Law School Admission Council\u00a0(LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151.\nOf course, if you\u2019re unhappy with your LSAT score, you can always\u00a0take it again.\nJust remember that you\u2019re limited to taking it three times in a single testing year (August to June) and five times in the past five years.\nIn total, you can take the LSAT seven times in your lifetime.\nBut is taking it again\u00a0really\u00a0worth it? Contrary to popular belief, doing so won\u2019t always help.\nRemember, first-time test takers score 151.\nPeople who take the LSAT for a second time score an average of 151.7, which is a slight increase.\nAnd while you might think that taking it for a third time would increase your score, that\u2019s not always true.\nIn fact, people who take the LSAT for a third time earn the lowest scores.\nThat\u2019s why I always tell my clients to really consider if retaking it is right for them. After all, your score isn\u2019t going to make or break your chances of acceptance, but we\u2019ll talk about that a bit later.\nLet\u2019s move on to the LSAT score you need to get accepted into your dream law school.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for law school?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0American Bar Association\u00a0(ABA), the median LSAT score of full-time first-year JD students in the fall of 2022 was 158.5.\u00a0\nThe 75th percentile score was 160.9, and the 25th percentile score was 154.8.\nThat\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t get into the program of your choice with a lower score. An LSAT score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program.\nYou just need to have the right kind of application.\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed the median LSAT score, let\u2019s move on to the highest scores.\nWhat is the highest LSAT score?\u00a0\nLSAT scores can range anywhere from 120 to 180.\nGetting a perfect 180 on the LSAT is practically unheard of. In fact, just 0.1% of test-takers have achieved it.\nA 170 is considered a great score, as it would mean you got at least 90 of the 101 questions on the test right.\u00a0\nDoing so would put you in the top 2-3% of test takers, meaning you would get into most law schools.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s discuss the kind of LSAT scores you would need to be accepted into the top 10 law schools in the country.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for the top 10 law schools?\u00a0\nIf you want to\u00a0attend one of the top 10 law schools in the country, you should aim for an LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the low, median, and high LSAT scores at each school.\nStanford University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nYale University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0175\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0178\nUniversity of Chicago\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (Carey)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0167\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nDuke University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0168\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0170\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0171\nHarvard University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0174\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nNew York University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0174\nColumbia University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Virginia\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nNorthwestern University (Pritzker)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0172\nAs you can see, each of these schools has a median LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nBut even with a lower score, you can still get in.\nKeep reading to learn how.\nHow important are LSAT scores for law school admissions?\nIt\u2019s true that a higher score will increase your chances of acceptance into the law school of your choice.\nTypically, a score that falls within the 150 range is considered average. While it will get you accepted into most law schools, it could make it difficult to stand out.\nA score of at least 160 is considered strong, and most law schools have median scores within this range. However, keep in mind that scholarships may require higher scores.\nLast but not least, a score of 170 or more puts you comfortably among the top 2-3% of test-takers and will certainly get the attention of some of the best law schools in the country.\nBut I want to let you in on a secret: Your admission doesn\u2019t hinge solely on your LSAT score.\nYour\u00a0undergraduate GPA\u00a0also plays a part in it.\nAccording to the ABA,\u00a0the average GPA among admitted law school students\u00a0is around 3.6. But just like LSAT scores, that average varies across schools.\nAmong students who get into top-tier law schools like the ones mentioned earlier, the average GPA is 3.8 or higher.\nWhile both your GPA and LSAT scores are important factors in determining how successful you would be as a law school student, schools tend to weigh the LSAT more heavily.\nBut even if you score a couple of points lower than the median LSAT score or GPA at your number one school of choice, don\u2019t let it keep you from applying.\nThe law school admission process is a holistic one, which means that they\u2019ll look at more than just your score.\nIt all comes down to being able to prove you have what it takes to succeed as a law student in your application. With the right strategy, application elements like your personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation will help you stand out.\nNow that we\u2019ve touched on average LSAT scores and the kind of scores needed for top schools, let\u2019s move on to the three different types of LSAT scores.\nHow does LSAT work?\u00a0\nWhen talking about LSAT scores, most people only talk about the numbers, like 150, 170, or 180.\nBut there are actually\u00a0three\u00a0types of LSAT scores you should be aware of.\nThe first is called the raw score. Your raw score reflects the number of questions you answered correctly on the test.\nFor instance, if an LSAT was made up of 100 questions and you got 85 correct, you would score an 85.\nThe second type of score is a scaled score, which is the kind of score you\u2019re probably most familiar with.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0the kind of score that reads 150, 170, or 180.\u00a0\nA scaled score is what you get when you convert your raw score into an LSAT score based on the Score Conversion Chart. In this chart, scores range from 120 to 180.\nFinally, there\u2019s a percentile score, which shows how well you tested compared to others who have taken the LSAT over the last three years.\u00a0\nNext steps\nThere you have it! Everything you need to know about what makes for a good LSAT score.\nDon\u2019t let the pressure of a high LSAT score keep you from trying.\nAfter all, even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right kind of application strategy.\nDon\u2019t believe me?\u00a0\nI\u2019ve worked with several students who have scored well beneath the median and still gone on to receive admission letters.\nIf you want to make sure you\u2019re a top candidate, sign up for my\u00a0on-demand workshop today.

    "Summarized_Document1": "All About SAT Scores: National Average and Full Statistics\n\nMore than 1.9 million high school students took the SAT in 2023, with the majority being juniors and seniors. In comparison, 1.4 million students took the ACT in the same year. Despite a growing number of colleges no longer requiring standardized test scores, the SAT remains a common standard, with score submissions being optional rather than completely abandoned.\n\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016. The SAT returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017. The percentage of high school students who took the SAT varied significantly by state, with 100% participation in the District of Columbia and 95% in Rhode Island, compared to only 1% in Mississippi and North Dakota.\n\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at top colleges can help set goals. College admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications, with standardized test scores being just one aspect. As of the 2023-2024 application cycle, over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free, representing almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions.\n\nThe Ivy League schools, known for their highly selective acceptance rates, have made standardized test scores optional. The data reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores. Other selective universities in the U.S. have average SAT scores comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\n\nSAT scores broken down by demographics show trends across race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income. A 2023 study by Harvard University found that Ivy-Plus colleges were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to those from low- or middle-income families with comparable test scores. This was primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\n\nMen have consistently outscored women on the SAT since 2017, with men scoring higher on the math section and women scoring higher on the ERW section. Those who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow margin. The highest level of parental education appears to heavily influence SAT performance, with first-generation college students making up more than 40% of all college students.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT. The College Board recommends taking the test at least twice, as many schools superscore results. The highest possible SAT score is 1600, with the math and ERW sections each worth 800 points. The optional SAT essay and subject tests were discontinued in January 2021.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways, but the ACT includes an additional science section. Deciding which test to take depends on individual strengths and the preferences of prospective colleges.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Students aiming for top engineering schools should be aware of the required GRE scores. Not all engineering programs require the GRE; for instance, some programs at Harvard and MIT do not. The GRE is beneficial for aspiring engineers as it is widely used for admissions. The math section is easier for those with a technical background, but the Verbal and Analytical Writing sections are more challenging. Quantitative scores are more critical for engineering admissions than verbal scores. However, verbal scores still impact the overall GRE score, which is important for top universities.For better chances of admission to top engineering programs, candidates should aim for a Quantitative score between 161-166. An 80th percentile score, according to ETS data for 2019-2020, is a verbal score of 158 and a quantitative score of 162. The average Quantitative score for the top ten engineering programs is 166, while for programs ranked 11 to 50, it is 164. Top engineering schools require Quantitative scores between 164-168.For Mechanical Engineering programs, students should aim for a Quantitative score of 165 and a Verbal score of 150. A GRE score above 320 with 161-166 in Quantitative Reasoning is considered good for engineering schools. A perfect score of 340 is excellent, but scores as low as 320 are still competitive.A good GRE Quantitative Reasoning score for engineering schools is above 161, with 170 being excellent. Similarly, a good Verbal Reasoning score is above 158, with 170 being excellent. GRE prep courses can help improve scores by providing targeted instruction and practice.In summary, for engineering program admissions, focus on achieving high Quantitative scores, but do not neglect the Verbal section. Aim for scores above 320 overall, with Quantitative scores between 161-166 for the best chances at top programs.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "Are you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results? If so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What is a good LSAT score? LSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180. Realistically, you should aim for at least 150 to get into any accredited law school. For top 25 law schools, aim for at least 160, and for top 10 law schools, aim for at least 170. According to the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151. If you\u2019re unhappy with your score, you can retake it, but note that scores typically don\u2019t improve significantly on subsequent attempts. The median LSAT score for full-time first-year JD students in fall 2022 was 158.5, with the 75th percentile at 160.9 and the 25th percentile at 154.8. A score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program. LSAT scores range from 120 to 180, with a perfect 180 being extremely rare (0.1% of test-takers). A score of 170 or higher is considered excellent and places you in the top 2-3% of test-takers. For the top 10 law schools, the median LSAT scores are as follows: Stanford University (173), Yale University (175), University of Chicago (173), University of Pennsylvania (172), Duke University (170), Harvard University (174), New York University (172), Columbia University (173), University of Virginia (171), and Northwestern University (171). LSAT scores are important for law school admissions, but your undergraduate GPA also plays a significant role. The average GPA among admitted law school students is around 3.6, with top-tier schools averaging 3.8 or higher. The LSAT has three types of scores: raw score (number of correct answers), scaled score (converted from raw score, ranging from 120 to 180), and percentile score (compared to other test-takers over the last three years). Even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right application strategy, including a strong personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation.",

The C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health asked a national sample of parents of children in middle and high school about participation in school activities.\nParents reported that over 80% of their middle and high school-age children would participate in at least one type of school activity for the 2018-19 school year, including 52% in sports, 43% in arts activities, and 51% clubs/other activities. Nearly half (46%) of middle and high school-age children were expected to participate in more than one type of school activity.\nRequired school participation fees averaged $161 for sports, $86 for arts, and $46 for clubs/other activities. For sports, 18% of students had school participation fees of $200 or more, compared to 12% for arts and 5% for clubs/other activities; there was little difference between middle and high school fees. In contrast, more students had a participation fee of $0 for arts (64%) or clubs (66%) compared to sports (46%). When combining participation fees with other expenses such as equipment and travel, the total cost averaged $408 for sports, $251 for arts, and $126 for clubs/other activities.\nNearly 3 in 10 parents (29%) said the cost of school activities is higher than they expected. Ten percent of parents felt the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost, including three times as many lower-income parents (18% less than $50,000 vs 6% more than $100,000). Only 7% of parents had ever requested a waiver or scholarship for participation fees; 19% said they didn\u2019t know how, and 5% were not comfortable making such a request.\nParents reported that 18% of their middle and high school-age children would not participate in any school activities in 2018-19. Non-participation was higher among boys than girls (21% vs 15%), and for students from lower-income households (25% less than $50,000 vs 12% over $100,000). Reasons for non-participation cited more often for boys were cost, transportation, and having a job; not being interested in activities was cited more often for girls. Non-participation was three times higher for children of parents who said the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost, and nearly twice as high for children of parents who said the cost of school activities is more than they expected.\nHighlights\nImplications\nSchool activities offer an array of benefits to middle and high school students: opportunities to explore different interests, make new friends, hone an existing skill or talent, and develop leadership and teamwork skills. Participation in school activities is linked to higher educational achievement.\nParticipation in school activities is widespread. According to parents responding to this Mott Poll, over 80% of their middle or high school students are participating in a school activity for the 2018-19 school year. These activities range from exploratory options like intramurals sports or afterschool clubs, to higher-intensity options like varsity sports, competition arts groups, or student council.\nMany school activities have a fee to participate, and those fees can be a barrier to participation. Most schools strive to offer a range of activities, including some with no fees; in addition, many schools provide scholarships or waivers to assist students with fees. Despite these efforts, elevated rates of non-participation among lower-income students continues to be a problem, as noted in our earlier reports from 2012, 2015, and 2016.\nIn this Mott Poll, 1 in 6 students (18%) at both the middle and high school level are not participating in any school activities for the 2018-19 school year. The income gap persists, as students from households earning less than $100,000 have twice the level of non-participation as their peers from wealthier households.\nTwo key parent attitudes that may explain some of the discrepancy. Nearly 3 in 10 parents (29%) said the cost of school extracurricular activities is higher than they expected, and 10% of parents said the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost. The children of parents who express either of these attitudes are less likely to participate in school activities.\nParents concerned about cost may not be aware of no-cost activities or knowledgeable about fee waivers. Only 7% of parents who responded to this Mott Poll had ever requested a waiver or scholarship for participation fees. In contrast, nearly one quarter of parents were \u201cmissed opportunities\u201d for assistance: those who didn\u2019t know about waivers (19%) and those who were not comfortable requesting one (5%). School officials can address the ongoing problem of non-participation by informing students and parents about no-cost activities, as well as waivers and scholarship options, and by emphasizing the benefits of school activities to parents who may be hesitant.\nThis Mott Poll also highlights the continuing trend of sports being more expensive than other types of school activities. The average participation fee was substantially higher for sports than for arts or clubs, as was the total cost of participation, with little difference between middle and high school costs. Also concerning are trends over time. A previous report for the 2015-16 school year found an average sports participation fee of $139; that average fee increased to $161 in this current Mott Poll Report, while the average fees for arts and clubs did not increase. The same pattern occurs for total costs. Moreover, no-cost options continue to be less common for sports than for arts and clubs.\nThe higher costs of sports, compared to other activities, may be contributing to the higher level of non-participation among boys. Boys have slightly greater participation in sports activities overall compared to girls (53% vs 49%), and more boys than girls participate in sports only (21% vs 10%). Thus, the disproportionately higher cost of sports may be more likely to impact boys.\nData Source & Methods\nThis report presents findings from a nationally representative household survey conducted exclusively by GfK Custom Research, LLC (GfK), for C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital. The survey was administered in October 2018 to a randomly selected, stratified group of parents age 18 and older (n=2,007). Adults were selected from GfK\u2019s web-enabled KnowledgePanel\u00ae that closely resembles the U.S. population. The sample was subsequently weighted to reflect population figures from the Census Bureau. The survey completion rate was 60% among panel members contacted to participate. This report is based on responses from 961 parents who reported on 1,323 children in middle or high school. The margin of error is \u00b11 to 6 percentage points.\nFindings from the C.S.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Pay-to-participate: Impact on school activities\n\nSchool extracurricular activities boost educational achievement and personal development, but participation barriers exist. The C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health surveyed parents of middle and high school students about participation in school activities.\n\nParents reported that over 80% of their children would participate in at least one school activity for the 2018-19 school year: 52% in sports, 43% in arts, and 51% in clubs/other activities. Nearly half (46%) were expected to participate in more than one type of activity.\n\nRequired school participation fees averaged $161 for sports, $86 for arts, and $46 for clubs/other activities. For sports, 18% of students had fees of $200 or more, compared to 12% for arts and 5% for clubs. More students had a participation fee of $0 for arts (64%) or clubs (66%) compared to sports (46%). Total costs, including equipment and travel, averaged $408 for sports, $251 for arts, and $126 for clubs.\n\nNearly 3 in 10 parents (29%) said the cost of school activities is higher than expected. Ten percent felt the benefits are not worth the cost, with lower-income parents (18% less than $50,000 vs 6% more than $100,000) more likely to feel this way. Only 7% of parents had requested a waiver or scholarship; 19% didn\u2019t know how, and 5% were uncomfortable making such a request.\n\nParents reported that 18% of their children would not participate in any school activities in 2018-19. Non-participation was higher among boys (21% vs 15%) and lower-income students (25% less than $50,000 vs 12% over $100,000). Reasons for non-participation included cost, transportation, and having a job for boys, and lack of interest for girls. Non-participation was higher for children of parents who felt the benefits are not worth the cost or that the cost is higher than expected.\n\nSchool activities offer benefits such as exploring interests, making friends, and developing skills. Participation is linked to higher educational achievement. Over 80% of students participate in activities, ranging from intramural sports to varsity sports and student council.\n\nMany activities have fees, which can be a barrier. Schools offer no-fee activities and provide scholarships or waivers, but non-participation among lower-income students remains a problem. In this poll, 18% of students are not participating, with lower-income students having twice the non-participation rate of wealthier peers.\n\nParents\u2019 attitudes about cost impact participation. Nearly 3 in 10 parents said costs are higher than expected, and 10% said benefits are not worth the cost. Children of these parents are less likely to participate. Only 7% of parents requested waivers, while nearly a quarter missed opportunities for assistance.\n\nSports are more expensive than other activities, with higher participation fees and total costs. The average sports fee increased from $139 in 2015-16 to $161 in this poll, while fees for arts and clubs did not increase. No-cost options are less common for sports.\n\nHigher sports costs may contribute to higher non-participation among boys, who participate in sports more than girls (53% vs 49%) and are more likely to participate in sports only (21% vs 10%).\n\nThis report is based on a nationally representative survey conducted by GfK Custom Research for C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital in October 2018. The survey included 2,007 parents, with responses from 961 parents about 1,323 children in middle or high school. The margin of error is \u00b11 to 6 percentage points.\n\nFindings do not represent the opinions of the University of Michigan. The University of Michigan reserves all rights over this material.",

High efficiency is crucial to achieve a desirable driving range while using a limited amount of energy in batteries. Basically, you can make a fast EV or one with great range, but if it's bad at efficiency, you won't see the benefits you want.\u00a0\nIn today's post, we'll take a look at a list of EPA energy consumption results\u2014Combined, City and Highway\u2014for U.S.-market battery-electric vehicles. The EPA results are not perfect, but they remain the only common measure for all EVs on the market.\nThere are more than 300 individual EV configurations on sale, including different battery sizes, ranges, powertrain setups, and wheels\u2014all of which directly affect energy consumption. We collected numbers for about 200 configurations, for which data were available\u2014listed directly by EPA, or by the manufacturers. (There is an asterisk in such cases, just like when we applied numbers from the previous model year of an EV.)\nNo Tesla Models For 2024, Yet\nUpdate March 1, 2024: We should note that at the moment, this\u00a0chart is lacking some of the popular models\u2014including the Tesla lineup\u2014because they unfortunately are not yet listed on the EPA website. We will include them in the future.\nHistorically, Tesla models have been rated as highly efficient, boasting\u00a0276 Wh/mi (172 Wh/km) for the Model Y Long Range AWD. We expect them to be very competitive when the data comes in.\nWe've included models that are currently available for order or reservation, some upcoming models, and a few that have been discontinued but may still be found on dealer lots as reference points.\nThe Stats\nThe EPA provides fuel economy numbers in MPGe (miles per gallon equivalent), assuming that one gallon of gasoline is 33.7 kWh of energy. This unit was created to have a kind of comparison to the MPG rating, used for internal combustion engine cars. It basically measures the equivalent amount of energy consumed when compared to a gasoline vehicle.\nHowever, because EVs are using electricity, it's better to operate using Wh or kWh as a metric. That's simply because the battery stores a certain number of kWh of energy. (The MPGe metric has been criticized for not being easy to understand or very relevant.)\u00a0\nIn our charts, we used the EPA Combined energy consumption numbers in miles per kilowatt-hour (mi/kWh), as well as in watt-hours per mile (Wh/mi). Both have white color text. Additionally, we also have Wh/mi numbers for EPA City (green) and EPA Highway (yellow.)\nWhile the mi/kWh metric might be more intuitive for some reasons, the Wh/mi is also handy and allows to quickly calculate the amount of energy, the vehicle will use during a month or a year, when assuming a certain mileage. For example, a vehicle with 300 Wh/mi energy consumption needs 3,000 kWh per 10,000 miles.\nA very important thing to note is that all the EPA figures include the charging losses, usually at least several percent of the total amount.\nAccording to the data, the average energy consumption for the 200 EVs listed below is 2.6 mi/kWh (381 Wh/mi). The highway numbers are over 5% worse, while the city numbers are some 4.5% better. About half of all vehicle configurations sits between 2.5-3.3 mi/kWh (300-400 Wh/mi).\nBest Energy Consumption EVs\n2024 Hyundai Ioniq 6\n2024 Lucid Air Pure RWD\nThe Hyundai Ioniq 6 (SE trim) with rear-wheel drive, a 77.4-kilowatt-hour battery and 18-inch wheels has the best EPA Combined energy consumption number of 140 MPGe or 4.2 mi/kWh (241 Wh/mi), including charging losses. One of the key elements to achieve such a high result is outstanding aerodynamics and a high-voltage battery system (697 volts nominal).\nThe second best is the Lucid Air Pure, rear-wheel drive with 19-inch wheels. It has a rating of 137 MPGe or 4.1 mi/kWh (246 Wh/mi). It's worth noting that the Lucid Air is the most efficient car on the market in the EPA Highway category (251 Wh/mi compared to 265 Wh/mi in the case of the Hyundai Ioniq 6). This is also a tremendous achievement considering the size, weight, battery capacity, range and performance of Lucid Air cars.\nOne of the biggest surprises is that the third model on the list is the new entry-level Lexus RZ 300e. According to the manufacturer, it is good for 125 MPGe or 3.7 mi/kWh (270 Wh/mi).\nHigh in the ranking are also some versions of the BMW i4 (eDrive35), the discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EV/Bolt EUV duo, Toyota bZ4X, Kia EV6, Hyundai Kona Electric, Polestar 2 (Long Range Single Motor), Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia Niro EV, Volkswagen ID.4 and Tesla Model 3 (the latest version is not yet listed by the EPA).\nRoughly about 10% of the best EV configurations gets results better than 300 Wh/mi (more than 3.3 mi/kWh).\nWorst Energy Consumption EVs\nOn the other end of the spectrum, we usually can find large and heavy electric vehicles with multi-motor powertrains. They consume up to about three times more energy than the most efficient electric cars, according to EPA.\nThe worst result belongs to the Lordstown Endurance pickup, which was rated just before the company went bankrupt. With just 48 MPGe or 1.4 mi/kWh (702 Wh/mi), the vehicle sits at the bottom of the list.\nThe GMC Hummer EV Pickup and GMC Hummer EV SUV (20 battery module version) are also electron guzzlers with 50-53 MPGe, depending on the wheels/tires (Mud-Terrain MT or All-Terrain AT). The results are as low as 1.5 mi/kWh or 674 Wh/mi, and goes up to 749 Wh/mi to an absolute worst result in EPA Highway category. However, considering the size, weight and performance, this EV is still tremendously more efficient than an ICE counterpart.\nThere are GMC Hummer EV Pickups with 24 battery modules. As we understand, they are too heavy to qualify for EPA energy consumption tests (a heavy-duty pickup category). Their results potentially are even worse than the mentioned 20BM versions.\nAmong the EVs with the highest energy consumption, we can also see the quad-motor Rivians, some Chevrolet Silverado EV and Ford F-150 Lightning, and the sporty Audi SQ8 e-tron.\nLordstown Endurance\nGMC Hummer EV Pickup\nEV Energy Consumption Chart\nThe chart below helps us to better illustrate the difference between the models (according to EPA methodology), and the difference between the city and highway driving for a particular model.\nIt's just a general comparison and the only consistent one we have for the entire market. In some cases, the results might be different than real-world tests\u2014especially the Audi e-tron GT/Porsche Taycan family, which generally have better real-world results than their EPA tests indicate.\nThis chart was last updated Feb. 21, 2024. It will be updated as the year goes on.\u00a0\nClick here to see an expanded version of this chart.\n*Values according to the manufacturer or estimated (borrowed from the previous model year)\nInfo and exceptions:\nSee also\nTrending\nlatest articles\nlatest articles\nAbout this article\n",

    "Document3": "The longest-range plug-in hybrids\nLike the idea of a plug-in hybrid car, but want to spend as much time as possible on electric power? Here are the top 10 models with the longest electric ranges...\nIf you need a car to help minimise your fuel costs, a plug-in hybrid\u00a0(PHEV) can make a lot of sense. That\u2019s because they essentially offer the best of both worlds;\u00a0combining a combustion engine with an\u00a0electric motor and a battery to give you the option of running on electric power\u00a0for\u00a0short\u00a0journeys, and the engine on longer ones.\nSo, if you regularly cover a 30-mile round trip to work or to drop your kids off at school, for example, a PHEV could be the ideal choice for you. A PHEV can also be a good option if you're a company car driver, because\u00a0their often\u00a0low official CO2 emissions\u00a0result in low benefit-in-kind (BIK) ratings.\nSo,\u00a0which plug-in hybrids have the longest\u00a0electric-only ranges? Here, we name\u00a0the top 10 cars,\u00a0and reveal\u00a0how much you can save on each with our\u00a0Target Price\u00a0deal and\u00a0free\u00a0New Car Deals\u00a0service. In each case, we've used the official WLTP electric-only ranges of each model, although we have also revealed real-world range figures where appropriate.\nIf you want to know which car has the longest official electric-only range, that would be the Range Rover Sport P460e and Mercedes GLC 300e \u2013 both cars have identical official range figures. However, if neither of those cars are to your taste, there are plenty of other cars on this list that aren't too far behind them.\u00a0\nRange Rover Sport\nOur pick: 3.0 D300 Dynamic SE 5dr Auto\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0P460e Dynamic SE\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a392,980\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a390,425 | Electric-only range\u00a075 miles\nThe silence offered by electric motor in the Range Rover Sport P460e makes it one of the most refined plug-in hybrids out there. Not only that, but the enormous\u00a0official electric-only range of 75 miles means you can maximise the serenity more than you can in the BMW X5 xDrive50e, which can manage 62 miles.\u00a0\nHaving said that, a range of around 50 miles is more likely in the real world, although that's still longer than what you get officially in\u00a0the Lexus RX 450h+ (43 miles). When\u00a0the 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine does eventually kick\u00a0in, it's incredibly quiet and smooth, and you'll hardly even notice it.\nOf course, being a Range Rover, the interior is as beautiful to look at as it is to touch, while the seats are comfortable and supportive. You also feel slightly more hunkered down in the Sport compared with its bigger Range Rover brother, thanks to the raised centre console.\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Range Rover Sport review\nMercedes GLC\nOur pick: GLC 220d 4Matic AMG Line 5dr 9G-Tronic\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0GLC 300e AMG Line\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a363,210\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a361,210 | Electric-only range\u00a075 miles\nAll versions of the latest GLC offer a comfortable ride and an interior that's filled\u00a0with tech, but the GLC 300e\u00a0also gives you one of\u00a0the longest official ranges of any plug-in hybrid. At 75 miles, its range is\u00a0almost double that of its closest competitor, the Lexus NX 450h+.\nHaving tested those two cars\u00a0back-to-back in the real-world, we found the GLC managed a healthy 57 miles before running out of charge in our real world test. The NX, by comparison, managed 30 miles in the same conditions (versus 43 miles officially).\nPerformance is\u00a0respectable\u00a0in the GLC 300e, with\u00a00-62mph taking\u00a06.4sec. However, the petrol engine is rather grumbly when it fires up, and you do feel the extra weight of the battery in the corners\u00a0compared with non-PHEV versions.\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Mercedes GLC review\nRange Rover\nOur pick: 3.0 D300 SE 4dr Auto\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0P460e\u00a0SE\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a3115,585\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a3115,585 | Electric-only range\u00a074 miles\nThe Range Rover takes luxury to the next level, with its commanding driving position, effortless\u00a0performance\u00a0and\u00a0super-soft\u00a0ride making it the ultimate long-distance cruiser.\nLike the Range Rover Sport, the P460e plug-in hybrid version\u00a0is a great option if you want to do big miles on electric-only power, with it only travelling\u00a0one less mile officially between charges than its sibling. Despite that, it can still travel much farther than\u00a0the\u00a0Bentley Bentayga PHEV (28 miles).\nWhere the Range Rover wins back some points compared with the Sport\u00a0is with the long-wheelbase version, because it's available with\u00a0seven seats (the Sport isn't). So, if you want a seven-seater PHEV that does big miles on electricity, then the Range Rover is a great option. You will have to exchange a big sum of cash\u00a0for it, though.\u00a0\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Range Rover\u00a0review\nMercedes C-Class\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0C300e AMG Line Premium\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a355,025\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a353,025 | Electric-only range\u00a066 miles\nThe Mercedes C-Class C300e has the longest official electric-only range of any PHEV\u00a0executive car, with a figure that's significantly longer\u00a0than that of its closest rival, the BMW 3 Series 33oe (37 miles).\nHowever, it's not just the\u00a0electric range that appeals, because the C-Class is one of the more comfortable executive cars. That's helped by the fact that the C300e gets rear air suspension as standard (to help cope with the extra weight of the battery), which does a\u00a0good job of keeping the car level over bumpy roads. It's a similar story with non-PHEV versions, which are also very comfortable.\nEven though the interior quality isn't as good as what you'll find in\u00a0the 3 Series, the design is slick and the infotainment system is relatively easy to use. It's just a shame there are minimal physical controls for operating certain functions, such as the climate controls.\u00a0\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Mercedes C-Class review\nMercedes E-Class\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion E300e AMG Line Premium\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a370,900\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a370,900 | Electric-only range\u00a065\u00a0miles\nIt may be an expensive option, but the Mercedes E-Class E300e is a brilliant\u00a0PHEV executive car. That's helped by the fact that it's well appointed and spacious inside, which makes\u00a0it a great option for carrying passengers.\nThe hybrid system itself is also very impressive.\u00a0It has a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder petrol\u00a0engine and\u00a0an electric motor\u00a0that generates a combined output of 328bhp (making it the quickest\u00a0E-Class available), while the\u00a025.4kWh (usable) battery delivers an official range of 65 miles. While this is big battery pays dividends when it comes to range, the downside\u00a0is\u00a0that it\u00a0eats into boot space, with only 370 litres of capacity as opposed to 540 litres with the mild hybrid models.\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Mercedes E-Class review\nMercedes C-Class Estate\nOur pick: C220d AMG Line 5dr 9G-Tronic\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion C300e AMG Line Premium Plus |\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a360,585\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a360,585 | Electric-only range\u00a064\u00a0miles\nThe Mercedes C-Class Estate C300e\u00a0has the longest official electric-only range of any PHEV estate car.\u00a0This is partly thanks to its large\u00a025.4kWh (usable) battery, which it shares with the saloon. As a result, it can travel farther than the Mercedes E-Class Estate E300e, BMW 330e Touring and Audi A6 Avant TFSIe.\u00a0\nWhile the\u00a0AMG Line Premium Plus trim is\u00a0pricey (it's\u00a0the only trim level available\u00a0with the\u00a0C300e), it does give you all the kit you could ever need, including\u00a0three-zone climate control, a panoramic sunroof, a\u00a0Burmester sound system and a head-up display. The interior is smart to look at and\u00a0filled\u00a0with the latest tech, too.\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Mercedes C-Class Estate review\nMercedes E-Class Estate\nOur pick: E300e AMG Line Premium 5dr 9G-Tronic [Pan Roof]\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion E300e AMG Line Premium |\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a373,150\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a373,150 | Electric-only range\u00a063\u00a0miles\nThe Mercedes E-Class Estate E300e shares its hybrid system with the E-Class saloon, and as a result it has an equally long\u00a0electric-only range, making it a brilliant option if you want a company car with a big boot. That said, the\u00a0location of the battery beneath the boot floor means the loading area\u00a0is higher than on non-PHEV versions, cutting capacity to 460 litres. However, this is similar to\u00a0rivals.\nPerhaps the best thing about the E300e, though, is the\u00a0ride. Like all the regular versions, it comes with\u00a0air suspension on the rear axle, helping keep the back end well\u00a0controlled over bumps\u00a0\u2013 even when you\u2019re carrying\u00a0a boot full of luggage.

With a 0-62mph time of just 5.2 seconds, it's properly quick, although the acceleration isn\u2019t as\u00a0sprightly in electric mode. That said,\u00a0there's plenty of oomph for rush-hour traffic and\u00a0reaching motorway speeds.\nSpeaking of motorways, the\u00a0S-Class's ride\u00a0is exemplary at high speeds, and the air suspension\u00a0irons out dips and crests exceptionally well.

    "Document1": "2024 U.S. Electric Cars Listed From Lowest To Highest Energy Consumption\n The Hyundai Ioniq 6, Lucid Air and Lexus RZ are your energy consumption champions. \nOutstanding energy consumption numbers are one of the key features of electric vehicles. High efficiency is crucial to achieve a desirable driving range while using a limited amount of energy in batteries. Basically, you can make a fast EV or one with great range, but if it's bad at efficiency, you won't see the benefits you want.\u00a0\nIn today's post, we'll take a look at a list of EPA energy consumption results\u2014Combined, City and Highway\u2014for U.S.-market battery-electric vehicles. The EPA results are not perfect, but they remain the only common measure for all EVs on the market.\nThere are more than 300 individual EV configurations on sale, including different battery sizes, ranges, powertrain setups, and wheels\u2014all of which directly affect energy consumption. We collected numbers for about 200 configurations, for which data were available\u2014listed directly by EPA, or by the manufacturers. (There is an asterisk in such cases, just like when we applied numbers from the previous model year of an EV.)\nNo Tesla Models For 2024, Yet\nUpdate March 1, 2024: We should note that at the moment, this\u00a0chart is lacking some of the popular models\u2014including the Tesla lineup\u2014because they unfortunately are not yet listed on the EPA website. We will include them in the future.\nHistorically, Tesla models have been rated as highly efficient, boasting\u00a0276 Wh/mi (172 Wh/km) for the Model Y Long Range AWD. We expect them to be very competitive when the data comes in.\nWe've included models that are currently available for order or reservation, some upcoming models, and a few that have been discontinued but may still be found on dealer lots as reference points.\nThe Stats\nThe EPA provides fuel economy numbers in MPGe (miles per gallon equivalent), assuming that one gallon of gasoline is 33.7 kWh of energy. This unit was created to have a kind of comparison to the MPG rating, used for internal combustion engine cars. It basically measures the equivalent amount of energy consumed when compared to a gasoline vehicle.\nHowever, because EVs are using electricity, it's better to operate using Wh or kWh as a metric. That's simply because the battery stores a certain number of kWh of energy. (The MPGe metric has been criticized for not being easy to understand or very relevant.)\u00a0\nIn our charts, we used the EPA Combined energy consumption numbers in miles per kilowatt-hour (mi/kWh), as well as in watt-hours per mile (Wh/mi). Both have white color text. Additionally, we also have Wh/mi numbers for EPA City (green) and EPA Highway (yellow.)\nWhile the mi/kWh metric might be more intuitive for some reasons, the Wh/mi is also handy and allows to quickly calculate the amount of energy, the vehicle will use during a month or a year, when assuming a certain mileage. For example, a vehicle with 300 Wh/mi energy consumption needs 3,000 kWh per 10,000 miles.\nA very important thing to note is that all the EPA figures include the charging losses, usually at least several percent of the total amount.\nAccording to the data, the average energy consumption for the 200 EVs listed below is 2.6 mi/kWh (381 Wh/mi). The highway numbers are over 5% worse, while the city numbers are some 4.5% better. About half of all vehicle configurations sits between 2.5-3.3 mi/kWh (300-400 Wh/mi).\nBest Energy Consumption EVs\n2024 Hyundai Ioniq 6\n2024 Lucid Air Pure RWD\nThe Hyundai Ioniq 6 (SE trim) with rear-wheel drive, a 77.4-kilowatt-hour battery and 18-inch wheels has the best EPA Combined energy consumption number of 140 MPGe or 4.2 mi/kWh (241 Wh/mi), including charging losses. One of the key elements to achieve such a high result is outstanding aerodynamics and a high-voltage battery system (697 volts nominal).\nThe second best is the Lucid Air Pure, rear-wheel drive with 19-inch wheels. It has a rating of 137 MPGe or 4.1 mi/kWh (246 Wh/mi). It's worth noting that the Lucid Air is the most efficient car on the market in the EPA Highway category (251 Wh/mi compared to 265 Wh/mi in the case of the Hyundai Ioniq 6). This is also a tremendous achievement considering the size, weight, battery capacity, range and performance of Lucid Air cars.\nOne of the biggest surprises is that the third model on the list is the new entry-level Lexus RZ 300e. According to the manufacturer, it is good for 125 MPGe or 3.7 mi/kWh (270 Wh/mi).\nHigh in the ranking are also some versions of the BMW i4 (eDrive35), the discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EV/Bolt EUV duo, Toyota bZ4X, Kia EV6, Hyundai Kona Electric, Polestar 2 (Long Range Single Motor), Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia Niro EV, Volkswagen ID.4 and Tesla Model 3 (the latest version is not yet listed by the EPA).\nRoughly about 10% of the best EV configurations gets results better than 300 Wh/mi (more than 3.3 mi/kWh).\nWorst Energy Consumption EVs\nOn the other end of the spectrum, we usually can find large and heavy electric vehicles with multi-motor powertrains. They consume up to about three times more energy than the most efficient electric cars, according to EPA.\nThe worst result belongs to the Lordstown Endurance pickup, which was rated just before the company went bankrupt. With just 48 MPGe or 1.4 mi/kWh (702 Wh/mi), the vehicle sits at the bottom of the list.\nThe GMC Hummer EV Pickup and GMC Hummer EV SUV (20 battery module version) are also electron guzzlers with 50-53 MPGe, depending on the wheels/tires (Mud-Terrain MT or All-Terrain AT). The results are as low as 1.5 mi/kWh or 674 Wh/mi, and goes up to 749 Wh/mi to an absolute worst result in EPA Highway category. However, considering the size, weight and performance, this EV is still tremendously more efficient than an ICE counterpart.\nThere are GMC Hummer EV Pickups with 24 battery modules. As we understand, they are too heavy to qualify for EPA energy consumption tests (a heavy-duty pickup category).

    "Document2": "The longest-range plug-in hybrids\nLike the idea of a plug-in hybrid car, but want to spend as much time as possible on electric power? Here are the top 10 models with the longest electric ranges...\nIf you need a car to help minimise your fuel costs, a plug-in hybrid\u00a0(PHEV) can make a lot of sense. That\u2019s because they essentially offer the best of both worlds;\u00a0combining a combustion engine with an\u00a0electric motor and a battery to give you the option of running on electric power\u00a0for\u00a0short\u00a0journeys, and the engine on longer ones.\nSo, if you regularly cover a 30-mile round trip to work or to drop your kids off at school, for example, a PHEV could be the ideal choice for you. A PHEV can also be a good option if you're a company car driver, because\u00a0their often\u00a0low official CO2 emissions\u00a0result in low benefit-in-kind (BIK) ratings.\nSo,\u00a0which plug-in hybrids have the longest\u00a0electric-only ranges? Here, we name\u00a0the top 10 cars,\u00a0and reveal\u00a0how much you can save on each with our\u00a0Target Price\u00a0deal and\u00a0free\u00a0New Car Deals\u00a0service. In each case, we've used the official WLTP electric-only ranges of each model, although we have also revealed real-world range figures where appropriate.\nIf you want to know which car has the longest official electric-only range, that would be the Range Rover Sport P460e and Mercedes GLC 300e \u2013 both cars have identical official range figures. However, if neither of those cars are to your taste, there are plenty of other cars on this list that aren't too far behind them.\u00a0\nRange Rover Sport\nOur pick: 3.0 D300 Dynamic SE 5dr Auto\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0P460e Dynamic SE\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a392,980\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a390,425 | Electric-only range\u00a075 miles\nThe silence offered by electric motor in the Range Rover Sport P460e makes it one of the most refined plug-in hybrids out there. Not only that, but the enormous\u00a0official electric-only range of 75 miles means you can maximise the serenity more than you can in the BMW X5 xDrive50e, which can manage 62 miles.\u00a0\nHaving said that, a range of around 50 miles is more likely in the real world, although that's still longer than what you get officially in\u00a0the Lexus RX 450h+ (43 miles). When\u00a0the 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine does eventually kick\u00a0in, it's incredibly quiet and smooth, and you'll hardly even notice it.\nOf course, being a Range Rover, the interior is as beautiful to look at as it is to touch, while the seats are comfortable and supportive. You also feel slightly more hunkered down in the Sport compared with its bigger Range Rover brother, thanks to the raised centre console.\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Range Rover Sport review\nMercedes GLC\nOur pick: GLC 220d 4Matic AMG Line 5dr 9G-Tronic\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0GLC 300e AMG Line\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a363,210\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a361,210 | Electric-only range\u00a075 miles\nAll versions of the latest GLC offer a comfortable ride and an interior that's filled\u00a0with tech, but the GLC 300e\u00a0also gives you one of\u00a0the longest official ranges of any plug-in hybrid. At 75 miles, its range is\u00a0almost double that of its closest competitor, the Lexus NX 450h+.\nHaving tested those two cars\u00a0back-to-back in the real-world, we found the GLC managed a healthy 57 miles before running out of charge in our real world test. The NX, by comparison, managed 30 miles in the same conditions (versus 43 miles officially).\nPerformance is\u00a0respectable\u00a0in the GLC 300e, with\u00a00-62mph taking\u00a06.4sec. However, the petrol engine is rather grumbly when it fires up, and you do feel the extra weight of the battery in the corners\u00a0compared with non-PHEV versions.\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Mercedes GLC review\nRange Rover\nOur pick: 3.0 D300 SE 4dr Auto\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0P460e\u00a0SE\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a3115,585\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a3115,585 | Electric-only range\u00a074 miles\nThe Range Rover takes luxury to the next level, with its commanding driving position, effortless\u00a0performance\u00a0and\u00a0super-soft\u00a0ride making it the ultimate long-distance cruiser.\nLike the Range Rover Sport, the P460e plug-in hybrid version\u00a0is a great option if you want to do big miles on electric-only power, with it only travelling\u00a0one less mile officially between charges than its sibling. Despite that, it can still travel much farther than\u00a0the\u00a0Bentley Bentayga PHEV (28 miles).\nWhere the Range Rover wins back some points compared with the Sport\u00a0is with the long-wheelbase version, because it's available with\u00a0seven seats (the Sport isn't). So, if you want a seven-seater PHEV that does big miles on electricity, then the Range Rover is a great option. You will have to exchange a big sum of cash\u00a0for it, though.\u00a0\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Range Rover\u00a0review\nMercedes C-Class\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion\u00a0C300e AMG Line Premium\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a355,025\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a353,025 | Electric-only range\u00a066 miles\nThe Mercedes C-Class C300e has the longest official electric-only range of any PHEV\u00a0executive car, with a figure that's significantly longer\u00a0than that of its closest rival, the BMW 3 Series 33oe (37 miles).\nHowever, it's not just the\u00a0electric range that appeals, because the C-Class is one of the more comfortable executive cars. That's helped by the fact that the C300e gets rear air suspension as standard (to help cope with the extra weight of the battery), which does a\u00a0good job of keeping the car level over bumpy roads. It's a similar story with non-PHEV versions, which are also very comfortable.\nEven though the interior quality isn't as good as what you'll find in\u00a0the 3 Series, the design is slick and the infotainment system is relatively easy to use. It's just a shame there are minimal physical controls for operating certain functions, such as the climate controls.\u00a0\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Mercedes C-Class review\nMercedes E-Class\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion E300e AMG Line Premium\u00a0|\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a370,900\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a370,900 | Electric-only range\u00a065\u00a0miles\nIt may be an expensive option, but the Mercedes E-Class E300e is a brilliant\u00a0PHEV executive car. That's helped by the fact that it's well appointed and spacious inside, which makes\u00a0it a great option for carrying passengers.\nThe hybrid system itself is also very impressive.\u00a0It has a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder petrol\u00a0engine and\u00a0an electric motor\u00a0that generates a combined output of 328bhp (making it the quickest\u00a0E-Class available), while the\u00a025.4kWh (usable) battery delivers an official range of 65 miles. While this is big battery pays dividends when it comes to range, the downside\u00a0is\u00a0that it\u00a0eats into boot space, with only 370 litres of capacity as opposed to 540 litres with the mild hybrid models.\nRead our in-depth\u00a0Mercedes E-Class review\nMercedes C-Class Estate\nOur pick: C220d AMG Line 5dr 9G-Tronic\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nVersion C300e AMG Line Premium Plus |\u00a0List price\u00a0\u00a360,585\u00a0|\u00a0Target Price\u00a0\u00a360,585 | Electric-only range\u00a064\u00a0miles\nThe Mercedes C-Class Estate C300e\u00a0has the longest official electric-only range of any PHEV estate car.\u00a0This is partly thanks to its large\u00a025.4kWh (usable) battery, which it shares with the saloon. As a result, it can travel farther than the Mercedes E-Class Estate E300e, BMW 330e Touring and Audi A6 Avant TFSIe.\u00a0\nWhile the\u00a0AMG Line Premium Plus trim is\u00a0pricey (it's\u00a0the only trim level available\u00a0with the\u00a0C300e), it does give you all the kit you could ever need, including\u00a0three-zone climate control, a panoramic sunroof, a\u00a0Burmester sound system and a head-up display.

That said, the\u00a0location of the battery beneath the boot floor means the loading area\u00a0is higher than on non-PHEV versions, cutting capacity to 460 litres. However, this is similar to\u00a0rivals.\nPerhaps the best thing about the E300e, though, is the\u00a0ride. Like all the regular versions, it comes with\u00a0air suspension on the rear axle, helping keep the back end well\u00a0controlled over bumps\u00a0\u2013 even when you\u2019re carrying\u00a0a boot full of luggage.

With a 0-62mph time of just 5.2 seconds, it's properly quick, although the acceleration isn\u2019t as\u00a0sprightly in electric mode. That said,\u00a0there's plenty of oomph for rush-hour traffic and\u00a0reaching motorway speeds.\nSpeaking of motorways, the\u00a0S-Class's ride\u00a0is exemplary at high speeds, and the air suspension\u00a0irons out dips and crests exceptionally well.

That's more than the Audi A6 TFSIe\u00a0(34 miles), but less than\u00a0the Mercedes E-Class E300e (65 miles).\nIf you want more power, there's also the 550e version. It gets a 3.0-litre petrol engine and a boost in performance (0-62mph takes 4.3sec as opposed to 6.3sec), but it can't travel quite as far as the 530e on electric-only power\u00a0(55 miles).

Average fuel economy for light-duty vehicles has improved from approximately 13.1 miles per gallon (mpg) in 1975 to 25.3 mpg in 2021, with dramatic initial gains, a 17-year decline, and since 2005 significant though slowing improvement again. During this period, passenger cars experienced impressive growth in horsepower. The second chart shows the improvement in real-world miles per gallon of several different light duty vehicle types.\nThe Biden administration has begun to make up for stalled progress by putting in place new fuel standards that will require carmakers to achieve average fuel efficiencies of 49 miles per gallon. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has taken an even more aggressive route, requiring all vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.\n47\nInternational Fuel Economy Standards and Targets\nSource: ICCT (2022)\nThe U.S. has set aggressive new the fuel economy standards. In 2022, it has only the second most stringent standards, after Brazil. other countries are further along in strengthening fuel economy targets for their own fleets. By 2025, U.S. fuel standards fall behind China and New Zealand. The European Union is considering net-zero fuel standards by 2035, the strongest of any other country. Their regulations will likely have important impacts for U.S. competitiveness in the auto market, as well as for U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and energy use overall.\n48\nMedium and Heavy-Duty Modes\nSource: EIA (2022), Annual Energy Outlook 2022\nSource: EPA (2022)\nSource: AFDC (2020), Average Fuel Economy by Vehicle\u00a0\nWhile a small percentage of vehicles, medium and heavy-duty vehicles make up a significant part of pollution impacts relative to other highway transportation modes. In particular, the heavy truck segment was responsible for approximately one-quarter of total energy consumption and the carbon dioxide emissions for all highway transportation in 2021, in spite of the fact that it was only responsible for 9% of the vehicle miles traveled. Additionally, the vehicle miles traveled by this segment are projected to increase by more than 30% by 2050.3\nAdvances in fuel economy, utilizing alternative freight modes like rail and waterways, alternative fuels in highly efficient engines (such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas \u2013 a prime example of redirecting energy waste to productive energy use with a wide variety of applications),4 and streamlining logistics will likely be important to keep this segment energy-productive, and reduce local particulate, NOx, and carbon emissions.\n49\nLight-Duty Electric Vehicles\nChart credit: Atlas (2022), EV Hub\nElectric vehicles (EVs) in the light duty segment (which include battery-electric, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell electric vehicles) present significant efficiency gains over conventional vehicles, with battery-electric cars estimated to be twice as efficient as a conventional car on a well-to-wheel basis.5 The U.S. market for these vehicles has grown quickly in the last decade, driven in part by Zero-Emission Vehicle mandates in select states, and federal and state tax credits. In the first two quarters of\u00a0 2022, the annual U.S. sales of EVs have already exceeded total sales in 2015 by more than a factor of four, to 430,000, primarily due to battery-electric vehicle growth. The U.S. currently has an estimated 1.5 million electric vehicles, and there are 84 different makes and models of plug-in hybrid and battery-electric vehicles on the U.S. market as of September 2022.6, 7\n50\nEV Transit\nSource: Calstart (2021)\nThe adoption of full-size, zero-emissions transit buses grew by 27% between 2020 and 2021 in the U.S. California has the largest number of zero-emissions transit buses (1,371) and has passed regulation that transit buses must be zero-emission by 2030. Nationally, the number of zero-energy buses is expected to increase as a result of new funding through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\nBattery-electric buses make up the large majority of zero-emissions transit buses in the country today, likely due to their cost, charging infrastructure requirements, and other operational considerations. Fuel cell adoption is also expected to increase as these buses perform better on longer routes and transit agencies are increasingly considering these buses for longer routes.8\n51\nEV Charging Infrastructure\nSource: DOE (2022), Alternative Fuels Data Center\nSource: DOE (2022), Alternative Fuels Data Center\nEVs require wide availability of EV-charging infrastructure to mitigate the market barrier caused by range anxiety.9 The number of charging stations available in the U.S. has grown dramatically in the last 10 years, expanding in number and geographical coverage. As of September 2022, there were 36,213 publicly available charging stations that were Level-2 or Direct Current Fast Charge (DCFC) stations, which are capable of charging most vehicles in 20 to 30 minutes. This is an over 200% increase in chargers relative to 2019, when it was estimated that roughly 10,000 of these charging stations were installed nationwide.10\n52\nVehicle Miles Traveled\nSource: DOT (2019), Travel Monitoring\nSince 1970, Americans have nearly tripled the number of vehicle miles traveled by cars and trucks. Though COVID led to a dramatic decrease in vehicle miles traveled in 2020, the U.S. is already on track to exceed its 2019 levels. More driving leads to traffic congestion, resulting in increased energy waste, air pollution, time waste, and costly infrastructure degradation.\n53\nUtilization Of Transportation Modes\nSource: ORNL (2022), Transportation Energy Data Book 40, Table 2.13\nEfficiency in the transportation sector is related to the efficiency of the vehicles, but also to the load factor, which reflects vehicle occupancy. These factors can be combined to consider the passenger miles per gallon of gasoline (pmpG), which quantifies the efficiency of moving one person one mile at a given vehicle fuel economy and vehicle occupancy. On a pmpG basis, rail options tend to be the most efficient travel modes (80-140 pmpG), but domestic flights, which exhibit the lowest fuel economy (0.45 pmpgG) appear relatively efficient per passenger due to a high load factor (averaging 120 passengers per flight) \u2014 a reflection of airlines\u2019 efforts to ensure planes fly full. In contrast, transit buses currently exhibit lower pmpG (26) than cars (43) due to lower average levels of national bus ridership. However, during high ridership periods, transit bus pmpG is estimated to be over four times higher (137).11 This illustrates the value of increasing not only fuel economy, but the utilization of such modes.\n54\nTransit Equity Metrics\nClean, Efficient Transportation for Low-Income Communities Scores (out of 6 possible points)\nSource: ACEEE (2021) City Scorecard\nCreating a broad low-carbon transportation system is an essential part of reducing transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), localized pollution, creating livable communities, and ensuring that our transportation system serves everyone.12\nAs cities have sprawled and jobs have moved away from urban cores, many low-income communities have become geographically isolated and inadequately served by affordable, efficient transportation. These communities\u2019 transportation options are often limited to automobiles and unreliable public transport services. Expenditures for vehicles, including the cost of fuel, insurance, and maintenance, can be large and unpredictable for these households. Cities can use a number of policy levers to increase access to mobility options other than personal vehicles in low-income communities, such as low-income housing near transit, low-income access to high-quality transit, and subsidized access to efficient transportation options.13\n\u00a0\nFootnotes\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright 2022\n",

    "Summarized_Document3": "Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards have significantly improved the miles per gallon (mpg) of new passenger cars by over 90% since 1975. Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which account for 9% of total vehicle miles traveled, use about 25% of all highway energy. Their vehicle miles traveled are expected to increase by more than 30% by 2050. Electric vehicle (EV) sales have more than doubled since 2019, with the U.S. now having an estimated 1.5 million EVs on the road. The number of vehicle miles traveled has tripled since 1970, leading to increased traffic congestion, consumer costs, and air pollution. The efficiency of transportation modes depends on both fuel economy and vehicle utilization. Transportation accounts for 27% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and 67% of U.S. oil use. The Biden administration has set new fuel standards requiring carmakers to achieve average fuel efficiencies of 49 mpg. California aims for all vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emissions by 2035. Medium and heavy-duty vehicles, despite being a small percentage of vehicles, contribute significantly to pollution. Advances in fuel economy, alternative fuels, and logistics are crucial for this segment. Light-duty EVs, including battery-electric, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell electric vehicles, are significantly more efficient than conventional vehicles. The U.S. market for these vehicles has grown rapidly, driven by mandates and tax credits. The adoption of zero-emissions transit buses grew by 27% between 2020 and 2021, with California leading in numbers. Battery-electric buses are the majority, but fuel cell adoption is expected to increase. The number of EV charging stations in the U.S. has grown dramatically, with over 36,213 publicly available charging stations as of September 2022. Since 1970, vehicle miles traveled by cars and trucks have nearly tripled, leading to increased energy waste and pollution. Efficiency in transportation also depends on vehicle occupancy, with rail options being the most efficient. Transit buses have lower efficiency due to lower ridership but can be highly efficient during peak times. Creating a low-carbon transportation system is essential for reducing emissions and ensuring equitable access to transportation, especially for low-income communities.",

    "Document1": "Sustainability and the Steel City: Modernization at Pittsburgh International Airport\nA rendering of the view future travelers will see when they approach the new terminal. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nFlying is essential for work, vacation or visiting loved ones. The industry also is necessary to ship goods overseas quickly. However, it\u2019s not known for being environmentally friendly. One airport is seeking to change that.\nAviation contributes 3.5 percent of effective radiative forcing (which measures energy imbalance), 2.5 percent of carbon emissions and 1.9 percent of all greenhouse gas output. So there\u2019s a strong push to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel, starting at the airport.\nPittsburgh\u2019s Terminal Modernization\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s Terminal Modernization Program is a $1.4 billion project to create a new consolidated terminal that modernizes outdated former hub facilities, better serves passengers, fuels the region\u2019s future development, stabilizes long-term costs for airlines and evokes the essence of Pittsburgh. The new multi-modal complex will feature a new garage that nearly triples the amount of covered parking.\nThe PIT Terminal Modernization Program (TMP) was built upon these five principles that represent fundamental purposes driving the transformation:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0Stabilize\u00a0airline costs\n2.\u00a0 Be\u00a0Pittsburgh\u2019s airport\n3.\u00a0 Be environmentally\u00a0sustainable\n4.\u00a0\u00a0Enhance the experience\u00a0for all customers\n5.\u00a0 Provide\u00a0value\u00a0to our\u00a0community\n\u00a0\nCranes install steel beams as part of the terminal modernization program.(triblive.com)\n1. Airport Modernization\nThe new terminal will be between the C and D airside gate concourses, eliminating the need for the people mover train. The new facility will cater to passengers flying directly to and from Pittsburgh (origin and destination traffic) as opposed to the existing facility which was largely built as a hub facility focused on connecting traffic.\n2. Improved Experience\nThe layout should make navigating the airport quicker and easier. It will slash passengers\u2019 time from curbside to airside in half. Aesthetic improvements will enhance everyone\u2019s experience, and new outdoor terraces (pre- and post-security) will make it easier for travelers to relax before boarding their flight.\n3. Increased Area Value\nAirports raise the value of the area around them by encouraging economic growth and adding convenience for potential new residents. The terminal modernization brings more than 14,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities to the region. Currently, about 550 construction workers are onsite daily, and that number will increase to 1,000 daily workers in summer 2023.\n4. Stabilized Airline Costs\nAirport efficiency can impact the costs of airlines. The expansion will allow airlines to better process and load luggage as well as welcome passengers. It also lowers long-term O&M costs.\n5. More Sustainable Terminal\nConstruction practices for the new terminal comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Environmental Program Declaration (EPD) credit for their materials while also working to reduce emissions, water, energy and waste. Officials are targeting a minimum of LEED Silver certification for the facility.\nVendors are strongly encouraged to present products and services that comply with verified third-party certification criteria or reporting standards. The airport also urges them to source their products or materials regionally to decrease the impact on the environment and human health compared to similar vendors in other locations.\nAdvantus Engineers is collaborating with other teams and implementing sustainable practices such as water and energy efficiency, using sustainable materials, managing waste, employing electric transportation methods, and promoting healthy indoor environments.\nAdditionally, the airport is recycling and reusing construction waste, including 86,000 tons of crushed concrete for new airport roads.\nThe 2030 Challenge\nPart of constructing the new terminal is moving the airport closer to achieving the 2030 Challenge, an environmental initiative to go carbon-neutral by that year.\nThe suggested plan by Architecture 2030 is to decrease 90 percent of carbon emissions by 2025 and be 100 percent carbon neutral by 2030. New buildings, renovations and additions throughout the new terminal will have energy-consumption performance standards.\nA Timeline for Construction 2021\nApril:\u00a0Officials added safe driving lanes and barricades between concourses C and D. Saw-cutting began on the ramp to remove slabs.\nMay:\u00a0To prepare for the new terminal\u2019s foundation, 300,000 square feet of material were removed.\nJune:\u00a0An impact roller broke up large concrete sections to crush into smaller aggregate for reuse in new roadways.\nJuly:\u00a0Construction teams modified an underground fuel line for future use.\nAugust and September:\u00a0Team members began installation of electrical lines, construction trailers and underground utility work. Geotechnical borings for probe holes and test piles began for terminal foundation work.\nOctober:\u00a0A groundbreaking ceremony began heavy construction.\nNovember and December:\u00a0Foundation support drilling started after test borings. Mass excavation began and utility line work continued. About 85,000 tons of concrete was removed and crushed for new roads.\n2022\nJanuary: Team members\u00a0almost complete the auger cast piles and finish about 25 percent of the structural caissons. Approximately 400 cubic yards of concrete were used for foundation pile caps.\nFebruary:\u00a0Drilling operations continued for more than half of the caissons, and auger piles were nearly completed. More than half the cubic yards of concrete for pile caps were placed, and more than 75 percent of structural steel came onto the fabrication site.\nMarch:\u00a0Installation of the first steel beams and girders. Members positioned and embedded plate girders while work was finished on terminal caissons.\nApril:\u00a0Pile cap and grade beam installation continued. Terminal bridge foundations laid, and road modifications began.\nMay:\u00a0Three-quarters of the pole caps installation was completed. Rebar for underground foundations and the front bridge terminal foundations were installed.\nJune:\u00a0Crews continued to install rebar and lifted steel beams over the train tunnel.\nJuly:\u00a0More than half of the grade beam content and 25 of the 27 embedded plate girders were installed.\nAugust and September:\u00a0Vertical construction began, and crews completed foundation roadwork. Critical construction activities continued, with foundation and concrete work progressing. Workers installed decking, steel and detailing.\nOctober:\u00a0Backfill and excavation continued, and corridor walls were demolished. Bridge piers for elevated highways were installed.\nNovember:\u00a0Completed all structural slabs, and rebar installation continued.\nDecember:\u00a0Team members placed geoform, and tub girders arrived. The first elevated deck slab concrete was installed.\n2023\nAll foundation work was completed on the site of the new terminal at the end of January. There were multiple concrete pours, and more than half of the mechanically stabilized earth walls now are in place.\nEmbracing Pittsburgh\u2019s History\nPittsburgh\u2019s industrial nickname comes from the rise of the steel industry after the Civil War. Increased demand for armament and iron boosted the local economy. Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie introduced the Bessemer steelmaking process, which brought him from obscurity to fame.\nCarnegie began producing steel in 1875. Meanwhile, Henry Clay Frick, the grandson of whiskey distillers, made his riches operating beehive cooking ovens that could turn coal into coke\u2014an essential steelmaking ingredient. Frick later partnered with Carnegie to form Carnegie Steel Co. and, in 1901, they merged multiple companies into the United States Steel Corp.\nBefore they reached their final success, however, a dispute between Carnegie Steel and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers put a dark cloud over the area\u2019s steel production. It led to the Battle of Homestead, an armed conflict that killed 12 people. This event paved the way for modern labor practices and worker-protection laws.\nThrough the mid-1950s, Pittsburgh thrived as America\u2019s eighth-largest city and produced half of the country\u2019s steel. European immigration through Ellis Island led to a population increase of more than 500,000 individuals. The city\u2019s diversity still exists in its various neighborhoods.\nThings changed for Pittsburgh in the 1970s and 1980s when steel production slowed to a stop, and the city had to reinvent itself to survive. It\u2019s now known for technology, energy, medicine, education, research, arts, sports and advanced manufacturing. Its National Football League team, the Steelers, pays tribute to its past in the steel industry. This new terminal aims to do the same. The new terminal at PIT invokes the essence of Pittsburgh through its design focused on Nature, Technology and Community\u2014dubbed NaTeCo by the design team.\nThe terminal modernization progam will pay tribute to the city\u2019s history through art and construction. Steel tree columns are a featured part of the new terminal, creating a nostalgic and stylistic design. Their brownish color is meant to invoke importance of nature in Western Pennsylvania. All of the steel in the new terminal, procured throughout the United States, is being fabricated just 10 miles away from the airport in Ambridge, Pa.\n\n\n(Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nThe Airport Authority also recruited artists Patrick Marold and Adam Kuby to create an exhibition honoring the steel industry through sculptures and other design elements. Other artisans contribute to the terminal through PIT\u2019s Art in the Airport initiative.\nSustainability in the Steel City\nThroughout the years, Pittsburgh made strides to create a healthier, more-sustainable city. From 2015-2020, the Department of City Planning released a yearly \u201cState of Sustainability\u201d report that examined ongoing efforts to reduce waste and minimize the use of nonrenewable resources.\nNonprofit organization Sustainable Pittsburgh advocates and educates individuals and groups through various initiatives such as recognizing corporations that make efforts toward decarbonization.\nUniversities in the city also are embracing measures to create a greener city. The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University and Point Park University each have their own sustainability programs to encourage research and on-campus responsibility.\nThe terminal modernization project is another major step toward creating a Pittsburgh that lives in harmony with its environment.\nTime for an Update\nAllegheny County Airport was the first airport in the region, opening in 1931, and at the time was one of the largest and most advanced terminals of its time. The Greater Pittsburgh Airport opened in 1952, becoming the region\u2019s primary commercial airport. (Allegheny County Airport continues to operate today as a robust general aviation airport with more than 60,000 operations annually.)\nThat terminal existed until 1992, when officials opened the more modern Pittsburgh International Airport, built and designed as a hub for US Airways. US Airways pulled its hub status in 2004, leaving Pittsburgh with a facility built for another time and a different purpose. The airport today offers nonstop service to more than 60 nonstop destinations on 16 airlines, including international service to London Heathrow on British Airways as well service to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.\nBoth Pittsburgh International Airport and Allegheny County Airport are operated under the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which has experienced several changes through the years, with the new terminal project being the largest.\nOfficials announced the new terminal in 2017, but construction was put on hold in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project resumed in 2021 and is now making consistent progress. The groundbreaking happened in October 2021, making it the first U.S. terminal built from the ground up after the pandemic.\nTravelers will get the opportunity to enjoy fresh air and greenery while they await their flights. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nManaging Construction\nACAA selected the architecture and engineering teams of Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects to lead work on the project. This collaboration ensures international best practices are met without sacrificing local characteristics.\nGensler is headquartered in San Francisco but has multiple Pennsylvania offices and designed the PNC tower downtown. The firm also has airport experience with Incheon Airport. HDR is headquartered in Omaha, Neb., but has an office in Pittsburgh. It replaced the Greenfield Bridge and renovated the Honolulu Airport.\nLuis Vidal completed terminal projects for Heathrow, Madrid-Barajas and other airports.\nBlue Sky News/Pittsburgh International Airport\nTaking in Local Concerns\nThe Allegheny County Airport Authority engaged the community and airlines to determine the best course of action for the terminal project. The terminal modernization has a program advisory group and a best practice group with experts in sustainability, accessibility, passenger experience, technology, health, culture and arts. These members represent constituencies, share their expertise and ensure the authority uses best practices in the new terminal design.\nFeedback was gathered through community and stakeholder meetings, interviews, surveys and the feedback section of the program\u2019s website,\u00a0PITtransformed.com.\nAlthough there are concerns with any project, Pittsburgh\u2019s local \u201cyinzers\u201d are known for being open to sustainable initiatives and creating socioeconomic changes that positively impact the environment, preserving it for future generations. These efforts are known internationally, with the United Nations Foundation recognizing the city as an example of America\u2019s growing sustainability movement.\nManaging the TPM Budget\nWith a high cost comes the need for strict budget management, and the program management team keeps spending under control. No local tax dollars are involved, and most of the construction is funded through long-term bonds, essentially borrowing money and then paying off that debt as part of its yearly operating budget. Paying for the project comes from airport revenues, including airline fees, parking and rental fees, passenger facility charges, terminal concessions revenues, and natural gas revenue.\nNatural Construction and Energy\nLarge windows will produce abundant natural light in the new terminal, minimizing the need for external lighting sources. Outside these windows are expansive outdoor terraces featuring local flora. Using local plants reduces the need for excess water and electricity.\nPlanting local trees, flowers and bushes enables visitors to learn and appreciate native plants, especially when the airport might be the only part of Pennsylvania some travelers see. They also cut carbon emissions by eliminating the need to transport outside flora.\nThe terrace will have chairs for passengers to relax as well as open spaces for kids and pets to run around before getting on their flights.\nOne of the largest changes to the terminal is the private microgrid with nearly 10,000 solar panels and five natural-gas generators. These energy sources will power the new terminal, cutting the airport\u2019s carbon footprint and creating a more-sustainable environment. The microgrid is already up and running, powering the existing facility since June 2021. This is significant for the 2030 goal, as construction and demolition projects generate approximately 569 million tons of waste annually.\nThis is advantageous for passengers and airlines, providing a power source when electricity goes out as well as decreasing flight delays. In addition to being more resilient, the microgrid saves PIT more than $1 million annually in utility costs and saves more than 6 million pounds of carbon emissions annually.\nLeading the Way for Sustainability\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s terminal modernization project is the first post-pandemic terminal built from the ground up and holds great promise. Sustainability has always been top of mind, but the ability to continue working toward the 2030 goal after a significant delay shows a commitment to creating a more eco-friendly airport. During the construction delay, PIT designers took that time to incorporate additional public health measures into the project.\nOfficials hope projects can look toward PIT as an example that sustainability, economic growth, customer satisfaction and local pride can exist in the same place.\u00a0\nAbout Rose Morrison\nRose Morrison is a freelance writer with a passion for sustainable building and innovative construction technologies; email: [email\u00a0protected].\nSubscribe\nSubscribe now to receive our FREE print publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nProject of the Week\n\nFort McHenry Tunnel\nClick here for details and to submit your project!\nCurrent Issue\n\n4th Annual Sustainable Engineering Issue 2024\nPopular Tags\nTwitter Feed\nLocation\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\nRequest More Information From Sponsor\n\n\u0394\n",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nEnergy Indicators\nMarch 13, 2024\nCoal power usage continues to decline in Texas. Solar power  will be roughly half of all new electric-generation additions in both Texas and  the U.S. in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Weatherization  over the last couple of years has significantly improved grid stability in  Texas. Global electric vehicle (EV) sales grew in 2023, with China accounting  for over half of those sales. In the U.S., the West Coast dominated EV  purchases last year. Finally, global CO2 emissions rose in 2023,  largely driven by coal use in China and India.\u00a0 \nElectrical demand\nCoal power down; wind power up \nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas\u2019 (ERCOT) net power  generation rose from 429 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2022 to 444 TWh in 2023 (Chart  1). Among lower-carbon  power sources, generation from nuclear plants has been hovering around 40  TWh since 2007, while wind and solar output rose by 99 TWh during the same time  frame. Utility-scale solar generation swelled to 32 TWh in 2023 from zero in  2015.\n\nNatural gas made up 47 percent of the 290 TWh of thermal  generation (coal, natural gas and nuclear) in 2007; coal was 39 percent. In  2023, natural gas provided 66 percent of the 303 TWh of thermal power, and coal  was 20 percent. \nSolar power capacity growth to outpace other sources\nAbout half of new U.S. planned grid additions will come from  solar power in 2024, according to the EIA (Chart 2). A total of 55.8 gigawatts  (GW) of name-plate generation capacity will be added in 2024, including 26.4 GW  of solar (47 percent), 13.4 GW of wind (24 percent) and 8.2 GW of battery  storage (15 percent). Solar will see more than half of its new capacity in  three states: Texas, California and Florida.\n\nNatural gas\u00ad will add 7.5 GW (13 percent of new generation  capacity) to the grid. This will be the lowest new natural gas capacity in 25  years. In addition, 4.7 GW of coal and natural gas capacity is expected to be  retired nationwide in 2024.\nHowever, due to the intermittent nature of renewables like  wind and solar and variations in demand for thermal power over the course of  the day and year, total output potential from these sources will be much less  than the total capacity. In 2023, installed utility-scale solar capacity was  690 TWh, while generation was only 162 TWh. The ratio of the two\u2014the capacity  factor\u2014was 23 percent in 2023 and 34 percent for wind. The average capacity  factor for natural gas was 41 percent.\nHalf of Texas\u2019 new generation capacity in 2024 will be  solar, matching that of the U.S.\u2019 Already a global leader in wind-power  production, wind will only make up 10 percent of the state\u2019s additions versus  24 percent nationally. Texas will also see the addition of 3.5 GW of natural-gas-fired  turbines, nearly half that of the nation. Most of these gas plants are peakers\u2014turbines  optimized to flex up and down when demand spikes or when output from other  sources like intermittent renewables or less reliable older coal and gas plants  (1.7 GW of which are slated for retirement this year) is unable to meet demand.\nFor the first time, Texas is also recruiting a material volume  of battery storage capacity to join peaker plants in balancing the Texas grid. Over  one-third of all U.S. utility-scale battery storage installations this year  will be in Texas, adding 3 GW of dispatchable power to the state. Combined with  new gas-fired units and other efforts to ensure sufficient capacity during severe  weather conditions, this should help mitigate some of the state\u2019s recent challenges  regarding grid stability.\nThermal outages less severe in recent winter blast\nDuring the most recent winter storm in Texas, Winter Storm  Heather, thermal outages were only 4.3 GW when temperatures hit their coldest  on Jan. 15, compared with 7.1 GW on Dec. 23, 2022, the previous Texas cold  front, Winter Storm Elliot (Chart 3). Thermal outages are forced  resource outages at gas, coal and nuclear power plants for unexpected  malfunctions or quick repairs and maintenance.\n\nThe lower outages were due in part to changes made by the state  legislature after the catastrophic Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. Measures  that helped included requiring weatherization of power generation facilities,  ensuring power was prioritized for critical energy infrastructure like oil and  natural gas field operations and pipelines, and enhanced communication between  different Texas agencies. \nBattery Electric Vehicles (BEV)\nElectric car sales growing\nOne increasing source of electrical demand is electric  vehicles. Global EV sales increased from 10.3 million in 2022 to 13.6 million  in 2023, a 32 percent increase (Chart 4). The U.S. saw the largest  percent increase (60 percent), increasing from 1 million to 1.6 million cars  sold. \n\nOn a monthly basis though, EV sales were down 70 percent  from January to December 2023, reflecting subsidy cuts in Germany and France  and lower demand in China. Germany announced the termination of its BEV subsidy  of up to $4,878 to help mitigate the nation\u2019s budget deficit. The French  government cut a subsidy for purchasing EV and hybrid vehicles for higher-income  buyers by 20 percent. \nMarket penetration has been more limited in the U.S. versus Europe and China. In 2023, 25 percent of all cars sold in China were EVs, 22 percent were in the European Union and 9 percent were in the U.S. In the first six months of 2023, the average retail EV price in China was $33,000, while in the U.S. it was $72,000. In Europe, the average price of an EV is similar to that in the U.S. at $71,000, but EV buyers in Europe enjoy many benefits such as lower registration taxes, exemptions from tolls and congestion charges, and subsidies for home-charging installation.\nWest Coast leads U.S. in EV sales \nDuring the first three quarters of 2023, 26 percent of all  vehicle sales in California were EVs, while only 1 percent of sales in North  Dakota were (Chart 5). Texas\u2019 sales came in at 6 percent of the market,  3 percent below the national average. Washington saw the greatest increase in  EV market share year over year, with a 7.6 percent increase in September 2023.  Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia increased their EV market share  by 2 percent or more from third quarter 2022 to third quarter 2023. \n\nGlobal emissions\nIn 2023, a net decline in global CO2 emissions  from combustion of 411 metric tons in the U.S. and European Union was offset by  an increase of 736 metric tons in China and India (Chart 6). In advanced  economies, emissions fell by 4.5 percent, driven by growth in renewables and  increases in energy-efficiency measures. \n\nQuestions can be addressed to Kenya Schott at kenya.schott@dal.frb.org.

Low-income households in Ohio could save on average 47% on home energy bills when they upgrade their energy efficiency. Ohio Households will get support for these types of upgrades to the tune of $249 million through DOE\u2019s Home Energy Rebate programs. The Inflation Reduction Act will help more families never pay at the pump again, with tax credits for eligible buyers and eligible vehicles of up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used electric vehicles \u2013 saving families an average of $950 a year on fuel and maintenance costs.\u25a0 For more information, visit: energy.gov/statefacts January 2024",
    "Summarized_Document1": "Sustainability and the Steel City: Modernization at Pittsburgh International Airport\n\nFlying is essential for work, vacation, or visiting loved ones, but the aviation industry is not known for being environmentally friendly. Pittsburgh International Airport is seeking to change that with its Terminal Modernization Program (TMP), a $1.4 billion project aimed at creating a new consolidated terminal that modernizes outdated facilities, better serves passengers, fuels regional development, stabilizes long-term costs for airlines, and evokes the essence of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe TMP is built on five principles: stabilizing airline costs, being Pittsburgh\u2019s airport, being environmentally sustainable, enhancing the customer experience, and providing value to the community. The new terminal will be located between the C and D airside gate concourses, eliminating the need for the people mover train. It will cater to passengers flying directly to and from Pittsburgh, making navigation quicker and easier, and reducing the time from curbside to airside by half.\n\nThe modernization project is expected to bring over 14,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities to the region. Currently, about 550 construction workers are onsite daily, with that number expected to increase to 1,000 daily workers in summer 2023. The construction practices comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards, targeting a minimum of LEED Silver certification. The airport is also recycling and reusing construction waste, including 86,000 tons of crushed concrete for new airport roads.\n\nThe 2030 Challenge aims for the airport to be carbon-neutral by 2030, with a 90% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025. The new terminal will have energy-consumption performance standards. The construction timeline includes significant milestones from 2021 to 2023, with foundation work completed by January 2023.\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s history as a steel city is honored in the new terminal\u2019s design, featuring steel tree columns and other elements that evoke the city\u2019s industrial past. The steel used in the terminal is fabricated locally in Ambridge, PA. The airport also recruited artists to create an exhibition honoring the steel industry.\n\nPittsburgh has made strides in sustainability, with various initiatives and programs from the Department of City Planning, Sustainable Pittsburgh, and local universities. The terminal modernization project is another step toward a more sustainable city.\n\nThe new terminal will feature large windows for natural light, outdoor terraces with local flora, and a private microgrid with nearly 10,000 solar panels and five natural-gas generators. This microgrid, operational since June 2021, powers the existing facility and will power the new terminal, saving over $1 million annually in utility costs and reducing carbon emissions by over 6 million pounds annually.\n\nThe project is funded through long-term bonds, airport revenues, and other sources, with no local tax dollars involved. The architecture and engineering teams of Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects are leading the project, ensuring international best practices while maintaining local characteristics.\n\nThe Allegheny County Airport Authority engaged the community and airlines to determine the best course of action for the terminal project, incorporating feedback from various stakeholders. The project aims to be an example of how sustainability, economic growth, customer satisfaction, and local pride can coexist.\n\nRose Morrison is a freelance writer with a passion for sustainable building and innovative construction technologies.",

For decades, the industry has been an important contributor to Europe\u2019s economic growth, innovation, and prosperity, accounting for almost 7 percent of the region\u2019s GDP and being directly or indirectly responsible for employing almost 14 million people.1\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, European Commission, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d ACEA, September 1, 2022; 25 actions for a successful restart of the EU\u2019s automotive sector, CLEPA, May 2020. The industry also carries significant symbolic weight; taglines such as \u201cMade in Germany,\u201d \u201cItalian car design,\u201d \u201cEuro NCAP for Saver Cars,\u201d and \u201cBritish racing\u201d have come to stand for European innovation and craftsmanship.\nHowever, the status quo is being challenged and the industry faces massive ongoing transformations, such as the shift from internal combustion engines to electrified powertrains and a shift in focus from hardware to differentiation through software. This dynamic has allowed new entrants in Europe and abroad\u2014especially in China, the largest automotive market in the world2\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d China - Country Commercial Guide, International Trade Administration, updated April 7, 2023.\u2014to disrupt the market and win market share. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports for the first time, with exports of about 3.0 million vehicles, in contrast to Germany\u2019s 2.6 million.3\u201cWhat if Germany stopped making cars?,\u201d Economist, July 31, 2023. These transformative forces overlap with a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, including rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. All of these factors have greatly affected the European auto industry and make navigating the sector\u2019s transformation challenging. A prosperous future for the European automotive industry will therefore depend on how well and quickly it responds and how European stakeholders can shape the necessary conditions for future success. The need for action is urgent.\nTo that end, we have sketched a road map that covers seven areas. Executing on this plan will require action from a variety of industry stakeholders. Speedy action from automotive companies will be important, but the regional ecosystem, including the public sector and multiple adjacent sectors, will need to participate in shaping a level playing field and a fertile environment for the future of the European automotive industry.\nA multidecade success story\nThe European automotive industry has been an engine powering prosperity and growth, employment, and innovation and has contributed to Europe\u2019s image and perception on the global stage (Exhibit 1).\nAn economic powerhouse for the region, the automotive industry contributed about 10 percent of Europe\u2019s exports in 2022.425 actions for a successful restart, May 2020; \u201cEuropean Union exports by category,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023. The sector\u2019s more than 17,300 companies form a network of OEMs and suppliers of all tiers.5\u201cImpact of electromobility on the European automotive industry,\u201d HitHorizons, February 21, 2022. Significantly, the industry directly or indirectly employs more than 6 percent of the region\u2019s workforce,6\u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d September 1, 2022. creating positive spillover effects outside the sector.\nThe automotive industry has also been a nexus of innovation. Technical champions and small and medium-size businesses within the ecosystem have continuously innovated, especially in the areas of combustion engine powertrain, chassis, safety systems, and exterior and interior design. Indeed, about 30 percent of global automotive patents originated from European countries, the most of any region.7McKinsey analysis based on data about automotive industry global patents from IPlytics and Innography by Clarivate, accessed June 12, 2023. Significant investments into research and development have helped European automakers introduce new technologies that have contributed to major advances in sustainability and safety by improving fuel economies and reducing emissions, noise, and accidents.\nProgress and investment in the European auto industry over the past several decades have contributed to Europe\u2019s global image. German engineering is widely touted,8Dave Taylor, \u201cWho owns the idea of German engineering among German car brands?,\u201d Taylor Brand Group, April 8, 2013. and our research suggests many European automakers are considered front-runners in sustainability, with some of the most ambitious targets around electric vehicles (EVs), decarbonization, and safety.\nThanks in part to this work, the brand value of the ten largest European auto companies is conservatively estimated at a combined \u20ac200 billion; five of the ten most valuable car brands worldwide are European.9\u201cLargest automakers by market capitalization,\u201d CompaniesMarketcap.com, accessed August 15, 2023; brand value analysis based on 2023 data on European automotive companies from Brand Finance, accessed June 20, 2023; Alex Haigh, \u201c2022 Automotive industry trends: Doubling down on electric and connected cars,\u201d Brand Finance, February 22, 2022. The grand challenge now is to maintain and build on these assets in the face of profound and accelerating change.\nDisruption and transformation\nThe historic strengths and recently reported record margins of European OEMs may create a false sense of safety for the industry. Accelerated disruptions around electrification, software, and new competitive pressures loom.\nSubstantial market disruptions have been observed in other industries, with serious outcomes. For instance, European manufacturers lost more than 90 percent of their share of the smartphone market in just six years.10\u201cGlobal market share held by Nokia smartphones from 1st quarter 2007 to 2nd quarter 2013,\u201d Statista Research Department, July 25, 2013. McKinsey analysis shows that leading players in the film camera industry lost similar market share over nine years.\nMarket share data suggest that European OEMs\u2019 leadership position is being challenged as new entrants, especially from China, gain traction. Our analysis also suggests that European market conditions for local development and production are becoming less competitive. Analysis from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility shows that since 2019, European incumbents have lost six percentage points of market share in their home market and five percentage points in China. Meanwhile, Chinese OEMs are gaining ground in both China and Europe, reaching 45 percent market share in their home market in 2022 and octupling their market share in Europe between 2020 and 2022.11McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. This dynamic is even more apparent in battery electric vehicles (BEVs): new EV-focused entrants hold 51 percent of the global BEV market (Exhibit 2).12McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. Besides market share, European OEMs also face the challenge of running profitable BEV businesses.\nA more detailed look at different segments offers a more nuanced picture of the industry. In the premium segment\u2014home turf for many European OEMs\u2014European OEMs still hold 71 percent of global sales. But this segment is also becoming more challenging to hold: newcomers claimed 18 percent of the premium market in 2022.13McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023.\nThis shake-up stems from the fast pace of change in the industry. The transition from internal-combustion-engine (ICE) to zero-emissions vehicles is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80 percent per year since 2020. McKinsey analysis suggests that many global mobility markets will reach near-total EV penetration by the mid-2030s. In response, European OEMs have announced ambitious electrification plans to launch more than 150 EV models through 2030, according to McKinsey analysis.\nThe EV transition drives the industry\u2019s emphasis away from hardware toward software and digital. According to our analysis, EV consumers are more than twice as likely to switch brands for better in-vehicle technology, such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) features and connectivity services. Our research shows that successful automakers are developing cars defined by software, resulting in a tripling of software content per vehicle since 2015.\nWith electrified, software-defined cars becoming the norm, semiconductors and batteries are the new industry control points. In fact, more than a third of the value of a BEV is associated with the battery. Consequently, the European supplier landscape is changing rapidly, and new capabilities are needed in development and manufacturing.\nRecently, software development and hardware development are increasingly decoupling. We\u2019ve observed that European suppliers have become proficient at the interaction between software and hardware in the context of specific control units that oversee specific components of a car, such as the engine or transmission. Modern vehicles may have as many as 150 control units in a distributed software architecture. Hardware and software will increasingly decouple as software becomes more centralized into domains such as the powertrain and in-vehicle connectivity\u2014and, eventually, into computers that oversee zones of the vehicle rather than components.\nAs a result of this shift toward more centralized computing, portions of vehicles may become commoditized, and scale and incremental improvements may become the main drivers of competitiveness. As a result, several component markets increasingly resemble the smartphone industry, in which the core differentiator is software innovation\u2014in addition to economies of scale, industrial excellence, and quality in hardware. McKinsey analysis suggests that the number of build-to-print suppliers (which manufacture products and components to customers\u2019 detailed engineering instructions) in the automotive industry that provide components such as power electronics will increase. We\u2019ve found that about a third of OEMs\u2019 requests for quotes in some powertrain components and systems are already build-to-print requests.\nNew entrants are moving to supply the automotive market with critical future technologies such as batteries, semiconductors, and software. Traditional suppliers find themselves sandwiched between \u201chigh-tech commodity\u201d companies that provide semiconductors and batteries upstream and cost-pressured incumbent OEMs downstream. This dynamic threatens European supply chains. Consider that the current battery value chain is largely controlled by Chinese companies (Exhibit 3).\nTo counteract these developments and form a strong supply network like the one Europe created during the ICE era, major industry participants are announcing strategic partnerships to secure access to resources and manufacturing capacity, especially for batteries and semiconductors. For example, some incumbents plan to strengthen their control over critical portions of the value chain by partnering with mine operators or even acquiring stakes in mines.14\u201cFactbox: Automakers accelerate drive to secure battery raw materials,\u201d Reuters, April 3, 2023; Victoria Waldersee, \u201cVolkswagen to invest in mines in bid to become global battery supplier,\u201d Reuters, March 17, 2023. While these actions are steps in the right direction, the projected supply and capacity are not yet enough to meet the region\u2019s forecast demand by 2030. Accelerated efforts are necessary.\nMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\nIn a perfect storm for the European auto industry, the current macroeconomic climate is turbulent, with multiple ongoing crises. Compared with other regions, Europe is particularly exposed and affected, and the automotive sector is at a disadvantage compared with other important industries. These challenges fall into five major areas:\nEnergy and resources. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe have surged to twice the costs in the United States and triple costs in China.1McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cChina electricity prices,\u201d GlobalPetrolPrices.com, December 2022; \u201cMidwest Information Office: Average energy prices for the United States, regions, census divisions, and selected metropolitan areas,\u201d US Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed August 17, 2023; and \u201cElectricity price statistics,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. This creates challenges for the auto industry, in which a significant portion of production costs come from energy requirements.\nGeopolitical tensions. The European auto industry generates a significant\u2014and higher compared with other regions\u2014share of its revenues through exports,2McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cInternational trade in cars,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. which means current geopolitical pressures have an outsize impact on European automakers.\nSupply chain challenges. Compared with other industries, the auto industry relies more heavily on timely deliveries of parts and components from international markets. The European auto industry is therefore at considerable risk when finely tuned international supply chains are disrupted.\nInflation. Inflation has hit Europe much more severely than the United States or China, with labor costs for European automakers disproportionately affected compared with other industries.3\u201cConsumer prices up 4.9 percent from April 2022 to April 2023,\u201d\u00a0TED: The Economics Daily, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, May 15, 2023.\nProductivity crisis. Europe\u2019s productivity and economic growth lag behind those of its peers, particularly in areas such as software engineering in which the auto industry needs significant additional capacity.4\u201cUnited States full year GDP growth,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cPriority reforms key for sustaining growth and achieving China\u2019s long-term goals - World Bank report,\u201d World Bank, June 14, 2023.\nFinally, these transformative forces overlap with a European macroeconomic environment that has a particularly acute impact on the region\u2019s auto industry (see sidebar \u201cMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\u201d).\nRoad map for the European automotive industry\nThe European auto industry is in the midst of the greatest change in its history. In service of helping the industry remain globally competitive we outline a road map of seven pillars for stakeholders to act on (Exhibit 4). The time to act is now: according to our analysis, European automotive OEMs and suppliers earn about three times the revenue of their Chinese counterparts and five times the EBIT, which means the European industry can act from a position of strength.\nA rapid response from OEMs and suppliers in the European auto industry will be important. But other stakeholders\u2014including adjacent industries such as the energy, research, and public sectors\u2014would also need to act collaboratively to provide an environment that enables success for the European automotive industry (and mobility ecosystem) of the future. In short, the ecosystem approach that made Europe strong in the ICE era has to be translated to serve the era of software-defined, electrified cars.\nRevive strengths in customer understanding, product design, and brand\nThe European automotive industry will need to extend its legacy of cutting-edge product design and superior brand value and transfer it into the new context of software-defined electric vehicles.\nOf the 25 global brands with the highest brand value, all but three are European.15\u201cLuxury & premium 2023 ranking,\u201d Brandirectory, Brand Finance, accessed August 15, 2023. Our data show that brand remains among the top five purchase criteria for European, American, and Chinese auto consumers. However, in the age of electrification and software-defined cars, purchase criteria will change and brand rankings might get reshuffled.\nTo maintain superior brand value, European incumbent OEMs would need to analyze and understand customer needs and preferences to build desirable products. Traditional consumer segmentation would need to be adapted for the era of software-defined electric vehicles, with more-detailed consumer profiles and more-granular user profiles. Owning and analyzing consumer data will enable OEMs to offer tailored mobility solutions and seamlessly engage consumers across the life cycle. They can also build their product development organizations to reflect customer journeys and experiences, which would bring operational roles closer to the customer. As consumers\u2019 desires change and technology advances, OEMs would need to continuously update their software remotely to bring the most up-to-date functionality to customers and meet their needs.\nFocus relentlessly on cost and speed\nMcKinsey research from 2022 shows that the vehicle purchase price is the most important buying factor for consumers across markets.16Annual MCFM Consumer Survey 2022, McKinsey Center for Future Mobility, global n = 27,869, December 2022. Particularly in EVs, Chinese OEMs can turn their cost advantage into a competitive edge: our analysis shows that their costs are 20 to 30 percent lower than those of European OEMs.\nTo catch up, European OEMs could drive down costs strategically. According to our analysis, European OEMs could close up to 20 percentage points of the cost gap by adopting structural product design, vertically integrating battery production, scaling EV production, and improving productivity. For example, battery insourcing could decrease European OEMs\u2019 costs by three percentage points, and cost-efficient battery cell chemistry alternatives could save five to six percentage points for some vehicles and segments. As for the remaining 5 to 10 percentage-point cost gap, European OEMs could identify differentiating features that consumers would be willing to pay a premium for, such as brand differentiation; environmental, social, and governance (ESG) leadership; and superior safety performance.\nSpeed is another consideration. McKinsey analysis shows that European OEMs have a long development cycle compared with competitors from other regions, with concept-to-pilot phases lasting up to four years. By contrast, we\u2019ve found that the fastest automakers in China need only 21 months to move from concept to pilot, allowing them to respond to market trends much more quickly.\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not necessarily appropriate to make direct comparisons between the Chinese and European automotive sectors or development cycles. However, European OEMs should take on the challenge and redesign their own processes to accelerate innovation, development, and industrialization. For instance, the product design process could be accelerated through iterative styling methods. Subsequent product development could be optimized by decoupling hardware and software development and by applying agile principles to software development. Across all processes, co-locating cross-domain teams and setting up task forces for products that are behind schedule or components with supply bottlenecks can further accelerate development.\nExecute a winning strategy for the Chinese market\nOur research shows China will remain the biggest automotive market in the future, which means winning in China will be important for European OEMs and suppliers that want to play a globally relevant role.\nEuropean incumbents have lost five percentage points of market share in China since 2019, a substantial decrease. Meanwhile, our analysis shows that Chinese automakers are outpacing their competitors and have gained more than ten percentage points of market share in China, driven by their hold on more than 80 percent of the EV market.17McKinsey analysis based on global passenger-car sales data from IHS Markit, 2002\u201322, accessed May 20, 2023.\nHow have they done it? Chinese OEMs offer significantly lower price points, and their products are more appealing and tailored to Chinese consumers\u2019 needs and preferences. They also bring targeted innovations to market rapidly; our research shows that more than 70 percent of new vehicles unveiled at the Shanghai auto show in April 2023 came from Chinese OEMs.\nLike their OEM counterparts, European automotive suppliers have a hard time gaining traction with Chinese EV players, especially for EV powertrain components and systems. While Western suppliers have held more than half of China\u2019s ICE powertrain market, they hold less than 5 percent of the EV powertrain market.18McKinsey analysis based on IHS Markit Production Forecast, number of model launches by powertrain for Aion, BMW, BYD, Mercedes-Benz, NIO, Tesla, Volkswagen and Xpeng, data as of 2022, accessed June 10, 2023.\nEuropean OEMs and suppliers would need a fundamental strategic overhaul to regain competitiveness in China and meet the preferences of Chinese customers. This starts with developing products specifically tailored for the Chinese market. According to our research, the average customer in China is 34 years old, compared with 58 in Europe. These consumers have significantly different purchasing criteria. For instance, Chinese consumers place higher value on cutting-edge technology, connectivity, advanced driver assistance systems, and on-board multimedia screens than European and American consumers do. Chinese car buyers also favor simplified vehicle choices with preconfigured options.19Thomas Fang, Mingyu Guan, Bill Peng, and Tony Zhou, \u201cMcKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2023,\u201d July 14, 2023.\nTo implement a \u201clocal for local\u201d strategy\u2014in which R&D, production, and distribution are in close proximity to where products will be bought and used\u2014European players would need to adjust their operating models for the Chinese market. For example, OEMs could localize research and development capabilities and transfer decision rights to local management. Entering local partnerships across the portfolio and supply chain will also be essential to develop a strong foothold in China and to benefit from the know-how and reputations of local partners.\nCreate resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains\nTo reduce bottlenecks and dependencies, the industry will need resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains centered on batteries, semiconductors, and green materials. In 2021, the chip crisis led to a loss of ten million vehicles in global production,20\u201cS&P Global Mobility on short- & long-term impact from chip shortage,\u201d Auto Remarketing, July 14, 2023. highlighting a need to increase supply chain resilience.\nTo create resilient supply, localization is vital. We project that the European supply\u2013demand gap for batteries will reach almost 40 percent, or 500 gigawatt-hours (GWh), by 2030. To cover European battery demand locally, an additional 20 gigafactories, a \u20ac35 billion investment, would be needed.21McKinsey Battery Insights analysis assumes a 500-GWh supply\u2013demand gap and average capital expenditures of \u20ac70 million per gigawatt hour in Europe. This leads to a \u20ac35 million investment need, in addition to the already announced \u20ac70 million for planned and existing factories in Europe. The continent would also need 37 new semiconductor fabs to cover local demand, requiring a \u20ac190 billion investment.22Annual report 2020: The automotive industry in facts and figures, Verband der Automobilindustrie, 2020. As a first step, the European Chips Act will provide \u20ac43 billion in subsidies. Next steps could involve expanding the ecosystem along the value chain while safeguarding crucial supplies, with tactics such as increasing safety stock and implementing dual-sourcing strategies.\nAt least in the midterm, improving the circularity of supply chains will further decrease Europe\u2019s dependence on raw materials and components from other regions while increasing sustainability. It could also increase the share of local added value in critical EV components and create additional jobs and economic growth. Our analysis shows that reusing materials from scrapped batteries can also save up to 10 percent of costs and avoid 20 percent of the CO2 required in production. To implement a circular value chain, industry stakeholders would need to commit to the use of recycled content and material efficiency and establish reverse operations at end of life.\nEnd-to-end transparency on ESG criteria such as digital traceability is an important way to make critical supply chains more sustainable. As sustainability standards in key industries begin to develop\u2014consider the launch of the battery passport, which contains ESG data for batteries23\u201cAction partnerships: Battery passport,\u201d Global Battery Alliance, accessed August 15, 2023.\u2014the European auto industry should stay at the forefront of ESG performance to gain and maintain competitive advantage in the future.\nHyperscale competitive European battery and semiconductor players\nWe\u2019ve observed that European players are underrepresented in battery manufacturing and high-end compute and semiconductors that power artificial intelligence. According to our analysis, only one European manufacturer is among the top ten in terms of market capitalization for battery manufacturing, while in semiconductors, Europe needs to close the capability gap for the next wave of computing to deliver functionalities such as ADAS.\nA path to creating an ecosystem of technology champions consists of three elements. First, Europe should consider developing a pan-European regulatory rule book to scale high-growth firms, aligning tax standards, regulations, labor rules, and bureaucratic processes. Second, to stay at the forefront of technology, the region would need to build specialized knowledge and product innovation capabilities. Suppliers could tap into niche specialties, such as more-sustainable battery refining. Finally, the European industry would need a battery and semiconductor network, similar to the one that serves the aerospace industry. European incumbents could form strategic partnerships with emerging entrants and research institutions.\nDesign a way forward for ADAS with policy support\nAdvanced driver assistance systems features are increasingly important. They are becoming a key differentiator for vehicle buyers: According to our research, 51 percent of consumers worldwide would consider switching to some form of ADAS car in the future. Competitive pressures around ADAS are also intensifying. In 2022, Mercedes-Benz was the first automotive player to introduce and certify Level 3 autonomy, the threshold at which drivers can take their hands off the wheel.24Andrew J. Hawkins, \u201cMercedes-Benz is the first to bring Level 3 automated driving to the US,\u201d Verge, January 27, 2023. Other participants in the global industry are catching up using a variety of technology approaches.\nTo remain competitive, the European industry may need to form a cross-industry alliance. Players could collaborate in two main areas. The first area is where differentiation is negligible and where there are opportunities for savings. This would include standardizing sensor communication protocols, which would simplify the integration of new sensors. Standardizing middleware (which sits between front- and back-end technologies) and layers of the operating system are other approaches.\nThe second area of collaboration is where scale and large databases could enable a faster, more robust development process for efforts including the continuous updates of software layers in maps\u2014updates such as creating high-definition map- and location-based services. A shared pool of data could also be used for AI training and validation.\nThe right regulatory environment could be critical to enable this kind of cross-industry collaboration. Public-sector stakeholders could consider adapting existing guidelines to the context of autonomous driving. These updates could encourage collaborative precompetitive research and innovation that advance and accelerate technological progress and drive standardization.\nClose the software skill gap to win the automotive digital transition\nSoftware is essential to the future of the automotive industry. But according to our analysis, only 15 to 20 percent of current R&D workers at European incumbents have software skills, compared with almost 45 percent at new entrants.\nTo shrink the gap, industry stakeholders would need to find holistic solutions. For example, European incumbents could create shared\u2014or at least interoperable\u2014software platforms across OEMs in Europe (and possibly other regions where the industry has strong partnerships) to complement individual participants\u2019 capabilities and to avoid costly solo efforts.\nEarly hiring, reskilling, and foreign talent can also help close the gap. Players can intensify early hiring directly from universities and boost STEM and software talent education through partnerships with universities and schools. Our research shows that reskilling is already in progress: 37 percent of European suppliers have ongoing reskilling efforts, and another 41 percent have plans to implement them. To draw skilled software talent from other regions, European employers would need accelerate processes around work permits and accommodate foreign talent\u2019s requirements on salary, benefits, and working conditions.\nCreating an environment that enables accelerated progress\nAbout the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility\nThese insights were developed by the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM). Since 2011, the MCFM has worked with stakeholders across the mobility ecosystem by providing independent and integrated evidence about possible future-mobility scenarios. With our unique, bottom-up modeling approach, our insights enable an end-to-end analytics journey through the future of mobility\u2014from consumer needs to modal mix across urban/rural areas, sales, value pools, and life cycle sustainability. Contact us if you are interested in getting full access to our market insights via the McKinsey Mobility Insights Portal.\nEuropean automotive players are moving in the right direction but should consider scaling and accelerating their efforts. To accomplish this, a wide variety of stakeholders in the region would need to create an environment that breeds progress and future wins for the region\u2019s automotive industry. The formula requires a road map, catalysts, and platforms for cooperation.\nA clear road map such as the one we outline is needed to help accelerate the European automotive industry\u2019s progress. Its seven pillars would need to be converted into actionable measures and quantifiable targets for industry stakeholders\u2014suppliers, OEMs, players from adjacent industries, and regulatory bodies. Associations could take on a coordinating role.\nCatalysts play a significant role in implementing the road map. One is a competitive regulatory environment. Clearly defining and communicating common standards and codifying interoperability across all elements of the road map is likely to be critical.\nAnother critical catalyst of the European industry\u2019s transition is EV infrastructure. According to our analysis, the industry will need a cumulative \u20ac300 billion worth of infrastructure investments in electricity generation, the electricity grid, EV chargers, and hydrogen refueling systems through 2030.25European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. European stakeholders have begun to install public chargers at a pace of 2,000 charging points per week.26European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. But to meet demand, decision makers would need to build out charging infrastructure to the tune of 6,000 to 14,000 charging points per week.27European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. We found that the wind and solar assets required to fulfill the corresponding demand for energy with renewable sources would require four times as many workers in Europe by 2030 than are currently available.\nFinally, the industry would need platforms for collaboration. As industry boundaries are redefined, three kinds of partnership will become more important: horizontal partnerships between entities in the same parts of the value chain (such as multiple car companies) for efforts such as software development or to gain a solid footing in the Chinese market; vertical partnerships between entities in different parts of the value chain (such as car companies with tech companies) to secure access to technology and talent; and cross-industry partnerships, such as collaborations between automotive players and utilities to facilitate structural goals such as seamless sector coupling.\nOur road map shows a way forward for a globally competitive European auto industry. The work will require action from an expansive array of regional stakeholders and a supportive administrative environment. Time is of the essence.\nAndreas Cornet and Andreas Tschiesner are senior partners in McKinsey\u2019s Munich office, where Patrick Schaufuss is a partner; Ruth Heuss is a senior partner in the Berlin office.\nThe authors wish to thank Ondrej Burkacky, Julian Conzade, Johannes Deichmann, Lauritz Fischer, Maximilian Geirhos, Marco Groth, Volker Gr\u00fcntges, Antonia Gutzler, Martin Hattrup-Silberberg, Martin Kellner, Martin Linder, Nicoline L\u00fchrs, Lukas Michor, Jan Paulitschek, and Kirsten Weerda for their contributions to this report.",
    "Document2": "Sustainability and the Steel City: Modernization at Pittsburgh International Airport\nA rendering of the view future travelers will see when they approach the new terminal. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nFlying is essential for work, vacation or visiting loved ones. The industry also is necessary to ship goods overseas quickly. However, it\u2019s not known for being environmentally friendly. One airport is seeking to change that.\nAviation contributes 3.5 percent of effective radiative forcing (which measures energy imbalance), 2.5 percent of carbon emissions and 1.9 percent of all greenhouse gas output. So there\u2019s a strong push to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel, starting at the airport.\nPittsburgh\u2019s Terminal Modernization\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s Terminal Modernization Program is a $1.4 billion project to create a new consolidated terminal that modernizes outdated former hub facilities, better serves passengers, fuels the region\u2019s future development, stabilizes long-term costs for airlines and evokes the essence of Pittsburgh. The new multi-modal complex will feature a new garage that nearly triples the amount of covered parking.\nThe PIT Terminal Modernization Program (TMP) was built upon these five principles that represent fundamental purposes driving the transformation:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0Stabilize\u00a0airline costs\n2.\u00a0 Be\u00a0Pittsburgh\u2019s airport\n3.\u00a0 Be environmentally\u00a0sustainable\n4.\u00a0\u00a0Enhance the experience\u00a0for all customers\n5.\u00a0 Provide\u00a0value\u00a0to our\u00a0community\n\u00a0\nCranes install steel beams as part of the terminal modernization program.(triblive.com)\n1. Airport Modernization\nThe new terminal will be between the C and D airside gate concourses, eliminating the need for the people mover train. The new facility will cater to passengers flying directly to and from Pittsburgh (origin and destination traffic) as opposed to the existing facility which was largely built as a hub facility focused on connecting traffic.\n2. Improved Experience\nThe layout should make navigating the airport quicker and easier. It will slash passengers\u2019 time from curbside to airside in half. Aesthetic improvements will enhance everyone\u2019s experience, and new outdoor terraces (pre- and post-security) will make it easier for travelers to relax before boarding their flight.\n3. Increased Area Value\nAirports raise the value of the area around them by encouraging economic growth and adding convenience for potential new residents. The terminal modernization brings more than 14,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities to the region. Currently, about 550 construction workers are onsite daily, and that number will increase to 1,000 daily workers in summer 2023.\n4. Stabilized Airline Costs\nAirport efficiency can impact the costs of airlines. The expansion will allow airlines to better process and load luggage as well as welcome passengers. It also lowers long-term O&M costs.\n5. More Sustainable Terminal\nConstruction practices for the new terminal comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Environmental Program Declaration (EPD) credit for their materials while also working to reduce emissions, water, energy and waste. Officials are targeting a minimum of LEED Silver certification for the facility.\nVendors are strongly encouraged to present products and services that comply with verified third-party certification criteria or reporting standards. The airport also urges them to source their products or materials regionally to decrease the impact on the environment and human health compared to similar vendors in other locations.\nAdvantus Engineers is collaborating with other teams and implementing sustainable practices such as water and energy efficiency, using sustainable materials, managing waste, employing electric transportation methods, and promoting healthy indoor environments.\nAdditionally, the airport is recycling and reusing construction waste, including 86,000 tons of crushed concrete for new airport roads.\nThe 2030 Challenge\nPart of constructing the new terminal is moving the airport closer to achieving the 2030 Challenge, an environmental initiative to go carbon-neutral by that year.\nThe suggested plan by Architecture 2030 is to decrease 90 percent of carbon emissions by 2025 and be 100 percent carbon neutral by 2030. New buildings, renovations and additions throughout the new terminal will have energy-consumption performance standards.\nA Timeline for Construction 2021\nApril:\u00a0Officials added safe driving lanes and barricades between concourses C and D. Saw-cutting began on the ramp to remove slabs.\nMay:\u00a0To prepare for the new terminal\u2019s foundation, 300,000 square feet of material were removed.\nJune:\u00a0An impact roller broke up large concrete sections to crush into smaller aggregate for reuse in new roadways.\nJuly:\u00a0Construction teams modified an underground fuel line for future use.\nAugust and September:\u00a0Team members began installation of electrical lines, construction trailers and underground utility work.

The first elevated deck slab concrete was installed.\n2023\nAll foundation work was completed on the site of the new terminal at the end of January. There were multiple concrete pours, and more than half of the mechanically stabilized earth walls now are in place.\nEmbracing Pittsburgh\u2019s History\nPittsburgh\u2019s industrial nickname comes from the rise of the steel industry after the Civil War. Increased demand for armament and iron boosted the local economy. Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie introduced the Bessemer steelmaking process, which brought him from obscurity to fame.\nCarnegie began producing steel in 1875. Meanwhile, Henry Clay Frick, the grandson of whiskey distillers, made his riches operating beehive cooking ovens that could turn coal into coke\u2014an essential steelmaking ingredient. Frick later partnered with Carnegie to form Carnegie Steel Co. and, in 1901, they merged multiple companies into the United States Steel Corp.\nBefore they reached their final success, however, a dispute between Carnegie Steel and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers put a dark cloud over the area\u2019s steel production. It led to the Battle of Homestead, an armed conflict that killed 12 people. This event paved the way for modern labor practices and worker-protection laws.\nThrough the mid-1950s, Pittsburgh thrived as America\u2019s eighth-largest city and produced half of the country\u2019s steel. European immigration through Ellis Island led to a population increase of more than 500,000 individuals. The city\u2019s diversity still exists in its various neighborhoods.\nThings changed for Pittsburgh in the 1970s and 1980s when steel production slowed to a stop, and the city had to reinvent itself to survive. It\u2019s now known for technology, energy, medicine, education, research, arts, sports and advanced manufacturing. Its National Football League team, the Steelers, pays tribute to its past in the steel industry. This new terminal aims to do the same. The new terminal at PIT invokes the essence of Pittsburgh through its design focused on Nature, Technology and Community\u2014dubbed NaTeCo by the design team.\nThe terminal modernization progam will pay tribute to the city\u2019s history through art and construction. Steel tree columns are a featured part of the new terminal, creating a nostalgic and stylistic design. Their brownish color is meant to invoke importance of nature in Western Pennsylvania. All of the steel in the new terminal, procured throughout the United States, is being fabricated just 10 miles away from the airport in Ambridge, Pa.\n\n\n(Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nThe Airport Authority also recruited artists Patrick Marold and Adam Kuby to create an exhibition honoring the steel industry through sculptures and other design elements. Other artisans contribute to the terminal through PIT\u2019s Art in the Airport initiative.\nSustainability in the Steel City\nThroughout the years, Pittsburgh made strides to create a healthier, more-sustainable city. From 2015-2020, the Department of City Planning released a yearly \u201cState of Sustainability\u201d report that examined ongoing efforts to reduce waste and minimize the use of nonrenewable resources.\nNonprofit organization Sustainable Pittsburgh advocates and educates individuals and groups through various initiatives such as recognizing corporations that make efforts toward decarbonization.\nUniversities in the city also are embracing measures to create a greener city. The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University and Point Park University each have their own sustainability programs to encourage research and on-campus responsibility.\nThe terminal modernization project is another major step toward creating a Pittsburgh that lives in harmony with its environment.\nTime for an Update\nAllegheny County Airport was the first airport in the region, opening in 1931, and at the time was one of the largest and most advanced terminals of its time. The Greater Pittsburgh Airport opened in 1952, becoming the region\u2019s primary commercial airport. (Allegheny County Airport continues to operate today as a robust general aviation airport with more than 60,000 operations annually.)\nThat terminal existed until 1992, when officials opened the more modern Pittsburgh International Airport, built and designed as a hub for US Airways. US Airways pulled its hub status in 2004, leaving Pittsburgh with a facility built for another time and a different purpose. The airport today offers nonstop service to more than 60 nonstop destinations on 16 airlines, including international service to London Heathrow on British Airways as well service to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.\nBoth Pittsburgh International Airport and Allegheny County Airport are operated under the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which has experienced several changes through the years, with the new terminal project being the largest.\nOfficials announced the new terminal in 2017, but construction was put on hold in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project resumed in 2021 and is now making consistent progress. The groundbreaking happened in October 2021, making it the first U.S. terminal built from the ground up after the pandemic.\nTravelers will get the opportunity to enjoy fresh air and greenery while they await their flights. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nManaging Construction\nACAA selected the architecture and engineering teams of Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects to lead work on the project. This collaboration ensures international best practices are met without sacrificing local characteristics.\nGensler is headquartered in San Francisco but has multiple Pennsylvania offices and designed the PNC tower downtown. The firm also has airport experience with Incheon Airport. HDR is headquartered in Omaha, Neb., but has an office in Pittsburgh. It replaced the Greenfield Bridge and renovated the Honolulu Airport.\nLuis Vidal completed terminal projects for Heathrow, Madrid-Barajas and other airports.\nBlue Sky News/Pittsburgh International Airport\nTaking in Local Concerns\nThe Allegheny County Airport Authority engaged the community and airlines to determine the best course of action for the terminal project. The terminal modernization has a program advisory group and a best practice group with experts in sustainability, accessibility, passenger experience, technology, health, culture and arts. These members represent constituencies, share their expertise and ensure the authority uses best practices in the new terminal design.\nFeedback was gathered through community and stakeholder meetings, interviews, surveys and the feedback section of the program\u2019s website,\u00a0PITtransformed.com.\nAlthough there are concerns with any project, Pittsburgh\u2019s local \u201cyinzers\u201d are known for being open to sustainable initiatives and creating socioeconomic changes that positively impact the environment, preserving it for future generations. These efforts are known internationally, with the United Nations Foundation recognizing the city as an example of America\u2019s growing sustainability movement.\nManaging the TPM Budget\nWith a high cost comes the need for strict budget management, and the program management team keeps spending under control. No local tax dollars are involved, and most of the construction is funded through long-term bonds, essentially borrowing money and then paying off that debt as part of its yearly operating budget. Paying for the project comes from airport revenues, including airline fees, parking and rental fees, passenger facility charges, terminal concessions revenues, and natural gas revenue.\nNatural Construction and Energy\nLarge windows will produce abundant natural light in the new terminal, minimizing the need for external lighting sources. Outside these windows are expansive outdoor terraces featuring local flora. Using local plants reduces the need for excess water and electricity.\nPlanting local trees, flowers and bushes enables visitors to learn and appreciate native plants, especially when the airport might be the only part of Pennsylvania some travelers see. They also cut carbon emissions by eliminating the need to transport outside flora.\nThe terrace will have chairs for passengers to relax as well as open spaces for kids and pets to run around before getting on their flights.\nOne of the largest changes to the terminal is the private microgrid with nearly 10,000 solar panels and five natural-gas generators. These energy sources will power the new terminal, cutting the airport\u2019s carbon footprint and creating a more-sustainable environment. The microgrid is already up and running, powering the existing facility since June 2021. This is significant for the 2030 goal, as construction and demolition projects generate approximately 569 million tons of waste annually.\nThis is advantageous for passengers and airlines, providing a power source when electricity goes out as well as decreasing flight delays. In addition to being more resilient, the microgrid saves PIT more than $1 million annually in utility costs and saves more than 6 million pounds of carbon emissions annually.\nLeading the Way for Sustainability\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s terminal modernization project is the first post-pandemic terminal built from the ground up and holds great promise. Sustainability has always been top of mind, but the ability to continue working toward the 2030 goal after a significant delay shows a commitment to creating a more eco-friendly airport. During the construction delay, PIT designers took that time to incorporate additional public health measures into the project.\nOfficials hope projects can look toward PIT as an example that sustainability, economic growth, customer satisfaction and local pride can exist in the same place.\u00a0\nAbout Rose Morrison\nRose Morrison is a freelance writer with a passion for sustainable building and innovative construction technologies; email: [email\u00a0protected].\nSubscribe\nSubscribe now to receive our FREE print publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nProject of the Week\n\nFort McHenry Tunnel\nClick here for details and to submit your project!\nCurrent Issue\n\n4th Annual Sustainable Engineering Issue 2024\nPopular Tags\nTwitter Feed\nLocation\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\nRequest More Information From Sponsor\n\n\u0394\n",

    "Summarized_Document1": "The European automotive industry is a significant contributor to the region's economy, accounting for nearly 7% of GDP and employing around 14 million people. However, it faces challenges such as the shift to electrified powertrains, software differentiation, and competition from new entrants, particularly from China. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports, with 3.0 million vehicles compared to Germany's 2.6 million. Rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions further complicate the industry's landscape.The industry has historically been a hub of innovation, with 30% of global automotive patents originating from Europe. Investments in R&D have led to advancements in sustainability and safety. The brand value of the top ten European auto companies is estimated at \u20ac200 billion, with five of the ten most valuable car brands being European.Despite these strengths, the industry is undergoing significant disruptions. European OEMs have lost market share to Chinese competitors, particularly in battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The transition to EVs is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80% annually since 2020. European OEMs have announced plans to launch over 150 EV models by 2030.The shift to software-defined vehicles is also crucial, with semiconductors and batteries becoming key components. European suppliers need to adapt to this change, as modern vehicles may have up to 150 control units. The industry must also address supply chain challenges, particularly in batteries and semiconductors, to remain competitive.Macroeconomic challenges such as high energy costs, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and a productivity crisis further impact the industry. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe are twice those in the U.S. and triple those in China, affecting production costs.To navigate these challenges, a road map with seven pillars is proposed: understanding customer needs, focusing on cost and speed, executing a winning strategy for the Chinese market, creating resilient supply chains, developing competitive battery and semiconductor players, advancing ADAS with policy support, and closing the software skill gap.European OEMs need to localize R&D and production in China, develop products tailored to Chinese consumers, and form strategic partnerships. Resilient supply chains require localization, circularity, and sustainability. The industry needs significant investments in battery and semiconductor manufacturing to meet future demand.Collaboration across the industry and with adjacent sectors is essential. A competitive regulatory environment and substantial investments in EV infrastructure are critical. The industry must also focus on software skills, with only 15-20% of current R&D workers having software expertise compared to 45% at new entrants.In summary, the European automotive industry must act swiftly and collaboratively to maintain its global competitiveness in the face of profound changes and challenges.",

Solar and wind account for more of our nation\u2019s energy mix than ever before.\nTo study America\u2019s growing renewable electricity capacity and generation, Climate Central analyzed historical data on solar and wind energy over a 10-year period (2014 to 2023).\nThe analysis shows that the amount of electricity produced from solar and wind power increased across the U.S. Our nation generated 238,121 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from solar in 2023 \u2014 more than eight times the amount generated a decade earlier in 2014. Wind power has more than doubled this decade, with 425,325 GWh coming from wind installations across the country in 2023. Together, these two renewable energy sources generated enough electricity in 2023 to power the equivalent of more than 61 million average American homes.\nThe most solar power generation came from California (68,816 GWh) and Texas (31,739 GWh) in 2023. Texas also led the country in power generated from wind (119,836 GWh).\nThese data \u2014 combined with federal capacity forecasts \u2014 show how renewable energy growth is driving America\u2019s progress toward net-zero carbon emissions targets in the U.S.\nThis report and supplementary data show:\nHow much solar and wind power increased from 2022 to 2023\nGrowth trends in solar and wind power over the past decade (2014-2023)\nWhich states are the biggest producers of solar and wind energy\nDownload the dataSee the full report\nRelated Climate Matters briefs including state-level graphics:\nA Decade of Solar Growth\nIndex\nIntroductionSolarSolar-powered States in 2023A Decade of Solar Growth Across the U.S., 2014-2023WindWind-powered States in 2023A Decade of Wind Growth Across the U.S., 2014-2023Clean Energy Growth Relative to U.S. Climate TargetsMethodology\nIntroduction #\nRenewable energy from solar panels and wind turbines is increasingly important in the United States, as costs for these technologies continue to rapidly decline. As the power grid grows to meet increasing electricity demand in the coming decades, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that most of the nation\u2019s new energy capacity will come from renewables like solar and wind \u2013 shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.\nLow-carbon renewable energy sources such as solar and wind provide electricity without producing heat-trapping gases or other air pollutants. Renewable energy projects create jobs, support local economies, and help meet U.S. commitments to reduce carbon pollution.\nSolar and wind are the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the U.S. In 2019, wind generation surpassed the amount of electricity generated from hydropower \u2014 a longtime leader in renewable energy. In 2022, solar overtook hydropower for the first time. Solar and wind energy will lead the growth in U.S. power generation for at least the next two years, according to EIA estimates.\nThis report uses data from the EIA to analyze solar and wind capacity and generation over the past decade (2014 to 2023) in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Recent data are compared across states and against historical figures to show which states have led growth in solar and wind energy.\nThe key terms in this report \u2014 capacity and generation \u2014 gauge renewable energy in the U.S.\nCapacity reflects the number and size of operational solar and wind installations. Renewable energy in the U.S. comes from both large utility-scale power plants and small-scale installations (which have less than 1 megawatt of capacity).\nGeneration reflects how much electricity is produced by those installations, which depends on the weather and number of daily sunlight hours.See Box 1. Key Terms for more details.\nTogether, capacity and generation data provide insight into renewable energy growth, by showing the new capacity that comes online each year as well as the amount of electricity generated with new installations.\nDownload datasets with all variables included in this report.\nCapacity: measure of the maximum rate at which electricity can be generated by equipment on the ground, reported here in megawatts (MW) for state totals and gigawatts (GW) (equal to 1,000 MW) for national totals.\nGeneration: the amount of electricity produced over a period of time, reported here in gigawatt-hours (GWh) (equal to 1,000 megawatt-hours). For reference, the average American household consumed 10.8 MWh of electricity in 2022.\nSmall-scale installations: power operations with less than 1 MW of capacity, usually located onsite or near where the electricity is used (e.g., residential rooftop solar panels or community solar projects). Note: The only small-scale installations discussed in this report are for solar power.\nUtility-scale installations: power plants with at least 1 MW of capacity.\nLearn more about U.S. electricity capacity and generation from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n01 / 01\nSOLAR #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 gigawatts from utility- and small-scale solar installations \u2014 an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 238,121 GWh of electricity from utility- and small-scale solar installations combined. This is an increase of 33,042 GWh or 16% compared to 2022.\nFigure 1: National solar electricity generation (GWh) in 2023 by state\nThe EIA considers a solar installation to be \u201csmall-scale\u201d if it has less than 1 MW of capacity. Most residential or commercial rooftop solar installations are small-scale, along with most community solar projects (those that provide electricity to multiple residents or businesses in an area).\nSmall-scale solar installations account for an estimated 48 GW (around 34%) of all solar capacity in the U.S. at the end of 2023. Nearly 8 GW of new small-scale solar capacity was brought online in 2023, representing a record 20% increase compared to 2022.\nDuring the past decade, small-scale solar capacity and generation have grown steadily, but at a slower pace than utility-scale. Small-scale capacity in 2023 was more than six times the amount compared to 2014; utility-scale saw an eight-fold increase. The EIA estimates that small-scale solar capacity could grow to 55 GW by the end of 2024.\nSmall-scale solar produced an estimated 73,619 GWh or about 31% of all solar generation in 2023 \u2014 compared to 164,502 GWh generated by utility-scale installations.\nCalifornia generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023, which accounts for around 41% of the state's total solar electricity generation for the year. On the East Coast, New York generated the most electricity from small-scale solar in 2023 (3,973 GWh) \u2014 accounting for nearly 62% of electricity generated from solar that year in the state. In the middle of the country, wind is typically a bigger source of electricity than solar; however, Illinois was the 10th highest small-scale solar generating state in 2023, with 1,536 GWh of electricity from small-scale operations \u2014 accounting for 44% of the state\u2019s solar electricity.\nUtility-scale solar accounts for around 8% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources (including renewables, nuclear, [1] and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas). In 2023, nearly4% of electricity in the U.S. was produced by utility-scale solar. A decade earlier in 2014, it accounted for less than 0.5% of the total electricity generated.\nCalifornia and Nevada are among the states for which utility-scale solar comprises a significant portion of the current electricity mix. In 2023, utility-scale solar contributed 19% (40,714 GWh) of electricity in California and 23% (9,733 GWh) of the electricity in Nevada.\nNevada\u2019s capacity for solar power is projected to increase during 2024, as the Gemini solar facility is scheduled to come online. The facility will add a planned 690 MW of solar capacity and 380 MW of battery storage \u2013 which is one way solar power facilities can capture and store some energy to meet evening electricity demand. It\u2019s expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational.\nNote: These data reflect total utility-scale energy sources only and exclude small-scale solar.\nSolar energy projects are bringing jobs and skills training to Nevada.

Texas added 4,996 MW of capacity (37% annual increase) and generated 6,302 GWh more than the previous year (25% annual increase).\nCalifornia followed with an addition of 4,714 MW of solar capacity \u2014 a 15% increase from 2022. The state produced 5,906 GWh more (9% increase) than the year before.\nState\nSolar Capacity (MW) 2023\nSolar Capacity Growth\n2022 to 2023\nSolar Generation (GWh) 2023\nSolar Generation Growth\n2022 to 2023\nCalifornia\n36,461\n15%\n68,816\n9%\nTexas\n18,476\n37%\n31,739\n25%\nFlorida\n10,352\n33%\n17,809\n28%\nNorth Carolina\n7,150\n11%\n12,085\n2%\nArizona\n5,848\n14%\n11,778\n6%\nUnited States total\n139,012\n23%\n238,121\n16%\nA Decade of Solar Growth Across the US 2014-2023 #\nThe U.S. added more than 121 GW of utility- and small-scale solar capacity in total during the last decade \u2014 an increase of around 688% (Figure 2). This means there was nearly eight times more solar capacity in 2023 than in 2014.\nThe amount of electricity produced from solar increased at a similar rate. In 2023, the U.S. generated over eight times more electricity from solar energy than in 2014 \u2014 an increase of more than 209,197 GWh or 723%.\nThe states with the most significant growth in solar capacity over the last 10 years include: California, which added 27,864 MW from 2014 to 2023; Texas (18,179 MW); Florida (10,203 MW); North Carolina (6,416 MW); and Nevada (4,313 MW).\nThese five states saw the most growth in generation, too (Table 2). Present-day data on solar capacity and generation reflect these strong historical growth trends, as these states were among the highest solar-generating states in 2023.\nState\nSolar Capacity Growth (MW)\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Capacity Growth\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Generation Growth (GWh)\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Generation Growth\n2014 to 2023\nCalifornia\n27,864\n324%\n54,210\n371%\nTexas\n18,179\n6,124%\n31,293\n7,016%\nFlorida\n10,203\n6,858%\n17,448\n4,833%\nNorth Carolina\n6,416\n874%\n11,282\n1,405%\nNevada\n4,313\n647%\n10,305\n922%\nUnited States total\n121,363\n688%\n209,197\n723%\nSolar and wind installations produce energy daily, year-round. Seasonal weather plays an important role. The amount of electricity generated is influenced, in part, by when the sun shines or the wind blows.\nSolar generation in the U.S. peaks in the summer, when days are long and the sun\u2019s rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly. In 2023, solar electricity produced from utility- and small-scale installations (combined) peaked (Figure 3) in July (26,626 GWh) and August (25,372 GWh).\nWind energy generation is typically highest during the spring. In 2023, the most wind energy was produced across the U.S. in March (44,580 GWh) and April (43,072 GWh) (Figure 4).\n01 / 01\nFigure 3: Monthly solar generation (GWh) in the U.S. in 2023. During 2023, U.S. solar electricity generation peaked in July (26,626 GWh).\nClimate Central\u2019s WeatherPower\u2122 tool produces daily estimates and forecasts of local solar and wind generation across the continental U.S. Daily forecasts from WeatherPower reflect the influence of weather on local solar and wind generation. WeatherPower data provide a snapshot of solar and wind energy across the U.S., at local scales, on any given day. It can be used to generate figures relevant to any state, media market, county, or congressional district in the continental U.S.\nThis WeatherPower graphic shows estimates and forecasts for solar generation in North Carolina in March 2024.\nWIND #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 148 GW from utility-scale onshore and offshore wind installations \u2014 an increase of 6 GW or 4% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 425,235 GWh of electricity from utility-scale wind installations. This represents a slight drop of 9,062 GWh or 2% compared to 2022 due to lower average wind speeds, mostly in the Midwest.\nMost wind energy in the U.S. is produced onshore, in the middle of the country. However coastal states can take advantage of offshore winds to generate electricity. Offshore wind currently makes up a small portion of the national electricity mix, but it has the potential to grow substantially in the coming decades.\nIn 2023, only two states (Rhode Island and Virginia) had operational offshore wind facilities, which contributed 42 MW to the total national wind capacity (148 GW). Offshore wind capacity has already grown early in 2024. Vineyard Wind, a wind installation off the coast of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, began operating in February 2024 with 68 MW of capacity. This facility will have 800 MW of capacity when fully operational, which could happen as soon as late 2024.

As part of its commitment, the U.S. has set the following goals:\nBy 2030: reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels\nBy 2035: reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity\nBy 2050: achieving a net-zero emissions economy\nRecent landmark laws are fostering renewable energy growth and moving the U.S. toward its climate goals. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) contains hundreds of billions of dollars to boost clean energy and cut emissions. The IRA includes provisions such as tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives for renewable energy projects from the utility-scale to individual households.\nThe Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT), a project led by Princeton University scientists, estimates the potential impact of these policies, and tracks progress towards U.S. climate targets.By 2030, REPEAT estimates U.S. net annual emissions could be as low as 4.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2e), compared to 6.6 Gt CO2e in 2005: a reduction of around 40% compared to 2005 levels. Although this represents significant progress, the U.S. would still fall short of its 2030 target (50% below 2005 levels) (Figure 7).Solar and wind energy are key to reducing emissions and reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. If current policies are taken advantage of, a boom in solar and wind energy capacity is expected based on REPEAT analysis. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority (more than 50%) of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (Figure 8).In 12 states, wind and solar could make up over 80% of electricity capacity by 2035 by utilizing current policies. And New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming could have over 90% of their electricity capacity from wind and solar by 2035.\nExplore more data: State Solar and Wind Boom to Bring U.S. Toward Climate Targets\nMethodology #\nAll national and state-level data come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values for 2014-2022 are as reported in EIA\u2019s Historical State Data for each year. For 2023, utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values are for December 2023 as reported in EIA\u2019s Electric Power Monthly. Small-scale solar capacity for 2014-2022 are for December of each year, as reported in form EIA-861M. All generation values (wind, utility- and small-scale solar) for 2014-2022 come from EIA\u2019s electricity data browser.\nTo calculate the portion of total capacity and electricity generation contributed by solar and wind (as a percentage), we compared electricity capacity/generation for utility-scale solar and wind to all fuel sources and all energy sectors at the utility-scale level, which includes: renewable sources; nuclear; and fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar and wind 10-year growth is a direct comparison between capacity/generation in 2014 and 2023.\nClimate Central is an independent group of scientists and communicators who research and report the facts about our changing climate and how it affects people\u2019s lives.\nClimate Central is a policy-neutral 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\nNewsletter signup\nLooking for Climate Matters?

Solar and wind account for more of our nation\u2019s energy mix than ever before.\nTo study America\u2019s growing renewable electricity capacity and generation, Climate Central analyzed historical data on solar and wind energy over a 10-year period (2014 to 2023).\nThe analysis shows that the amount of electricity produced from solar and wind power increased across the U.S. Our nation generated 238,121 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from solar in 2023 \u2014 more than eight times the amount generated a decade earlier in 2014. Wind power has more than doubled this decade, with 425,325 GWh coming from wind installations across the country in 2023. Together, these two renewable energy sources generated enough electricity in 2023 to power the equivalent of more than 61 million average American homes.\nThe most solar power generation came from California (68,816 GWh) and Texas (31,739 GWh) in 2023.

As the power grid grows to meet increasing electricity demand in the coming decades, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that most of the nation\u2019s new energy capacity will come from renewables like solar and wind \u2013 shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.\nLow-carbon renewable energy sources such as solar and wind provide electricity without producing heat-trapping gases or other air pollutants. Renewable energy projects create jobs, support local economies, and help meet U.S. commitments to reduce carbon pollution.\nSolar and wind are the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the U.S. In 2019, wind generation surpassed the amount of electricity generated from hydropower \u2014 a longtime leader in renewable energy. In 2022, solar overtook hydropower for the first time. Solar and wind energy will lead the growth in U.S. power generation for at least the next two years, according to EIA estimates.\nThis report uses data from the EIA to analyze solar and wind capacity and generation over the past decade (2014 to 2023) in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Recent data are compared across states and against historical figures to show which states have led growth in solar and wind energy.\nThe key terms in this report \u2014 capacity and generation \u2014 gauge renewable energy in the U.S.\nCapacity reflects the number and size of operational solar and wind installations. Renewable energy in the U.S. comes from both large utility-scale power plants and small-scale installations (which have less than 1 megawatt of capacity).\nGeneration reflects how much electricity is produced by those installations, which depends on the weather and number of daily sunlight hours.See Box 1. Key Terms for more details.\nTogether, capacity and generation data provide insight into renewable energy growth, by showing the new capacity that comes online each year as well as the amount of electricity generated with new installations.\nDownload datasets with all variables included in this report.\nCapacity: measure of the maximum rate at which electricity can be generated by equipment on the ground, reported here in megawatts (MW) for state totals and gigawatts (GW) (equal to 1,000 MW) for national totals.\nGeneration: the amount of electricity produced over a period of time, reported here in gigawatt-hours (GWh) (equal to 1,000 megawatt-hours). For reference, the average American household consumed 10.8 MWh of electricity in 2022.\nSmall-scale installations: power operations with less than 1 MW of capacity, usually located onsite or near where the electricity is used (e.g., residential rooftop solar panels or community solar projects). Note: The only small-scale installations discussed in this report are for solar power.\nUtility-scale installations: power plants with at least 1 MW of capacity.\nLearn more about U.S. electricity capacity and generation from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n01 / 01\nSOLAR #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 gigawatts from utility- and small-scale solar installations \u2014 an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 238,121 GWh of electricity from utility- and small-scale solar installations combined. This is an increase of 33,042 GWh or 16% compared to 2022.\nFigure 1: National solar electricity generation (GWh) in 2023 by state\nThe EIA considers a solar installation to be \u201csmall-scale\u201d if it has less than 1 MW of capacity. Most residential or commercial rooftop solar installations are small-scale, along with most community solar projects (those that provide electricity to multiple residents or businesses in an area).\nSmall-scale solar installations account for an estimated 48 GW (around 34%) of all solar capacity in the U.S. at the end of 2023. Nearly 8 GW of new small-scale solar capacity was brought online in 2023, representing a record 20% increase compared to 2022.\nDuring the past decade, small-scale solar capacity and generation have grown steadily, but at a slower pace than utility-scale. Small-scale capacity in 2023 was more than six times the amount compared to 2014; utility-scale saw an eight-fold increase. The EIA estimates that small-scale solar capacity could grow to 55 GW by the end of 2024.\nSmall-scale solar produced an estimated 73,619 GWh or about 31% of all solar generation in 2023 \u2014 compared to 164,502 GWh generated by utility-scale installations.\nCalifornia generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023, which accounts for around 41% of the state's total solar electricity generation for the year. On the East Coast, New York generated the most electricity from small-scale solar in 2023 (3,973 GWh) \u2014 accounting for nearly 62% of electricity generated from solar that year in the state. In the middle of the country, wind is typically a bigger source of electricity than solar; however, Illinois was the 10th highest small-scale solar generating state in 2023, with 1,536 GWh of electricity from small-scale operations \u2014 accounting for 44% of the state\u2019s solar electricity.\nUtility-scale solar accounts for around 8% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources (including renewables, nuclear, [1] and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas). In 2023, nearly4% of electricity in the U.S. was produced by utility-scale solar. A decade earlier in 2014, it accounted for less than 0.5% of the total electricity generated.\nCalifornia and Nevada are among the states for which utility-scale solar comprises a significant portion of the current electricity mix. In 2023, utility-scale solar contributed 19% (40,714 GWh) of electricity in California and 23% (9,733 GWh) of the electricity in Nevada.\nNevada\u2019s capacity for solar power is projected to increase during 2024, as the Gemini solar facility is scheduled to come online. The facility will add a planned 690 MW of solar capacity and 380 MW of battery storage \u2013 which is one way solar power facilities can capture and store some energy to meet evening electricity demand. It\u2019s expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational.\nNote: These data reflect total utility-scale energy sources only and exclude small-scale solar.\nSolar energy projects are bringing jobs and skills training to Nevada.

This means there was nearly eight times more solar capacity in 2023 than in 2014.\nThe amount of electricity produced from solar increased at a similar rate. In 2023, the U.S. generated over eight times more electricity from solar energy than in 2014 \u2014 an increase of more than 209,197 GWh or 723%.\nThe states with the most significant growth in solar capacity over the last 10 years include: California, which added 27,864 MW from 2014 to 2023; Texas (18,179 MW); Florida (10,203 MW); North Carolina (6,416 MW); and Nevada (4,313 MW).\nThese five states saw the most growth in generation, too (Table 2). Present-day data on solar capacity and generation reflect these strong historical growth trends, as these states were among the highest solar-generating states in 2023.\nState\nSolar Capacity Growth (MW)\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Capacity Growth\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Generation Growth (GWh)\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Generation Growth\n2014 to 2023\nCalifornia\n27,864\n324%\n54,210\n371%\nTexas\n18,179\n6,124%\n31,293\n7,016%\nFlorida\n10,203\n6,858%\n17,448\n4,833%\nNorth Carolina\n6,416\n874%\n11,282\n1,405%\nNevada\n4,313\n647%\n10,305\n922%\nUnited States total\n121,363\n688%\n209,197\n723%\nSolar and wind installations produce energy daily, year-round. Seasonal weather plays an important role. The amount of electricity generated is influenced, in part, by when the sun shines or the wind blows.\nSolar generation in the U.S. peaks in the summer, when days are long and the sun\u2019s rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly. In 2023, solar electricity produced from utility- and small-scale installations (combined) peaked (Figure 3) in July (26,626 GWh) and August (25,372 GWh).\nWind energy generation is typically highest during the spring. In 2023, the most wind energy was produced across the U.S. in March (44,580 GWh) and April (43,072 GWh) (Figure 4).\n01 / 01\nFigure 3: Monthly solar generation (GWh) in the U.S. in 2023. During 2023, U.S. solar electricity generation peaked in July (26,626 GWh).\nClimate Central\u2019s WeatherPower\u2122 tool produces daily estimates and forecasts of local solar and wind generation across the continental U.S. Daily forecasts from WeatherPower reflect the influence of weather on local solar and wind generation. WeatherPower data provide a snapshot of solar and wind energy across the U.S., at local scales, on any given day. It can be used to generate figures relevant to any state, media market, county, or congressional district in the continental U.S.\nThis WeatherPower graphic shows estimates and forecasts for solar generation in North Carolina in March 2024.\nWIND #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 148 GW from utility-scale onshore and offshore wind installations \u2014 an increase of 6 GW or 4% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 425,235 GWh of electricity from utility-scale wind installations. This represents a slight drop of 9,062 GWh or 2% compared to 2022 due to lower average wind speeds, mostly in the Midwest.\nMost wind energy in the U.S. is produced onshore, in the middle of the country. However coastal states can take advantage of offshore winds to generate electricity. Offshore wind currently makes up a small portion of the national electricity mix, but it has the potential to grow substantially in the coming decades.\nIn 2023, only two states (Rhode Island and Virginia) had operational offshore wind facilities, which contributed 42 MW to the total national wind capacity (148 GW). Offshore wind capacity has already grown early in 2024. Vineyard Wind, a wind installation off the coast of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, began operating in February 2024 with 68 MW of capacity. This facility will have 800 MW of capacity when fully operational, which could happen as soon as late 2024. In March 2024, South Fork Wind Farm off the coasts of New York and Rhode Island began operating with around 130 MW of capacity \u2014 making it the country\u2019s largest operational offshore wind installation.\nRising costs have challenged the economic viability of offshore wind installations, delaying some projects. Financial incentives such as those in the Inflation Reduction Act could ease some of the economic burden. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, state policies are poised to support development of nearly 43 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040.

As part of its commitment, the U.S. has set the following goals:\nBy 2030: reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels\nBy 2035: reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity\nBy 2050: achieving a net-zero emissions economy\nRecent landmark laws are fostering renewable energy growth and moving the U.S. toward its climate goals. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) contains hundreds of billions of dollars to boost clean energy and cut emissions. The IRA includes provisions such as tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives for renewable energy projects from the utility-scale to individual households.\nThe Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT), a project led by Princeton University scientists, estimates the potential impact of these policies, and tracks progress towards U.S. climate targets.By 2030, REPEAT estimates U.S. net annual emissions could be as low as 4.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2e), compared to 6.6 Gt CO2e in 2005: a reduction of around 40% compared to 2005 levels. Although this represents significant progress, the U.S. would still fall short of its 2030 target (50% below 2005 levels) (Figure 7).Solar and wind energy are key to reducing emissions and reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. If current policies are taken advantage of, a boom in solar and wind energy capacity is expected based on REPEAT analysis. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority (more than 50%) of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (Figure 8).In 12 states, wind and solar could make up over 80% of electricity capacity by 2035 by utilizing current policies. And New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming could have over 90% of their electricity capacity from wind and solar by 2035.\nExplore more data: State Solar and Wind Boom to Bring U.S. Toward Climate Targets\nMethodology #\nAll national and state-level data come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values for 2014-2022 are as reported in EIA\u2019s Historical State Data for each year. For 2023, utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values are for December 2023 as reported in EIA\u2019s Electric Power Monthly. Small-scale solar capacity for 2014-2022 are for December of each year, as reported in form EIA-861M. All generation values (wind, utility- and small-scale solar) for 2014-2022 come from EIA\u2019s electricity data browser.\nTo calculate the portion of total capacity and electricity generation contributed by solar and wind (as a percentage), we compared electricity capacity/generation for utility-scale solar and wind to all fuel sources and all energy sectors at the utility-scale level, which includes: renewable sources; nuclear; and fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar and wind 10-year growth is a direct comparison between capacity/generation in 2014 and 2023.\nClimate Central is an independent group of scientists and communicators who research and report the facts about our changing climate and how it affects people\u2019s lives.\nClimate Central is a policy-neutral 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\nNewsletter signup\nLooking for Climate Matters?

Yet, the cost of installing solar panels  remains a leading deterrent. The good news for residents of New York is that there are a variety of federal, state and local programs that can decrease the expense.\nFederal Solar Tax Credit (ITC)\nAlso known as the Investment Tax Credit  or Residential Clean Energy Credit, this federal incentive allows homeowners to get a tax credit for 30% of the cost of their fully installed solar panel system. Expenses include the materials and labor from your solar installation company. For example, if solar panels cost $10,000  to purchase and install, the credit will lower your tax bill by $3,000.\nThis tax credit recently increased to 30% from 26% and is approved through 2033. To be eligible, homeowners must own their solar panel system, and the credit can be claimed during the reporting period that follows the completion of the system. There is no cap on the amount that can be claimed.\nNew York State Solar Equipment Tax Credit\nThrough the New York State Solar Equipment Tax Credit, the state of New York offers a 25% tax credit for fully installed solar panel systems. This tax credit can be combined with the Federal Solar Tax Credit for even greater savings come tax season. Although there is a $5,000 limit on the credit, PPA or leased systems are eligible. (Unlike with the ITC.)\nThe tax credit is not refundable. In other words, if you don\u2019t owe money when filing taxes, you cannot get the credit refunded to you. However, the credit can roll over for up to five years.\nMegawatt Block Incentive\nOffered through the NY-Sun Initiative, the Megawatt Block Incentive  is available to homeowners in certain regions of the state. Savings are based on watts installed. For example, people in Upstate New York can get $0.30 per watt of solar  installed. That works out to be a refund of $2,400 for an 8 kW system.\nCurrently, only homeowners in Upstate or Con Edison regions can take advantage of this incentive. (Sorry, Long Islanders, the incentives for your area were recently phased out.) It\u2019s also important to note that systems must be installed by participating NY-Sun contractors and the cash back will come from the contractor.\nNY-Sun Initiative\nPart of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, the NY-Sun Initiative  oversees the Megawatt Block Incentive as well as other programs that can help lower the cost of installing solar. Many incentives come directly from solar installation contractors. The NY-Sun Initiative can direct interested homeowners to approved contractors.\nAmong other programs, one managed by the NY-Sun Initiative is the Affordable Solar Program  or EmPower+. This lowers the cost of installing solar panels for households where the earnings are 80% lower than the median income for the county.\nNet Metering\nNet metering programs in New York vary by utility company\u2014such as Con Edison, National Grid or PSE&G. Still, the broad strokes are the same: With net metering in place, solar users connected to the grid are able to \u201cbank\u201d excess solar energy with the utility company. Then, when the solar panels aren\u2019t producing enough to cover the home\u2019s energy needs (as is common during the winter months), the homeowners are able to pull from their bank and enjoy lower utility bills.\nNet metering in New York is available for residential systems less than 25 kW. There are monthly Consumer Benefit Contribution (CBC) charges set by the utility company, but these rates are pretty minimal.\nVDER Value Stack\nNew York is in the process of moving away from net metering and toward the Value of Distribution Energy Resource (VDER) Value Stack  model. This is a bit trickier to understand than net metering, but is essentially an alternative way to get credits based on the Value Stack Tariff. Whereas net metering just looks at one factor\u2014electricity exchanged\u2014VDER Value Stack takes into account energy value, environmental value, demand reduction value and more. Keep in mind that if you transition from net metering to VDER Value Stack, there is no going back.\nSales Tax Exemption\nThe sales tax in New York is 4%, but you don\u2019t have to take this into account when budgeting for solar panels thanks to the sales tax exemption. Although this isn\u2019t truly a saving based on the ticket price of solar panels, it does feel like saving money if you\u2019re used to paying sales taxes on other purchases.\nFor example, if you bought a large furniture item for $5,000, the total price with sales tax would come to $5,200. Hpwever, solar panels purchased for $5,000 truly cost $5,000.\nProperty Tax Exemption\nPer the Clean Energy Systems Exception under the New York State Real Property Tax Law, solar energy systems will not cause property taxes to increase for a period of 15 years. In other words, the installation of solar panels will not be factored into property tax calculations. The good news: Installing solar panels can increase your home value in terms of resale, even while you don\u2019t have to pay increased property taxes.\nCompare Quotes From Top-rated Solar Panel Installers\nSelect a State To Get Started With Your No Commitment, Free Estimate\nNew York Solar Panels Cost\nAt an average cost of $3.07 per watt  for an installed solar panel, the initial expense associated with going solar in New York is on the higher side.\nBenefits of Going Solar\nInstalling solar panels is advantageous for multiple reasons\u2014including lower energy bills, reduced carbon footprint and improved home value.\nIs It Worth Going Solar in New York?\nCounterintuitive as it may seem, the best states to go solar aren\u2019t always the ones that get the most sunlight. Rather, states like New York that offer generous incentives to offset the expense of installing solar panels can make the investments more palatable. Between the stackable federal and state solar tax credits and the variety of other local incentives, there is a strong case for switching to solar power in New York.\nThat said, it\u2019s not right for everyone\u2014even if the budget allows for solar panels. To see the most savings from your solar panels, it helps to be in your home long-term, have clear exposure to the sun and have the space to install the proper amount of solar panels.\nBottom Line\nTo get the full picture of the cost of solar panels, it\u2019s important to take the available incentives into account. In New York, federal, state and local incentives can greatly reduce the cost of installing solar panels.\nLocal Solar Companies By City\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nDoes New York State have solar incentives?\nYes, New York State has some of the most attractive state-based solar incentives in the country\u2014starting with the New York State Solar Equipment Tax Credit and other incentives offered through the NY-Sun Initiative.\nIs solar exempt from property tax in NY?\nYes, under the Clean Energy Systems Exemption, solar panel installation cannot cause property value assessments to increase for a period of 15 years.\nAre solar panels worth the money?\nThere\u2019s no denying that installing solar panels is a significant investment. However, it is an investment that can pay for itself in time while helping the environment. In New York, in particular, the case for solar panels is even stronger because of the incentives that can help bring down the costs. Not to mention that electricity is more expensive than the national average in New York, so the savings potential with solar power is greater.\nWhat are the downfalls of solar power?\nAlthough solar power access and efficiency are ever-improving, there are some downfalls to keep in mind. Specifically, the upfront expense of installing solar panels remains high, although there are often financing options. Geographic location is also an obstacle, as solar panels need clear access to ample sunlight to operate.

The report 'A Decade of Growth in Solar and Wind Power: Trends Across the U.S.' shows that America's capacity to generate carbon-free electricity grew during 2023, with solar and wind accounting for more of the energy mix than ever before. In 2023, the U.S. generated 238,121 GWh of electricity from solar, more than eight times the amount in 2014. Wind power more than doubled, with 425,325 GWh generated in 2023. California and Texas were the top producers of solar power, with 68,816 GWh and 31,739 GWh respectively. Texas also led in wind power with 119,836 GWh. The report includes data on solar and wind power increases from 2022 to 2023, growth trends over the past decade, and the biggest producers of solar and wind energy. By the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 GW from solar installations, a 23% increase from 2022. Small-scale solar installations accounted for 48 GW of this capacity. California generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023. Utility-scale solar contributed 19% of California's electricity in 2023. The Gemini solar facility in Nevada is expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational. Wind energy generation in the U.S. peaked in March 2023 with 44,580 GWh. By the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 148 GW from wind installations. Offshore wind capacity grew early in 2024 with the Vineyard Wind and South Fork Wind Farm projects. Wind accounted for around 12% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources in 2023. Texas led in wind capacity and generation growth from 2022 to 2023. The U.S. added more than 83 GW of wind capacity during the last decade, an increase of around 130%. The U.S. aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. Recent laws like the Inflation Reduction Act are fostering renewable energy growth. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states.",

    "Summarized_Document3": "Despite having some of the cloudiest weather in the country, New York remains one of the best states for installing solar panels due to the great incentives. By switching to solar in 2024, homeowners in New York can take advantage of ongoing federal, state, and local incentives, including tax credits, rebates, and beneficial net metering policies. Most incentive programs are only authorized for a certain period or until funding runs out, so it's wise to take advantage when you can.\n\n**New York Solar Incentives Available in 2024**\n\n- **Investment Tax Credit (ITC)**: Homeowners can get a tax credit for 30% of the cost of installed solar panels.\n- **New York State Solar Equipment Tax Credit**: Residents can get a tax credit equal to 25% of qualified solar energy expenses.\n- **Megawatt Block Incentive**: Led by the NY-Sun program, New Yorkers can get a rebate based on wattage.\n- **NY-Sun Initiative**: A statewide program offering numerous incentives to help with financing options.\n- **Net Metering**: Homeowners can sell back excess energy produced by solar panels to their utility company to earn credits on future bills.\n- **VDER Value Stack**: An alternative to net metering, allowing homeowners to earn credits for energy produced.\n- **Sales Tax Exemption**: Solar panels purchased in New York are exempt from state sales taxes.\n- **Property Tax Exemption**: Property value assessments are prohibited from increasing due to solar panel installation for 15 years.\n\n**Federal Solar Tax Credit (ITC)**\n\nThis federal incentive allows homeowners to get a tax credit for 30% of the cost of their fully installed solar panel system. For example, if solar panels cost $10,000 to purchase and install, the credit will lower your tax bill by $3,000. This tax credit is approved through 2033 and can be claimed during the reporting period that follows the completion of the system.\n\n**New York State Solar Equipment Tax Credit**\n\nThe state offers a 25% tax credit for fully installed solar panel systems, with a $5,000 limit on the credit. This tax credit can be combined with the Federal Solar Tax Credit for greater savings. The credit can roll over for up to five years if not fully utilized in one tax year.\n\n**Megawatt Block Incentive**\n\nOffered through the NY-Sun Initiative, this incentive is available to homeowners in certain regions of the state. For example, people in Upstate New York can get $0.30 per watt of solar installed, resulting in a refund of $2,400 for an 8 kW system. Systems must be installed by participating NY-Sun contractors.\n\n**NY-Sun Initiative**\n\nThis initiative oversees the Megawatt Block Incentive and other programs that can help lower the cost of installing solar. The Affordable Solar Program or EmPower+ lowers the cost of installing solar panels for households earning 80% less than the median income for the county.\n\n**Net Metering**\n\nNet metering programs in New York vary by utility company but generally allow solar users to bank excess solar energy with the utility company. This banked energy can be used when the solar panels aren\u2019t producing enough to cover the home\u2019s energy needs, resulting in lower utility bills.\n\n**VDER Value Stack**\n\nNew York is transitioning from net metering to the VDER Value Stack model, which provides credits based on multiple factors, including energy value, environmental value, and demand reduction value.\n\n**Sales Tax Exemption**\n\nSolar panels purchased in New York are exempt from the state\u2019s 4% sales tax, reducing the overall cost of solar panel installation.\n\n**Property Tax Exemption**\n\nUnder the Clean Energy Systems Exception, solar energy systems will not cause property taxes to increase for 15 years, even though installing solar panels can increase home value in terms of resale.\n\n**New York Solar Panels Cost**\n\nThe average cost of installed solar panels in New York is $3.07 per watt, which is on the higher side.\n\n**Benefits of Going Solar**\n\nInstalling solar panels can lead to lower energy bills, a reduced carbon footprint, and improved home value.\n\n**Is It Worth Going Solar in New York?**\n\nNew York offers generous incentives to offset the expense of installing solar panels, making the investment more palatable. However, it\u2019s not right for everyone. To see the most savings, it helps to be in your home long-term, have clear exposure to the sun, and have the space to install the proper amount of solar panels.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nFederal, state, and local incentives in New York can greatly reduce the cost of installing solar panels, making it a worthwhile investment for many homeowners.",

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures.  Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here.  If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below.  The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA.  There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.\u00a0For many years I have calculated, studied and worked with carbon footprints, and Shrink That Footprint is that interest come to life.\nI have an Economics degree from\u00a0UCL, have previously worked as an energy efficiency analyst at\u00a0BNEF\u00a0and continue to work as a strategy consultant at\u00a0Maneas. \u00a0I have consulted to numerous clients in energy and finance, as well as the World Economic Forum.\nWhen I\u2019m not crunching carbon footprints you\u2019ll often find me helping my two year old son tend to the tomatoes, salad and peppers growing in our upcycled greenhouse.\n2 thoughts on \u201cAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\u201d\nHello Lindsay,\nI read your information to confirm data about energy usage around the world. Thanks for all your research on energy. You may be interested on my company and my invention, patented and prototype only 10% fuel used. I have problems with marketing due to my small town in West Virginia.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023.

    "Document2": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit.\nThis novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level.\nAlthough this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates.\nPhoto from iStock 157317957 Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock.\n2 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d1 in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014 communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities.\nHousing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%.2 1 DOE\u2019s working definition of disadvantaged is based on cumulative burden and includes data for 36 burden indicators collected at the census tract level. These burden indicators can be grouped across four categories: energy burden, environmental and climate hazards, fossil dependence, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. https://www.energy.gov/diversity/justice40-initiative 2 According to Elevate analysis of 2014 data from Cook County property assessor.\n3 According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/fmr98/sect8.html 4 https://resilient.chicago.gov/ Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]3), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety.\nWe selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1.\nCommunity Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago,4 the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs.\n3 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Table 1.

The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2.\nHigh-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3.\nA co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat Table 2.

The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history.8,9 Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan10 identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency.\nPaired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as 8 Cusick, Daniel. 2020. \u201cChicago Learned Climate Lessons from Its Deadly 1995 Heat Wave.\u201d Scientific American. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chicago-learned-climate-lessons-from-its-deadly-1995-heat-wave1/ 9 Thomas, Mike. 2015. \u201cChicago\u2019s Deadly 1995 Heat Wave: An Oral History.\u201d Chicago Magazine. https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/July-2015/1995-Chicago-heat-wave/ 10 City of Chicago. 2022a.

This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago.

CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool.11 These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago.\nIn addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study.\n11 https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/cambium.html How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types.

This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings.\nHomes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry 12 City of Chicago. 2022b. Chicago Recovery Plan. https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/chicago-recovery-plan/home.html construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction.\n\u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps.\n\u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid.\nAlong with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

In San Francisco, CA, the average monthly electric bill for residential customers is $456/month, which is calculated by multiplying the average monthly consumption by the average electric rate: 1,010 kWh * 45 \u00a2/kWh.\nElectric bills are designed to cover all of the costs of producing the electricity that you use, of running and maintaining the electrical grid to help prevent outages, and of any public benefit funds that promote things like renewable energy and energy efficiency. These costs are rolled into both fixed charges (i.e., monthly customer charges) and variable charges (i.e., \u00a2/kWh that you use). While fixed charges will remain the same from month to month, the portion of variable charges on your bill each month will change based on how much electricity you use. As a result, there are two ways to reduce your bills: by either\n                using less electricity\n                or by reducing the cost of electricity, by installing solar for instance.\nElectric rates in San Francisco, CA\nThe easiest way to compare the cost of electricity from one region to another is to look at the electricity rate. Residential rates in the U.S. range from 6 \u00a2/kWh to 71 \u00a2/kWh depending upon where you live, what types of power plants provide your electricity, and when during the day or year you\u2019re consuming electricity.\nThe average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 45 \u00a2/kWh, which is 25% higher than the average electricity rate in California of 36.07 \u00a2/kWh. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 136% higher than the national average rate of 19 \u00a2/kWh.\nHow solar helps you save on electric bills\nSolar panel systems help you save money by reducing your monthly electric bills. Although a $50 or $100 electric bill might not seem like much when you pay it each month, those bills add up quickly over ten, twenty or even thirty years: if you pay $100 per month in electricity now, you\u2019ll pay over $93,000 on electricity over the next thirty years!\nAssuming a 5.9% annual increase based on inflation and average annual electric rate increases.\nInstalling solar allows you to reduce or even eliminate your electric bill: when you pay upfront for solar panels, you are effectively paying today for the electricity you\u2019ll use over the next 25 or even 30 years.\n                Calculating your savings from investing in solar\n                is as simple as subtracting the amount you pay for solar from what you would have paid for electricity otherwise.\nEnergySage can help you go solar and save!\nWe know electric bills add up over time, and going solar is a great way to save money while helping the environment.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Shrink That Footprint\n\nAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\n\nBy: Lindsay Wilson\n\nIntroduction \u2013 Electricity Used By A Home\n[Update 03/09/2024: we updated the average household electricity consumption figures using the latest data from EIA from 2023 which is current as of March 2024]\n\nAs of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year. This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day. Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.\n\nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\n\nWe use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures. The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding period.\n\nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10,204 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\n\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\n\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\n\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.\n\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\n\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\n\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\n\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\n\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\n\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh. We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\n\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\n\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\n\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\n\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\n\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. This figure increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\n\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.\n\nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023. This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it. Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d. What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much. Canada and United States really stand out. We included also the number of households. You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger. Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\n\nAcross the countries we chose to compare household electricity use varies enormously. The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\n\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\n\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\n\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\n\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\n\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. In India these are 66% and 5 respectively and in Nigeria 50% and 5. Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\n\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\n\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\n\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\n\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\n\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\n\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\n\nWhere Is Yours Like?\n\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\n\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow do you stack up?\n\nData Sources\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures. Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here. If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below. The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\n\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\n\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA. There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\n\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research. For many years I have calculated, studied and worked with carbon footprints, and Shrink That Footprint is that interest come to life.\n\nI have an Economics degree from UCL, have previously worked as an energy efficiency analyst at BNEF and continue to work as a strategy consultant at Maneas. I have consulted to numerous clients in energy and finance, as well as the World Economic Forum.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not crunching carbon footprints you\u2019ll often find me helping my two year old son tend to the tomatoes, salad and peppers growing in our upcycled greenhouse.\n\n2 thoughts on \u201cAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\u201d\n\nHello Lindsay,\n\nI read your information to confirm data about energy usage around the world.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit. This novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level. Although this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates. Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock. The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. Housing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%. Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety. We selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1. Community Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago, the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs. Estimation of Energy Savings Potential From Retrofit Programs Using NREL\u2019s ResStock Analysis Tool Of the dozen or so retrofit packages explored by Elevate and NREL, we selected three candidate packages designed to be cost-effective, code compliant, and having a high potential to reduce energy consumption. The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2. High-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3. A co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat waves. The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history. Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency. Paired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as the same building without the heat pump upgrade. This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago. Advanced retrofit packages with heat pumps have the potential to reduce Chicago\u2019s CO2 emissions by 2.5 million metric tons per year\u2014the equivalent of 500,000 cars taken off the road! If these two top packages (Package 2 and 3) are deployed in all 323,000 Chicago buildings from the five selected housing types, there would be significant energy savings, bill savings, and CO2 savings, as shown in Table 4. CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool. These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago. In addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study. How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types. At the time of release of this case study, the City of Chicago is directly investing $46 million from the Chicago Recovery Plan into energy and equity projects. Approximately half of this amount is reserved for retrofits in single-family and multifamily buildings. This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings. Homes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction. \u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps. \u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid. Along with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

Assuming a 5.9% annual increase in electricity prices and that you install your system with a $0-down loan, you can expect to save $5,500 in your first year, $30,800 over five years, $71,800 over 10 years, and $199,200 over 20 years on electric bills in San Francisco, CA. Over your system\u2019s lifetime you\u2019ll save more by financing your solar system with a cash purchase, but you won\u2019t start saving in year one. Learn more about how to finance your solar panel system.\n\nHow much can you save by going solar in San Francisco, CA?\n\nHow much can you save on electric bills with community solar in San Francisco, CA?\n\nEven if onsite solar doesn\u2019t make sense for you, you can still participate in the clean energy transition and save on your electric bills by subscribing to a community solar farm. Community solar programs in San Francisco, CA typically save you 5-15% in electricity costs over the course of the year. For the average electricity customer in San Francisco, CA, 10% annual savings would amount to $547 in savings per year.\n\nHow much can you save by subscribing to a community solar farm in San Francisco, CA?\n\nElectric bills in San Francisco, CA\n\nMonthly electric bills are a product of how much electricity you use per month and your electric rate. In San Francisco, CA, the average monthly electric bill for residential customers is $456/month, which is calculated by multiplying the average monthly consumption by the average electric rate: 1,010 kWh * 45 \u00a2/kWh. Electric bills are designed to cover all of the costs of producing the electricity that you use, of running and maintaining the electrical grid to help prevent outages, and of any public benefit funds that promote things like renewable energy and energy efficiency. These costs are rolled into both fixed charges (i.e., monthly customer charges) and variable charges (i.e., \u00a2/kWh that you use). While fixed charges will remain the same from month to month, the portion of variable charges on your bill each month will change based on how much electricity you use. As a result, there are two ways to reduce your bills: by either using less electricity or by reducing the cost of electricity, by installing solar for instance.\n\nElectric rates in San Francisco, CA\n\nThe easiest way to compare the cost of electricity from one region to another is to look at the electricity rate. Residential rates in the U.S. range from 6 \u00a2/kWh to 71 \u00a2/kWh depending upon where you live, what types of power plants provide your electricity, and when during the day or year you\u2019re consuming electricity. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 45 \u00a2/kWh, which is 25% higher than the average electricity rate in California of 36.07 \u00a2/kWh. The average residential electricity rate in San Francisco, CA is 136% higher than the national average rate of 19 \u00a2/kWh.\n\nHow solar helps you save on electric bills\n\nSolar panel systems help you save money by reducing your monthly electric bills. Although a $50 or $100 electric bill might not seem like much when you pay it each month, those bills add up quickly over ten, twenty or even thirty years: if you pay $100 per month in electricity now, you\u2019ll pay over $93,000 on electricity over the next thirty years! Assuming a 5.9% annual increase based on inflation and average annual electric rate increases. Installing solar allows you to reduce or even eliminate your electric bill: when you pay upfront for solar panels, you are effectively paying today for the electricity you\u2019ll use over the next 25 or even 30 years. Calculating your savings from investing in solar is as simple as subtracting the amount you pay for solar from what you would have paid for electricity otherwise.\n\nEnergySage can help you go solar and save!\n\nWe know electric bills add up over time, and going solar is a great way to save money while helping the environment.

series whenever new monthly data are added; the inclusion of the most recent LFS data in the calculation process; update of seasonal adjustment models with complete annual data.\nCompared with the rates published in News Release of 3 April 2024, the February 2024 unemployment rate for the EU has been revised from 6.0% to 6.1%, while the unemployment rate for the euro area remained unchanged. Among EU Member States, the rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) upwards for Spain (by 0.3 pp) as well as for Finland and Sweden (by 0.2 pp each). The rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) downwards for Greece (by 0.2 pp).\nCountry notes\nGermany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden as well as Iceland and Norway: the trend component is used instead of the more volatile seasonally adjusted data.\nEstonia and Portugal: 3-month moving averages of LFS data are used instead of pure monthly indicators.\nMethods and definitions\nEurostat publishes harmonised unemployment rates for individual EU Member States, the euro area and the EU. These unemployment rates are based on the definition recommended by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The measurement is based on a harmonised data source, the European Union Labour Force Survey (LFS).\nBased on the ILO definition, Eurostat defines unemployed persons as persons aged 15 to 74 who:\nare without work;\nare available to start work within the next two weeks;\nand have actively sought employment at some time during the previous four weeks.\nThe unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force.\nThe labour force is the total number of people employed plus unemployed. In this news release unemployment rates are based on employment and unemployment data covering persons aged 15 to 74.\nThe youth unemployment rate is the number of people aged 15 to 24 unemployed as a percentage of the labour force of the same age. Therefore, the youth unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the share of jobless people in the overall youth population.\nWhen data for the most recent month are not available for a Member State, EU and EA aggregates are calculated using the latest data available for that Member State.\nGeographical information\nEuro area (EA20): Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.\nEuropean Union (EU27): Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden.\nFor more information\nEurostat website section on employment and unemployment\nEurostat database section on unemployment, including non-seasonally adjusted and trend data\nStatistics Explained articles on unemployment\nEurostat metadata on adjusted unemployment series\nEuro indicators dashboard\nRelease calendar for Euro indicators\nEuropean Statistics Code of Practice\nGet in touch\nMedia requests\n\n\n\n\nEurostat Media Support\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 33 408\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: eurostat-mediasupport@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nFurther information on data\n\n\n\n\nThibaut HENRION\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 31 686\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevena CHOLAKOVA\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 35 304\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: estat-monthly-unemployment@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nShare the release\n\nWas this page useful?                \nIf you do not wish to provide more detailed feedback, please just click on the \u201cSubmit\u201d button to send your response. \n\nNeed help?                    \n\nFollow us                    \n\nContact the EU                    \n\nSocial media                    \n\nLegal                    \n\nEU institutions                    \n\n                        EU institutions\n                    \n",

In Q2 2024, the economy grew 4.7%, down from 5.3% in Q1 and lower than market expectations. Extreme weather, adjustments to calculations of the value of the financial industry, and sluggish domestic demand weighed on economic growth. \u2022 The momentum of consumption slowed down with a decline in income growth. The growth of retail sales fell to 2.6% in Q2 2024 from 4.7% in Q1. At its July meeting, the Politburo pointed out that consumption would be the core engine to boost domestic demand. Consumption is expected to recover moderately in H2 2024. \u2022 Manufacturing investments held up relatively well, with a growth rate of 9.3% in Q2 2024. The expansion of equipment renewals is expected to sustain robust growth in manufacturing investment. \u2022 Growth in infrastructure investment dropped slightly to 7.2% in Q2 2024 from 8.8% in Q1. Government investment slowed down due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. With issuances of local government special bonds and extra long-term special treasury bonds speeding up, however, infrastructure investment is expected to remain robust.\n\u2022 The property market is still struggling with weak sales and sluggish investment. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2 2024. To further raise housing demand and promote activity in the property market, policies to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory will be implemented in H2 2024.\n\u2022 Thanks to continuous improvement in external demand, exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with robust growth of 5.8% YoY in Q2. China\u2019s trade with emerging markets has seen fast growth, reflecting strengthened regional collaborations. Meanwhile, the optimisation of the structure of export commodities continues. Exports are expected to remain resilient through 2024. \u2022 Overall, driven by the implementation of equipment renewal policies and the recovery of external demand, China\u2019s GDP growth remained relatively stable in H1 2024. However, it is worth noting that domestic demand is still insufficient. The downturn in prices has had a direct effect on incomes, corporate profits and fiscal revenues, constraining spending. In addition, growing foreign trade tensions may weigh on China\u2019s exports. The government is expected to adopt a more accommodative macro policy stance in H2 2024 to facilitate the recovery of economic growth. 3 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

China\u2019s economic recovery momentum slowed down in Q2 Growth rate of major economic indicators, YoY, % Source: Wind, KPMG analysis Note: growth of GDP, industrial production, and income per capita are in real terms, and others are in nominal terms. \u2022 China\u2019s GDP grew 5% year-on-year in H1 2024, reaching the target set at the Two Sessions. However, the growth rate in Q2 dropped to 4.7% in Q2 from 5.3% in Q1, which was lower than expectations. Beyond challenges posed by extreme weather, the slowdown reflected sluggish domestic demand.\n\u2022 The contribution of consumption to GDP fell from 73.7% in Q1 to 46.5% in Q2. Retail sales growth plummeted to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1 due to weakness in incomes. Fixed asset investment growth dropped to 3.6% in Q2, with activity in the real estate market remaining subdued and infrastructure investment constrained by shortages in fiscal funds.\n\u2022 Export growth picked up from 1.5% in Q1 to 5.8% in Q2 due to a lower base and robust external demand. 2020-23 Average 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2024 Q1 2024 Q2 GDP 4.8% 6.3% 4.9% 5.2% 5.3% 4.7% Industrial production 5.0% 4.5% 4.2% 5.2% 6.1% 5.9% Retail sales 4.1% 10.7% 4.2% 8.3% 4.7% 2.6% Fixed asset investment 4.4% 3.1% 1.9% 2.7% 4.5% 3.6% Exports 9.0% -4.9% -9.9% -1.2% 1.5% 5.8% Imports 6.4% -7.0% -8.5% 0.9% 1.6% 2.5% Income per capita 4.8% 8.3% 6.1% 6.7% 6.2% 4.2% Fiscal revenue 4.6% 31.7% -0.9% -1.0% -2.3% -3.2% Fiscal expenditures 3.7% 1.0% 4.1% 9.2% 2.9% 1.1% 4 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Extreme weather and weak demand still weighed on production side Manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMI Source: Wind, KPMG analysis \u2022 The manufacturing PMI has been below 50 for the past three months, since April, and fell to 49.4 in July. The divergence between production and demand recovery persisted. The production index dropped 0.5 to 50.1 while the new orders index fell to 49.3 in July, declining below the 50 point mark. A reading under 50 indicates a contraction.\n\u2022 The non-manufacturing sector also slowed down. Affected by extreme weather, construction activity slowed in July and the Construction PMI dropped 1.1 points to 51.2. With capital markets and the real estate industry still sluggish, the services PMI index dropped to 50, reaching its lowest level for the year.\n20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Manufacturing Construction and Services 5 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Consumption slowed as residents\u2019 income growth declined Growth of retail sales by category, YoY, % \u2022 Consumption has continued a pattern of differentiated recovery since 2023, with services sales increasing 7.5% YoY in H1 2024, 4.3 percentage points higher than goods sales growth. Robust sales of non-discretionary consumer goods and higher-quality goods contributed to consumption. Retail sales of property-related goods improved to varying degrees, driven mainly by relaxed real estate policies and effective trade-in policies of consumer goods.\n\u2022 The government has identified boosting domestic demand through consumption as a key focus in H2 2024. It sees service consumption as an important lever to expand and upgrade consumption, supporting sectors including culture and tourism, elderly care, housekeeping, childcare, etc.\nSource: Wind, KPMG analysis.

Consumers showed increased appetite for spending, but faced constraints on purchasing power Residents\u2019 propensity to consume, % \u2022 Residents\u2019 consumption propensity rate was 68.5% in Q2 2024, up 1.3 percentage points from the average for the same period in 2020-2023. But it remained below the average of 71.0% for the same period of 2014-2019, indicating room for improvement. \u2022 The slowdown in consumption growth was primarily due to slower income growth, as the per capita disposable income increased by 5.4% YoY in H1 2024.

Here are some takeaways from the decision and from remarks by the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell.\n\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision lowers rates to about 4.9 percent, down from a more than two-decade high.\n\n\nFed officials lowered interest rates because they are confident that inflation is coming back down to their 2 percent goal, and now they want to prevent the job market from softening further.\n\n\nCentral bankers expect to cut interest rates more in the months to come, but they are not on a preset path, Mr. Powell said. They could speed up if the economy is weak and slow down if it\u2019s strong.\n\n\nThe Fed is keeping a wary eye on the uptick in unemployment, but for now it thinks the economy is basically strong.\n\n\nThe Fed is feeling \u201cgrowing confidence\u201d that it can pull off the soft economic landing by lowering interest rates.\n\n\nIn short, the Fed has pivoted to its rate cutting era, and there is more to come.\n\n\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 4:04 p.m. ET\nDanielle Kaye\nReporting from New York\nThe S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both closed roughly 0.3 percent lower, a modest drop, after rising earlier in the day on the news of the half-percentage rate cut. Overall, the market doesn\u2019t seem spooked by the larger-than-usual rate cut. Investors had already bet on this bigger move, and the Fed\u2019s messaging \u2013 that it wasn\u2019t an emergency cut \u2013 also offered reassurance.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:46 p.m. ET\nAlan Rappeport\nReporting from Washington\nVice President Kamala Harris is out with a statement that makes clear she is not ready to declare \u201cmission accomplished\u201d on inflation. \u201cWhile this announcement is welcome news for Americans who have borne the brunt of high prices, my focus is on the work ahead to keep bringing prices down,\u201d she said.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:23 p.m. ET\nJeanna Smialek\nReporting from Washington\nPowell has finished his press conference.

Many economists said at the time that the report showed that the Fed should have cut rates \u2014 and Powell just suggested he agrees with them. If they had gotten the jobs report before their meeting, he said, \u201cwe might well have\u201d cut rates.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nOne interpretation of today\u2019s half-point cut is that it is making up for the quarter-point cut the Fed didn\u2019t make in July.

He says that the process has been slower than expected, but that data suggests that rents are easing, and that he is confident housing inflation will ultimately cool.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:07 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nThe \u2018dot plot\u2019 shows more rate cuts are coming, but disagreement on how many.\nFederal Reserve officials agree that Wednesday\u2019s rate cut is unlikely to be their last. They are much less united on how far or how quickly they will decide to lower rates moving forward.\nThe chart below, known as the \u201cdot plot,\u201d helps tell the story.

That suggests those officials expect to make more modest, quarter-size cuts in each of the two meetings they have scheduled for the rest of the year.\nBut seven policymakers expect just one more cut this year, and two officials expect none. At the other end of the spectrum, one official expects the Fed to cut rates by another three-quarters of a point this year, suggesting another supersize reduction in either November or December.\nAll 19 officials expect rates to be lower at the end of next year than they are now. But their estimates of how much lower vary widely, from about 2.9 percent (two full percentage points below where they are after Wednesday\u2019s action) to 4.1 percent (just three-quarters of a point below where they are now). There is an even wider range of views in 2026 and 2027.\nEventually, most officials expect interest rates to settle between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent. That\u2019s higher than in the decade before the pandemic, when the Fed\u2019s target interest rate never topped 2.5 percent \u2014 suggesting we may not soon return to the era of ultralow rates that prevailed after the Great Recession.\nShow more\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:04 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell tries to make clear that the politics of cutting rates right before a presidential election is not something the Fed thinks about, even though Trump has said any move ahead of November would be political. \u201cThis really concentrates the mind,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t put up any other filters. If you start doing that, I don\u2019t know where you stop.\u201d\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:02 p.m. ET\nJim Tankersley\nReporting from Washington\nNo surprise that Powell was asked about the political optics of this decision. And no surprise his answer is, what we care about it doing the best thing for the American people and the economy.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:02 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nIs the era of ultralow interest rates gone for good? Powell seems to think so. \u201cWe\u2019re probably not going back to that era where there are trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds being issued at negative rates,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cMy own sense is that we\u2019re not going back to that.\u201d\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell is asked about whether he would be content if the economy continued to add around 100,000 jobs a month, and he responds that it depends on how many people are entering the labor market. The high rate of immigration in recent years has raised that so-called \u201cbreakeven rate,\u201d which is the pace at which employers need to add jobs to prevent the unemployment rate from rising further \u2014 some have estimated it\u2019s now about 175,000 jobs a month.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nJeanna Smialek\nReporting from Washington\nPowell is making very sure to emphasize that the job market is still strong today. He\u2019s walking a tricky line here. There were some concerns coming into this press conference that investors would read a big rate cut today as a sign that the Fed was freaking out about the job market. Powell is pushing back on that with all of this confident talk.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nIt\u2019s striking how many of the questions in the news conference so far have focused on the job market, rather than inflation. It\u2019s another sign of how the narrative around the economy has shifted.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:58 p.m. ET\nTalmon Joseph Smith\nPowell mentioned that average wage growth for workers is still somewhat above what most officials see as being \u201cconsistent with price stability.\u201d One of the things I\u2019ll be watching in the next several months, though, is whether inflation continues to slowly cool even as wage growth remains strong. That may be viewed as a pleasant surprise.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:54 p.m. ET\nDanielle Kaye\nReporting from New York\nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said markets \u201ccan and should only celebrate today\u2019s move \u2013 and will continue to celebrate over coming months.\u201d The S&P 500 hovered near its record high this afternoon, and the index is now up roughly 0.5 percent as Powell speaks.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:54 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nPowell notes that layoffs are still low. But as I explained in a story last week, low layoffs don\u2019t necessarily indicate a healthy labor market. It is the rate of hiring, more than the rate of layoffs, that often drives fluctuations in unemployment.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:53 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell is leaning into the argument that a strong labor market is a good time to cut rates. \u201cThere is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when it\u2019s strong, and not when you begin to see the layoffs,\u201d he said, noting that initial claims for unemployment insurance are pretty flat.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:52 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nPowell acknowledges that the labor market is, by many measures, weaker than it was immediately before the pandemic.

However, the growth rate in Q2 2024 dropped to 4.7% from 5.3% in Q1, falling short of market expectations due to extreme weather, adjustments in financial industry valuations, and sluggish domestic demand. Retail sales growth fell to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1, reflecting a slowdown in income growth. Manufacturing investments grew by 9.3% in Q2, supported by equipment renewals, while infrastructure investment growth dropped to 7.2% from 8.8% in Q1 due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2, with policies expected to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory in H2 2024. Exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with a robust 5.8% growth in Q2, driven by strong external demand and regional collaborations. Despite stable GDP growth in H1 2024, domestic demand remains insufficient, and foreign trade tensions may impact exports. The government is expected to adopt more accommodative macro policies in H2 2024 to support economic recovery. The manufacturing PMI has been below 50 since April, indicating contraction, while the non-manufacturing sector also slowed due to extreme weather. Consumption growth slowed as residents' income growth declined, with the per capita disposable income increasing by 5.4% YoY in H1 2024. Manufacturing investment growth was driven by exports and equipment renewals, despite a slight drop to 9.3% in Q2 from 9.9% in Q1. Infrastructure investment growth fell to 7.2% in Q2 from 8.8% in Q1, constrained by extreme weather and fiscal funding shortages. General fiscal revenue growth dropped to -7.2% YoY in Q2, leading to a reduction in government expenditures. Property sales showed limited improvement, with investment growth dropping to -10.5% in Q2. Liquidity pressure on property developers persisted, with funding sources growth picking up slightly to -22.6% in H1 2024. CPI rose by 0.2% YoY in June 2024, while PPI decline narrowed, indicating moderate inflation expectations. Growth of total social financing slowed, with new bank loans decreasing by RMB 3.1 trillion in H1 2024. The central bank cut key interest rates to signal accommodative policies. Exports to major trading partners grew, with ASEAN remaining the largest trading partner. The export commodity structure continued to optimize, with mechanical and electrical products leading growth. FDI into China decreased by 29.1% YoY in H1 2024, while ODI grew by 19.5%. The RMB exchange rate remained stable despite global monetary policy divergence.

    "Summarized_Document3": "The Federal Reserve announced a significant interest rate cut on September 18, 2024, reducing rates by half a percentage point. This decision lowered the rates to approximately 4.9 percent, down from a more than two-decade high. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that future rate cuts would be considered on a 'meeting by meeting' basis, reflecting confidence that inflation is moving towards the 2 percent target. The Fed aims to prevent further softening of the job market while maintaining economic stability. Despite the larger-than-usual rate cut, the market reaction was modest, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closing about 0.3 percent lower. Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged the positive impact on inflation but stressed the need for continued efforts to reduce prices. Some economists believe the Fed's decision compensates for not cutting rates in July, following a disappointing jobs report. The 'dot plot' indicates that more rate cuts are expected, though there is disagreement among Fed officials on the extent and timing. Most officials anticipate rates to settle between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent in the long term, higher than pre-pandemic levels. Powell dismissed political considerations, focusing on the economic benefits of the rate cut. He also noted that the era of ultralow interest rates is likely over, and the labor market remains strong despite some weaknesses compared to pre-pandemic conditions.",

It measures everything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts, concert tickets and household appliances.\nPerhaps the \"most encouraging\" news for consumers is that inflation for household necessities has cooled dramatically, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\n\"The prices for staples \u00e2\u20ac\u201d food at home, gasoline, new-lease rents \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they haven't changed in about a year,\" Zandi said. \"So people are paying the same for those staples today that they were a year ago.\"\nThe April inflation reading is down significantly from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, which was the highest level since 1981.\nHowever, it remains above policymakers' long-term target, around 2%.\n\"We continue to expect inflation to grind lower in the months ahead as input cost pressures ease and more tepid consumer demand makes it harder [for businesses] to raise prices,\" Sarah House and Aubrey George, economists at Wells Fargo Economics, wrote in a note this week.\nHowever, additional improvements are likely to be \"slow-going,\" they wrote.\nGood sign for Fed interest rate cut in September\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve uses inflation data to help guide its interest rate policy. It raised interest rates to their\u00c2\u00a0highest level\u00c2\u00a0in 23 years during the Covid-19 pandemic era, pushing up borrowing costs for consumers and businesses in a bid to tame inflation.\nLast month, Fed officials forecast they would start cutting rates by the end of 2024.\n\"All indications are inflation has moderated, is back close to the Fed's target and consistent with a rate cut in September,\" Zandi said.\nGasoline prices weigh on inflation\nGasoline played a large role in June's inflation pullback.\nPrices fell 3.8% in June relative to May, according to CPI data. That follows a 3.6% decline the prior month.\n\"Tepid gasoline demand, increasing supply, and falling oil costs\" have led to weaker gas prices, AAA wrote in June.\nMore from Personal Finance:Why Fed policy may make your next trip abroad more expensiveInflation largely isn't Biden or Trump's fault, say economistsMore Americans are struggling even as inflation cools\nAverage U.S. pump prices fell to $3.48 a gallon as of July 1, down from $3.52 on June 3, according to weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration.\nGasoline prices are down 2.5% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nThere has also been a broad pullback in prices at the grocery store.\n\"Food at home\" prices have risen just 1.1% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nConsumers have more \"breathing room\" at the store amid \"growing promotional activity\" among retailers, while a few \"major\" companies recently announced price cuts \"that are likely to pressure competitors' pricing,\" wrote economists House and George.\n'Core' CPI at lowest level in three years\nWhile annual data on inflation trends is helpful, economists generally recommend looking at monthly numbers as a better guide of short-term movements and prevailing trends.\nThey also generally like to examine \"core\" inflation readings. They strip out food and energy prices, which can be volatile from month to month.\nThe monthly core CPI reading was 0.1% in June, the smallest increase in about three years, since August 2021. It has declined for three consecutive months, from 0.4% in March. To get back to target, economists say the monthly reading should consistently be in the range of about 0.2%.\n\"Core\" CPI has risen 3.3% since June 2023, the smallest 12-month gain since April 2021.\nHousing is the largest component of core CPI and therefore has an outsized effect on inflation readings. It has accounted for nearly 70% of the total 12-month increase in core CPI.\nShelter inflation has moderated much slower than expected, one of the big reasons inflation has not yet fallen back to target, economists said.\nThe shelter index lags broader trends in the rental market due to how the government constructs it.\nHowever, economists expect shelter to throttle back further since inflation for market rents has plummeted. For example, the annual inflation rate for new rental contracts sunk to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d lower than its pre-pandemic baseline \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from record highs of around 12% just two years earlier, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nThere were encouraging signals in the latest CPI report. Monthly shelter inflation dropped to 0.2% after being stuck at 0.4% for four consecutive months. It was the smallest monthly gain since August 2021.\n\"It should continue to cool off,\" said Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.\n\"It just takes time,\" he added.\nServices inflation is the trouble spot\nInflation for physical goods spiked as the U.S. economy reopened in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, while Americans spent more on their homes and less on services such as dining out and entertainment.\nIt is a different story now. Goods inflation has largely normalized, while services is a fly in the ointment.\n\"The goods side looks very benign at the moment,\" said Olivia Cross, a North America economist at Capital Economics. \"Where there's work to be done is in some areas of core services and in shelter.\"\nFor example, prices for services such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care jumped a \"notable\" 19.5% and 3.3% since June 2023, respectively, the BLS said.\nA surge in new and used car prices a few years ago is likely now fueling high inflation for car insurance and repair, since it generally costs more to insure and repair pricier cars, economists said.\nIt also takes a long time \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a year, two or even three \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for higher labor costs in health care to translate to CPI readings due to a long contracting process, Zandi said. Higher pandemic-era wages in health care are now nudging up medical care CPI and will likely do so over the coming year, he said.\nThe services sector is generally more sensitive to inflationary pressures in the labor market such as strong wage growth.\nRecord-high demand for workers as the pandemic-era economy reopened pushed wage growth to its highest level in decades. The labor market has since cooled and wage growth has declined, though it remains above its pre-pandemic level.\n\"Inflationary pressure from the labor market has dissipated quite strongly,\" Cross said.\nDon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss these insights from CNBC PRO\nGot a confidential news tip?

In March 2024, the youth unemployment rate was 14.6% in the EU, down from 14.7% in February 2024, and 14.1% in the euro area, down from 14.4% in the previous month.\nCompared with February 2024, youth unemployment decreased by 11\u00a0thousand in the EU and by 30 thousand in the euro area.\nCompared with March 2023, youth unemployment increased by 150 thousand in the EU and by 36 thousand in the euro area.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nUnemployment by sex\nIn March 2024, the unemployment rate for women was 6.4% in the EU, stable compared with February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 5.7%, down from 5.8% in the previous month. In the euro area, the unemployment rate for women was 7.0%, stable compared with February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 6.0%, down from 6.1% in the previous month.\nAdditional labour market indicators\nThe estimates in this News Release are based on the globally used International Labour Organisation (ILO) standard definition of unemployment, which counts as unemployed people without a job who have been actively seeking work in the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks.\nTo capture in full the labour market situation, the data on unemployment have been complemented by additional indicators, e.g. underemployed part-time workers, persons seeking work but not immediately available and persons available to work but not seeking, released together with LFS data for the fourth quarter of 2023.\nLFS data for the first quarter of 2024 will be released on 14 June 2024.\nTables\nSeasonally adjusted unemployment, totals\n\nRates

series whenever new monthly data are added; the inclusion of the most recent LFS data in the calculation process; update of seasonal adjustment models with complete annual data.\nCompared with the rates published in News Release of 3 April 2024, the February 2024 unemployment rate for the EU has been revised from 6.0% to 6.1%, while the unemployment rate for the euro area remained unchanged. Among EU Member States, the rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) upwards for Spain (by 0.3 pp) as well as for Finland and Sweden (by 0.2 pp each). The rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) downwards for Greece (by 0.2 pp).\nCountry notes\nGermany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden as well as Iceland and Norway: the trend component is used instead of the more volatile seasonally adjusted data.\nEstonia and Portugal: 3-month moving averages of LFS data are used instead of pure monthly indicators.\nMethods and definitions\nEurostat publishes harmonised unemployment rates for individual EU Member States, the euro area and the EU. These unemployment rates are based on the definition recommended by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The measurement is based on a harmonised data source, the European Union Labour Force Survey (LFS).\nBased on the ILO definition, Eurostat defines unemployed persons as persons aged 15 to 74 who:\nare without work;\nare available to start work within the next two weeks;\nand have actively sought employment at some time during the previous four weeks.\nThe unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force.\nThe labour force is the total number of people employed plus unemployed. In this news release unemployment rates are based on employment and unemployment data covering persons aged 15 to 74.\nThe youth unemployment rate is the number of people aged 15 to 24 unemployed as a percentage of the labour force of the same age. Therefore, the youth unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the share of jobless people in the overall youth population.\nWhen data for the most recent month are not available for a Member State, EU and EA aggregates are calculated using the latest data available for that Member State.\nGeographical information\nEuro area (EA20): Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.\nEuropean Union (EU27): Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden.\nFor more information\nEurostat website section on employment and unemployment\nEurostat database section on unemployment, including non-seasonally adjusted and trend data\nStatistics Explained articles on unemployment\nEurostat metadata on adjusted unemployment series\nEuro indicators dashboard\nRelease calendar for Euro indicators\nEuropean Statistics Code of Practice\nGet in touch\nMedia requests\n\n\n\n\nEurostat Media Support\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 33 408\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: eurostat-mediasupport@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nFurther information on data\n\n\n\n\nThibaut HENRION\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 31 686\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevena CHOLAKOVA\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 35 304\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: estat-monthly-unemployment@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nShare the release\n\nWas this page useful?                \nIf you do not wish to provide more detailed feedback, please just click on the \u201cSubmit\u201d button to send your response. \n\nNeed help?                    \n\nFollow us                    \n\nContact the EU                    \n\nSocial media                    \n\nLegal                    \n\nEU institutions                    \n\n                        EU institutions\n                    \n",

Powell, the Fed chair, said that the central bank would take future interest rate cuts \u201cmeeting by meeting\u201d after lowering rates by a half percentage point, an unusually large move.\nToday, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by a half percentage point. Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends. Inflation is now much closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. We\u2019re going to take it meeting by meeting. As I mentioned, there\u2019s no sense that the committee feels it\u2019s in a rush to do this. We made a good, strong start to this, and that\u2019s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence \u2014 confidence that inflation is coming down.\n\nJerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said that the central bank would take future interest rate cuts \u201cmeeting by meeting\u201d after lowering rates by a half percentage point, an unusually large move.CreditCredit...Tom Brenner/Reuters\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday by half a percentage point. Here are some takeaways from the decision and from remarks by the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell.\n\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision lowers rates to about 4.9 percent, down from a more than two-decade high.\n\n\nFed officials lowered interest rates because they are confident that inflation is coming back down to their 2 percent goal, and now they want to prevent the job market from softening further.\n\n\nCentral bankers expect to cut interest rates more in the months to come, but they are not on a preset path, Mr. Powell said. They could speed up if the economy is weak and slow down if it\u2019s strong.\n\n\nThe Fed is keeping a wary eye on the uptick in unemployment, but for now it thinks the economy is basically strong.\n\n\nThe Fed is feeling \u201cgrowing confidence\u201d that it can pull off the soft economic landing by lowering interest rates.\n\n\nIn short, the Fed has pivoted to its rate cutting era, and there is more to come.\n\n\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 4:04 p.m. ET\nDanielle Kaye\nReporting from New York\nThe S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both closed roughly 0.3 percent lower, a modest drop, after rising earlier in the day on the news of the half-percentage rate cut. Overall, the market doesn\u2019t seem spooked by the larger-than-usual rate cut. Investors had already bet on this bigger move, and the Fed\u2019s messaging \u2013 that it wasn\u2019t an emergency cut \u2013 also offered reassurance.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:46 p.m. ET\nAlan Rappeport\nReporting from Washington\nVice President Kamala Harris is out with a statement that makes clear she is not ready to declare \u201cmission accomplished\u201d on inflation. \u201cWhile this announcement is welcome news for Americans who have borne the brunt of high prices, my focus is on the work ahead to keep bringing prices down,\u201d she said.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:23 p.m. ET\nJeanna Smialek\nReporting from Washington\nPowell has finished his press conference.

Many economists said at the time that the report showed that the Fed should have cut rates \u2014 and Powell just suggested he agrees with them. If they had gotten the jobs report before their meeting, he said, \u201cwe might well have\u201d cut rates.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nOne interpretation of today\u2019s half-point cut is that it is making up for the quarter-point cut the Fed didn\u2019t make in July. Powell hasn\u2019t endorsed that interpretation, but he hasn\u2019t exactly rejected it either.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET\nJoe Rennison\nReporting from New York\nStocks have eased and the S&P 500 is now down for the day.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:07 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nThe real problem when it comes to housing, Powell says, is the lack of supply \u2014 a long-term problem that is outside of the Fed\u2019s control.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:07 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nPowell is asked about housing inflation, which has proved stubborn even as other consumer prices have risen more slowly. He says that the process has been slower than expected, but that data suggests that rents are easing, and that he is confident housing inflation will ultimately cool.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:07 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nThe \u2018dot plot\u2019 shows more rate cuts are coming, but disagreement on how many.\nFederal Reserve officials agree that Wednesday\u2019s rate cut is unlikely to be their last.

That suggests those officials expect to make more modest, quarter-size cuts in each of the two meetings they have scheduled for the rest of the year.\nBut seven policymakers expect just one more cut this year, and two officials expect none. At the other end of the spectrum, one official expects the Fed to cut rates by another three-quarters of a point this year, suggesting another supersize reduction in either November or December.\nAll 19 officials expect rates to be lower at the end of next year than they are now. But their estimates of how much lower vary widely, from about 2.9 percent (two full percentage points below where they are after Wednesday\u2019s action) to 4.1 percent (just three-quarters of a point below where they are now). There is an even wider range of views in 2026 and 2027.\nEventually, most officials expect interest rates to settle between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent. That\u2019s higher than in the decade before the pandemic, when the Fed\u2019s target interest rate never topped 2.5 percent \u2014 suggesting we may not soon return to the era of ultralow rates that prevailed after the Great Recession.\nShow more\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:04 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell tries to make clear that the politics of cutting rates right before a presidential election is not something the Fed thinks about, even though Trump has said any move ahead of November would be political. \u201cThis really concentrates the mind,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t put up any other filters. If you start doing that, I don\u2019t know where you stop.\u201d\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:02 p.m. ET\nJim Tankersley\nReporting from Washington\nNo surprise that Powell was asked about the political optics of this decision. And no surprise his answer is, what we care about it doing the best thing for the American people and the economy.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:02 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nIs the era of ultralow interest rates gone for good? Powell seems to think so. \u201cWe\u2019re probably not going back to that era where there are trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds being issued at negative rates,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cMy own sense is that we\u2019re not going back to that.\u201d\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell is asked about whether he would be content if the economy continued to add around 100,000 jobs a month, and he responds that it depends on how many people are entering the labor market. The high rate of immigration in recent years has raised that so-called \u201cbreakeven rate,\u201d which is the pace at which employers need to add jobs to prevent the unemployment rate from rising further \u2014 some have estimated it\u2019s now about 175,000 jobs a month.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nJeanna Smialek\nReporting from Washington\nPowell is making very sure to emphasize that the job market is still strong today. He\u2019s walking a tricky line here. There were some concerns coming into this press conference that investors would read a big rate cut today as a sign that the Fed was freaking out about the job market. Powell is pushing back on that with all of this confident talk.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nIt\u2019s striking how many of the questions in the news conference so far have focused on the job market, rather than inflation. It\u2019s another sign of how the narrative around the economy has shifted.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:58 p.m. ET\nTalmon Joseph Smith\nPowell mentioned that average wage growth for workers is still somewhat above what most officials see as being \u201cconsistent with price stability.\u201d One of the things I\u2019ll be watching in the next several months, though, is whether inflation continues to slowly cool even as wage growth remains strong. That may be viewed as a pleasant surprise.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:54 p.m. ET\nDanielle Kaye\nReporting from New York\nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said markets \u201ccan and should only celebrate today\u2019s move \u2013 and will continue to celebrate over coming months.\u201d The S&P 500 hovered near its record high this afternoon, and the index is now up roughly 0.5 percent as Powell speaks.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:54 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nPowell notes that layoffs are still low. But as I explained in a story last week, low layoffs don\u2019t necessarily indicate a healthy labor market. It is the rate of hiring, more than the rate of layoffs, that often drives fluctuations in unemployment.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:53 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell is leaning into the argument that a strong labor market is a good time to cut rates. \u201cThere is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when it\u2019s strong, and not when you begin to see the layoffs,\u201d he said, noting that initial claims for unemployment insurance are pretty flat.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:52 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nPowell acknowledges that the labor market is, by many measures, weaker than it was immediately before the pandemic.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Here's the inflation breakdown for June 2024 \u2014 in one chart\nInflation fell further in June as lower gasoline prices combined with other easing price pressures to bring relief for consumers' wallets.\nThe consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, rose 3% in June from a year ago, down from 3.3% in May, the U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday.\nThe CPI gauges how fast prices are changing across the U.S. economy. It measures everything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts, concert tickets and household appliances.\nPerhaps the 'most encouraging' news for consumers is that inflation for household necessities has cooled dramatically, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\n'The prices for staples \u2014 food at home, gasoline, new-lease rents \u2014 they haven't changed in about a year,' Zandi said. 'So people are paying the same for those staples today that they were a year ago.'\nThe April inflation reading is down significantly from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, which was the highest level since 1981.\nHowever, it remains above policymakers' long-term target, around 2%.\n'We continue to expect inflation to grind lower in the months ahead as input cost pressures ease and more tepid consumer demand makes it harder [for businesses] to raise prices,' Sarah House and Aubrey George, economists at Wells Fargo Economics, wrote in a note this week.\nHowever, additional improvements are likely to be 'slow-going,' they wrote.\nGood sign for Fed interest rate cut in September\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve uses inflation data to help guide its interest rate policy. It raised interest rates to their highest level in 23 years during the Covid-19 pandemic era, pushing up borrowing costs for consumers and businesses in a bid to tame inflation.\nLast month, Fed officials forecast they would start cutting rates by the end of 2024.\n'All indications are inflation has moderated, is back close to the Fed's target and consistent with a rate cut in September,' Zandi said.\nGasoline prices weigh on inflation\nGasoline played a large role in June's inflation pullback.\nPrices fell 3.8% in June relative to May, according to CPI data. That follows a 3.6% decline the prior month.\n'Tepid gasoline demand, increasing supply, and falling oil costs' have led to weaker gas prices, AAA wrote in June.\nMore from Personal Finance:Why Fed policy may make your next trip abroad more expensiveInflation largely isn't Biden or Trump's fault, say economistsMore Americans are struggling even as inflation cools\nAverage U.S. pump prices fell to $3.48 a gallon as of July 1, down from $3.52 on June 3, according to weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration.\nGasoline prices are down 2.5% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nThere has also been a broad pullback in prices at the grocery store.\n'Food at home' prices have risen just 1.1% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nConsumers have more 'breathing room' at the store amid 'growing promotional activity' among retailers, while a few 'major' companies recently announced price cuts 'that are likely to pressure competitors' pricing,' wrote economists House and George.\n'Core' CPI at lowest level in three years\nWhile annual data on inflation trends is helpful, economists generally recommend looking at monthly numbers as a better guide of short-term movements and prevailing trends.\nThey also generally like to examine 'core' inflation readings. They strip out food and energy prices, which can be volatile from month to month.\nThe monthly core CPI reading was 0.1% in June, the smallest increase in about three years, since August 2021. It has declined for three consecutive months, from 0.4% in March. To get back to target, economists say the monthly reading should consistently be in the range of about 0.2%.\n'Core' CPI has risen 3.3% since June 2023, the smallest 12-month gain since April 2021.\nHousing is the largest component of core CPI and therefore has an outsized effect on inflation readings. It has accounted for nearly 70% of the total 12-month increase in core CPI.\nShelter inflation has moderated much slower than expected, one of the big reasons inflation has not yet fallen back to target, economists said.\nThe shelter index lags broader trends in the rental market due to how the government constructs it.\nHowever, economists expect shelter to throttle back further since inflation for market rents has plummeted. For example, the annual inflation rate for new rental contracts sunk to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024 \u2014 lower than its pre-pandemic baseline \u2014 from record highs of around 12% just two years earlier, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nThere were encouraging signals in the latest CPI report. Monthly shelter inflation dropped to 0.2% after being stuck at 0.4% for four consecutive months. It was the smallest monthly gain since August 2021.\n'It should continue to cool off,' said Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.\n'It just takes time,' he added.\nServices inflation is the trouble spot\nInflation for physical goods spiked as the U.S. economy reopened in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, while Americans spent more on their homes and less on services such as dining out and entertainment.\nIt is a different story now. Goods inflation has largely normalized, while services is a fly in the ointment.\n'The goods side looks very benign at the moment,' said Olivia Cross, a North America economist at Capital Economics. 'Where there's work to be done is in some areas of core services and in shelter.'\nFor example, prices for services such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care jumped a 'notable' 19.5% and 3.3% since June 2023, respectively, the BLS said.\nA surge in new and used car prices a few years ago is likely now fueling high inflation for car insurance and repair, since it generally costs more to insure and repair pricier cars, economists said.\nIt also takes a long time \u2014 a year, two or even three \u2014 for higher labor costs in health care to translate to CPI readings due to a long contracting process, Zandi said. Higher pandemic-era wages in health care are now nudging up medical care CPI and will likely do so over the coming year, he said.\nThe services sector is generally more sensitive to inflationary pressures in the labor market such as strong wage growth.\nRecord-high demand for workers as the pandemic-era economy reopened pushed wage growth to its highest level in decades. The labor market has since cooled and wage growth has declined, though it remains above its pre-pandemic level.\n'Inflationary pressure from the labor market has dissipated quite strongly,' Cross said.\nDon't miss these insights from CNBC PRO\nGot a confidential news tip?

    "Summarized_Document2": "In March 2024, the euro area seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 6.5%, stable compared to February 2024 and down from 6.6% in March 2023. The EU unemployment rate was 6.0% in March 2024, down from 6.1% in February 2024 and stable compared to March 2023. Eurostat estimates that 13.258 million persons in the EU, including 11.087 million in the euro area, were unemployed in March 2024. Compared to February 2024, unemployment decreased by 74 thousand in the EU and by 94 thousand in the euro area. Compared to March 2023, unemployment increased by 175 thousand in the EU and decreased by 51 thousand in the euro area.\n\nIn March 2024, 2.858 million young persons (under 25) were unemployed in the EU, including 2.259 million in the euro area. The youth unemployment rate was 14.6% in the EU, down from 14.7% in February 2024, and 14.1% in the euro area, down from 14.4% in the previous month. Compared to February 2024, youth unemployment decreased by 11 thousand in the EU and by 30 thousand in the euro area. Compared to March 2023, youth unemployment increased by 150 thousand in the EU and by 36 thousand in the euro area.\n\nIn March 2024, the unemployment rate for women was 6.4% in the EU, stable compared to February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 5.7%, down from 5.8% in the previous month. In the euro area, the unemployment rate for women was 7.0%, stable compared to February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 6.0%, down from 6.1% in the previous month.\n\nThe estimates are based on the International Labour Organisation (ILO) standard definition of unemployment, which includes people without a job who have been actively seeking work in the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks. Additional indicators such as underemployed part-time workers and persons seeking work but not immediately available are also considered.\n\nThe document includes detailed tables showing seasonally adjusted unemployment rates and the number of unemployed persons in thousands for the euro area, EU, and individual countries from March 2023 to March 2024. For example, in March 2024, Germany had an unemployment rate of 3.2% with 1,421 thousand unemployed persons, while Spain had an unemployment rate of 11.7% with 2,854 thousand unemployed persons.\n\nYouth unemployment rates and numbers are also detailed, with the euro area having a youth unemployment rate of 14.1% in March 2024, down from 14.4% in February 2024, and the EU having a rate of 14.6%, down from 14.7% in February 2024. For instance, in March 2024, Spain had a youth unemployment rate of 27.2% with 480 thousand unemployed young persons, while Germany had a rate of 5.8% with 263 thousand unemployed young persons.\n\nUnemployment rates by gender are provided, showing that in March 2024, the euro area had an unemployment rate of 6.0% for men and 7.0% for women, while the EU had rates of 5.7% for men and 6.4% for women.\n\nThe document also notes that the data can be subject to revisions and provides information on the methods and definitions used by Eurostat, including the ILO definition of unemployment and the calculation of unemployment rates. It lists the countries included in the euro area (EA20) and the European Union (EU27) and provides contact information for further inquiries.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "The Federal Reserve announced a significant interest rate cut on September 18, 2024, reducing rates by half a percentage point. This decision lowered the rates to approximately 4.9 percent, down from a more than two-decade high. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that future rate cuts would be considered on a 'meeting by meeting' basis, reflecting confidence that inflation is moving towards the 2 percent target. The Fed aims to prevent further softening of the job market while maintaining economic stability. Despite the larger-than-usual rate cut, the market reaction was modest, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closing about 0.3 percent lower. Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged the positive impact on inflation but stressed the need for continued efforts to reduce prices. Some economists believe the Fed's decision compensates for not cutting rates in July, following a disappointing jobs report. The 'dot plot' indicates that more rate cuts are expected, though there is disagreement among Fed officials on the extent and timing. Most officials anticipate rates to settle between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent in the long term, higher than pre-pandemic levels. Powell dismissed political considerations, focusing on the economic benefits of the rate cut. He also noted that the era of ultralow interest rates is likely over, and the labor market remains strong despite some weaknesses compared to pre-pandemic conditions.",

In Q2 2024, the economy grew 4.7%, down from 5.3% in Q1 and lower than market expectations. Extreme weather, adjustments to calculations of the value of the financial industry, and sluggish domestic demand weighed on economic growth. \u2022 The momentum of consumption slowed down with a decline in income growth. The growth of retail sales fell to 2.6% in Q2 2024 from 4.7% in Q1. At its July meeting, the Politburo pointed out that consumption would be the core engine to boost domestic demand. Consumption is expected to recover moderately in H2 2024. \u2022 Manufacturing investments held up relatively well, with a growth rate of 9.3% in Q2 2024. The expansion of equipment renewals is expected to sustain robust growth in manufacturing investment. \u2022 Growth in infrastructure investment dropped slightly to 7.2% in Q2 2024 from 8.8% in Q1. Government investment slowed down due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. With issuances of local government special bonds and extra long-term special treasury bonds speeding up, however, infrastructure investment is expected to remain robust.\n\u2022 The property market is still struggling with weak sales and sluggish investment. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2 2024. To further raise housing demand and promote activity in the property market, policies to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory will be implemented in H2 2024.\n\u2022 Thanks to continuous improvement in external demand, exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with robust growth of 5.8% YoY in Q2. China\u2019s trade with emerging markets has seen fast growth, reflecting strengthened regional collaborations. Meanwhile, the optimisation of the structure of export commodities continues. Exports are expected to remain resilient through 2024. \u2022 Overall, driven by the implementation of equipment renewal policies and the recovery of external demand, China\u2019s GDP growth remained relatively stable in H1 2024. However, it is worth noting that domestic demand is still insufficient. The downturn in prices has had a direct effect on incomes, corporate profits and fiscal revenues, constraining spending. In addition, growing foreign trade tensions may weigh on China\u2019s exports. The government is expected to adopt a more accommodative macro policy stance in H2 2024 to facilitate the recovery of economic growth. 3 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

However, the growth rate in Q2 dropped to 4.7% in Q2 from 5.3% in Q1, which was lower than expectations. Beyond challenges posed by extreme weather, the slowdown reflected sluggish domestic demand.\n\u2022 The contribution of consumption to GDP fell from 73.7% in Q1 to 46.5% in Q2. Retail sales growth plummeted to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1 due to weakness in incomes. Fixed asset investment growth dropped to 3.6% in Q2, with activity in the real estate market remaining subdued and infrastructure investment constrained by shortages in fiscal funds.\n\u2022 Export growth picked up from 1.5% in Q1 to 5.8% in Q2 due to a lower base and robust external demand. 2020-23 Average 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2024 Q1 2024 Q2 GDP 4.8% 6.3% 4.9% 5.2% 5.3% 4.7% Industrial production 5.0% 4.5% 4.2% 5.2% 6.1% 5.9% Retail sales 4.1% 10.7% 4.2% 8.3% 4.7% 2.6% Fixed asset investment 4.4% 3.1% 1.9% 2.7% 4.5% 3.6% Exports 9.0% -4.9% -9.9% -1.2% 1.5% 5.8% Imports 6.4% -7.0% -8.5% 0.9% 1.6% 2.5% Income per capita 4.8% 8.3% 6.1% 6.7% 6.2% 4.2% Fiscal revenue 4.6% 31.7% -0.9% -1.0% -2.3% -3.2% Fiscal expenditures 3.7% 1.0% 4.1% 9.2% 2.9% 1.1% 4 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Extreme weather and weak demand still weighed on production side Manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMI Source: Wind, KPMG analysis \u2022 The manufacturing PMI has been below 50 for the past three months, since April, and fell to 49.4 in July. The divergence between production and demand recovery persisted. The production index dropped 0.5 to 50.1 while the new orders index fell to 49.3 in July, declining below the 50 point mark. A reading under 50 indicates a contraction.\n\u2022 The non-manufacturing sector also slowed down. Affected by extreme weather, construction activity slowed in July and the Construction PMI dropped 1.1 points to 51.2. With capital markets and the real estate industry still sluggish, the services PMI index dropped to 50, reaching its lowest level for the year.\n20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Manufacturing Construction and Services 5 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Consumption slowed as residents\u2019 income growth declined Growth of retail sales by category, YoY, % \u2022 Consumption has continued a pattern of differentiated recovery since 2023, with services sales increasing 7.5% YoY in H1 2024, 4.3 percentage points higher than goods sales growth. Robust sales of non-discretionary consumer goods and higher-quality goods contributed to consumption. Retail sales of property-related goods improved to varying degrees, driven mainly by relaxed real estate policies and effective trade-in policies of consumer goods.\n\u2022 The government has identified boosting domestic demand through consumption as a key focus in H2 2024. It sees service consumption as an important lever to expand and upgrade consumption, supporting sectors including culture and tourism, elderly care, housekeeping, childcare, etc.\nSource: Wind, KPMG analysis.

But it remained below the average of 71.0% for the same period of 2014-2019, indicating room for improvement. \u2022 The slowdown in consumption growth was primarily due to slower income growth, as the per capita disposable income increased by 5.4% YoY in H1 2024. This was 0.8 and 1.1 percentage points lower than in Q1 2024 and H1 2023, respectively. \u2022 Strengthening measures to stabilize employment and raise income will be necessary to support a steady recovery in residents' consumption ability and willingness.\nSource: Wind, KPMG analysis Note: Residents\u2019 propensity to consume = nationwide per capita consumption expenditures / nationwide per capita disposable income 55 60 65 70 75 80 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2014-2019 Average 2020-2023 Average 2024 7 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Specifically, tax revenue declined by 5.6% and land transfer income dropped by 18.3% in H1. \u2022 With shrinking revenues, the government curbed the expansion of investment, causing the growth rate of general fiscal expenses to fall to -4.1% YoY in Q2, down from -1.5% in Q1. It was well below the 7.9% budgeted growth rate set at the beginning of the year. \u2022 Looking ahead, in addition to accelerating the issuance of local government special bonds in H2 2024, the central government is expected to raise its debt ceiling in 2024 in order to achieve its fiscal budget targets.

Powell, the Fed chair, said that the central bank would take future interest rate cuts \u201cmeeting by meeting\u201d after lowering rates by a half percentage point, an unusually large move.\nToday, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by a half percentage point. Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends. Inflation is now much closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. We\u2019re going to take it meeting by meeting. As I mentioned, there\u2019s no sense that the committee feels it\u2019s in a rush to do this. We made a good, strong start to this, and that\u2019s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence \u2014 confidence that inflation is coming down.\n\nJerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said that the central bank would take future interest rate cuts \u201cmeeting by meeting\u201d after lowering rates by a half percentage point, an unusually large move.CreditCredit...Tom Brenner/Reuters\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday by half a percentage point. Here are some takeaways from the decision and from remarks by the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell.\n\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision lowers rates to about 4.9 percent, down from a more than two-decade high.\n\n\nFed officials lowered interest rates because they are confident that inflation is coming back down to their 2 percent goal, and now they want to prevent the job market from softening further.\n\n\nCentral bankers expect to cut interest rates more in the months to come, but they are not on a preset path, Mr. Powell said. They could speed up if the economy is weak and slow down if it\u2019s strong.\n\n\nThe Fed is keeping a wary eye on the uptick in unemployment, but for now it thinks the economy is basically strong.\n\n\nThe Fed is feeling \u201cgrowing confidence\u201d that it can pull off the soft economic landing by lowering interest rates.\n\n\nIn short, the Fed has pivoted to its rate cutting era, and there is more to come.\n\n\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 4:04 p.m. ET\nDanielle Kaye\nReporting from New York\nThe S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both closed roughly 0.3 percent lower, a modest drop, after rising earlier in the day on the news of the half-percentage rate cut. Overall, the market doesn\u2019t seem spooked by the larger-than-usual rate cut. Investors had already bet on this bigger move, and the Fed\u2019s messaging \u2013 that it wasn\u2019t an emergency cut \u2013 also offered reassurance.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:46 p.m. ET\nAlan Rappeport\nReporting from Washington\nVice President Kamala Harris is out with a statement that makes clear she is not ready to declare \u201cmission accomplished\u201d on inflation. \u201cWhile this announcement is welcome news for Americans who have borne the brunt of high prices, my focus is on the work ahead to keep bringing prices down,\u201d she said.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:23 p.m. ET\nJeanna Smialek\nReporting from Washington\nPowell has finished his press conference.

Many economists said at the time that the report showed that the Fed should have cut rates \u2014 and Powell just suggested he agrees with them. If they had gotten the jobs report before their meeting, he said, \u201cwe might well have\u201d cut rates.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nOne interpretation of today\u2019s half-point cut is that it is making up for the quarter-point cut the Fed didn\u2019t make in July. Powell hasn\u2019t endorsed that interpretation, but he hasn\u2019t exactly rejected it either.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET\nJoe Rennison\nReporting from New York\nStocks have eased and the S&P 500 is now down for the day.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:07 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nThe real problem when it comes to housing, Powell says, is the lack of supply \u2014 a long-term problem that is outside of the Fed\u2019s control.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:07 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nPowell is asked about housing inflation, which has proved stubborn even as other consumer prices have risen more slowly. He says that the process has been slower than expected, but that data suggests that rents are easing, and that he is confident housing inflation will ultimately cool.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:07 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nThe \u2018dot plot\u2019 shows more rate cuts are coming, but disagreement on how many.\nFederal Reserve officials agree that Wednesday\u2019s rate cut is unlikely to be their last. They are much less united on how far or how quickly they will decide to lower rates moving forward.\nThe chart below, known as the \u201cdot plot,\u201d helps tell the story.

That suggests those officials expect to make more modest, quarter-size cuts in each of the two meetings they have scheduled for the rest of the year.\nBut seven policymakers expect just one more cut this year, and two officials expect none. At the other end of the spectrum, one official expects the Fed to cut rates by another three-quarters of a point this year, suggesting another supersize reduction in either November or December.\nAll 19 officials expect rates to be lower at the end of next year than they are now. But their estimates of how much lower vary widely, from about 2.9 percent (two full percentage points below where they are after Wednesday\u2019s action) to 4.1 percent (just three-quarters of a point below where they are now). There is an even wider range of views in 2026 and 2027.\nEventually, most officials expect interest rates to settle between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent. That\u2019s higher than in the decade before the pandemic, when the Fed\u2019s target interest rate never topped 2.5 percent \u2014 suggesting we may not soon return to the era of ultralow rates that prevailed after the Great Recession.\nShow more\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:04 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell tries to make clear that the politics of cutting rates right before a presidential election is not something the Fed thinks about, even though Trump has said any move ahead of November would be political. \u201cThis really concentrates the mind,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t put up any other filters. If you start doing that, I don\u2019t know where you stop.\u201d\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:02 p.m. ET\nJim Tankersley\nReporting from Washington\nNo surprise that Powell was asked about the political optics of this decision. And no surprise his answer is, what we care about it doing the best thing for the American people and the economy.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:02 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nIs the era of ultralow interest rates gone for good? Powell seems to think so. \u201cWe\u2019re probably not going back to that era where there are trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds being issued at negative rates,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cMy own sense is that we\u2019re not going back to that.\u201d\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell is asked about whether he would be content if the economy continued to add around 100,000 jobs a month, and he responds that it depends on how many people are entering the labor market. The high rate of immigration in recent years has raised that so-called \u201cbreakeven rate,\u201d which is the pace at which employers need to add jobs to prevent the unemployment rate from rising further \u2014 some have estimated it\u2019s now about 175,000 jobs a month.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nJeanna Smialek\nReporting from Washington\nPowell is making very sure to emphasize that the job market is still strong today. He\u2019s walking a tricky line here. There were some concerns coming into this press conference that investors would read a big rate cut today as a sign that the Fed was freaking out about the job market. Powell is pushing back on that with all of this confident talk.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 3:01 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nIt\u2019s striking how many of the questions in the news conference so far have focused on the job market, rather than inflation. It\u2019s another sign of how the narrative around the economy has shifted.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:58 p.m. ET\nTalmon Joseph Smith\nPowell mentioned that average wage growth for workers is still somewhat above what most officials see as being \u201cconsistent with price stability.\u201d One of the things I\u2019ll be watching in the next several months, though, is whether inflation continues to slowly cool even as wage growth remains strong. That may be viewed as a pleasant surprise.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:54 p.m. ET\nDanielle Kaye\nReporting from New York\nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said markets \u201ccan and should only celebrate today\u2019s move \u2013 and will continue to celebrate over coming months.\u201d The S&P 500 hovered near its record high this afternoon, and the index is now up roughly 0.5 percent as Powell speaks.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:54 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nPowell notes that layoffs are still low. But as I explained in a story last week, low layoffs don\u2019t necessarily indicate a healthy labor market. It is the rate of hiring, more than the rate of layoffs, that often drives fluctuations in unemployment.\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:53 p.m. ET\nLydia DePillis\nReporting from New York\nPowell is leaning into the argument that a strong labor market is a good time to cut rates. \u201cThere is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when it\u2019s strong, and not when you begin to see the layoffs,\u201d he said, noting that initial claims for unemployment insurance are pretty flat.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSept. 18, 2024, 2:52 p.m. ET\nBen Casselman\nReporting from New York\nPowell acknowledges that the labor market is, by many measures, weaker than it was immediately before the pandemic.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Here's the inflation breakdown for June 2024 \u2014 in one chart\nInflation fell further in June as lower gasoline prices combined with other easing price pressures to bring relief for consumers' wallets.\nThe consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, rose 3% in June from a year ago, down from 3.3% in May, the U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday.\nThe CPI gauges how fast prices are changing across the U.S. economy. It measures everything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts, concert tickets and household appliances.\nPerhaps the 'most encouraging' news for consumers is that inflation for household necessities has cooled dramatically, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\n'The prices for staples \u2014 food at home, gasoline, new-lease rents \u2014 they haven't changed in about a year,' Zandi said. 'So people are paying the same for those staples today that they were a year ago.'\nThe April inflation reading is down significantly from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, which was the highest level since 1981.\nHowever, it remains above policymakers' long-term target, around 2%.\n'We continue to expect inflation to grind lower in the months ahead as input cost pressures ease and more tepid consumer demand makes it harder [for businesses] to raise prices,' Sarah House and Aubrey George, economists at Wells Fargo Economics, wrote in a note this week.\nHowever, additional improvements are likely to be 'slow-going,' they wrote.\nGood sign for Fed interest rate cut in September\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve uses inflation data to help guide its interest rate policy. It raised interest rates to their highest level in 23 years during the Covid-19 pandemic era, pushing up borrowing costs for consumers and businesses in a bid to tame inflation.\nLast month, Fed officials forecast they would start cutting rates by the end of 2024.\n'All indications are inflation has moderated, is back close to the Fed's target and consistent with a rate cut in September,' Zandi said.\nGasoline prices weigh on inflation\nGasoline played a large role in June's inflation pullback.\nPrices fell 3.8% in June relative to May, according to CPI data. That follows a 3.6% decline the prior month.\n'Tepid gasoline demand, increasing supply, and falling oil costs' have led to weaker gas prices, AAA wrote in June.\nMore from Personal Finance:Why Fed policy may make your next trip abroad more expensiveInflation largely isn't Biden or Trump's fault, say economistsMore Americans are struggling even as inflation cools\nAverage U.S. pump prices fell to $3.48 a gallon as of July 1, down from $3.52 on June 3, according to weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration.\nGasoline prices are down 2.5% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nThere has also been a broad pullback in prices at the grocery store.\n'Food at home' prices have risen just 1.1% since June 2023, according to CPI data.\nConsumers have more 'breathing room' at the store amid 'growing promotional activity' among retailers, while a few 'major' companies recently announced price cuts 'that are likely to pressure competitors' pricing,' wrote economists House and George.\n'Core' CPI at lowest level in three years\nWhile annual data on inflation trends is helpful, economists generally recommend looking at monthly numbers as a better guide of short-term movements and prevailing trends.\nThey also generally like to examine 'core' inflation readings. They strip out food and energy prices, which can be volatile from month to month.\nThe monthly core CPI reading was 0.1% in June, the smallest increase in about three years, since August 2021. It has declined for three consecutive months, from 0.4% in March. To get back to target, economists say the monthly reading should consistently be in the range of about 0.2%.\n'Core' CPI has risen 3.3% since June 2023, the smallest 12-month gain since April 2021.\nHousing is the largest component of core CPI and therefore has an outsized effect on inflation readings. It has accounted for nearly 70% of the total 12-month increase in core CPI.\nShelter inflation has moderated much slower than expected, one of the big reasons inflation has not yet fallen back to target, economists said.\nThe shelter index lags broader trends in the rental market due to how the government constructs it.\nHowever, economists expect shelter to throttle back further since inflation for market rents has plummeted. For example, the annual inflation rate for new rental contracts sunk to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024 \u2014 lower than its pre-pandemic baseline \u2014 from record highs of around 12% just two years earlier, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nThere were encouraging signals in the latest CPI report. Monthly shelter inflation dropped to 0.2% after being stuck at 0.4% for four consecutive months. It was the smallest monthly gain since August 2021.\n'It should continue to cool off,' said Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.\n'It just takes time,' he added.\nServices inflation is the trouble spot\nInflation for physical goods spiked as the U.S. economy reopened in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, while Americans spent more on their homes and less on services such as dining out and entertainment.\nIt is a different story now. Goods inflation has largely normalized, while services is a fly in the ointment.\n'The goods side looks very benign at the moment,' said Olivia Cross, a North America economist at Capital Economics. 'Where there's work to be done is in some areas of core services and in shelter.'\nFor example, prices for services such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care jumped a 'notable' 19.5% and 3.3% since June 2023, respectively, the BLS said.\nA surge in new and used car prices a few years ago is likely now fueling high inflation for car insurance and repair, since it generally costs more to insure and repair pricier cars, economists said.\nIt also takes a long time \u2014 a year, two or even three \u2014 for higher labor costs in health care to translate to CPI readings due to a long contracting process, Zandi said. Higher pandemic-era wages in health care are now nudging up medical care CPI and will likely do so over the coming year, he said.\nThe services sector is generally more sensitive to inflationary pressures in the labor market such as strong wage growth.\nRecord-high demand for workers as the pandemic-era economy reopened pushed wage growth to its highest level in decades. The labor market has since cooled and wage growth has declined, though it remains above its pre-pandemic level.\n'Inflationary pressure from the labor market has dissipated quite strongly,' Cross said.\nDon't miss these insights from CNBC PRO\nGot a confidential news tip?

However, the growth rate in Q2 2024 dropped to 4.7% from 5.3% in Q1, falling short of market expectations due to extreme weather, adjustments in financial industry valuations, and sluggish domestic demand. Retail sales growth fell to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1, reflecting a slowdown in income growth. Manufacturing investments grew by 9.3% in Q2, supported by equipment renewals, while infrastructure investment growth dropped to 7.2% from 8.8% in Q1 due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2, with policies expected to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory in H2 2024. Exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with a robust 5.8% growth in Q2, driven by strong external demand and regional collaborations. Despite stable GDP growth in H1 2024, domestic demand remains insufficient, and foreign trade tensions may impact exports. The government is expected to adopt more accommodative macro policies in H2 2024 to support economic recovery. The manufacturing PMI has been below 50 since April, indicating contraction, while the non-manufacturing sector also slowed due to extreme weather. Consumption growth slowed as residents' income growth declined, with the per capita disposable income increasing by 5.4% YoY in H1 2024. Manufacturing investment growth was driven by exports and equipment renewals, despite a slight drop to 9.3% in Q2 from 9.9% in Q1. Infrastructure investment growth fell to 7.2% in Q2 from 8.8% in Q1, constrained by extreme weather and fiscal funding shortages. General fiscal revenue growth dropped to -7.2% YoY in Q2, leading to a reduction in government expenditures. Property sales showed limited improvement, with investment growth dropping to -10.5% in Q2. Liquidity pressure on property developers persisted, with funding sources growth picking up slightly to -22.6% in H1 2024. CPI rose by 0.2% YoY in June 2024, while PPI decline narrowed, indicating moderate inflation expectations. Growth of total social financing slowed, with new bank loans decreasing by RMB 3.1 trillion in H1 2024. The central bank cut key interest rates to signal accommodative policies. Exports to major trading partners grew, with ASEAN remaining the largest trading partner. The export commodity structure continued to optimize, with mechanical and electrical products leading growth. FDI into China decreased by 29.1% YoY in H1 2024, while ODI grew by 19.5%. The RMB exchange rate remained stable despite global monetary policy divergence. Hong Kong\u2019s GDP grew by 3.3% in Q2 2024, with tourism and private consumption expected to pick up in H2 2024.",

Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that future rate cuts would be considered on a 'meeting by meeting' basis, reflecting confidence that inflation is moving towards the 2 percent target. The Fed aims to prevent further softening of the job market while maintaining economic stability. Despite the larger-than-usual rate cut, the market reaction was modest, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closing about 0.3 percent lower. Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged the positive impact on inflation but stressed the need for continued efforts to reduce prices. Some economists believe the Fed's decision compensates for not cutting rates in July, following a disappointing jobs report. The 'dot plot' indicates that more rate cuts are expected, though there is disagreement among Fed officials on the extent and timing. Most officials anticipate rates to settle between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent in the long term, higher than pre-pandemic levels. Powell dismissed political considerations, focusing on the economic benefits of the rate cut. He also noted that the era of ultralow interest rates is likely over, and the labor market remains strong despite some weaknesses compared to pre-pandemic conditions.",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

    "Document2": "State of the Consumer 2024: What\u2019s now and what\u2019s next\nIf you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands.\nThese are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed.\nIn this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise\u00a0research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d\nNine trends defining the global consumer market\nTo forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth.\nWho is the future consumer?\nConsumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved.\n1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend.\nAmong this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies (Exhibit 1). This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies.\n2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age.1\u201cAgeing,\u201d United Nations, accessed May 29, 2024. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood.\nDespite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age.\nIn emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets2Forty-two percent of consumers in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.\nsaid they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe3Throughout this article, we will refer to \u201cEurope\u201d to indicate France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\nand 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk.\n3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers.\nThis intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers.\nWhat will consumers want?\nWhat consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies.\n4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers\u00a0switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups.\nIn advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts (Exhibit 2). Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior.\nThis weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers.\nOne beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality.\n5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims\u00a0outpaced sales of products without such claims.\nWhile young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023 (Exhibit 3).\nYounger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims.\n6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually.4\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\nIn advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets.\nIn emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States (Exhibit 4).\nIt\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so.\nWeight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years.\nBy 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective.5\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\n7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually\u00a0by 2040.6Kweilin Ellingrud, Lucy P\u00e9rez, Anouk Petersen, and Valentina Sartori, Closing the women\u2019s health gap: A $1 trillion opportunity to improve lives and economies, McKinsey Health Institute, January 17, 2024.\nA higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well.\nWhere will consumers shop?\nKnowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world.\n8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend.\nJust because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas.\nEmerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world.\n9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind (Exhibit 5). Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States.\nAttempts to grow the social-commerce market\u00a0in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today.7\u201cSocial commerce: The future of how consumers interact with brands,\u201d McKinsey, October 19, 2022. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months.\nFour imperatives to win the consumer of the future\nIn light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives:\nBuild microtargeting capabilities\nAbout QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey\nQuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe.\nRather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments\u00a0at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases.\nInvest in wellness\nA rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging).\nPropel the social\u2013digital experience\nCompanies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries)\u00a0become more important.\nWe see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers.\nOffer premium products where they matter\nOffering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures.\nIn this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.\nThe authors wish to thank Cait Pearson, Heather Gouinlock, and Keir Sullivan for their contributions to this article.\nThis article was edited by Alexandra Mondalek, an editor in the New York office.",

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document1": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "If you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands. These are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed. In this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d Nine trends defining the global consumer market To forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth. Who is the future consumer? Consumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved. 1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend. Among this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies. This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies. 2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood. Despite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age. In emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets said they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe and 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk. 3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers. This intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers. What will consumers want? What consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies. 4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups. In advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts. Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior. This weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers. One beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality. 5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims outpaced sales of products without such claims. While young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023. Younger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims. 6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually. In advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets. In emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States. It\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so. Weight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years. By 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective. 7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually by 2040. A higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well. Where will consumers shop? Knowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world. 8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend. Just because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas. Emerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world. 9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind. Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States. Attempts to grow the social-commerce market in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months. Four imperatives to win the consumer of the future In light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives: Build microtargeting capabilities About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey QuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe. Rather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases. Invest in wellness A rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging). Propel the social\u2013digital experience Companies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries) become more important. We see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers. Offer premium products where they matter Offering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures. In this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.

    "Summarized_Document3": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

Depression is more than just a few days of moderate sadness. It's a severe clinical illness that is remarkably common and affects your overall mental health and state of mind. It may cause you to feel worn out, depressed, nervous, or terrified. It can alter the way you think, eat, and sleep. Some people may commit suicide due to depression. Antidepressants may be suggested by a medical professional for anxiety or sleeplessness in cases of chronic pain.\u00a0\r\nHealthcare professionals occasionally suggest antidepressants for various conditions. Antidepressants come in a variety of forms. Everyone operates in an unforeseen way. Doctors advise starting with the more modern antidepressants since they have fewer negative effects than the older ones. Different antidepressants may be more effective at alleviating different symptoms of depression. The way that antidepressant symptoms vary from person to person and from one medicine to the next.\nMarket Dynamics of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nKey Drivers\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nThe growing awareness of psychological health concerns and the initiatives to lessen the stigma associated with seeking treatment are major factors propelling the market for antidepressant medications. Public knowledge of psychological health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, has grown as a result of developing awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. The number of individuals who identify the signs of mental health disorders and seek professional treatment will rise, which will raise the need for antidepressant drugs. Educating the public about mental health illnesses, accessible treatments, and the need to get assistance is the aim of educational efforts and programs. Media campaigns that feature true tales, celebrity endorsements, and accurate portrayals of psychological health issues contribute to public awareness.\u00a0\nAs society's perceptions of mental health shift, there is a growing understanding of the prevalence and consequences of mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. This changing view has led more people to seek care for mental health difficulties, increasing the demand for effective therapy. Moreover, the reduced stigma has encouraged pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new, more potent antidepressants. To satisfy the needs of numerous patients, the industry has expanded to provide a greater range of treatment options.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, the data updated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in January 2022 shows depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the US, and an estimated 46.9% of adolescents with a major depressive episode and significant impairment received treatment in the previous year.\r\n(Source:https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness\u00a0)\nRestraints\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nPatients may be reluctant to begin or continue antidepressant medication due to worries about potential side effects and their general well-being. Reduced market development and poorer solution rates may result from patient resistance and non-compliance. Regulations and warning labels have the potential to negatively affect consumers' perceptions and reduce their belief in the safety of antidepressant drugs, which can hinder the growth of the market. Unfavorable events and health issues may lead to legal actions and lawsuits against medication companies. Legal disputes may be detrimental to a business's profits, the reputation of an antidepressant, and consumer trust.\nHow Did COVID-19 Impact the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nAntidepressant market growth has been positively influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic because of an increase in product sales related to the disaster. Furthermore, the market expansion has been helped by important tactics used by biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses, such as maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of their goods. Due to several causes, including financial and emotional strain, stress, worry, and dread, the pandemic has increased stress levels in the general population, which has increased the prevalence of depression. This has resulted in a greater proportion of patients receiving therapy, together with the expansion of telehealth and increased public knowledge of available treatment options.\nOpportunities\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nBy improving patient outcomes overall, increasing treatment adherence, and providing more advanced access to psychological wellness care, telemedicine, and digital mental health solutions create opportunities for the antidepressant medication industry. When more people have access to mental health services, more will be able to receive evaluations and prescriptions for antidepressants. Telemedicine platforms provide remote meetings between psychiatrists and other medical experts as well as patients. Prescriptions for antidepressants may now be filled remotely, which is more convenient for patients and may lead to a rise in prescription rates.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, In February 2021, Ginger, a company providing on-demand mental healthcare announced a partnership agreement with Capsule, a digital pharmacy. This partnership was aimed at providing Ginger members with mental health medications including anti-depressants at their homes.\u00a0\r\n(Source:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224005209/en/Ginger-Partners-with-Capsule-to-Seamlessly-Prescribe-and-Deliver-Mental-Health-Medications\u00a0)\nWe have various report editions of Antidepressant Drugs Market, hence please contact our sales team and author directly to obtain/purchase a desired Edition eg, Global Edition, Regional Edition, Country Specific Report Edition, Company Profiles, Forecast Edition, etc. Request for your Free Sample PDF/Online Access.\nCompetitive Landscape: Antidepressant Drugs Market\nMajor market participants who are essential in determining consumer preferences and market dynamics have a major impact on the antidepressant drugs market.

The Canadian healthcare system places a high priority on mental health, and a sizable portion of its budget is allocated to services and initiatives in this area. This covers the cost of prescription drugs for mental health disorders as well as the cost of mental health treatments rendered in community-based settings, hospitals, and outpatient clinics. The rising demand for antidepressant drugs affects market prices as well. Patients may find antidepressants to be more affordable because many of them are available in generic form.\u00a0\nWhich Region is Expanding at the Fastest CAGR?\nAsia-Pacific is expected to witness the fastest growth in the antidepressant drugs market during the forecast period. Changes in the financial system, societal norms, and lifestyle might increase the likelihood of mental health issues like depression, which in turn drives up the need for antidepressant drugs. The aging population raises the possibility of mental health issues like depression. This shift in the population might support the growth of the antidepressant industry. The market will grow if government initiatives are implemented to provide access to basic treatment for all mental health conditions. Additionally, the market is growing due to growing sales of CNS stimulants, an increase in the number of persons experiencing stress, and growing awareness about the illness state and necessary treatment needs.\r\n\u00a0\nThe current report Scope analyzes Antidepressant Drugs Market on 5 major region Split (In case you wish to acquire a specific region edition (more granular data) or any country Edition data then please write us on info@cognitivemarketresearch.com\n\nNorth America (United States, Canada, Mexico)\nEurope (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium)\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Rest of APAC)\nSouth America (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Rest of South America)\nMiddle East and Africa (Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Nigeria, UAE, Egypt, South Africa, GCC Countries, Rest of MEA)\n\n\n\nAntidepressant Drugs Market Share (%) by Region (2019-2031)\n\n\nThe above graph is for illustrative purposes only.

However, due to rising rates of mental illness, more public awareness of depression, rising healthcare costs, and an increase in clinical trials, North America is predicted to see the greatest CAGR of xx% between 2024 and 2031. Spending on mental health and healthcare are strongly related in Canada. The Canadian healthcare system places a high priority on mental health, and a sizable portion of its budget is allocated to services and initiatives in this area. This covers the cost of prescription drugs for mental health disorders as well as the cost of mental health treatments rendered in community-based settings, hospitals, and outpatient clinics. The rising demand for antidepressant drugs affects market prices as well. Patients may find antidepressants to be more affordable because many of them are available in generic form.\u00a0\nWhich Region is Expanding at the Fastest CAGR?\nAsia-Pacific is expected to witness the fastest growth in the antidepressant drugs market during the forecast period. Changes in the financial system, societal norms, and lifestyle might increase the likelihood of mental health issues like depression, which in turn drives up the need for antidepressant drugs. The aging population raises the possibility of mental health issues like depression. This shift in the population might support the growth of the antidepressant industry. The market will grow if government initiatives are implemented to provide access to basic treatment for all mental health conditions. Additionally, the market is growing due to growing sales of CNS stimulants, an increase in the number of persons experiencing stress, and growing awareness about the illness state and necessary treatment needs.\r\n\u00a0\nThe current report Scope analyzes Antidepressant Drugs Market on 5 major region Split (In case you wish to acquire a specific region edition (more granular data) or any country Edition data then please write us on info@cognitivemarketresearch.com\n\nNorth America (United States, Canada, Mexico)\nEurope (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium)\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Rest of APAC)\nSouth America (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Rest of South America)\nMiddle East and Africa (Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Nigeria, UAE, Egypt, South Africa, GCC Countries, Rest of MEA)\n\n\nThe above graph is for illustrative purposes only.

The market provides the value (in USD million) for the above-mentioned segments.\n\n\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Analysis\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is expected to register a CAGR of 4.5% during the forecast period (2021 to 2026).\nThe COVID-19 outbreak had a significant impact on people with hypertension. Also, due to lockdown and other restrictions imposed by governements to curb the spread of the infection from the Covid-19 virus, the lifestyle of patients with hypertension was severely impacted. As per the study titled \"COVID-19 in Patients with Hypertension\" published in Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology in July 2021, hypertension individuals who have COVID-19 have an increased risk of mortality that is at least two times higher; nevertheless, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors that have been offer protection for this subgroup of patients which in turn expected to boost the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nOne of the leading factors responsible for the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market is the rising prevalence of hypertension among people around the world. The major known causes of hypertension are kidney diseases, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and other cardiovascular diseases due to which the prevalence of hypertension has been observed a significant rise over the past few years. Also, some drugs can induce hypertension in patients with other diseases or disorders which in turn is expected to promote the growth of the studied market. As per the updated May 2021 data from the World Health Organization, about 1.13 billion people around the world have hypertension, of which two-third are living in low- and middle-income countries. In the report published in June 2020 titled 'A Global View on Prevalence of Hypertension and Human Development Index' to determine the relationship between the prevalence of hypertension and human development index (HDI) concluded that the prevalence of hypertension ranged from 35% to 41% among 182 countries around the world. Thus, the rising prevalence of hypertension is expected to drive the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nCertain other factors that will boost the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market include growing initiatives by private and government organizations and rising awareness about hypertension around the around. For instance, in May 2022, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals conclude the hypertension awareness symbol backed by the Association of Physicians of India (API) and Hypertension Society of India (HIS). Additionally, in May 2022, Namya Smile Foundation (NSF) organized an awareness campaign in India related to hypertension among people. The organization conducted a camp and checked the blood pressure and made them aware of various aspects of high blood pressure.\nWhereas factors such as expiration of patent of multiple major drugs along with side effects associated with the hypertension treatment and rise in the availability of other non-pharmacological based therapy will restrict the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market. For Instance, In December 2021, AbbVie, the parent company of Allergan, lost the patent of its anti-hypertensive drug, Bystolic (Nebivolol). Nebivolol is a beta blocker used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Additionally, market participants frequently introduce new products and use a variety of growth tactics in their particular segments, which is likely to spur market expansion. For Instance, in December 2021, Dr Reddy's Laboratories has launched Valsartan tablets, used for treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure, in the United States market. The Valsartan tablet is the generic therapeutic equivalent of Diovan, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). Similarly, in November 2021, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. reported that Novartis Pharma K.K. (Novartis Pharma) has obtained approval in Japan for ENTREST 100 mg and 200 mg Tablets (generic name: sacubitril valsartan sodium hydrate) for the new indication of hypertension. This approval is Japan's first of an ARNI for the indication of hypertension.\nThus, all aforementioned factors expected to boost the market growth over the forecast period, However, multiple major drug patent expiration expected to hamper the market growth.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Trends\n\n This section covers the major market trends shaping the Anti-hypertensive Drugs Market according to our research experts: \n\nDiuretics Therapeutics Class is Expected to Hold a Significant Market Share in the Forecast Period\n\nDiuretics help in reducing the sodium and water from the body by inducing kidneys to release more sodium into the urine which leads to lower blood pressure as fluid flowing through the body is decreases. Diuretics are the preferred class of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of hypertension over others mainly because of their high efficacy, low cost, and low side effects as compared to other available therapeutic classes in the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nDiuretics are of three types - thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics, from which thiazide diuretics are the cornerstone of treatment for hypertension in most patients around the world. For instance, as per the research article published in July 2022, titled 'Loop Diuretics', Loop diuretics have received FDA approval to be used alone or in combination with other anti-hypertensives to treat hypertension. However, first-line therapy does not consist solely of loop diuretics. Loop diuretics can be used to address fluid overload conditions and alternative hypertension therapy. Moreover, according to the study titled \"Thiazide diuretics alone or in combination with a potassium-sparing diuretic on blood pressure-lowering in patients with primary hypertension: protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis\" published in the BMC Open Journal in February 2022, Thiazides have a proven track record of lowering blood pressure, have a good safety record, and are inexpensive.

The Report Offers the Value (in USD) and Volume (in Units) for the Above Segments.\n\n\n\nInsulin Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nInsulin Market Analysis\n\nThe Human Insulin Drugs Market size is estimated at USD 27.96 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 33.81 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 3.87% during the forecast period (2024-2029).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the Human Insulin Drugs Market. Type-1 diabetes patients are impacted more during Covid-19. People with diabetes are having a weak immune system so, with COVID-19, the immune system gets weaker very fast. People with diabetes will have more chances to get into serious complications rather than normal people.\nDiabetes is associated with many health complications. People with diabetes have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized compared to those without diabetes, and thus, they incur more healthcare expenses compared to non-diabetic people. Patients with Type 2 diabetes require many corrections throughout the day for maintaining nominal blood glucose levels, such as the administration of additional insulin or ingestion of additional carbohydrates. Furthermore, patients attempting to control their blood glucose levels, so as to prevent the long-term complications associated with fluctuations in blood glucose levels, are at greater risk for overcorrection and the resultant hypoglycemia.\nTherefore, owing to the aforementioned factors the studied market is anticipated to witness growth over the analysis period.\n\nInsulin Market Trends\n\n\nGrowing Diabetes Prevalence Driving the Market\n\nAll type-1 diabetes patients and a limited number of type-2 diabetes patients require daily insulin injections as part of their treatment. As per the ADA, around 67.3% of the cost of diabetes care in the United States is covered by government insurance (including Medicare, Medicaid, and the military). The rest is paid for by private insurance (30.7%) or by the uninsured (2%). In Canada, the total diabetic population in the country increased by approximately 33% between 2016 and 2022, and about 8% of the diabetic population has type-1 diabetes. Many developing countries in North America, including the Caribbean countries, are undergoing an epidemiologic transition and experiencing rapid increases in the prevalence of diabetes. As of 2022, the prevalence rates for diabetes ranged from 12% to 19% of the population in several countries in the region.\nThere was a glaring research gap in the absence of data for adult populations because only 1.52 million of the 8.75 million people with type-1 diabetes worldwide in 2022 were under the age of 20. If type-1 diabetes is not correctly diagnosed and promptly treated, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can quickly result in death. Type-1 diabetes and the use of insulin were reported by 1.4 million individuals aged 20 or older, or 5.2% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, while 10.9% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, or 2.9 million adults aged 20 or older, started taking insulin within a year after diagnosis. Regular insulin is used along with a healthy diet and exercise routine to help diabetics with high blood sugar levels. Keeping blood sugar levels under control helps prevent kidney damage, blindness, nerve damage, limb loss, and issues with sexual function. Your chance of having a heart attack or stroke may be reduced if your diabetes is well controlled. This synthetic insulin is identical to human insulin. It takes the place of the insulin that your body typically produces. This insulin has a short half-life. It functions by making it easier for blood sugar (glucose) to enter cells where your body can use it as fuel. Usually, this drug is used with either a medium-acting or long-acting insulin product. The use of this medication with other oral diabetic medications is also possible.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated.\n\nNorth America Dominates the Market\n\nNorth America dominates the global human insulin market, especially the United States, owing to the high prevalence of diabetes in the region because of a sedentary lifestyle. The cost factor is the major concern in the United States, where almost 50% of the insulin revenues for the manufacturers are from the country itself. The United States accounts for the highest sales of long-acting insulin, Lantus, across the world. Most diabetic drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. Lantus is the most commonly administered basal insulin across the world, accounting for a dominant share in the US market. The traditional North American human insulin drug market is expected to grow during the forecast period due to its affordability to patients. Humulin holds the highest market share, followed by Novolin. There are no generic competitors for the traditional North American human insulin drug market in the United States. The United States accounts for the highest sales of Humalog across the world, with over 56% of the market share. The majority of diabetes drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. In the United States, Humalog is available in different varieties under names like Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog U-100, Humalog U-200, and Humalog Mix 50/50 for the treatment of diabetes.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated in the human insulin drug market.\n\nInsulin Industry Overview\n\nThe global human insulin market is highly consolidated, with three major manufacturers holding a global market presence and the remaining manufacturers confined to other local or region-specific manufacturers. Mergers and acquisitions that happened between the players in the recent past have helped the companies strengthen their market presence. Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim have an alliance to develop and commercialize Basaglar (Insulin Glargine). Biocon is developing Insulin Tregopil, an oral prandial insulin tablet, for the treatment of type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Fast-acting oral insulin could improve postprandial glucose control with reduced side effects and greater adherence, thus holding the promise to transform T1D management. Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc., a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral drug delivery systems, is working to bring the first oral insulin product to market, thus providing a more convenient, effective, and safer method for delivering insulin therapy.\n\nInsulin Market Leaders\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S\nEli Lilly and Company\nSanofi S.A.\nBiocon Limited\nPfizer Inc.\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nInsulin Market News\n\nInsulin Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDS\n\nInsulin Industry Segmentation\n\nThe hormone class of drugs includes human insulin. In place of the insulin that the body ordinarily produces, human insulin is used. It functions by assisting in the movement of blood sugar into different bodily tissues, where it is used as an energy source. It also prevents the liver from generating additional sugar.

The market provides the value (in USD million) for the above-mentioned segments.\n\n\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Analysis\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is expected to register a CAGR of 4.5% during the forecast period (2021 to 2026).\nThe COVID-19 outbreak had a significant impact on people with hypertension. Also, due to lockdown and other restrictions imposed by governements to curb the spread of the infection from the Covid-19 virus, the lifestyle of patients with hypertension was severely impacted. As per the study titled \"COVID-19 in Patients with Hypertension\" published in Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology in July 2021, hypertension individuals who have COVID-19 have an increased risk of mortality that is at least two times higher; nevertheless, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors that have been offer protection for this subgroup of patients which in turn expected to boost the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nOne of the leading factors responsible for the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market is the rising prevalence of hypertension among people around the world. The major known causes of hypertension are kidney diseases, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and other cardiovascular diseases due to which the prevalence of hypertension has been observed a significant rise over the past few years. Also, some drugs can induce hypertension in patients with other diseases or disorders which in turn is expected to promote the growth of the studied market. As per the updated May 2021 data from the World Health Organization, about 1.13 billion people around the world have hypertension, of which two-third are living in low- and middle-income countries. In the report published in June 2020 titled 'A Global View on Prevalence of Hypertension and Human Development Index' to determine the relationship between the prevalence of hypertension and human development index (HDI) concluded that the prevalence of hypertension ranged from 35% to 41% among 182 countries around the world. Thus, the rising prevalence of hypertension is expected to drive the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nCertain other factors that will boost the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market include growing initiatives by private and government organizations and rising awareness about hypertension around the around. For instance, in May 2022, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals conclude the hypertension awareness symbol backed by the Association of Physicians of India (API) and Hypertension Society of India (HIS). Additionally, in May 2022, Namya Smile Foundation (NSF) organized an awareness campaign in India related to hypertension among people. The organization conducted a camp and checked the blood pressure and made them aware of various aspects of high blood pressure.\nWhereas factors such as expiration of patent of multiple major drugs along with side effects associated with the hypertension treatment and rise in the availability of other non-pharmacological based therapy will restrict the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market. For Instance, In December 2021, AbbVie, the parent company of Allergan, lost the patent of its anti-hypertensive drug, Bystolic (Nebivolol). Nebivolol is a beta blocker used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Additionally, market participants frequently introduce new products and use a variety of growth tactics in their particular segments, which is likely to spur market expansion. For Instance, in December 2021, Dr Reddy's Laboratories has launched Valsartan tablets, used for treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure, in the United States market. The Valsartan tablet is the generic therapeutic equivalent of Diovan, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). Similarly, in November 2021, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. reported that Novartis Pharma K.K. (Novartis Pharma) has obtained approval in Japan for ENTREST 100 mg and 200 mg Tablets (generic name: sacubitril valsartan sodium hydrate) for the new indication of hypertension. This approval is Japan's first of an ARNI for the indication of hypertension.\nThus, all aforementioned factors expected to boost the market growth over the forecast period, However, multiple major drug patent expiration expected to hamper the market growth.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Trends\n\n This section covers the major market trends shaping the Anti-hypertensive Drugs Market according to our research experts: \n\nDiuretics Therapeutics Class is Expected to Hold a Significant Market Share in the Forecast Period\n\nDiuretics help in reducing the sodium and water from the body by inducing kidneys to release more sodium into the urine which leads to lower blood pressure as fluid flowing through the body is decreases. Diuretics are the preferred class of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of hypertension over others mainly because of their high efficacy, low cost, and low side effects as compared to other available therapeutic classes in the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nDiuretics are of three types - thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics, from which thiazide diuretics are the cornerstone of treatment for hypertension in most patients around the world. For instance, as per the research article published in July 2022, titled 'Loop Diuretics', Loop diuretics have received FDA approval to be used alone or in combination with other anti-hypertensives to treat hypertension. However, first-line therapy does not consist solely of loop diuretics. Loop diuretics can be used to address fluid overload conditions and alternative hypertension therapy. Moreover, according to the study titled \"Thiazide diuretics alone or in combination with a potassium-sparing diuretic on blood pressure-lowering in patients with primary hypertension: protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis\" published in the BMC Open Journal in February 2022, Thiazides have a proven track record of lowering blood pressure, have a good safety record, and are inexpensive. This makes them a popular choice for pharmaceutical treatment. Hydrochlorothiazide has less antihypertensive effectiveness than chlorthalidone and indapamide. Thus,m due to above benefits of the diuretics in the management of hypertension is anticipated to boost the segmrent growth over the forecast period.\nTherefore, owing to the above-mentioned factors, the diuretics therapeutics class is expected to have highest growth as compared to others with the rise in the prevalence of hypertension cases around the world.\n\nNorth America is Expected to Dominate the Anti-hypertensive Drugs Market Over the Forecast Period\n\nNorth America holds a major share in the anti-hypertensive drugs market and is expected to show a similar trend over the forecast period mainly due to the high prevalence of hypertension and diseases causing hypertension in the region. Additionally, the demand for prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, identifying people predisposed to the disease, presence of technically advanced healthcare infrastructure, and management of the prognosis of the disease are some of the key market drivers of the North American anti-hypertension market.\nIn North America, the United States will hold the largest market in anti-hypertensive drugs market in the region. In the United States, the rising prevalence of hypertension is the major reason for the growth of the anti-hypertensive drug market. As per the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention In July 2022, over half of adults (47 percent, or 116 million) have hypertension. Thus, the growing burden of hypertension in the United States is expected to rise in the demand anti-hypertensive drug thereby boost the market growth.\nThe other factors such as increasing awareness among the people about hypertension in the region. For instance, in November 2021, New public service announcements (PSAs) were released by the American Heart Association (AHA), American Medical Association (AMA), HHS Office of Minority Health (OMH), Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA), and the Ad Council to encourage people to take charge of their health by self-monitoring their blood pressure and talking with a healthcare provider about their numbers.\nAdditionally, various strategies adopted by the key market players such as product launches and merger and acquisistion supports the market growth. In April 2021, United Therapeutics Corporation announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration approved its drug for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease, known as Tyvaso (Treprostinil).\nThus, the North America is expected to hold major market share in the anti-hypertensive market.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Industry Overview\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is highly competitive due to the presence of a number of pharmaceutical companies. Companies such as AstraZeneca PLC, C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Ko. KG, Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, Johnson & Johnson Ltd, Lupin Limited, Merck KGaA ., Novartis AG, among others, hold a substantial market share in the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Leaders\n\nPfizer Inc.\nC.H.

The Report Offers the Value (in USD) and Volume (in Units) for the Above Segments.\n\n\n\nInsulin Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nInsulin Market Analysis\n\nThe Human Insulin Drugs Market size is estimated at USD 27.96 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 33.81 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 3.87% during the forecast period (2024-2029).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the Human Insulin Drugs Market. Type-1 diabetes patients are impacted more during Covid-19. People with diabetes are having a weak immune system so, with COVID-19, the immune system gets weaker very fast. People with diabetes will have more chances to get into serious complications rather than normal people.\nDiabetes is associated with many health complications. People with diabetes have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized compared to those without diabetes, and thus, they incur more healthcare expenses compared to non-diabetic people. Patients with Type 2 diabetes require many corrections throughout the day for maintaining nominal blood glucose levels, such as the administration of additional insulin or ingestion of additional carbohydrates. Furthermore, patients attempting to control their blood glucose levels, so as to prevent the long-term complications associated with fluctuations in blood glucose levels, are at greater risk for overcorrection and the resultant hypoglycemia.\nTherefore, owing to the aforementioned factors the studied market is anticipated to witness growth over the analysis period.\n\nInsulin Market Trends\n\n\nGrowing Diabetes Prevalence Driving the Market\n\nAll type-1 diabetes patients and a limited number of type-2 diabetes patients require daily insulin injections as part of their treatment. As per the ADA, around 67.3% of the cost of diabetes care in the United States is covered by government insurance (including Medicare, Medicaid, and the military). The rest is paid for by private insurance (30.7%) or by the uninsured (2%). In Canada, the total diabetic population in the country increased by approximately 33% between 2016 and 2022, and about 8% of the diabetic population has type-1 diabetes. Many developing countries in North America, including the Caribbean countries, are undergoing an epidemiologic transition and experiencing rapid increases in the prevalence of diabetes. As of 2022, the prevalence rates for diabetes ranged from 12% to 19% of the population in several countries in the region.\nThere was a glaring research gap in the absence of data for adult populations because only 1.52 million of the 8.75 million people with type-1 diabetes worldwide in 2022 were under the age of 20. If type-1 diabetes is not correctly diagnosed and promptly treated, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can quickly result in death. Type-1 diabetes and the use of insulin were reported by 1.4 million individuals aged 20 or older, or 5.2% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, while 10.9% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, or 2.9 million adults aged 20 or older, started taking insulin within a year after diagnosis. Regular insulin is used along with a healthy diet and exercise routine to help diabetics with high blood sugar levels. Keeping blood sugar levels under control helps prevent kidney damage, blindness, nerve damage, limb loss, and issues with sexual function. Your chance of having a heart attack or stroke may be reduced if your diabetes is well controlled. This synthetic insulin is identical to human insulin. It takes the place of the insulin that your body typically produces. This insulin has a short half-life. It functions by making it easier for blood sugar (glucose) to enter cells where your body can use it as fuel. Usually, this drug is used with either a medium-acting or long-acting insulin product. The use of this medication with other oral diabetic medications is also possible.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated.\n\nNorth America Dominates the Market\n\nNorth America dominates the global human insulin market, especially the United States, owing to the high prevalence of diabetes in the region because of a sedentary lifestyle. The cost factor is the major concern in the United States, where almost 50% of the insulin revenues for the manufacturers are from the country itself. The United States accounts for the highest sales of long-acting insulin, Lantus, across the world. Most diabetic drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. Lantus is the most commonly administered basal insulin across the world, accounting for a dominant share in the US market. The traditional North American human insulin drug market is expected to grow during the forecast period due to its affordability to patients. Humulin holds the highest market share, followed by Novolin. There are no generic competitors for the traditional North American human insulin drug market in the United States. The United States accounts for the highest sales of Humalog across the world, with over 56% of the market share. The majority of diabetes drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. In the United States, Humalog is available in different varieties under names like Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog U-100, Humalog U-200, and Humalog Mix 50/50 for the treatment of diabetes.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated in the human insulin drug market.\n\nInsulin Industry Overview\n\nThe global human insulin market is highly consolidated, with three major manufacturers holding a global market presence and the remaining manufacturers confined to other local or region-specific manufacturers. Mergers and acquisitions that happened between the players in the recent past have helped the companies strengthen their market presence. Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim have an alliance to develop and commercialize Basaglar (Insulin Glargine). Biocon is developing Insulin Tregopil, an oral prandial insulin tablet, for the treatment of type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Fast-acting oral insulin could improve postprandial glucose control with reduced side effects and greater adherence, thus holding the promise to transform T1D management. Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc., a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral drug delivery systems, is working to bring the first oral insulin product to market, thus providing a more convenient, effective, and safer method for delivering insulin therapy.\n\nInsulin Market Leaders\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S\nEli Lilly and Company\nSanofi S.A.\nBiocon Limited\nPfizer Inc.\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nInsulin Market News\n\nInsulin Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

Depression is more than just a few days of moderate sadness. It's a severe clinical illness that is remarkably common and affects your overall mental health and state of mind. It may cause you to feel worn out, depressed, nervous, or terrified. It can alter the way you think, eat, and sleep. Some people may commit suicide due to depression. Antidepressants may be suggested by a medical professional for anxiety or sleeplessness in cases of chronic pain.\u00a0\r\nHealthcare professionals occasionally suggest antidepressants for various conditions. Antidepressants come in a variety of forms. Everyone operates in an unforeseen way. Doctors advise starting with the more modern antidepressants since they have fewer negative effects than the older ones. Different antidepressants may be more effective at alleviating different symptoms of depression. The way that antidepressant symptoms vary from person to person and from one medicine to the next.\nMarket Dynamics of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nKey Drivers\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nThe growing awareness of psychological health concerns and the initiatives to lessen the stigma associated with seeking treatment are major factors propelling the market for antidepressant medications. Public knowledge of psychological health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, has grown as a result of developing awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. The number of individuals who identify the signs of mental health disorders and seek professional treatment will rise, which will raise the need for antidepressant drugs. Educating the public about mental health illnesses, accessible treatments, and the need to get assistance is the aim of educational efforts and programs. Media campaigns that feature true tales, celebrity endorsements, and accurate portrayals of psychological health issues contribute to public awareness.\u00a0\nAs society's perceptions of mental health shift, there is a growing understanding of the prevalence and consequences of mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. This changing view has led more people to seek care for mental health difficulties, increasing the demand for effective therapy. Moreover, the reduced stigma has encouraged pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new, more potent antidepressants. To satisfy the needs of numerous patients, the industry has expanded to provide a greater range of treatment options.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, the data updated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in January 2022 shows depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the US, and an estimated 46.9% of adolescents with a major depressive episode and significant impairment received treatment in the previous year.\r\n(Source:https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness\u00a0)\nRestraints\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nPatients may be reluctant to begin or continue antidepressant medication due to worries about potential side effects and their general well-being. Reduced market development and poorer solution rates may result from patient resistance and non-compliance. Regulations and warning labels have the potential to negatively affect consumers' perceptions and reduce their belief in the safety of antidepressant drugs, which can hinder the growth of the market. Unfavorable events and health issues may lead to legal actions and lawsuits against medication companies. Legal disputes may be detrimental to a business's profits, the reputation of an antidepressant, and consumer trust.\nHow Did COVID-19 Impact the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nAntidepressant market growth has been positively influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic because of an increase in product sales related to the disaster. Furthermore, the market expansion has been helped by important tactics used by biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses, such as maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of their goods. Due to several causes, including financial and emotional strain, stress, worry, and dread, the pandemic has increased stress levels in the general population, which has increased the prevalence of depression. This has resulted in a greater proportion of patients receiving therapy, together with the expansion of telehealth and increased public knowledge of available treatment options.\nOpportunities\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nBy improving patient outcomes overall, increasing treatment adherence, and providing more advanced access to psychological wellness care, telemedicine, and digital mental health solutions create opportunities for the antidepressant medication industry. When more people have access to mental health services, more will be able to receive evaluations and prescriptions for antidepressants. Telemedicine platforms provide remote meetings between psychiatrists and other medical experts as well as patients. Prescriptions for antidepressants may now be filled remotely, which is more convenient for patients and may lead to a rise in prescription rates.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, In February 2021, Ginger, a company providing on-demand mental healthcare announced a partnership agreement with Capsule, a digital pharmacy. This partnership was aimed at providing Ginger members with mental health medications including anti-depressants at their homes.\u00a0\r\n(Source:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224005209/en/Ginger-Partners-with-Capsule-to-Seamlessly-Prescribe-and-Deliver-Mental-Health-Medications\u00a0)\nWe have various report editions of Antidepressant Drugs Market, hence please contact our sales team and author directly to obtain/purchase a desired Edition eg, Global Edition, Regional Edition, Country Specific Report Edition, Company Profiles, Forecast Edition, etc. Request for your Free Sample PDF/Online Access.\nCompetitive Landscape: Antidepressant Drugs Market\nMajor market participants who are essential in determining consumer preferences and market dynamics have a major impact on the antidepressant drugs market.

The market provides the value (in USD million) for the above-mentioned segments.\n\n\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Analysis\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is expected to register a CAGR of 4.5% during the forecast period (2021 to 2026).\nThe COVID-19 outbreak had a significant impact on people with hypertension. Also, due to lockdown and other restrictions imposed by governements to curb the spread of the infection from the Covid-19 virus, the lifestyle of patients with hypertension was severely impacted. As per the study titled \"COVID-19 in Patients with Hypertension\" published in Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology in July 2021, hypertension individuals who have COVID-19 have an increased risk of mortality that is at least two times higher; nevertheless, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors that have been offer protection for this subgroup of patients which in turn expected to boost the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nOne of the leading factors responsible for the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market is the rising prevalence of hypertension among people around the world. The major known causes of hypertension are kidney diseases, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and other cardiovascular diseases due to which the prevalence of hypertension has been observed a significant rise over the past few years. Also, some drugs can induce hypertension in patients with other diseases or disorders which in turn is expected to promote the growth of the studied market. As per the updated May 2021 data from the World Health Organization, about 1.13 billion people around the world have hypertension, of which two-third are living in low- and middle-income countries. In the report published in June 2020 titled 'A Global View on Prevalence of Hypertension and Human Development Index' to determine the relationship between the prevalence of hypertension and human development index (HDI) concluded that the prevalence of hypertension ranged from 35% to 41% among 182 countries around the world. Thus, the rising prevalence of hypertension is expected to drive the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nCertain other factors that will boost the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market include growing initiatives by private and government organizations and rising awareness about hypertension around the around. For instance, in May 2022, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals conclude the hypertension awareness symbol backed by the Association of Physicians of India (API) and Hypertension Society of India (HIS). Additionally, in May 2022, Namya Smile Foundation (NSF) organized an awareness campaign in India related to hypertension among people. The organization conducted a camp and checked the blood pressure and made them aware of various aspects of high blood pressure.\nWhereas factors such as expiration of patent of multiple major drugs along with side effects associated with the hypertension treatment and rise in the availability of other non-pharmacological based therapy will restrict the growth of the anti-hypertensive drugs market. For Instance, In December 2021, AbbVie, the parent company of Allergan, lost the patent of its anti-hypertensive drug, Bystolic (Nebivolol). Nebivolol is a beta blocker used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Additionally, market participants frequently introduce new products and use a variety of growth tactics in their particular segments, which is likely to spur market expansion. For Instance, in December 2021, Dr Reddy's Laboratories has launched Valsartan tablets, used for treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure, in the United States market. The Valsartan tablet is the generic therapeutic equivalent of Diovan, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). Similarly, in November 2021, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. reported that Novartis Pharma K.K. (Novartis Pharma) has obtained approval in Japan for ENTREST 100 mg and 200 mg Tablets (generic name: sacubitril valsartan sodium hydrate) for the new indication of hypertension. This approval is Japan's first of an ARNI for the indication of hypertension.\nThus, all aforementioned factors expected to boost the market growth over the forecast period, However, multiple major drug patent expiration expected to hamper the market growth.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Market Trends\n\n This section covers the major market trends shaping the Anti-hypertensive Drugs Market according to our research experts: \n\nDiuretics Therapeutics Class is Expected to Hold a Significant Market Share in the Forecast Period\n\nDiuretics help in reducing the sodium and water from the body by inducing kidneys to release more sodium into the urine which leads to lower blood pressure as fluid flowing through the body is decreases. Diuretics are the preferred class of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of hypertension over others mainly because of their high efficacy, low cost, and low side effects as compared to other available therapeutic classes in the anti-hypertensive drugs market.\nDiuretics are of three types - thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics, from which thiazide diuretics are the cornerstone of treatment for hypertension in most patients around the world. For instance, as per the research article published in July 2022, titled 'Loop Diuretics', Loop diuretics have received FDA approval to be used alone or in combination with other anti-hypertensives to treat hypertension. However, first-line therapy does not consist solely of loop diuretics. Loop diuretics can be used to address fluid overload conditions and alternative hypertension therapy. Moreover, according to the study titled \"Thiazide diuretics alone or in combination with a potassium-sparing diuretic on blood pressure-lowering in patients with primary hypertension: protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis\" published in the BMC Open Journal in February 2022, Thiazides have a proven track record of lowering blood pressure, have a good safety record, and are inexpensive. This makes them a popular choice for pharmaceutical treatment. Hydrochlorothiazide has less antihypertensive effectiveness than chlorthalidone and indapamide. Thus,m due to above benefits of the diuretics in the management of hypertension is anticipated to boost the segmrent growth over the forecast period.\nTherefore, owing to the above-mentioned factors, the diuretics therapeutics class is expected to have highest growth as compared to others with the rise in the prevalence of hypertension cases around the world.\n\nNorth America is Expected to Dominate the Anti-hypertensive Drugs Market Over the Forecast Period\n\nNorth America holds a major share in the anti-hypertensive drugs market and is expected to show a similar trend over the forecast period mainly due to the high prevalence of hypertension and diseases causing hypertension in the region. Additionally, the demand for prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, identifying people predisposed to the disease, presence of technically advanced healthcare infrastructure, and management of the prognosis of the disease are some of the key market drivers of the North American anti-hypertension market.\nIn North America, the United States will hold the largest market in anti-hypertensive drugs market in the region. In the United States, the rising prevalence of hypertension is the major reason for the growth of the anti-hypertensive drug market. As per the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention In July 2022, over half of adults (47 percent, or 116 million) have hypertension. Thus, the growing burden of hypertension in the United States is expected to rise in the demand anti-hypertensive drug thereby boost the market growth.\nThe other factors such as increasing awareness among the people about hypertension in the region. For instance, in November 2021, New public service announcements (PSAs) were released by the American Heart Association (AHA), American Medical Association (AMA), HHS Office of Minority Health (OMH), Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA), and the Ad Council to encourage people to take charge of their health by self-monitoring their blood pressure and talking with a healthcare provider about their numbers.\nAdditionally, various strategies adopted by the key market players such as product launches and merger and acquisistion supports the market growth. In April 2021, United Therapeutics Corporation announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration approved its drug for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease, known as Tyvaso (Treprostinil).\nThus, the North America is expected to hold major market share in the anti-hypertensive market.\n\nAnti-hypertensive Drugs Industry Overview\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is highly competitive due to the presence of a number of pharmaceutical companies. Companies such as AstraZeneca PLC, C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Ko.

    "Summarized_Document3": "Antihypertensive Drugs Market Size & Share Analysis - Growth Trends & Forecasts (2024 - 2029)\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.5% from 2021 to 2026. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted individuals with hypertension, increasing the demand for anti-hypertensive drugs. The rising prevalence of hypertension, driven by factors such as kidney diseases, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, is a major growth driver. According to the World Health Organization, about 1.13 billion people globally have hypertension, with two-thirds living in low- and middle-income countries. The prevalence of hypertension ranges from 35% to 41% among 182 countries.\n\nPrivate and government initiatives are also boosting market growth. For example, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals and the Namya Smile Foundation have conducted awareness campaigns in India. However, the expiration of patents for major drugs and the side effects associated with hypertension treatments are expected to restrain market growth. For instance, AbbVie lost the patent for its drug Bystolic in December 2021.\n\nDiuretics are expected to hold a significant market share due to their high efficacy, low cost, and minimal side effects. Thiazide diuretics, in particular, are widely used for hypertension treatment. North America is expected to dominate the market, driven by the high prevalence of hypertension and advanced healthcare infrastructure. The United States, where 47% of adults have hypertension, will hold the largest market share in the region.\n\nThe anti-hypertensive drugs market is highly competitive, with major players including Pfizer Inc., C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Ko. KG, Noden Pharma DAC, Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, and Merck KGaA. The market is segmented by therapeutic class (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers, alpha blockers, renin inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and other therapeutic classes) and geography (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, and South America).\n\nThe report covers market dynamics, including drivers such as the increasing prevalence of hypertension and growing awareness, and restraints like drug patent expirations and side effects. It also includes a competitive landscape analysis and profiles of key companies. The market is expected to see significant growth in Asia-Pacific due to rising health awareness and an aging population.",

Last year, the Lakers finished the season 47-35 and made the playoffs. However, they lost to the Denver Nuggets in the First Round in 5 games. Will they fare better this year? Let's find out.\nLos Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will go 48-34 in the regular season and make the playoffs. But before we show what happened in the postseason, let's see how they got there in the first place.\nOctober \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers' 2024-2025 season started on a rough note, with the team going 1-4 in October. The team performed well offensively, but the same couldn't be said about the defense. They managed to start the year 1-0 after beating Minnesota 111-103. But they instantly faced a fierce five-game losing streak that set them back.\nLeBron James and Anthony Davis led the team in minutes per game, points scored, and several other statistical categories. But as we can see, there'll need to be improvements from other players if they want to turn things around.\nNovember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe month of November was a bit better for the Lakers, but the team still struggled. As we mentioned, they suffered a loss to start the month, extending their losing streak to five. However, the Lakers went on to win seven of their next nine games to go 8-7. However, as soon as things were looking better, they lost four straight to end the month and end up being below .500 again.\nNothing was too different here than in October. While the team played well offensively, they allowed over 1,500 points (110 points per game) in a 14 game stretch. However, the season is still early and anything is possible.\nDecember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nBecause some games are still to be decided, a couple of games here do not reflect the actual 2024-2025 season. Instead of waiting for December to see the confirmed matchups, we just rocked with what NBA 2K25's MyNBA mode provided for us. The rest of the season does accurately reflect the real 2024-2024 schedule.\nAnyways, it was a better month for the Lakers who finally evened out their record. Additionally, the defense managed to buckle down and play better, though they still need to improve. However, thanks LeBron averaging over 27 points per game, the Lakers' offense is in good hands. We also got to see Bronny James play for the first time, though he only played for two minutes against the Kings near the end of the month.\nJanuary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers started off their New Year with a win to go above .500 for the first time this season. They went on to win two more games to extend their win streak to four games. Furthermore, this month saw the team win some important matchups, including a 1 point victory over the Celtics.\nIn fact, L.A. had three close games this month in which the winning team only won by 1 point. Another thing worth noting is the defensive improvement. This month they only allowed over 100 points in half of their matchups this month. It's not perfect, but the Lakers seemed to find a better rhythm in terms of defense.\nOverall, Davis and LeBron continue to be the superstars of this team. Fortunately, they've both been healthy and didn't get injured\u2026 yet.\nFebruary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers continued another win streak in the month of February, winning their first three games before losing to the Pacers. Overall, they went 16-11 in the first two months of the year as they continue to build their record. At this point into the season, it seems unlikely the Lakers will be able to catch up to the Mavericks, who are the #1 team in the league.\nThe Lakers still find themselves fighting for a playoff spot, but the slight improvements every month seem to help the team inch towards a postseason spot.\nA quick shoutout to Austin Reaves here, who put up 29 points in the team's 127-94 win over the Denver Nuggets. With Nikola Jokic missing the game due to injury the Lakers took advantage and got a little revenge on Denver.\nMarch \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nMarch started off ugly as the team suffered a 77-97 loss to the Clippers. However, they went on to win 12 games this month as they essentially clinched a playoff spot. They also faced a lot of adversity, as D'Angelo Russell missed time due to injury. Although not the star player of the team, it hurts to lose good depth guys.\nNevertheless, L.A. performed fine without him, as LeBron James continued to ball out. We also got to see Bronny play, but just barely. He made one basket and earned an assist in the team's 113-102 win over the Grizzlies. But the most important thing here for L.A. to do is win a few more games to reserve a playoff spot.\nApril \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nDespite an ugly three-game losing streak in the middle of the month, the Lakers did just enough to earn the fifth seed in the NBA Playoffs. They started the month with back-to-back wins, and ended the month with another two to edge out Sacramento for the 5 seed.\nLike last year, it wasn't the most prettiest season, but L.A. found a way to make the postseason and avoid the Play-In. However, they now host a San Antonio Spurs team which shocked the league this season. Can they defeat San Antonio, whose now led by second-year superstar Victor Wembanyama?\nNBA Playoffs First Round \u2013 vs. #4 San Antonio Spurs\nThe Lakers got off to a hot start in this series, but ultimately let the Spurs take a quick 2-1 lead in the series. However, LeBron buckled down, averaging a whopping 33 points per game to help the Lakers overcome the Spurs. However, there was one major problem the Lakers now had to deal with.\nAnthony Davis suffered an ankle injury which would cause him to miss at least the next round. Can the Lakers hold off the #1 Mavericks without him?\nNBA Playoffs QuarterFinals \u2013 vs. #1 Dallas Mavericks\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will lose to the Dallas Mavericks in the Quarterfinals of the NBA Playoffs. Due to Anthony Davis' injury, the team suffered a serious collapse, failing to score and rebound throughout the contest. LeBron also faltered, now averaging just 23 points per game in the series.\nAlthough they made it farther than they did last season, the Lakers were still hoping to reach the NBA Finals again. As long as LeBron is still playing at an All-Star level, the team can definitely make a big push this year. Unfortunately, NBA 2K25 doesn't think they'll go that far.\nOverall, that wraps up the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25. We hope you enjoyed reading. We also look forward to another exciting NBA Season, which begins in October.\nFor more gaming and NBA news, visit ClutchPoints.

Where does everyone else land?\nShare this story\n\nShare\nAll sharing options for:\nReport card: grading each member of the Celtics through 55 games\n\nThe All-Star break is an ideal time to take a step back, catch our collective breath and analyze what we\u2019ve seen to this point.\nIt\u2019s also a fun time to dish out some grades. The Celtics are 43-12, so naturally most of these grades are going to be favorable, but the minuses and pluses are sure to spark some debate. Here we go:\nJayson Tatum: A\nTatum is the best player on the best team. Forget the Most Valuable Player talk for a second. He probably won\u2019t win it, and that\u2019s OK; he\u2019s the head of the snake and has reached a new level as a leader this year with Marcus Smart gone. \nHe\u2019s taking even more accountability defensively, minimizing poor shooting nights and complaining about calls a little less (I said a little). If he\u2019s not careful, he might become the face of the league in June.\nJayson Tatum is confident he's the NBA's top player   pic.twitter.com/UBL5SyCaZu\nJaylen Brown: B+\nBrown has had some moments of brilliance and some head-scratchers along the way. He\u2019s capable of dropping 30-plus any night, but he\u2019s also capable of dropping 10 or fewer. The most important thing for him (now that he appears to possess a left hand) is consistency. \nHe\u2019s shooting a career-high 49.2 percent from the floor, but just 34.2 percent from 3-point range. His defense and passing have improved, but he\u2019s averaging his fewest rebounds (5.5) since 2018-19. When Brown is elite, the Celtics are essentially unbeatable.\nKristaps Porzingis: A\nIt\u2019s hard to remember a situation since Kevin Garnett where a player adjusted so seamlessly and immediately felt like the missing piece. Porzingis has been insanely efficient on post-ups, excelling in an area the Celtics dramatically needed him to.\nHe\u2019s also been a pleasant surprise defensively and is more capable of guarding shorter players than I realized. The only small critiques are that he should shoot a smidgen more 2s and a smidgen fewer 3s. I mean, the guy\u2019s 7\u20192 with the touch of an angel.\nMost points per possession on post-ups this season (min. 75 FGA): 1.42 - Kristaps Porzingis 1.17 - Joel Embiid 1.17 - Myles Turner 1.16 - Jayson Tatum1.15 - Jonas Valanciunas 1.14 - Nikola Jokic 1.12 - Anthony Davis 1.11 - Karl-Anthony TownsKP in a league of his own   pic.twitter.com/I58XI7K17E\nJrue Holiday: A-\nHoliday\u2019s 3-point shooting has exceeded expectations (career-high 44 percent), and he sets the tone defensively every night. He always finds clever ways to contribute, whether he takes 20 shots or five. \nHis maturity, consistency and poise set him apart. One area I\u2019d like to see a bit more is playmaking. He\u2019s averaging 4.8 assists \u2013 his lowest since 2011-12 \u2013 and I believe that number could be around 6. Obviously part of it is circumstantial, but I think putting the ball in his hands at the top of the key a bit more could be beneficial.\nDerrick White: A\nDon\u2019t worry, White gets an A. I\u2019m sure my colleagues would blast me if he didn\u2019t, but he truthfully does deserve one. He has career-highs in points (15.6), rebounds (3.9), blocks (1.2) and steals (1) and consistently plays his best in the fourth quarter.\nWhite is the consummate professional and has become a fan favorite. He can do no wrong in Celtics\u2019 fans eyes. Folks appreciate guys who hustle, make winning plays and exude charisma, and White embodies all those characteristics and then some.\nAl Horford: B+\nHorford is always ready, whether the Celtics need him to play 30 minutes or 15. At the moment, he gets a B+, but this grade is less relevant than some others. It\u2019s all about preserving him for the playoffs, and he\u2019s fully capable of upping his grade to an A then \u2013 particularly if Boston plays Philly.\nOne area Horford has really excelled this year is rebounding (6.7 a night). His 3-point shooting has naturally dipped a bit from last year, but it\u2019s still at 40.9 percent. I still want to see him attack the basket a bit more, but it\u2019s possible that\u2019s just not in his wheelhouse at this point.\nPayton Pritchard: A-\nThe Celtics were right to pay Pritchard, and overall, he\u2019s thrived in his expanded role. He\u2019s 15th in the league in assist-to-turnover ratio (4.81) and has excelled as a ball-handler and facilitator. \nHe\u2019s always locked in, whether he plays in the fourth quarter of a close game or garbage time (don\u2019t tell him it\u2019s garbage time). Pritchard fits in perfectly with this core.\nPayton Pritchard stats at the All-Star break:20.7 MPG8.1 PPG3.2 RPG2.8 APG44% FG38% 3FGHow are we feeling about the season so far @paytonpritch3?? pic.twitter.com/BC3DTIIaJo\nSam Hauser: A-\nHauser\u2019s shooting 41.2 percent from 3, which is great, but it\u2019s really his spacing that sets him apart. When Tatum, Brown and Porzingis have the ball, you really can\u2019t double. If you do, they\u2019ll find Hauser open for 3. He\u2019s solid with the bench unit, but he\u2019s even more lethal with the starters.\nHe\u2019s also been a pleasant surprise defensively, and his mid-range jumper\u2019s improved as well. It\u2019s easy to forget this is just his second season logging regular minutes.\nLuke Kornet: B+\nKornet\u2019s averages of 4.9 points and 4 rebounds aren\u2019t earth-shattering, but they\u2019re pretty solid when you consider that he plays 14.9 minutes per game. He\u2019s sneaky good in the pick-and-roll, an absolute goofball and excellent for team vibes. Rim protection is an area where he could improve.\nOshae Brissett: B\nIf Brissett can get that 3-point percentage up just a tick, from 29.3 to 33.3 or so, that would go a long way. He\u2019s long, athletic and has a good motor, but his shot makes him a bit of a liability at the moment.\nNeemias Queta: B+\nQueta is the definition of a \u201cfun project.\u201d You can sometimes see the lightbulb go off mid-game, which is pretty cool, and he\u2019s only getting better. The next steps are post moves, lateral quickness and defending without fouling.\n\n    More From\n    \n        CelticsBlog\n\n\n\n\n\n          Most Read\n        \n\n\n\nSign up for the\n          \n            newsletter\n          \n          Sign up for the Celtics Blog Daily Roundup newsletter!\n        \nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\nOops.

Last year, the Lakers finished the season 47-35 and made the playoffs. However, they lost to the Denver Nuggets in the First Round in 5 games. Will they fare better this year? Let's find out.\nLos Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will go 48-34 in the regular season and make the playoffs. But before we show what happened in the postseason, let's see how they got there in the first place.\nOctober \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers' 2024-2025 season started on a rough note, with the team going 1-4 in October. The team performed well offensively, but the same couldn't be said about the defense. They managed to start the year 1-0 after beating Minnesota 111-103. But they instantly faced a fierce five-game losing streak that set them back.\nLeBron James and Anthony Davis led the team in minutes per game, points scored, and several other statistical categories. But as we can see, there'll need to be improvements from other players if they want to turn things around.\nNovember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe month of November was a bit better for the Lakers, but the team still struggled. As we mentioned, they suffered a loss to start the month, extending their losing streak to five. However, the Lakers went on to win seven of their next nine games to go 8-7. However, as soon as things were looking better, they lost four straight to end the month and end up being below .500 again.\nNothing was too different here than in October. While the team played well offensively, they allowed over 1,500 points (110 points per game) in a 14 game stretch. However, the season is still early and anything is possible.\nDecember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nBecause some games are still to be decided, a couple of games here do not reflect the actual 2024-2025 season. Instead of waiting for December to see the confirmed matchups, we just rocked with what NBA 2K25's MyNBA mode provided for us. The rest of the season does accurately reflect the real 2024-2024 schedule.\nAnyways, it was a better month for the Lakers who finally evened out their record. Additionally, the defense managed to buckle down and play better, though they still need to improve. However, thanks LeBron averaging over 27 points per game, the Lakers' offense is in good hands. We also got to see Bronny James play for the first time, though he only played for two minutes against the Kings near the end of the month.\nJanuary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers started off their New Year with a win to go above .500 for the first time this season. They went on to win two more games to extend their win streak to four games. Furthermore, this month saw the team win some important matchups, including a 1 point victory over the Celtics.\nIn fact, L.A. had three close games this month in which the winning team only won by 1 point. Another thing worth noting is the defensive improvement. This month they only allowed over 100 points in half of their matchups this month. It's not perfect, but the Lakers seemed to find a better rhythm in terms of defense.\nOverall, Davis and LeBron continue to be the superstars of this team. Fortunately, they've both been healthy and didn't get injured\u2026 yet.\nFebruary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers continued another win streak in the month of February, winning their first three games before losing to the Pacers. Overall, they went 16-11 in the first two months of the year as they continue to build their record. At this point into the season, it seems unlikely the Lakers will be able to catch up to the Mavericks, who are the #1 team in the league.\nThe Lakers still find themselves fighting for a playoff spot, but the slight improvements every month seem to help the team inch towards a postseason spot.\nA quick shoutout to Austin Reaves here, who put up 29 points in the team's 127-94 win over the Denver Nuggets. With Nikola Jokic missing the game due to injury the Lakers took advantage and got a little revenge on Denver.\nMarch \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nMarch started off ugly as the team suffered a 77-97 loss to the Clippers. However, they went on to win 12 games this month as they essentially clinched a playoff spot. They also faced a lot of adversity, as D'Angelo Russell missed time due to injury. Although not the star player of the team, it hurts to lose good depth guys.\nNevertheless, L.A. performed fine without him, as LeBron James continued to ball out. We also got to see Bronny play, but just barely. He made one basket and earned an assist in the team's 113-102 win over the Grizzlies. But the most important thing here for L.A. to do is win a few more games to reserve a playoff spot.\nApril \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nDespite an ugly three-game losing streak in the middle of the month, the Lakers did just enough to earn the fifth seed in the NBA Playoffs. They started the month with back-to-back wins, and ended the month with another two to edge out Sacramento for the 5 seed.\nLike last year, it wasn't the most prettiest season, but L.A. found a way to make the postseason and avoid the Play-In. However, they now host a San Antonio Spurs team which shocked the league this season. Can they defeat San Antonio, whose now led by second-year superstar Victor Wembanyama?\nNBA Playoffs First Round \u2013 vs. #4 San Antonio Spurs\nThe Lakers got off to a hot start in this series, but ultimately let the Spurs take a quick 2-1 lead in the series. However, LeBron buckled down, averaging a whopping 33 points per game to help the Lakers overcome the Spurs. However, there was one major problem the Lakers now had to deal with.\nAnthony Davis suffered an ankle injury which would cause him to miss at least the next round. Can the Lakers hold off the #1 Mavericks without him?\nNBA Playoffs QuarterFinals \u2013 vs. #1 Dallas Mavericks\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will lose to the Dallas Mavericks in the Quarterfinals of the NBA Playoffs. Due to Anthony Davis' injury, the team suffered a serious collapse, failing to score and rebound throughout the contest. LeBron also faltered, now averaging just 23 points per game in the series.\nAlthough they made it farther than they did last season, the Lakers were still hoping to reach the NBA Finals again. As long as LeBron is still playing at an All-Star level, the team can definitely make a big push this year. Unfortunately, NBA 2K25 doesn't think they'll go that far.\nOverall, that wraps up the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25. We hope you enjoyed reading. We also look forward to another exciting NBA Season, which begins in October.\nFor more gaming and NBA news, visit ClutchPoints.

    "Document3": "Trail Blazers suffer 3rd worst loss in history at Miami Heat\nPatty Mills #88 of the Miami Heat shoots the ball against the Portland Trailblazers during the first half at the Kaseya Center on March 29, 2024 in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Lauren Sopourn/Getty Images)Getty Images\nDeandre Ayton and Matisse Thubulle returned to the rotation for the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night and were greeted rather rudely by the Miami Heat.\nThe Heat led 29-19 after the first quarter then went off for 45 points in the second quarter to lead 74-30 at halftime. The Blazers never remotely got back into the game and fell 142-82, the third most lopsided defeat in franchise history.\n\u201cIt was just a rough one,\u201d Blazers coach Chauncey Billups told reporters. \u201cIt was just a rough one for everybody.\u201d\nNot quite everybody. Ayton, who missed four games with elbow tendinitis, did all he could during a dreadful first half by scoring 16 points on 8-of-13 shooting.\n\u201cWe were happy to have him,\u201d Billups said. \u201cDA was his normal efficient self. He was very efficient and he was good on the glass. I\u2019m pretty sure he felt good just kind of getting back out there after being down for a while. I thought he did the best that he could.\u201d\nThe rest of the Blazers shot 10 of 32 (31.3%) from the field in the first half and 1 of 14 from three-point range while committing 10 turnovers.\nFor the game, the Blazers shot 39.8% from the field and 5 on 31 threes (16.1%). The Blazers committed 24 turnovers on the night.\nBillups briefly discussed how the Blazers started off playing clean basketball. They led 11-10 about four minutes into the game.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t last long,\u201d Billups said. \u201cIt happened pretty quick where we couldn\u2019t score. We couldn\u2019t get in the paint. We try to make a point, always, of getting the ball to the paint. Collapsing defenses and then create the chase, is what I call it.\u201d\nInstead, Miami prevented the Blazers from accomplishing their goal.\n\u201cTheir defense, they got physical,\u201d Billups said. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t get to the paint. And we just kind of settled, settled, settled. We turned it over. And we had a lot of what I call \u2018shooting turnovers,\u2019 which are just horrible shots that might as well be a turnover. And everything just kind of went bad at the same time.\u201d\nAyton, who played just over five minutes in the second half, finished with 18 points and eight rebounds. Scoot Henderson led the Blazers with 20 points with six assists but also committed seven turnovers.\nDalano Banton, who set a career high with 31 points during Wednesday\u2019s loss at Atlanta, shot just 5 of 19 against the Heat for 12 points.\nThe Heat did whatever they wanted on offense, shooting 59.3% from the field and 21 of 39 on threes (53.8%).\nThe Heat had six players with double-digit scoring, four over 20. Thomas Bryant led the Heat with 26 points off the bench. Terry Rozier scored 22 with six assists.\nWHAT IT MEANS\nThe Blazers (19-55) lost their ninth consecutive game to match their longest losing streak of the season. The Heat (40-33) remained in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, slightly ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers (39-35).\nMONUMENTAL LOSS\nThe 60-point defeat is the third-worst in franchise history. Earlier this season, Portland lost 139-77 at Oklahoma City. That 62-point defeat ranks second all-time. The Blazers\u2019 worst loss in franchise history came Feb. 27, 1998, at Indiana by the score of 124-59 (65 points).\nMATISSE THYBULLE\nThe Blazers guard returned to action but didn\u2019t last long. Thybulle played seven minutes before leaving the game with a right ankle impingement. He had missed five games with an ankle injury leading up to Friday night.\nNEXT UP\nThe Blazers play at 4 p.m. Monday at the Orlando Magic.\nLatest Blazers news\n-- Aaron Fentress | afentress@Oregonian.com | @AaronJFentress (Twitter), @AaronJFentress (Instagram), @AaronFentress (Facebook)\nMORE BLAZERS COVERAGE\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

As we look forward to fiscal 2025, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth, EPS growth and free cash flow productivity \u2013 each in-line with our long-term growth algorithm. We remain committed to our integrated strategy \u2013 a focused product portfolio of daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority (of product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and consumer and customer value), productivity, constructive disruption and an agile and accountable organization \u2013 all aimed at delivering sustainable, balanced growth and value creation.\"\nFiscal Year ($ billions, except EPS)\nGAAP\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP*\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$84.0\n$82.0\n+2%\n\u00a0\nOrganic Sales\nn/a\nn/a\n+4%\nDiluted EPS\n$6.02\n$5.90\n+2%\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n$6.59\n$5.90\n+12%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFourth Quarter ($ billions, except EPS)\nGAAP\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP*\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$20.5\n$20.6\n\u2014%\n\u00a0\nOrganic Sales\nn/a\nn/a\n+2%\nDiluted EPS\n$1.27\n$1.37\n(7)%\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n$1.40\n$1.37\n+2%\n* Please refer to Exhibit 1 - Non-GAAP Measures for the definition and reconciliation of these measures to the related GAAP measures.\nFiscal Year 2024 Results\nThe Company reported fiscal year 2024 net sales of $84.0 billion, an increase of two percent versus the prior year. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased four percent. Higher pricing contributed four points of growth to organic sales. Shipment volumes and mix were unchanged versus the prior year.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $6.02, an increase of two percent versus prior year as the increase in net sales was partially offset by a non-cash charge to impair the carrying value of the Gillette trade name intangible asset and higher non-core restructuring charges. Core net earnings per share increased by 12% to $6.59. Currency-neutral core EPS increased 16% versus the prior year EPS.\nThe Company generated operating cash flow of $19.8 billion and net earnings of $15.0 billion for the fiscal year. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 105%, which is calculated as operating cash flow less capital spending and certain other items, as a percentage of net earnings excluding the Gillette impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria.\nThe Company returned over $14 billion of value to shareholders in fiscal 2024 via $9.3 billion in dividend payments and $5 billion of share repurchases. With the dividend increase in April 2024, this marks the 68th consecutive year that P&G has increased its dividend and the 134th consecutive year that P&G has paid a dividend since its incorporation in 1890.\nApril-June Quarter Results\nThe Company reported fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter net sales of $20.5 billion, unchanged versus the prior year. A one percent increase in all-in volume and one percent increase due to higher pricing were offset by two percentage points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased two percent. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased two percent. Mix had a neutral impact on sales growth for the quarter.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS increased six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nOperating cash flow was $5.8 billion and net earnings were $3.1 billion, with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 148%.\nApril-June Quarter Business Discussion\nApril - June 2024\nVolume\nForeign\nExchange\nPrice\nMix\nOther (2)\nNet Sales\nOrganic\nVolume\nOrganic\nSales\nNet Sales Drivers (1)\nBeauty\n(1)%\n(3)%\n3%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n(1)%\n1%\n3%\nGrooming\n2%\n(7)%\n5%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n2%\n7%\nHealth Care\n2%\n(1)%\n2%\n1%\n(1)%\n3%\n1%\n4%\nFabric & Home Care\n2%\n(1)%\n(1)%\n1%\n(1)%\n\u2014%\n3%\n2%\nBaby, Feminine & Family Care\n(1)%\n(2)%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n(3)%\n(1)%\n(1)%\nTotal P&G\n1%\n(2)%\n1%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n2%\n2%\n(1) \u00a0Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.\n(2) \u00a0Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.\nBeauty segment organic sales increased three percent versus year ago. Skin and Personal Care organic sales were unchanged as growth from increased pricing was offset by lower sales of the super-premium SK-II brand and in Greater China. Hair Care organic sales increased high single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix due to growth of premium products.\nGrooming segment organic sales increased seven percent versus year ago driven by increased pricing primarily in Latin America and volume growth from innovation.\nHealth Care segment organic sales increased four percent versus year ago. Oral Care organic sales increased high single digits due to premium product mix and volume growth in North America and Europe. Personal Health Care organic sales were unchanged as growth due to pricing and volume increases were offset by unfavorable mix due to lower incidence of cough and cold.\nFabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased two percent versus year ago. Fabric Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth driven by North America and Europe was offset by lower pricing due to increased promotional spending. Home Care organic sales increased high single digits due to volume growth from innovation and favorable product mix.\nBaby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales declined one percent versus year ago. Baby Care organic sales decreased mid-single digits due to volume declines from share losses, partially offset by premium product mix. Feminine Care organic sales increased low single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix. Family Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth was offset by unfavorable product mix.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27 for the quarter, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased by two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS were up six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nReported gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points versus year ago. Core gross margin for the quarter increased 140 basis points versus year ago, 180 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 210 basis points of productivity savings, 100 basis points of lower commodity costs and 40 basis points of pricing benefit. These were partially offset by 130 basis points of unfavorable product mix and 40 basis points of product/package reinvestments and other impacts.\nReported selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 260 basis points versus the prior year. Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 240 basis points versus year ago and 240 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 300 basis points of marketing reinvestments and 30 basis points of wage inflation and overhead investments, partially offset by 40 basis points of productivity savings and 50 basis points of net sales growth leverage and other impacts.\nReported operating margin for the quarter decreased 140 basis points due primarily to higher restructuring charges. Excluding 40 basis points of non-core restructuring charges, core operating margin for the quarter decreased 100 basis points versus the prior year, 60 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. Core operating margin included gross productivity savings of 250 basis points.\nLimited Market Portfolio Restructuring\nIn December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company said that it expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to 1.5 billion after tax, including foreign currency translation losses to be recognized upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has substantially liquidated its operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, and recorded a non-cash charge of $216 million after tax for accumulated currency translation losses. On July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 million for accumulated currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\nIntangible Asset Impairment\nIn the October-December 2023 quarter of the fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge, on intangible assets acquired as part of the Company\u2019s acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nThe impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value.\nFiscal Year 2025 Guidance\nP&G expects fiscal year 2025 all-in sales growth in the range of two to four percent versus the prior year. Foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately one percentage point to all-in sales growth. The Company expects organic sales growth in the range of three to five percent.\nP&G expects fiscal 2025 diluted net earnings per share growth in the range of 10% to 12% versus fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS of $6.02. P&G expects its fiscal 2025 core net earnings per share growth in the range of five to seven percent versus fiscal 2024 core EPS of $6.59. This outlook equates to a range of $6.91 to $7.05 per share, with a mid-point estimate of $6.98, or an increase of 6%.\nThe Company said its outlook estimates a net headwind of around $500 million after-tax from unfavorable commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. The net headwind equates to a $0.20 per share for fiscal 2025, or a three percentage drag on core EPS growth.\nIn addition, the prior fiscal year included benefits from minor brand divestitures and tax impacts that are unlikely to repeat to the same extent in the new fiscal year. Combined, these are an additional $0.10 to $0.12 headwind to core EPS.\nThe Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures without unreasonable efforts given the unpredictability of the timing and amounts of discrete items, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or impairments, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nP&G said it expects a core effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% in fiscal 2025.\nCapital spending is estimated to be in the range of four to five percent of fiscal 2025 net sales.\nP&G said it expects adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% and expects to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 to $7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures because the Company cannot predict the timing and amounts of discrete items such as acquisition and divestitures, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nThe Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:\nIncremental restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges.\nIntangible asset impairment: In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($1.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying value of the Gillette intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nWe do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.\nOrganic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nCore EPS and Currency-neutral EPS: Core net earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as useful supplemental measures of Company performance over time.\nCore gross margin and Currency-neutral Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's Core gross margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nCore selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as a percentage of sales and Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales: Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's Core selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provides a supplemental perspective to the Company's operating efficiency over time.\nCore operating margin and Currency-neutral Core operating margin: Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's Core operating margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nAdjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.\nAdjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G\u2019s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nTHE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nAmounts in millions except per share amounts\nAs Reported\n(GAAP)\n\u00a0\nIncremental\nRestructuring\n\u00a0\nIntangible\nImpairment\n\u00a0\nCore\n(Non-GAAP)\n\u00a0\nAs Reported\n(GAAP) (1)\nCost of products sold\n$\n10,348\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n(45\n)\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,303\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,613\n\u00a0\nGross profit\n\u00a0\n10,183\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n10,229\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n9,940\n\u00a0\nGross margin\n\u00a0\n49.6\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n49.8\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n48.4\n%\nCurrency impact to Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n50.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n\u00a0\n6,299\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(28\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n6,271\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5,778\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n30.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(0.2\n)%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n28.1\n%\nCurrency impact to Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperating income\n\u00a0\n3,884\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n73\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,958\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4,162\n\u00a0\nOperating margin\n\u00a0\n18.9\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.3\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n20.3\n%\nCurrency impact to Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOther non-operating income, net\n\u00a0\n98\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n248\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n346\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n195\n\u00a0\nIncome taxes\n\u00a0\n726\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(6\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n720\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n841\n\u00a0\nNet earnings attributable to P&G\n\u00a0\n3,137\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n327\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,464\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,384\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted net earnings per common share (2)\n$\n1.27\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n0.13\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.40\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.37\n\u00a0\nCurrency impact to Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n0.05\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n1.45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n\u00a0\n2,472.2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2,477.5\n\u00a0\nCommon shares outstanding -

The report offers market size and values in (USD Billion) during the forecasted years for the above segments.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Size\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Analysis\nThe Beauty and Personal Care Products Market size is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, registering a CAGR of 4.64% over the next five years.\nMillennials are increasingly using beauty products like color cosmetics as part of their regular grooming routines. For instance, as of 2021, according to financial comparison service provider Mozo, the average Australian woman spent approximately USD 3,600 on beauty and personal care products yearly. The simple accessibility of these cosmetic items through various sales channels, with the increased emphasis on personal grooming, aided the sales value. Furthermore, the emergence of cosmetics with natural, non-toxic, and organic components helped the market expansion. With the rising awareness about the harmful effects of chemicals and synthetic products, consumers are inclined toward organic personal care products. It is expected to drive market growth during the study period. Besides this, companies are capitalizing on consumers' demands to expand their share and consumer base in the market. For instance, in February 2022, a United Kingdom-based fashion company, Boohoo, launched a vegan beauty range of more than 50 products. Boohoo Beauty's cosmetics line includes highlighter sticks, blush, setting sprays, cosmetic palettes, and others available exclusively.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Trends\nInclination toward Natural/Organic Formulations\nThe growing concerns regarding the side effects of chemicals in personal care products, leading to skin irritation, allergies, and dullness, fueled the demand for natural and organic skincare products. Prolonged use of synthetic cosmetics may cause various health issues, such as irritation, hormonal imbalance, and toxicity. However, cosmetic products made of organic ingredients, such as plant extracts and natural oils, do not harm the skin. Natural skincare and cosmetic products that are free from chemicals and transparent about the content are preferred by consumers. This factor resulted in a shift in preference from synthetic skincare products to organic products among consumers.\nTo capitalize on this growing interest, manufacturers are revamping and expanding their product offerings by introducing a wide range of organic skincare products. These products contain plant-based, clean-label ingredients with organic, vegan, natural, chemical-free, and cruelty-free claims. For instance, in April 2022, Shiseido revealed a new skincare brand, Ul\u00e9. It sources pesticide-free botanicals from local vertical farms. The dissemination of knowledge related to the benefits of natural skincare led consumers to seek eco-friendly, sustainable, natural skincare products that offer greater product ingredient transparency. Furthermore, the growing trend of organic concepts through online stores for bio-cosmetic products is expected to boost the growth of the natural and organic beauty and personal care products market.\nAsia-Pacific Emerges as the Fastest-growing Region\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, countries like China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam present considerable growth opportunities for the market players. It is primarily due to the growing demand for color cosmetics, as many people unleash the potential of cosmetics in their daily makeup routine. Hence, the significant players are intensely embarking on product innovation and mergers and acquisitions as their prime strategy to consolidate the market. For instance, in April 2023, Personal care and beauty brand The Body Shop launched its 'activist' product range in the Indian market. The new line strengthens the brand's sustainable commitment in the country with a selection of skin products and color cosmetics.\nFurthermore, growing awareness regarding cosmetics products, such as facial makeup, hairstyling, and coloring products, with increasing demand for clean labels and natural ingredients, is expected to drive the market shortly. The need for multifunctional products is driving innovation as price-conscious consumers are opting for products that provide hydration and skin protection. The trend of social media influencers showcasing their beauty regimens increased over the past few years. Thus, both local and international beauty companies are turning to influencers to increase their brand awareness and reach potential consumers. For instance, in September 2022, as part of its global expansion, the Honest Company, a clean lifestyle company founded by Jessica Alba, launched its business in China. To capitalize on the relatively small but rising demand for sanitary beauty products, the digitally native company created a flagship store on Tmall Global, Alibaba Group's cross-border e-commerce platform. Chinese shoppers can purchase skin care and color cosmetics from Honest's brand, Honest Beauty. Shoppers on Tmall Global can select from various stock-keeping units, including its Extreme Length Mascara + Lash Primer and Hydrogel Cream, a face cream enriched with hyaluronic acid.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Industry Overview\nThe global beauty and personal care market is highly competitive, with a strong presence of regional and international players in the market like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. Demand is mainly driven by more adaptation toward skincare routines and consumer awareness about brand know-how. The companies improved the quality and product innovation regarding ingredients, functionality, and packaging. The key players are embarking on mergers, acquisitions, and product innovation as their key strategies to achieve consolidation and optimize offerings. Moreover, these players merge with local players to gain dominance in the local market.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Leaders\nThe Procter & Gamble Company\nL'Oreal SA\nUnilever PLC\nColgate-Palmolive Company\nThe Estee Lauder Companies\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market News\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The restructuring expenses of $55 million in the quarter ($479 million Q4 YTD) include the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments.\nIn fiscal 2023, the company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within the MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network arrangements. The restructuring expenses of $84 million in the quarter ($319 million Q4 YTD) primarily includes inventory and instrument reserves related to the market and product exits.\nEuropean Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company\u2019s previously registered products. MDR is a replacement of the existing European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 2021. The Company considers the adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations. The Company has excluded only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance which is expected to be completed during 2024.\nThe tax impact related to special item adjustments reflects the current and deferred income taxes associated with the above pre-tax special items in arriving at adjusted earnings.\n4.2%\n13.3%\n7.3%\n9.5%\n14.1%\n11.0%\n(2.5)%\n12.4%\n2.9%\n0.2\n(0.1)\n0.1\n-\n-\n-\n0.6\n(0.4)\n0.2\n4.0%\n13.4%\n7.2%\n9.5%\n14.1%\n11.0%\n(3.1)%\n12.8%\n2.7%\n(4.5)\n(1.6)\n(7.2)\n(2.3)\n(1.9)\n(0.7)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.3\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n4.0%\n9.1%\n5.7%\n9.5%\n7.2%\n8.8%\n(3.0)%\n11.0%\n2.1%\nInnovative

As we look forward to fiscal 2025, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth, EPS growth and free cash flow productivity \u2013 each in-line with our long-term growth algorithm. We remain committed to our integrated strategy \u2013 a focused product portfolio of daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority (of product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and consumer and customer value), productivity, constructive disruption and an agile and accountable organization \u2013 all aimed at delivering sustainable, balanced growth and value creation.\"\nFiscal Year ($ billions, except EPS)\nGAAP\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP*\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$84.0\n$82.0\n+2%\n\u00a0\nOrganic Sales\nn/a\nn/a\n+4%\nDiluted EPS\n$6.02\n$5.90\n+2%\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n$6.59\n$5.90\n+12%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFourth Quarter ($ billions, except EPS)\nGAAP\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP*\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$20.5\n$20.6\n\u2014%\n\u00a0\nOrganic Sales\nn/a\nn/a\n+2%\nDiluted EPS\n$1.27\n$1.37\n(7)%\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n$1.40\n$1.37\n+2%\n* Please refer to Exhibit 1 - Non-GAAP Measures for the definition and reconciliation of these measures to the related GAAP measures.\nFiscal Year 2024 Results\nThe Company reported fiscal year 2024 net sales of $84.0 billion, an increase of two percent versus the prior year. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased four percent. Higher pricing contributed four points of growth to organic sales. Shipment volumes and mix were unchanged versus the prior year.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $6.02, an increase of two percent versus prior year as the increase in net sales was partially offset by a non-cash charge to impair the carrying value of the Gillette trade name intangible asset and higher non-core restructuring charges. Core net earnings per share increased by 12% to $6.59. Currency-neutral core EPS increased 16% versus the prior year EPS.\nThe Company generated operating cash flow of $19.8 billion and net earnings of $15.0 billion for the fiscal year. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 105%, which is calculated as operating cash flow less capital spending and certain other items, as a percentage of net earnings excluding the Gillette impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria.\nThe Company returned over $14 billion of value to shareholders in fiscal 2024 via $9.3 billion in dividend payments and $5 billion of share repurchases. With the dividend increase in April 2024, this marks the 68th consecutive year that P&G has increased its dividend and the 134th consecutive year that P&G has paid a dividend since its incorporation in 1890.\nApril-June Quarter Results\nThe Company reported fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter net sales of $20.5 billion, unchanged versus the prior year. A one percent increase in all-in volume and one percent increase due to higher pricing were offset by two percentage points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased two percent. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased two percent. Mix had a neutral impact on sales growth for the quarter.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS increased six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nOperating cash flow was $5.8 billion and net earnings were $3.1 billion, with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 148%.\nApril-June Quarter Business Discussion\nApril - June 2024\nVolume\nForeign\nExchange\nPrice\nMix\nOther (2)\nNet Sales\nOrganic\nVolume\nOrganic\nSales\nNet Sales Drivers (1)\nBeauty\n(1)%\n(3)%\n3%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n(1)%\n1%\n3%\nGrooming\n2%\n(7)%\n5%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n2%\n7%\nHealth Care\n2%\n(1)%\n2%\n1%\n(1)%\n3%\n1%\n4%\nFabric & Home Care\n2%\n(1)%\n(1)%\n1%\n(1)%\n\u2014%\n3%\n2%\nBaby, Feminine & Family Care\n(1)%\n(2)%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n(3)%\n(1)%\n(1)%\nTotal P&G\n1%\n(2)%\n1%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n2%\n2%\n(1) \u00a0Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.\n(2) \u00a0Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.\nBeauty segment organic sales increased three percent versus year ago. Skin and Personal Care organic sales were unchanged as growth from increased pricing was offset by lower sales of the super-premium SK-II brand and in Greater China. Hair Care organic sales increased high single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix due to growth of premium products.\nGrooming segment organic sales increased seven percent versus year ago driven by increased pricing primarily in Latin America and volume growth from innovation.\nHealth Care segment organic sales increased four percent versus year ago. Oral Care organic sales increased high single digits due to premium product mix and volume growth in North America and Europe. Personal Health Care organic sales were unchanged as growth due to pricing and volume increases were offset by unfavorable mix due to lower incidence of cough and cold.\nFabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased two percent versus year ago. Fabric Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth driven by North America and Europe was offset by lower pricing due to increased promotional spending. Home Care organic sales increased high single digits due to volume growth from innovation and favorable product mix.\nBaby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales declined one percent versus year ago. Baby Care organic sales decreased mid-single digits due to volume declines from share losses, partially offset by premium product mix. Feminine Care organic sales increased low single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix. Family Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth was offset by unfavorable product mix.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27 for the quarter, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased by two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS were up six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nReported gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points versus year ago. Core gross margin for the quarter increased 140 basis points versus year ago, 180 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 210 basis points of productivity savings, 100 basis points of lower commodity costs and 40 basis points of pricing benefit. These were partially offset by 130 basis points of unfavorable product mix and 40 basis points of product/package reinvestments and other impacts.\nReported selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 260 basis points versus the prior year. Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 240 basis points versus year ago and 240 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 300 basis points of marketing reinvestments and 30 basis points of wage inflation and overhead investments, partially offset by 40 basis points of productivity savings and 50 basis points of net sales growth leverage and other impacts.\nReported operating margin for the quarter decreased 140 basis points due primarily to higher restructuring charges. Excluding 40 basis points of non-core restructuring charges, core operating margin for the quarter decreased 100 basis points versus the prior year, 60 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. Core operating margin included gross productivity savings of 250 basis points.\nLimited Market Portfolio Restructuring\nIn December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company said that it expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to 1.5 billion after tax, including foreign currency translation losses to be recognized upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has substantially liquidated its operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, and recorded a non-cash charge of $216 million after tax for accumulated currency translation losses. On July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 million for accumulated currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\nIntangible Asset Impairment\nIn the October-December 2023 quarter of the fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge, on intangible assets acquired as part of the Company\u2019s acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nThe impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value.\nFiscal Year 2025 Guidance\nP&G expects fiscal year 2025 all-in sales growth in the range of two to four percent versus the prior year. Foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately one percentage point to all-in sales growth. The Company expects organic sales growth in the range of three to five percent.\nP&G expects fiscal 2025 diluted net earnings per share growth in the range of 10% to 12% versus fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS of $6.02. P&G expects its fiscal 2025 core net earnings per share growth in the range of five to seven percent versus fiscal 2024 core EPS of $6.59. This outlook equates to a range of $6.91 to $7.05 per share, with a mid-point estimate of $6.98, or an increase of 6%.\nThe Company said its outlook estimates a net headwind of around $500 million after-tax from unfavorable commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. The net headwind equates to a $0.20 per share for fiscal 2025, or a three percentage drag on core EPS growth.\nIn addition, the prior fiscal year included benefits from minor brand divestitures and tax impacts that are unlikely to repeat to the same extent in the new fiscal year. Combined, these are an additional $0.10 to $0.12 headwind to core EPS.\nThe Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures without unreasonable efforts given the unpredictability of the timing and amounts of discrete items, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or impairments, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nP&G said it expects a core effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% in fiscal 2025.\nCapital spending is estimated to be in the range of four to five percent of fiscal 2025 net sales.\nP&G said it expects adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% and expects to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 to $7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures because the Company cannot predict the timing and amounts of discrete items such as acquisition and divestitures, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nThe Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:\nIncremental restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges.\nIntangible asset impairment: In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($1.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying value of the Gillette intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nWe do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.\nOrganic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nCore EPS and Currency-neutral EPS: Core net earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as useful supplemental measures of Company performance over time.\nCore gross margin and Currency-neutral Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's Core gross margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nCore selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as a percentage of sales and Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales: Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's Core selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provides a supplemental perspective to the Company's operating efficiency over time.\nCore operating margin and Currency-neutral Core operating margin: Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's Core operating margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nAdjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.\nAdjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G\u2019s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nTHE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nAmounts in millions except per share amounts\nAs Reported\n(GAAP)\n\u00a0\nIncremental\nRestructuring\n\u00a0\nIntangible\nImpairment\n\u00a0\nCore\n(Non-GAAP)\n\u00a0\nAs Reported\n(GAAP) (1)\nCost of products sold\n$\n10,348\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n(45\n)\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,303\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,613\n\u00a0\nGross profit\n\u00a0\n10,183\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n10,229\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n9,940\n\u00a0\nGross margin\n\u00a0\n49.6\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n49.8\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n48.4\n%\nCurrency impact to Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n50.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n\u00a0\n6,299\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(28\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n6,271\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5,778\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n30.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(0.2\n)%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n28.1\n%\nCurrency impact to Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperating income\n\u00a0\n3,884\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n73\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,958\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4,162\n\u00a0\nOperating margin\n\u00a0\n18.9\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.3\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n20.3\n%\nCurrency impact to Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOther non-operating income, net\n\u00a0\n98\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n248\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n346\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n195\n\u00a0\nIncome taxes\n\u00a0\n726\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(6\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n720\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n841\n\u00a0\nNet earnings attributable to P&G\n\u00a0\n3,137\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n327\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,464\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,384\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted net earnings per common share (2)\n$\n1.27\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n0.13\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.40\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.37\n\u00a0\nCurrency impact to Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n0.05\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n1.45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n\u00a0\n2,472.2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2,477.5\n\u00a0\nCommon shares outstanding -

(NASDAQ: PEP) today reported results for the second quarter 2024. \u201cDuring the second quarter, our business delivered net revenue growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth, remaining agile despite facing difficult net revenue growth comparisons versus the prior year, subdued category performance within North America convenient foods and the impacts associated with certain product recalls at Quaker Foods North America,\u201d said Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta.\nLaguarta continued, \u201cFor the balance of the year, we will further elevate and accelerate our productivity initiatives and make disciplined commercial investments in the marketplace to stimulate growth. These investments will focus on surgically providing optimal value propositions within certain portions of our North America convenient foods portfolio, amplifying our advertising and marketing initiatives and leveraging our go-to-market distribution capabilities to enable more precise marketplace execution. As a result, we now expect to deliver approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4 percent) and have a high degree of confidence in delivering at least 8 percent core constant currency EPS growth for full-year 2024.\u201d 1 Please refer to the Glossary for the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, including \u201cOrganic revenue growth,\u201d \u201cCore\u201d and \u201cConstant currency,\u201d and to \u201cGuidance and Outlook\u201d for additional information regarding PepsiCo\u2019s full-year 2024 financial guidance.

In addition, the Company continues to expect: \u2022 At least 8 percent increase in core constant currency EPS; \u2022 A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; \u2022 Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8.2 billion, comprised of dividends of $7.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion; and \u2022 An approximate 1-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to impact reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates.\nThis assumption and the guidance above imply 2024 core EPS of at least $8.15, a 7 percent increase compared to 2023 core EPS of $7.62.\nPrepared Management Remarks and Live Question and Answer Webcast At approximately 6:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will post prepared management remarks (in pdf format) of its second quarter 2024 results and business update, including its outlook for 2024, at www.pepsico.com/investors. At 8:15 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will host a live question and answer session with investors and financial analysts. Further details will be accessible on the Company\u2019s website at www.pepsico.com/investors.\nContacts: Investor Relations Communications investor@pepsico.com pepsicomediarelations@pepsico.com 4 PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income (in millions except per share amounts, unaudited) 12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 6/17/2023 6/15/2024 6/17/2023 Net Revenue $ 22,501 $ 22,322 $ 40,751 $ 40,168 Cost of sales 9,919 10,121 18,167 18,109 Gross profit 12,582 12,201 22,584 22,059 Selling, general and administrative expenses 8,534 8,542 15,819 15,771 Operating Profit 4,048 3,659 6,765 6,288 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income 56 60 114 121 Net interest expense and other (234) (201) (436) (401) Income before income taxes 3,870 3,518 6,443 6,008 Provision for income taxes 776 747 1,296 1,293 Net income 3,094 2,771 5,147 4,715 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 11 23 22 35 Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo $ 3,083 $ 2,748 $ 5,125 $ 4,680 Diluted Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 2.23 $ 1.99 $ 3.71 $ 3.38 Weighted-average common shares outstanding 1,379 1,384 1,380 1,384 A -

5 Non-GAAP Measures In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): organic revenue growth, core results and core constant currency results. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); product recall-related impact; pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures included herein. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nGlossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies: Acquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nConcentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d in \u201cItem 2 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Q2 2024 Form 10-Q and in \u201cItem 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items: Mark-to-market net impact Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Restructuring and impairment charges Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures, primarily consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nImpairment and other charges/credits We recognized impairment charges taken as a result of our quantitative assessments of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and related to our investment in Tropicana Brands Group. We also recognized adjustments to charges recorded in prior years from changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.\nA - 6 Product recall-related impact We recognized property, plant and equipment and inventory write-offs, product returns, employee severance costs, customer and consumer-related costs and other costs in our Quaker Foods North America division associated with a previously announced voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals.\nPension and retiree medical-related impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs.\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. 2024 guidance Our 2024 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2024 core effective tax rate guidance and our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges and other items noted above. Our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2024 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2024 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2024 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2024 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2024 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2024 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.\nA - 7 PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information Organic Revenue Growth Rates 12 and 24 Weeks Ended June 15, 2024 (unaudited) 12 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 Impact of Impact of Net Revenue Year over Year % Change Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a) Organic volume(b) Effective net pricing Frito-Lay North America (0.5) % \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 % (4) 3 Quaker Foods North America (c) (18) % \u2014 \u2014 (18) % (17) (1) PepsiCo Beverages North America 1 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (3.5) 5 Latin America 7 % (5) \u2014 2 % (5) 6 Europe 2.5 % 5 \u2014 7 % 2 5 Africa, Middle East and South Asia 2 % 11 (1) 12 % 1 11 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region (2) % 3 \u2014 1 % \u2014 1.5 Total 1 % 1 \u2014 2 % (3) 5 24 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 Impact of Impact of Net Revenue Year over Year % Change Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a) Organic volume(b) Effective net pricing Frito-Lay North America 0.5 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (3) 3 Quaker Foods North America (c) (21) % \u2014 \u2014 (21) % (20) (1) PepsiCo Beverages North America 1 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (4) 5 Latin America 10 % (6) \u2014 4 % (3) 7 Europe 3 % 5.5 \u2014 8 % 2 6 Africa, Middle East and South Asia 2 % 8 \u2014 10 % 2 7 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region 2 % 4 \u2014 6 % 5 0.5 Total 1.5 % 1 \u2014 2 % (2) 5 (a) A financial measure that is not in accordance with GAAP.

In certain instances, the impact of organic volume on net revenue performance differs from the unit volume disclosed in the Summary Second-Quarter 2024 Performance table and Summary Year-to-Date Performance on pages 2 and 3, respectively, due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE. We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE.

The quarter included one additional day, which resulted in a 1-point tailwind to revenue growth. For the full year, net revenues grew 6% to $45.8 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 12%, driven by 10% growth in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales. For both the quarter and the full year, organic revenue (non-GAAP) performance was strong across all operating segments.\n- Operating margin:\u00a0For the quarter, operating margin was 21.0% versus 20.5% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 23.1% versus 22.7% in the prior year. For the full year, operating margin was 24.7% versus 25.4% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 29.1% versus 28.7% in the prior year. Operating margin performance included items impacting comparability and currency headwinds. For both the quarter and full year, comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion was primarily driven by strong topline growth, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, as well as currency headwinds.\n- Earnings per share:\u00a0For the quarter, EPS declined 2% to $0.46, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 10% to $0.49. EPS performance included the impact of a 14-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 13-point currency headwind. For the full year, EPS grew 13% to $2.47, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 8% to $2.69. EPS performance included the impact of an 8-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 7-point currency headwind.\n- Market share:\u00a0For both the quarter and the full year, the company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages.\n- Cash flow:\u00a0Cash flow from operations was $11.6 billion for the full year, an increase of $581 million versus the prior year, driven by strong business performance and working capital initiatives, partially offset by a transition tax payment and currency headwinds. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $9.7 billion for the full year, an increase of $213 million versus the prior year.\n-\u00a0Connecting with consumers through experiences and digital engagement: The company continues to leverage its marketing transformation to build globally scaled marketing platforms tailored to local consumers. In the fourth quarter, \u201cThe World Needs More Santas\u201d campaign was executed in over 80 markets, continuing the company\u2019s rich history of celebrating the holidays. The company leveraged the success of its first AI-based platform, \u201cCreate Real Magic\u201d, by inviting consumers to create sharable, digital greeting cards featuring iconic brand assets such as cherished depictions of Santa Claus and the Coca\u2011Cola polar bear. Local initiatives generated buzz and excitement, such as the Coca\u2011Cola Caravan Truck Tour, which travelled throughout nearly 60 countries around the world making over a thousand stops and meeting over 16 million consumers to share in the magic. In total, the holiday campaign experiences garnered approximately 9 billion impressions on social media. By combining the company\u2019s global scale with local relevancy, the holiday activation contributed to Trademark Coca\u2011Cola\u00ae volume and value share gains as well as unit case volume and transactions growth for both the quarter and for the full year.\n-\u00a0Building a system that is increasingly positioned for sustainable long-term growth: Since the start of 2023, the company completed the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations in Vietnam to a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Limited (Swire), completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Pakistan to Coca\u2011Cola \u0130\u00e7ecek and completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Indonesia to Coca\u2011Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP). More recently, the company completed the refranchising of a portion of its company-owned bottling operations in India to existing franchise bottlers and received regulatory approval to sell its bottling operations in the Philippines to CCEP and Aboitiz Equity Ventures, which is expected to close towards the end of February 2024. Additionally, the company recently completed the sale of its stake in the largest bottler in Thailand to Swire and existing shareholders of the bottler. Our franchise business model has enabled the company to develop a strong global footprint with a local touch in markets around the world. The company continuously works to optimize the system with trusted, capable and motivated bottling partners allowing it to focus on building and growing consumer-loved brands.\n-\u00a0Delivering on our purpose by empowering people to drive growth: The company\u2019s strategy is centered around people, starting with the employees who are critical in bringing this strategy to life. In November, the company was ranked #1 on the 2023 American Opportunity Index, which assessed how effectively companies enable employees to progress in their careers in the United States. Around the world, the company provides thousands of jobs and is invested in the long-term success of its employees. Over the year, the company enhanced its learning and related technologies, making strides towards nurturing a more innovative and informed workforce. The company\u2019s 2023 Culture & Engagement Survey results underscore the strong levels of employee pride and growth opportunities with a strong number of respondents saying they are proud to work at The Coca\u2011Cola Company and see good opportunities to learn and grow in their roles.\nOperating Review \u2013 Three Months Ended December 31, 2023\nOperating Review \u2013 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nIn addition to the data in the preceding tables, operating results included the following:\n- Unit case volume grew 2% for the quarter.

The company has increased its dividend in each of the last 61 years.\n-\u00a0M&A initiatives: In 2023, the company did not make any significant acquisitions. The company continues to evaluate inorganic growth opportunities through brands and capabilities. In 2023, with respect to divestitures, the company made progress towards refranchising company-owned bottling operations.\n-\u00a0Share repurchases: In 2023, the company issued $0.5 billion of shares in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees and purchased $2.3 billion of shares. Consequently, net share repurchases (non-GAAP) were $1.7 billion. The company\u2019s remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately $6 billion.\nOutlook\nThe 2024 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full-year 2024 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported effective tax rate, full-year 2024 projected comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS, or full-year 2024 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and exact impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes throughout 2024; the exact timing and exact amount of items impacting comparability throughout 2024; and the exact impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates throughout 2024. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s full-year 2024 reported financial results.\nThe company expects to deliver organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth of 6% to 7%.\nFor comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 2% to 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company\u2019s underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 19.2%. This does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the company were not to prevail.\nGiven the above considerations, the company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 8% to 10% and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 4% to 5%, versus $2.69 in 2023.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 4% to 5% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company expects to generate free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.2 billion through cash flow from operations of approximately $11.4 billion, less capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion. This does not include any potential payments related to ongoing tax litigation with the IRS.\nComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an approximate 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include an approximate 8% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe first quarter has one less day compared to the first quarter of 2023.\nNotes\n- All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise noted.\n- All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales in the fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted, and are computed on a reported basis for the full year. \u201cUnit case\u201d means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. \u201cUnit case volume\u201d means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.\n- \u201cConcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the fourth quarter, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the full year, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.\n- \u201cPrice/mix\u201d represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.\n- First quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to first quarter 2022, and fourth quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one additional day as compared to fourth quarter 2022. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.\nConference Call\nThe company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2023 operating results today, Feb. 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company\u2019s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section.

As we look forward to fiscal 2025, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth, EPS growth and free cash flow productivity \u2013 each in-line with our long-term growth algorithm. We remain committed to our integrated strategy \u2013 a focused product portfolio of daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority (of product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and consumer and customer value), productivity, constructive disruption and an agile and accountable organization \u2013 all aimed at delivering sustainable, balanced growth and value creation.\"\nFiscal Year ($ billions, except EPS)\nGAAP\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP*\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$84.0\n$82.0\n+2%\n\u00a0\nOrganic Sales\nn/a\nn/a\n+4%\nDiluted EPS\n$6.02\n$5.90\n+2%\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n$6.59\n$5.90\n+12%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFourth Quarter ($ billions, except EPS)\nGAAP\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP*\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$20.5\n$20.6\n\u2014%\n\u00a0\nOrganic Sales\nn/a\nn/a\n+2%\nDiluted EPS\n$1.27\n$1.37\n(7)%\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n$1.40\n$1.37\n+2%\n* Please refer to Exhibit 1 - Non-GAAP Measures for the definition and reconciliation of these measures to the related GAAP measures.\nFiscal Year 2024 Results\nThe Company reported fiscal year 2024 net sales of $84.0 billion, an increase of two percent versus the prior year. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased four percent. Higher pricing contributed four points of growth to organic sales. Shipment volumes and mix were unchanged versus the prior year.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $6.02, an increase of two percent versus prior year as the increase in net sales was partially offset by a non-cash charge to impair the carrying value of the Gillette trade name intangible asset and higher non-core restructuring charges. Core net earnings per share increased by 12% to $6.59. Currency-neutral core EPS increased 16% versus the prior year EPS.\nThe Company generated operating cash flow of $19.8 billion and net earnings of $15.0 billion for the fiscal year. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 105%, which is calculated as operating cash flow less capital spending and certain other items, as a percentage of net earnings excluding the Gillette impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria.\nThe Company returned over $14 billion of value to shareholders in fiscal 2024 via $9.3 billion in dividend payments and $5 billion of share repurchases. With the dividend increase in April 2024, this marks the 68th consecutive year that P&G has increased its dividend and the 134th consecutive year that P&G has paid a dividend since its incorporation in 1890.\nApril-June Quarter Results\nThe Company reported fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter net sales of $20.5 billion, unchanged versus the prior year. A one percent increase in all-in volume and one percent increase due to higher pricing were offset by two percentage points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased two percent. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased two percent. Mix had a neutral impact on sales growth for the quarter.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS increased six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nOperating cash flow was $5.8 billion and net earnings were $3.1 billion, with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 148%.\nApril-June Quarter Business Discussion\nApril - June 2024\nVolume\nForeign\nExchange\nPrice\nMix\nOther (2)\nNet Sales\nOrganic\nVolume\nOrganic\nSales\nNet Sales Drivers (1)\nBeauty\n(1)%\n(3)%\n3%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n(1)%\n1%\n3%\nGrooming\n2%\n(7)%\n5%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n2%\n7%\nHealth Care\n2%\n(1)%\n2%\n1%\n(1)%\n3%\n1%\n4%\nFabric & Home Care\n2%\n(1)%\n(1)%\n1%\n(1)%\n\u2014%\n3%\n2%\nBaby, Feminine & Family Care\n(1)%\n(2)%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n(3)%\n(1)%\n(1)%\nTotal P&G\n1%\n(2)%\n1%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n2%\n2%\n(1) \u00a0Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.\n(2) \u00a0Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.\nBeauty segment organic sales increased three percent versus year ago. Skin and Personal Care organic sales were unchanged as growth from increased pricing was offset by lower sales of the super-premium SK-II brand and in Greater China. Hair Care organic sales increased high single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix due to growth of premium products.\nGrooming segment organic sales increased seven percent versus year ago driven by increased pricing primarily in Latin America and volume growth from innovation.\nHealth Care segment organic sales increased four percent versus year ago. Oral Care organic sales increased high single digits due to premium product mix and volume growth in North America and Europe. Personal Health Care organic sales were unchanged as growth due to pricing and volume increases were offset by unfavorable mix due to lower incidence of cough and cold.\nFabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased two percent versus year ago. Fabric Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth driven by North America and Europe was offset by lower pricing due to increased promotional spending. Home Care organic sales increased high single digits due to volume growth from innovation and favorable product mix.\nBaby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales declined one percent versus year ago. Baby Care organic sales decreased mid-single digits due to volume declines from share losses, partially offset by premium product mix. Feminine Care organic sales increased low single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix. Family Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth was offset by unfavorable product mix.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27 for the quarter, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased by two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS were up six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nReported gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points versus year ago. Core gross margin for the quarter increased 140 basis points versus year ago, 180 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 210 basis points of productivity savings, 100 basis points of lower commodity costs and 40 basis points of pricing benefit. These were partially offset by 130 basis points of unfavorable product mix and 40 basis points of product/package reinvestments and other impacts.\nReported selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 260 basis points versus the prior year. Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 240 basis points versus year ago and 240 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 300 basis points of marketing reinvestments and 30 basis points of wage inflation and overhead investments, partially offset by 40 basis points of productivity savings and 50 basis points of net sales growth leverage and other impacts.\nReported operating margin for the quarter decreased 140 basis points due primarily to higher restructuring charges. Excluding 40 basis points of non-core restructuring charges, core operating margin for the quarter decreased 100 basis points versus the prior year, 60 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. Core operating margin included gross productivity savings of 250 basis points.\nLimited Market Portfolio Restructuring\nIn December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company said that it expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to 1.5 billion after tax, including foreign currency translation losses to be recognized upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has substantially liquidated its operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, and recorded a non-cash charge of $216 million after tax for accumulated currency translation losses. On July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 million for accumulated currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\nIntangible Asset Impairment\nIn the October-December 2023 quarter of the fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge, on intangible assets acquired as part of the Company\u2019s acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nThe impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value.\nFiscal Year 2025 Guidance\nP&G expects fiscal year 2025 all-in sales growth in the range of two to four percent versus the prior year. Foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately one percentage point to all-in sales growth. The Company expects organic sales growth in the range of three to five percent.\nP&G expects fiscal 2025 diluted net earnings per share growth in the range of 10% to 12% versus fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS of $6.02. P&G expects its fiscal 2025 core net earnings per share growth in the range of five to seven percent versus fiscal 2024 core EPS of $6.59. This outlook equates to a range of $6.91 to $7.05 per share, with a mid-point estimate of $6.98, or an increase of 6%.\nThe Company said its outlook estimates a net headwind of around $500 million after-tax from unfavorable commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. The net headwind equates to a $0.20 per share for fiscal 2025, or a three percentage drag on core EPS growth.\nIn addition, the prior fiscal year included benefits from minor brand divestitures and tax impacts that are unlikely to repeat to the same extent in the new fiscal year. Combined, these are an additional $0.10 to $0.12 headwind to core EPS.\nThe Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures without unreasonable efforts given the unpredictability of the timing and amounts of discrete items, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or impairments, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nP&G said it expects a core effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% in fiscal 2025.\nCapital spending is estimated to be in the range of four to five percent of fiscal 2025 net sales.\nP&G said it expects adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% and expects to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 to $7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures because the Company cannot predict the timing and amounts of discrete items such as acquisition and divestitures, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nThe Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:\nIncremental restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges.\nIntangible asset impairment: In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($1.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying value of the Gillette intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nWe do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.\nOrganic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nCore EPS and Currency-neutral EPS: Core net earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as useful supplemental measures of Company performance over time.\nCore gross margin and Currency-neutral Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's Core gross margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nCore selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as a percentage of sales and Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales: Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's Core selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provides a supplemental perspective to the Company's operating efficiency over time.\nCore operating margin and Currency-neutral Core operating margin: Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's Core operating margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nAdjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.\nAdjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G\u2019s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nTHE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nAmounts in millions except per share amounts\nAs Reported\n(GAAP)\n\u00a0\nIncremental\nRestructuring\n\u00a0\nIntangible\nImpairment\n\u00a0\nCore\n(Non-GAAP)\n\u00a0\nAs Reported\n(GAAP) (1)\nCost of products sold\n$\n10,348\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n(45\n)\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,303\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,613\n\u00a0\nGross profit\n\u00a0\n10,183\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n10,229\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n9,940\n\u00a0\nGross margin\n\u00a0\n49.6\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n49.8\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n48.4\n%\nCurrency impact to Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n50.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n\u00a0\n6,299\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(28\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n6,271\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5,778\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n30.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(0.2\n)%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n28.1\n%\nCurrency impact to Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperating income\n\u00a0\n3,884\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n73\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,958\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4,162\n\u00a0\nOperating margin\n\u00a0\n18.9\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.3\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n20.3\n%\nCurrency impact to Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOther non-operating income, net\n\u00a0\n98\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n248\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n346\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n195\n\u00a0\nIncome taxes\n\u00a0\n726\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(6\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n720\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n841\n\u00a0\nNet earnings attributable to P&G\n\u00a0\n3,137\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n327\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,464\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,384\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted net earnings per common share (2)\n$\n1.27\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n0.13\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.40\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.37\n\u00a0\nCurrency impact to Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n0.05\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n1.45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n\u00a0\n2,472.2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2,477.5\n\u00a0\nCommon shares outstanding -

The quarter included one additional day, which resulted in a 1-point tailwind to revenue growth. For the full year, net revenues grew 6% to $45.8 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 12%, driven by 10% growth in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales. For both the quarter and the full year, organic revenue (non-GAAP) performance was strong across all operating segments.\n- Operating margin:\u00a0For the quarter, operating margin was 21.0% versus 20.5% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 23.1% versus 22.7% in the prior year. For the full year, operating margin was 24.7% versus 25.4% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 29.1% versus 28.7% in the prior year. Operating margin performance included items impacting comparability and currency headwinds. For both the quarter and full year, comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion was primarily driven by strong topline growth, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, as well as currency headwinds.\n- Earnings per share:\u00a0For the quarter, EPS declined 2% to $0.46, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 10% to $0.49. EPS performance included the impact of a 14-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 13-point currency headwind. For the full year, EPS grew 13% to $2.47, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 8% to $2.69. EPS performance included the impact of an 8-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 7-point currency headwind.\n- Market share:\u00a0For both the quarter and the full year, the company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages.\n- Cash flow:\u00a0Cash flow from operations was $11.6 billion for the full year, an increase of $581 million versus the prior year, driven by strong business performance and working capital initiatives, partially offset by a transition tax payment and currency headwinds. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $9.7 billion for the full year, an increase of $213 million versus the prior year.\n-\u00a0Connecting with consumers through experiences and digital engagement: The company continues to leverage its marketing transformation to build globally scaled marketing platforms tailored to local consumers. In the fourth quarter, \u201cThe World Needs More Santas\u201d campaign was executed in over 80 markets, continuing the company\u2019s rich history of celebrating the holidays. The company leveraged the success of its first AI-based platform, \u201cCreate Real Magic\u201d, by inviting consumers to create sharable, digital greeting cards featuring iconic brand assets such as cherished depictions of Santa Claus and the Coca\u2011Cola polar bear. Local initiatives generated buzz and excitement, such as the Coca\u2011Cola Caravan Truck Tour, which travelled throughout nearly 60 countries around the world making over a thousand stops and meeting over 16 million consumers to share in the magic. In total, the holiday campaign experiences garnered approximately 9 billion impressions on social media. By combining the company\u2019s global scale with local relevancy, the holiday activation contributed to Trademark Coca\u2011Cola\u00ae volume and value share gains as well as unit case volume and transactions growth for both the quarter and for the full year.\n-\u00a0Building a system that is increasingly positioned for sustainable long-term growth: Since the start of 2023, the company completed the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations in Vietnam to a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Limited (Swire), completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Pakistan to Coca\u2011Cola \u0130\u00e7ecek and completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Indonesia to Coca\u2011Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP). More recently, the company completed the refranchising of a portion of its company-owned bottling operations in India to existing franchise bottlers and received regulatory approval to sell its bottling operations in the Philippines to CCEP and Aboitiz Equity Ventures, which is expected to close towards the end of February 2024. Additionally, the company recently completed the sale of its stake in the largest bottler in Thailand to Swire and existing shareholders of the bottler. Our franchise business model has enabled the company to develop a strong global footprint with a local touch in markets around the world. The company continuously works to optimize the system with trusted, capable and motivated bottling partners allowing it to focus on building and growing consumer-loved brands.\n-\u00a0Delivering on our purpose by empowering people to drive growth: The company\u2019s strategy is centered around people, starting with the employees who are critical in bringing this strategy to life. In November, the company was ranked #1 on the 2023 American Opportunity Index, which assessed how effectively companies enable employees to progress in their careers in the United States. Around the world, the company provides thousands of jobs and is invested in the long-term success of its employees. Over the year, the company enhanced its learning and related technologies, making strides towards nurturing a more innovative and informed workforce. The company\u2019s 2023 Culture & Engagement Survey results underscore the strong levels of employee pride and growth opportunities with a strong number of respondents saying they are proud to work at The Coca\u2011Cola Company and see good opportunities to learn and grow in their roles.\nOperating Review \u2013 Three Months Ended December 31, 2023\nOperating Review \u2013 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nIn addition to the data in the preceding tables, operating results included the following:\n- Unit case volume grew 2% for the quarter. Developed markets were even as growth in Mexico and Germany was offset by declines in the United States and Chile. Developing and emerging markets grew 4%, driven by growth in Brazil and India. For the full year, unit case volume grew 2%. Developed markets grew 1%, driven by growth in Mexico and Germany. Developing and emerging markets grew 2%, driven by growth in India and Brazil, partially offset by the suspension of business in Russia in 2022.\nUnit case volume performance included the following:\n- Sparkling soft drinks grew 2% for both the quarter and the full year, primarily driven by growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific.

Water grew 1% for the quarter and 2% for the full year, primarily driven by growth in Latin America. Sports drinks declined 1% for the quarter and were even for the year. Full year performance was benefited by growth in Powerade\u00ae in Latin America, offset by a decline in BODYARMOR\u00ae. Coffee declined 7% for the quarter and grew 3% for the year. Full year performance was benefited by strong performance of Costa\u00ae coffee in the United Kingdom and China. Tea was even for the quarter and declined 1% for the full year, as growth in Latin America and Europe, Middle East and Africa was more than offset by declines in North America and do\u011fadan\u00ae in T\u00fcrkiye.\n- Price/mix grew 9% for the quarter and 10% for the full year, primarily driven by pricing actions in the marketplace, including the continued impact of hyperinflationary markets, and favorable mix.

Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 24% for the quarter, primarily driven by strong organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments.\n- For the year, the company gained value share in total NARTD beverages, led by share gains in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.\n- Unit case volume declined 1% for the quarter, as growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages and Trademark Coca\u2011Cola was more than offset by a decline in water, sports, coffee and tea.\n- Price/mix grew 8% for the quarter, primarily driven by pricing actions already in the marketplace, timing related adjustments and favorable category mix. For the quarter, concentrate sales were 2 points behind unit case volume, primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments, partially offset by one additional day.\n- Operating income grew 19% for the quarter, which included items impacting comparability.

Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 18% for the quarter, driven by organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth across all operating units and lower operating costs, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments.\n- For the year, the company gained value share in total NARTD beverages, led by share gains in India, the Philippines, South Korea and Japan.\n- Net revenues grew 10%, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 5% for the quarter, primarily driven by the strong performance of Costa\u00ae coffee in the United Kingdom and China.\n- Operating income and comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) both had robust growth for the quarter, driven by organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth and lower costs.\n- Unit case volume declined 1% for the quarter, as growth in India and the Philippines was more than offset by the impact of refranchising bottling operations.\n- Price/mix grew 7% for the quarter, driven by pricing actions across most markets.\n- Operating income grew 38% for the quarter, which included items impacting comparability and an 8-point currency headwind. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 66% for the quarter, driven by organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth, partially offset by higher operating costs.\n-\u00a0Reinvesting in the business: The company continued to invest in its various lines of business and spent\n$1.9 billion on capital expenditures in 2023, an increase of 25% versus the prior year.\n-\u00a0Continuing to grow the dividend: The company paid dividends totaling $8.0 billion during 2023. The company has increased its dividend in each of the last 61 years.\n-\u00a0M&A initiatives: In 2023, the company did not make any significant acquisitions. The company continues to evaluate inorganic growth opportunities through brands and capabilities. In 2023, with respect to divestitures, the company made progress towards refranchising company-owned bottling operations.\n-\u00a0Share repurchases: In 2023, the company issued $0.5 billion of shares in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees and purchased $2.3 billion of shares. Consequently, net share repurchases (non-GAAP) were $1.7 billion. The company\u2019s remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately $6 billion.\nOutlook\nThe 2024 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full-year 2024 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported effective tax rate, full-year 2024 projected comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS, or full-year 2024 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and exact impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes throughout 2024; the exact timing and exact amount of items impacting comparability throughout 2024; and the exact impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates throughout 2024. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s full-year 2024 reported financial results.\nThe company expects to deliver organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth of 6% to 7%.\nFor comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 2% to 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company\u2019s underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 19.2%. This does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the company were not to prevail.\nGiven the above considerations, the company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 8% to 10% and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 4% to 5%, versus $2.69 in 2023.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 4% to 5% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company expects to generate free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.2 billion through cash flow from operations of approximately $11.4 billion, less capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion. This does not include any potential payments related to ongoing tax litigation with the IRS.\nComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an approximate 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include an approximate 8% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe first quarter has one less day compared to the first quarter of 2023.\nNotes\n- All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise noted.\n- All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales in the fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted, and are computed on a reported basis for the full year. \u201cUnit case\u201d means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. \u201cUnit case volume\u201d means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.\n- \u201cConcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the fourth quarter, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the full year, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.\n- \u201cPrice/mix\u201d represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.\n- First quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to first quarter 2022, and fourth quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one additional day as compared to fourth quarter 2022. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.\nConference Call\nThe company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2023 operating results today, Feb. 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company\u2019s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section. An audio replay in downloadable digital format and a transcript of the call will be available on the website within 24 hours following the call. Further, the \u201cInvestors\u201d section of the website includes certain supplemental information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the company\u2019s results as reported under GAAP, which may be used during the call when discussing financial results.\nThis press release may contain statements, estimates or projections that constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d as defined under U.S. federal securities laws.

This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The restructuring expenses of $55 million in the quarter ($479 million Q4 YTD) include the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments.\nIn fiscal 2023, the company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within the MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network arrangements. The restructuring expenses of $84 million in the quarter ($319 million Q4 YTD) primarily includes inventory and instrument reserves related to the market and product exits.\nEuropean Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company\u2019s previously registered products. MDR is a replacement of the existing European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 2021. The Company considers the adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations. The Company has excluded only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance which is expected to be completed during 2024.\nThe tax impact related to special item adjustments reflects the current and deferred income taxes associated with the above pre-tax special items in arriving at adjusted earnings.\n4.2%\n13.3%\n7.3%\n9.5%\n14.1%\n11.0%\n(2.5)%\n12.4%\n2.9%\n0.2\n(0.1)\n0.1\n-\n-\n-\n0.6\n(0.4)\n0.2\n4.0%\n13.4%\n7.2%\n9.5%\n14.1%\n11.0%\n(3.1)%\n12.8%\n2.7%\n(4.5)\n(1.6)\n(7.2)\n(2.3)\n(1.9)\n(0.7)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.3\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n4.0%\n9.1%\n5.7%\n9.5%\n7.2%\n8.8%\n(3.0)%\n11.0%\n2.1%\nInnovative

The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.\n1Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.\n\"Our first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations on both the top and bottom line, tracking the trajectory we outlined for this year and setting up a return to growth in the second quarter,\" said Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation. \"Our topline performance improved for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in our digital business led by strength in our same-day fulfillment services. Consumers continue to respond to the newness and value that we offer across our shopping experience, and we're pleased with early results from the relaunch of Target Circle. Looking ahead, our team will deliver for our guests through lower prices, a seasonally relevant assortment, ease and convenience, as we keep investing in our strategy and efficiency initiatives to get back to growth and deliver on our longer-term financial goals.\"\nGuidance\nFor the second quarter, the Company expects a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.95 to $2.35.\nFor the full year, the Company continues to expect a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60.\nOperating Results\nComparable sales declined 3.7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a comparable store sales decline of 4.8 percent partially offset by a comparable digital sales increase of 1.4 percent. Total revenue of $24.5 billion was 3.1 percent lower than last year, reflecting a total sales decline of 3.2 percent and a 3.9 percent increase in other revenue. First quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was 2.4 percent lower than last year, driven by lower sales volume.\nFirst\u00a0quarter operating income margin rate was 5.3 percent in 2024, compared with 5.2 percent in 2023. First quarter gross margin rate was 27.7 percent, compared with 26.3 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of merchandising activities, including cost improvements that more than offset higher promotional markdown rates, combined with favorable category mix and lower book to physical inventory adjustments as compared to the prior year.\u00a0 First quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.1 percent in 2024, compared with 19.8 percent in 2023, reflecting the combined impact of lower sales and higher costs, including continued investments in pay and benefits and marketing, partially offset by disciplined cost management.\nInterest Expense and Taxes\nThe Company's first quarter 2024 net interest expense was $106 million, compared with $147 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in interest income reflecting higher cash balances year-over-year.\nFirst\u00a0quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.7 percent, compared with the prior year rate of 21.1 percent, reflecting lower discrete benefits as compared to the prior year.\nCapital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital\nThe Company paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, compared with $497 million last year, reflecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.\nThe Company did not repurchase any stock in the first quarter.\u00a0 As of the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by Target's Board of Directors in August 2021.\nFor the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2024, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.4 percent, compared with 11.4 percent for the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2023. The increase in ROIC reflects higher operating income, partially offset by higher average invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information about the Company's ROIC calculation.\nWebcast Details\nTarget will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call at 7:00 a.m. CT today. Investors and the media are invited to listen to the meeting at Corporate.Target.com/Investors (click on \"Q1 2024 Target Corporation Earnings Conference Call\" under \"Events & Presentations\").

In the past, these items have included losses on the early retirement of debt and certain other items that are discretely managed.\nEarnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) and earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures provide meaningful information about our operational efficiency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of differences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels, and, for EBITDA, capital investment. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is net earnings. EBIT and EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP.

Comparable sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 2.8%, and comparable sales in the U.S. decreased 3.2%.\u00a0\n\nNet earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $3.6 billion, or $3.63 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $3.9 billion, or $3.82 per diluted share, in the same period of fiscal 2023.\u00a0\n\"The team executed at a high level in the quarter, and we continued to grow market share,\" said Ted Decker, chair, president and CEO. \"And while the quarter was impacted by a delayed start to spring and continued softness in certain larger discretionary projects, we feel great about our store readiness, our product assortment in stores and online, and our associate engagement.\u00a0 Our associates are energized and ready to serve our customers as spring breaks across the country. I would like to thank them for their continued hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities.\"\nFiscal 2024 Guidance\nThe company reaffirms its fiscal 2024 guidance, which includes 53 weeks of operating results.

Since the acquisition has not closed, the following guidance does not reflect any impacts from the SRS acquisition:\u00a0\nThe Home Depot will conduct a conference call today at 9 a.m. ET to discuss information included in this news release and related matters. The conference call will be available in its entirety through a webcast and replay at ir.homedepot.com/events-and-presentations.\nAt the end of the first quarter, the company operated a total of 2,337 retail stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, 10 Canadian provinces and Mexico.

At the same time, not enough stock causes slow order fulfillment, the potential for missed sales, and lost revenue.\nReorder point (ROP) is a supply chain management technique that businesses can use to guide this delicate balancing act to improve inventory operations, avoid stockouts, and maintain ideal inventory levels.\nWhat is the reorder point?\nThe reorder point is the minimum number of units a company needs to have in stock to fill sales orders or meet production targets. Once inventory dips below the calculated reorder point, replenishment is triggered through a new purchase order.\nRegularly calculating reorder points removes the mystery from inventory cost control and helps your business maintain optimal service levels.\nWhy should your business know your reorder points?\nReorder points help to ensure products and cash flow in the right direction, at the right time. With accurate reorder points for all of your product SKUs, you can meet customer demand in a timely fashion to improve cash flow and avoid the bloated costs of overstock.\nPrimary business benefits of using reorder points include the following:\nCost control\nInventory\u00a0carrying costs\u00a0typically account for 15-30% of total inventory costs. This affects the profit margin on goods sold. By using the most optimal reorder levels, businesses can keep storage and warehousing costs low to protect profits. \nOptimal inventory levels\nBy reordering a predetermined amount of replenishment inventory according to demand forecasts, you can avoid sunk costs from inventory shrinkage and obsolescence.\nSupply chain optimization\n The reorder point calculation takes into account delivery lead time from suppliers. By keeping track of average delivery lead time, you can identify your most reliable and least reliable suppliers and make more informed\u00a0procurement decisions.\nImproved forecasting\nTo accurately calculate reorder points, you\u2019ll need to have strong records on sales volume and trends over a certain time period. As you build this body of data, you can improve forecasting to better meet customer demand.\nNow, let\u2019s see how to find the reorder point.\nHow does the reorder point formula work?\nThe reorder point formula takes into account three factors: average daily sales or usage, average delivery lead time, and safety stock.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nFirst, let\u2019s define all of the components that make up this equation.\nComponents of the reorder equation\nAverage daily sales or usage\n Average daily sales is the average number of units sold or used per day over a defined time period. Three months or 90 days is a good starting increment to use. A retailer would measure the average number of units sold, while a manufacturer would calculate the average number of components used per day. \nLet\u2019s say you sold 40 units of an item in March, 60 in April, and 46 in May.\nOver those three months (or 92 days) that averages out to 1.5 units sold on average per day.\nAverage delivery lead time\n Average delivery lead time is the average amount of time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the time the order was placed. Average delivery lead time changes with fluctuations in seasonal demand, the quantity ordered, and distance from the up-chain supplier. For a reasonable measure, take an average of the past three months of POs for the SKU item you want to set a reorder point for. If your sales cycle is longer or shorter, adjust accordingly. \nSafety stock\nSafety stock\u00a0is the amount of inventory a business holds to mitigate the risk of shortages or stockouts. The safety stock calculation is the difference between the maximum daily sales/usage and lead time, and the average daily usage and lead time. \n(Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time)\n Let\u2019s say a manufacturer used 10 units of a component on their busiest day of production. The longest time it would take the supplier to deliver this component is 15 days. And let\u2019s assume that the average daily use is 1.5 units, and the average lead time is 12 days. \n(10 x 15) \u2013 (1.5 x 12)\n150 \u2013 18 = 132\u00a0\nThe manufacturer should hold 132 safety stock units to avoid bottlenecks in production.\nThe reorder point formula in action\nNow we\u2019ve got all reorder point sub-metrics ready. Let\u2019s continue with the manufacturer example and calculate the reorder point.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nAverage daily usage = 1.5 units\nAverage lead team = 12 days\nSafety stock = 132 units\n(1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150\nTherefore, the manufacturer should reorder this component when stock falls to 150 units. By doing so, the company can prevent stockouts and avoid dipping into safety stock while they wait for new stock to arrive.\nHow to start using the reorder point formula in your business\nIf you have at least one procurement cycle and one sales cycle worth of data, you can start using the reorder point formula to improve your inventory operations.\nBusinesses with a limited number of products can start with excel spreadsheets and format cells to turn red when inventory levels reach the reorder point.\nFor growing\u00a0retailers,\u00a0manufacturers, or\u00a0wholesalers, working with dozens or hundreds of spreadsheets can be time-consuming and error-prone. If your business falls into this category, consider the benefits of\u00a0inventory management software.\n A modern inventory management system can bring greater efficiency to inventory processes through automation and digital tools. For example, real-time inventory tracking allows staff to see what\u2019s in stock, what\u2019s on order, and where each item is located. Software tools can also collect and present data on purchase orders, sales fulfillment, and demand forecasting on a single user dashboard. \n With this information readily available, inventory managers can avoid wasting time manually searching through spreadsheets and crunching numbers. Some inventory management tools also enable businesses to generate customized reports on inventory stock by item, vendor, delivery date, assembly, and more. Rich inventory insights like these empower businesses to fine-tune their reorder points and overall inventory management processes. \nFinal thoughts\nKeep in mind, reorder points are not static. Sales volumes fluctuate, and supply delivery times vary. Demand for certain product lines may grow or fall.\nTo maintain an accurate reorder point, check the underlying metrics \u2014 average daily sales/usage and average lead time \u2014 at least once per quarter. If you have a high season and low season, or seasonal bad weather that slows down deliveries, factor this in.\nAn effective reorder point ensures that your business keeps flowing\u2014 it helps you fulfill orders quickly, protects your margins, and keeps customers happy.\nRecommended for you\nMidsize business\nWhat is the safety stock formula?

    "Summarized_Document2": "The Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer, reported first-quarter fiscal 2024 sales of $36.4 billion, a 2.3% decrease from the same period in fiscal 2023. Comparable sales dropped by 2.8%, with U.S. sales down by 3.2%. Net earnings were $3.6 billion, or $3.63 per diluted share, compared to $3.9 billion, or $3.82 per diluted share, in fiscal 2023. Despite a delayed start to spring and softness in larger discretionary projects, the company maintained market share and reaffirmed its fiscal 2024 guidance, which includes 53 weeks of operating results. The acquisition of SRS Distribution Inc. is not reflected in this guidance as it has not yet closed. The Home Depot operated 2,337 retail stores and employed approximately 465,000 associates as of the end of the first quarter. The company\u2019s stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol HD and is part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 index.

Calculating reorder points helps maintain optimal service levels and improve cash flow.The reorder point formula is: Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock. Components of the formula include:- Average daily sales or usage: The average number of units sold or used per day over a defined period, typically three months.- Average delivery lead time: The average time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the order date, which can vary with seasonal demand and other factors.- Safety stock: Extra inventory held to mitigate the risk of shortages, calculated as (Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time).For example, if a manufacturer uses 1.5 units daily on average, with an average lead time of 12 days and a safety stock of 132 units, the reorder point would be (1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150 units. This means the manufacturer should reorder when stock falls to 150 units to avoid stockouts.Businesses can start using the reorder point formula with at least one procurement and sales cycle worth of data. Small businesses might use spreadsheets, while larger operations may benefit from inventory management software for greater efficiency and accuracy. These tools can automate processes, provide real-time tracking, and generate detailed reports to fine-tune inventory management.Reorder points should be reviewed at least quarterly to account for fluctuations in sales volumes and delivery times.

    "Document1": "Amazon sales come up short, profits nearly double\nby Todd Bishop on August 1, 2024 at 1:21 pmAugust 1, 2024 at 5:30 pm\nIn-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant\u2019s hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.\nAmazon\u2019s sales fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates but profits exceeded expectations in the company\u2019s second quarter results, released Thursday afternoon for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nThe tech giant reported a 10% increase in second-quarter revenue, to $147.98 billion, shy of expectations of $148.56 billion. Profits were $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per share, nearly double Amazon\u2019s profits in the same quarter a year ago, and surpassing expectations of $1.03 per share.\nSpeaking with reporters on a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said average selling prices (ASP) are declining amid cautious consumer spending. Unit sales growth was strong, he said, and an increase in shipping speeds is prompting growth in purchasing of everyday essentials. \n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is really around ASP, and lower ASP in products selected by customers,\u201d Olsavsky said. \u201cThey are continuing to be cautious with their spending, trading down to lower ASP products. And even on the higher-ticket items \u2026 there\u2019s certainly a drop-off from probably more of a steady-state, thriving economy.\u201d\nAmazon is reportedly planning to launch a new storefront with lower-priced items and slower shipping, directly from Chinese suppliers, to compete with emerging rivals including Temu and Shein. Olsavsky declined to comment directly on those reports in response to a question on the media call.\nIn addition, Olsavsky said Amazon experienced a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange rates, which was about $300 million higher than the company expected.\nIn the realm of artificial intelligence, Amazon is spending significant sums to expand its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure. Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures and equipment finance leases amounted to $30.5 billion for the first half of the year, and the number is expected to grow in the second half of the year, Olsavsky said.\n\u201cThe majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure, as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads,\u201d he said.\nHighlights from the company\u2019s business segments:\nIn its guidance for the current quarter, which began July 1, Amazon said it expects net sales between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, which translates into a midpoint of $156.25 billion, below the average estimate of $158.24 billion.\nOlsavsky said the current quarter was proving especially challenging to predict, due in part to consumers becoming distracted by news events, elections, and the Olympics, among other factors.\nShares fell 4% in initial after-hours trading. \nGeekWire Newsletters\nSubscribe to GeekWire's free newsletters to catch every headline\nSend Us a Tip\nHave a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.\n1Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.\n\"Our first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations on both the top and bottom line, tracking the trajectory we outlined for this year and setting up a return to growth in the second quarter,\" said Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation. \"Our topline performance improved for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in our digital business led by strength in our same-day fulfillment services. Consumers continue to respond to the newness and value that we offer across our shopping experience, and we're pleased with early results from the relaunch of Target Circle. Looking ahead, our team will deliver for our guests through lower prices, a seasonally relevant assortment, ease and convenience, as we keep investing in our strategy and efficiency initiatives to get back to growth and deliver on our longer-term financial goals.\"\nGuidance\nFor the second quarter, the Company expects a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.95 to $2.35.\nFor the full year, the Company continues to expect a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60.\nOperating Results\nComparable sales declined 3.7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a comparable store sales decline of 4.8 percent partially offset by a comparable digital sales increase of 1.4 percent. Total revenue of $24.5 billion was 3.1 percent lower than last year, reflecting a total sales decline of 3.2 percent and a 3.9 percent increase in other revenue. First quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was 2.4 percent lower than last year, driven by lower sales volume.\nFirst\u00a0quarter operating income margin rate was 5.3 percent in 2024, compared with 5.2 percent in 2023. First quarter gross margin rate was 27.7 percent, compared with 26.3 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of merchandising activities, including cost improvements that more than offset higher promotional markdown rates, combined with favorable category mix and lower book to physical inventory adjustments as compared to the prior year.\u00a0 First quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.1 percent in 2024, compared with 19.8 percent in 2023, reflecting the combined impact of lower sales and higher costs, including continued investments in pay and benefits and marketing, partially offset by disciplined cost management.\nInterest Expense and Taxes\nThe Company's first quarter 2024 net interest expense was $106 million, compared with $147 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in interest income reflecting higher cash balances year-over-year.\nFirst\u00a0quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.7 percent, compared with the prior year rate of 21.1 percent, reflecting lower discrete benefits as compared to the prior year.\nCapital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital\nThe Company paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, compared with $497 million last year, reflecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.\nThe Company did not repurchase any stock in the first quarter.\u00a0 As of the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by Target's Board of Directors in August 2021.\nFor the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2024, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.4 percent, compared with 11.4 percent for the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2023. The increase in ROIC reflects higher operating income, partially offset by higher average invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information about the Company's ROIC calculation.\nWebcast Details\nTarget will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call at 7:00 a.m. CT today.

We believe these measures provide meaningful information about our operational efficiency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of differences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels, and, for EBITDA, capital investment. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is net earnings. EBIT and EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP.

At the same time, not enough stock causes slow order fulfillment, the potential for missed sales, and lost revenue.\nReorder point (ROP) is a supply chain management technique that businesses can use to guide this delicate balancing act to improve inventory operations, avoid stockouts, and maintain ideal inventory levels.\nWhat is the reorder point?\nThe reorder point is the minimum number of units a company needs to have in stock to fill sales orders or meet production targets. Once inventory dips below the calculated reorder point, replenishment is triggered through a new purchase order.\nRegularly calculating reorder points removes the mystery from inventory cost control and helps your business maintain optimal service levels.\nWhy should your business know your reorder points?\nReorder points help to ensure products and cash flow in the right direction, at the right time. With accurate reorder points for all of your product SKUs, you can meet customer demand in a timely fashion to improve cash flow and avoid the bloated costs of overstock.\nPrimary business benefits of using reorder points include the following:\nCost control\nInventory\u00a0carrying costs\u00a0typically account for 15-30% of total inventory costs. This affects the profit margin on goods sold. By using the most optimal reorder levels, businesses can keep storage and warehousing costs low to protect profits. \nOptimal inventory levels\nBy reordering a predetermined amount of replenishment inventory according to demand forecasts, you can avoid sunk costs from inventory shrinkage and obsolescence.\nSupply chain optimization\n The reorder point calculation takes into account delivery lead time from suppliers. By keeping track of average delivery lead time, you can identify your most reliable and least reliable suppliers and make more informed\u00a0procurement decisions.\nImproved forecasting\nTo accurately calculate reorder points, you\u2019ll need to have strong records on sales volume and trends over a certain time period. As you build this body of data, you can improve forecasting to better meet customer demand.\nNow, let\u2019s see how to find the reorder point.\nHow does the reorder point formula work?\nThe reorder point formula takes into account three factors: average daily sales or usage, average delivery lead time, and safety stock.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nFirst, let\u2019s define all of the components that make up this equation.\nComponents of the reorder equation\nAverage daily sales or usage\n Average daily sales is the average number of units sold or used per day over a defined time period. Three months or 90 days is a good starting increment to use. A retailer would measure the average number of units sold, while a manufacturer would calculate the average number of components used per day. \nLet\u2019s say you sold 40 units of an item in March, 60 in April, and 46 in May.\nOver those three months (or 92 days) that averages out to 1.5 units sold on average per day.\nAverage delivery lead time\n Average delivery lead time is the average amount of time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the time the order was placed. Average delivery lead time changes with fluctuations in seasonal demand, the quantity ordered, and distance from the up-chain supplier. For a reasonable measure, take an average of the past three months of POs for the SKU item you want to set a reorder point for. If your sales cycle is longer or shorter, adjust accordingly. \nSafety stock\nSafety stock\u00a0is the amount of inventory a business holds to mitigate the risk of shortages or stockouts. The safety stock calculation is the difference between the maximum daily sales/usage and lead time, and the average daily usage and lead time. \n(Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time)\n Let\u2019s say a manufacturer used 10 units of a component on their busiest day of production. The longest time it would take the supplier to deliver this component is 15 days. And let\u2019s assume that the average daily use is 1.5 units, and the average lead time is 12 days. \n(10 x 15) \u2013 (1.5 x 12)\n150 \u2013 18 = 132\u00a0\nThe manufacturer should hold 132 safety stock units to avoid bottlenecks in production.\nThe reorder point formula in action\nNow we\u2019ve got all reorder point sub-metrics ready. Let\u2019s continue with the manufacturer example and calculate the reorder point.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nAverage daily usage = 1.5 units\nAverage lead team = 12 days\nSafety stock = 132 units\n(1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150\nTherefore, the manufacturer should reorder this component when stock falls to 150 units. By doing so, the company can prevent stockouts and avoid dipping into safety stock while they wait for new stock to arrive.\nHow to start using the reorder point formula in your business\nIf you have at least one procurement cycle and one sales cycle worth of data, you can start using the reorder point formula to improve your inventory operations.\nBusinesses with a limited number of products can start with excel spreadsheets and format cells to turn red when inventory levels reach the reorder point.\nFor growing\u00a0retailers,\u00a0manufacturers, or\u00a0wholesalers, working with dozens or hundreds of spreadsheets can be time-consuming and error-prone. If your business falls into this category, consider the benefits of\u00a0inventory management software.\n A modern inventory management system can bring greater efficiency to inventory processes through automation and digital tools. For example, real-time inventory tracking allows staff to see what\u2019s in stock, what\u2019s on order, and where each item is located. Software tools can also collect and present data on purchase orders, sales fulfillment, and demand forecasting on a single user dashboard. \n With this information readily available, inventory managers can avoid wasting time manually searching through spreadsheets and crunching numbers. Some inventory management tools also enable businesses to generate customized reports on inventory stock by item, vendor, delivery date, assembly, and more. Rich inventory insights like these empower businesses to fine-tune their reorder points and overall inventory management processes. \nFinal thoughts\nKeep in mind, reorder points are not static. Sales volumes fluctuate, and supply delivery times vary. Demand for certain product lines may grow or fall.\nTo maintain an accurate reorder point, check the underlying metrics \u2014 average daily sales/usage and average lead time \u2014 at least once per quarter. If you have a high season and low season, or seasonal bad weather that slows down deliveries, factor this in.\nAn effective reorder point ensures that your business keeps flowing\u2014 it helps you fulfill orders quickly, protects your margins, and keeps customers happy.\nRecommended for you\nMidsize business\nWhat is the safety stock formula?

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon\u2019s sales fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates but profits exceeded expectations in the company\u2019s second quarter results, released Thursday afternoon for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The tech giant reported a 10% increase in second-quarter revenue, to $147.98 billion, shy of expectations of $148.56 billion. Profits were $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per share, nearly double Amazon\u2019s profits in the same quarter a year ago, and surpassing expectations of $1.03 per share. Speaking with reporters on a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said average selling prices (ASP) are declining amid cautious consumer spending. Unit sales growth was strong, he said, and an increase in shipping speeds is prompting growth in purchasing of everyday essentials. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is really around ASP, and lower ASP in products selected by customers,\u201d Olsavsky said. \u201cThey are continuing to be cautious with their spending, trading down to lower ASP products. And even on the higher-ticket items \u2026 there\u2019s certainly a drop-off from probably more of a steady-state, thriving economy.\u201d Amazon is reportedly planning to launch a new storefront with lower-priced items and slower shipping, directly from Chinese suppliers, to compete with emerging rivals including Temu and Shein. Olsavsky declined to comment directly on those reports in response to a question on the media call. In addition, Olsavsky said Amazon experienced a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange rates, which was about $300 million higher than the company expected. In the realm of artificial intelligence, Amazon is spending significant sums to expand its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure. Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures and equipment finance leases amounted to $30.5 billion for the first half of the year, and the number is expected to grow in the second half of the year, Olsavsky said. \u201cThe majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure, as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads,\u201d he said. Highlights from the company\u2019s business segments: In its guidance for the current quarter, which began July 1, Amazon said it expects net sales between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, which translates into a midpoint of $156.25 billion, below the average estimate of $158.24 billion. Olsavsky said the current quarter was proving especially challenging to predict, due in part to consumers becoming distracted by news events, elections, and the Olympics, among other factors. Shares fell 4% in initial after-hours trading.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Target Corporation announced its first quarter 2024 financial results on May 22, 2024. The company reported GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $2.03, slightly down from $2.05 in 2023. Total revenue for the quarter was $24.5 billion, a 3.1% decrease from the previous year.

For the full year, the company maintains its forecast of a 0 to 2 percent increase in comparable sales and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60.The company's net interest expense for the first quarter was $106 million, down from $147 million last year, due to higher interest income from increased cash balances. The effective income tax rate was 22.7%, up from 21.1% in the previous year. Target paid $508 million in dividends, a 1.9% increase from last year, and did not repurchase any stock during the quarter.Target's inventory levels were $11.73 billion as of May 4, 2024, compared to $11.89 billion on February 3, 2024, and $12.62 billion on April 29, 2023. The company's total assets were $55.12 billion, with total liabilities and shareholders' investment also at $55.12 billion.The company\u2019s after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) for the trailing twelve months was 15.4%, up from 11.4% in the previous year, driven by higher operating income. Target will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call and provide a replay for investors and media.Target operates nearly 2,000 stores and has a significant digital presence.

    "Summarized_Document3": "Holding too much inventory ties up capital and increases carrying costs, while not enough stock can lead to slow order fulfillment and lost revenue. The reorder point (ROP) is a technique in supply chain management to balance these issues by determining the minimum number of units needed in stock to meet sales orders or production targets. When inventory falls below this point, a new purchase order is triggered. Calculating reorder points helps maintain optimal service levels and improve cash flow.The reorder point formula is: Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock. Components of the formula include:- Average daily sales or usage: The average number of units sold or used per day over a defined period, typically three months.- Average delivery lead time: The average time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the order date, which can vary with seasonal demand and other factors.- Safety stock: Extra inventory held to mitigate the risk of shortages, calculated as (Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time).For example, if a manufacturer uses 1.5 units daily on average, with an average lead time of 12 days and a safety stock of 132 units, the reorder point would be (1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150 units. This means the manufacturer should reorder when stock falls to 150 units to avoid stockouts.Businesses can start using the reorder point formula with at least one procurement and sales cycle worth of data. Small businesses might use spreadsheets, while larger operations may benefit from inventory management software for greater efficiency and accuracy. These tools can automate processes, provide real-time tracking, and generate detailed reports to fine-tune inventory management.Reorder points should be reviewed at least quarterly to account for fluctuations in sales volumes and delivery times. An effective reorder point helps fulfill orders quickly, protect margins, and keep customers satisfied.",

    "Document1": "Amazon sales come up short, profits nearly double\nby Todd Bishop on August 1, 2024 at 1:21 pmAugust 1, 2024 at 5:30 pm\nIn-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant\u2019s hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.\nAmazon\u2019s sales fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates but profits exceeded expectations in the company\u2019s second quarter results, released Thursday afternoon for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nThe tech giant reported a 10% increase in second-quarter revenue, to $147.98 billion, shy of expectations of $148.56 billion. Profits were $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per share, nearly double Amazon\u2019s profits in the same quarter a year ago, and surpassing expectations of $1.03 per share.\nSpeaking with reporters on a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said average selling prices (ASP) are declining amid cautious consumer spending. Unit sales growth was strong, he said, and an increase in shipping speeds is prompting growth in purchasing of everyday essentials. \n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is really around ASP, and lower ASP in products selected by customers,\u201d Olsavsky said. \u201cThey are continuing to be cautious with their spending, trading down to lower ASP products. And even on the higher-ticket items \u2026 there\u2019s certainly a drop-off from probably more of a steady-state, thriving economy.\u201d\nAmazon is reportedly planning to launch a new storefront with lower-priced items and slower shipping, directly from Chinese suppliers, to compete with emerging rivals including Temu and Shein. Olsavsky declined to comment directly on those reports in response to a question on the media call.\nIn addition, Olsavsky said Amazon experienced a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange rates, which was about $300 million higher than the company expected.\nIn the realm of artificial intelligence, Amazon is spending significant sums to expand its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure. Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures and equipment finance leases amounted to $30.5 billion for the first half of the year, and the number is expected to grow in the second half of the year, Olsavsky said.\n\u201cThe majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure, as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads,\u201d he said.\nHighlights from the company\u2019s business segments:\nIn its guidance for the current quarter, which began July 1, Amazon said it expects net sales between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, which translates into a midpoint of $156.25 billion, below the average estimate of $158.24 billion.\nOlsavsky said the current quarter was proving especially challenging to predict, due in part to consumers becoming distracted by news events, elections, and the Olympics, among other factors.\nShares fell 4% in initial after-hours trading. \nGeekWire Newsletters\nSubscribe to GeekWire's free newsletters to catch every headline\nSend Us a Tip\nHave a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

Comparable sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 2.8%, and comparable sales in the U.S. decreased 3.2%.\u00a0\n\nNet earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $3.6 billion, or $3.63 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $3.9 billion, or $3.82 per diluted share, in the same period of fiscal 2023.\u00a0\n\"The team executed at a high level in the quarter, and we continued to grow market share,\" said Ted Decker, chair, president and CEO. \"And while the quarter was impacted by a delayed start to spring and continued softness in certain larger discretionary projects, we feel great about our store readiness, our product assortment in stores and online, and our associate engagement.\u00a0 Our associates are energized and ready to serve our customers as spring breaks across the country. I would like to thank them for their continued hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities.\"\nFiscal 2024 Guidance\nThe company reaffirms its fiscal 2024 guidance, which includes 53 weeks of operating results. In addition, in March, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SRS Distribution Inc. (SRS). Since the acquisition has not closed, the following guidance does not reflect any impacts from the SRS acquisition:\u00a0\nThe Home Depot will conduct a conference call today at 9 a.m. ET to discuss information included in this news release and related matters. The conference call will be available in its entirety through a webcast and replay at ir.homedepot.com/events-and-presentations.\nAt the end of the first quarter, the company operated a total of 2,337 retail stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, 10 Canadian provinces and Mexico. The Company employs approximately 465,000 associates.

At the same time, not enough stock causes slow order fulfillment, the potential for missed sales, and lost revenue.\nReorder point (ROP) is a supply chain management technique that businesses can use to guide this delicate balancing act to improve inventory operations, avoid stockouts, and maintain ideal inventory levels.\nWhat is the reorder point?\nThe reorder point is the minimum number of units a company needs to have in stock to fill sales orders or meet production targets. Once inventory dips below the calculated reorder point, replenishment is triggered through a new purchase order.\nRegularly calculating reorder points removes the mystery from inventory cost control and helps your business maintain optimal service levels.\nWhy should your business know your reorder points?\nReorder points help to ensure products and cash flow in the right direction, at the right time. With accurate reorder points for all of your product SKUs, you can meet customer demand in a timely fashion to improve cash flow and avoid the bloated costs of overstock.\nPrimary business benefits of using reorder points include the following:\nCost control\nInventory\u00a0carrying costs\u00a0typically account for 15-30% of total inventory costs. This affects the profit margin on goods sold. By using the most optimal reorder levels, businesses can keep storage and warehousing costs low to protect profits. \nOptimal inventory levels\nBy reordering a predetermined amount of replenishment inventory according to demand forecasts, you can avoid sunk costs from inventory shrinkage and obsolescence.\nSupply chain optimization\n The reorder point calculation takes into account delivery lead time from suppliers. By keeping track of average delivery lead time, you can identify your most reliable and least reliable suppliers and make more informed\u00a0procurement decisions.\nImproved forecasting\nTo accurately calculate reorder points, you\u2019ll need to have strong records on sales volume and trends over a certain time period. As you build this body of data, you can improve forecasting to better meet customer demand.\nNow, let\u2019s see how to find the reorder point.\nHow does the reorder point formula work?\nThe reorder point formula takes into account three factors: average daily sales or usage, average delivery lead time, and safety stock.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nFirst, let\u2019s define all of the components that make up this equation.\nComponents of the reorder equation\nAverage daily sales or usage\n Average daily sales is the average number of units sold or used per day over a defined time period. Three months or 90 days is a good starting increment to use. A retailer would measure the average number of units sold, while a manufacturer would calculate the average number of components used per day. \nLet\u2019s say you sold 40 units of an item in March, 60 in April, and 46 in May.\nOver those three months (or 92 days) that averages out to 1.5 units sold on average per day.\nAverage delivery lead time\n Average delivery lead time is the average amount of time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the time the order was placed. Average delivery lead time changes with fluctuations in seasonal demand, the quantity ordered, and distance from the up-chain supplier. For a reasonable measure, take an average of the past three months of POs for the SKU item you want to set a reorder point for. If your sales cycle is longer or shorter, adjust accordingly. \nSafety stock\nSafety stock\u00a0is the amount of inventory a business holds to mitigate the risk of shortages or stockouts. The safety stock calculation is the difference between the maximum daily sales/usage and lead time, and the average daily usage and lead time. \n(Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time)\n Let\u2019s say a manufacturer used 10 units of a component on their busiest day of production. The longest time it would take the supplier to deliver this component is 15 days. And let\u2019s assume that the average daily use is 1.5 units, and the average lead time is 12 days. \n(10 x 15) \u2013 (1.5 x 12)\n150 \u2013 18 = 132\u00a0\nThe manufacturer should hold 132 safety stock units to avoid bottlenecks in production.\nThe reorder point formula in action\nNow we\u2019ve got all reorder point sub-metrics ready. Let\u2019s continue with the manufacturer example and calculate the reorder point.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nAverage daily usage = 1.5 units\nAverage lead team = 12 days\nSafety stock = 132 units\n(1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150\nTherefore, the manufacturer should reorder this component when stock falls to 150 units. By doing so, the company can prevent stockouts and avoid dipping into safety stock while they wait for new stock to arrive.\nHow to start using the reorder point formula in your business\nIf you have at least one procurement cycle and one sales cycle worth of data, you can start using the reorder point formula to improve your inventory operations.\nBusinesses with a limited number of products can start with excel spreadsheets and format cells to turn red when inventory levels reach the reorder point.\nFor growing\u00a0retailers,\u00a0manufacturers, or\u00a0wholesalers, working with dozens or hundreds of spreadsheets can be time-consuming and error-prone. If your business falls into this category, consider the benefits of\u00a0inventory management software.\n A modern inventory management system can bring greater efficiency to inventory processes through automation and digital tools. For example, real-time inventory tracking allows staff to see what\u2019s in stock, what\u2019s on order, and where each item is located. Software tools can also collect and present data on purchase orders, sales fulfillment, and demand forecasting on a single user dashboard. \n With this information readily available, inventory managers can avoid wasting time manually searching through spreadsheets and crunching numbers. Some inventory management tools also enable businesses to generate customized reports on inventory stock by item, vendor, delivery date, assembly, and more. Rich inventory insights like these empower businesses to fine-tune their reorder points and overall inventory management processes. \nFinal thoughts\nKeep in mind, reorder points are not static. Sales volumes fluctuate, and supply delivery times vary. Demand for certain product lines may grow or fall.\nTo maintain an accurate reorder point, check the underlying metrics \u2014 average daily sales/usage and average lead time \u2014 at least once per quarter. If you have a high season and low season, or seasonal bad weather that slows down deliveries, factor this in.\nAn effective reorder point ensures that your business keeps flowing\u2014 it helps you fulfill orders quickly, protects your margins, and keeps customers happy.\nRecommended for you\nMidsize business\nWhat is the safety stock formula?

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon\u2019s sales fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates but profits exceeded expectations in the company\u2019s second quarter results, released Thursday afternoon for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The tech giant reported a 10% increase in second-quarter revenue, to $147.98 billion, shy of expectations of $148.56 billion. Profits were $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per share, nearly double Amazon\u2019s profits in the same quarter a year ago, and surpassing expectations of $1.03 per share. Speaking with reporters on a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said average selling prices (ASP) are declining amid cautious consumer spending. Unit sales growth was strong, he said, and an increase in shipping speeds is prompting growth in purchasing of everyday essentials. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is really around ASP, and lower ASP in products selected by customers,\u201d Olsavsky said. \u201cThey are continuing to be cautious with their spending, trading down to lower ASP products. And even on the higher-ticket items \u2026 there\u2019s certainly a drop-off from probably more of a steady-state, thriving economy.\u201d Amazon is reportedly planning to launch a new storefront with lower-priced items and slower shipping, directly from Chinese suppliers, to compete with emerging rivals including Temu and Shein. Olsavsky declined to comment directly on those reports in response to a question on the media call. In addition, Olsavsky said Amazon experienced a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange rates, which was about $300 million higher than the company expected. In the realm of artificial intelligence, Amazon is spending significant sums to expand its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure. Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures and equipment finance leases amounted to $30.5 billion for the first half of the year, and the number is expected to grow in the second half of the year, Olsavsky said. \u201cThe majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure, as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads,\u201d he said. Highlights from the company\u2019s business segments: In its guidance for the current quarter, which began July 1, Amazon said it expects net sales between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, which translates into a midpoint of $156.25 billion, below the average estimate of $158.24 billion. Olsavsky said the current quarter was proving especially challenging to predict, due in part to consumers becoming distracted by news events, elections, and the Olympics, among other factors. Shares fell 4% in initial after-hours trading.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer, reported first-quarter fiscal 2024 sales of $36.4 billion, a 2.3% decrease from the same period in fiscal 2023. Comparable sales dropped by 2.8%, with U.S. sales down by 3.2%. Net earnings were $3.6 billion, or $3.63 per diluted share, compared to $3.9 billion, or $3.82 per diluted share, in fiscal 2023. Despite a delayed start to spring and softness in larger discretionary projects, the company maintained market share and reaffirmed its fiscal 2024 guidance, which includes 53 weeks of operating results. The acquisition of SRS Distribution Inc. is not reflected in this guidance as it has not yet closed. The Home Depot operated 2,337 retail stores and employed approximately 465,000 associates as of the end of the first quarter. The company\u2019s stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol HD and is part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 index. Forward-looking statements in the report highlight various risks and uncertainties that could impact future performance. Financial highlights include a gross profit of $12.4 billion, operating income of $5.1 billion, and net earnings of $3.6 billion. The balance sheet shows total assets of $79.2 billion and total liabilities of $77.4 billion. Cash flows from operating activities were $5.5 billion, with net cash used in investing and financing activities amounting to $830 million and $4.1 billion, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period were $4.3 billion.",

Calculating reorder points helps maintain optimal service levels and improve cash flow.The reorder point formula is: Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock. Components of the formula include:- Average daily sales or usage: The average number of units sold or used per day over a defined period, typically three months.- Average delivery lead time: The average time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the order date, which can vary with seasonal demand and other factors.- Safety stock: Extra inventory held to mitigate the risk of shortages, calculated as (Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time).For example, if a manufacturer uses 1.5 units daily on average, with an average lead time of 12 days and a safety stock of 132 units, the reorder point would be (1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150 units. This means the manufacturer should reorder when stock falls to 150 units to avoid stockouts.Businesses can start using the reorder point formula with at least one procurement and sales cycle worth of data. Small businesses might use spreadsheets, while larger operations may benefit from inventory management software for greater efficiency and accuracy. These tools can automate processes, provide real-time tracking, and generate detailed reports to fine-tune inventory management.Reorder points should be reviewed at least quarterly to account for fluctuations in sales volumes and delivery times. An effective reorder point helps fulfill orders quickly, protect margins, and keep customers satisfied.",

But as most small business owners know, there are times where you need to stop and make sure that your business is bringing in the revenue it should be.\nOur research indicates that figuring out the best trucking rates per mile is the key to making sure that your business remains profitable, but it can also be a complex process as rates are constantly changing.\nBefore getting into the details on trucking rates per mile 2024, it\u2019s important to understand what goes into determining freight truck rates.\nIn this guide, you\u2019ll find out what current trucking rates per mile are and get a refresher on the industry terms to remember as you navigate truck rates.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nHow to calculate trucking  freight rates\nThe trucking rates can be calculated by multiplying your trucking rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points.\nTotal trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles)\nLike other trades jobs, there is a lot that goes into determining the best trucking rate per mile for your business.\nOur findings show that not only do you have to constantly monitor your fuel spend as well as supply and demand, but you also have to take into account your fixed costs.\nBut let\u2019s start with the basics for truck rates per mile.\nA truck freight rate is a price a shipper or broker will pay you, the carrier, to haul a load. The concept is simple, but our research indicates that trucking rates per mile can vary significantly depending on the time of year and current fuel prices.\nWhich can make knowing the national average trucking cost per mile feel like a black box.\nTrucking freight rates are calculated on a per mile basis. Therefore, the most important number when it comes to calculating truck rates is the number of miles between your starting point and the destination.\nBased on our observations, having the average rate per mile for trucking and accurate information about trucking freight rates is essential to properly pricing trips and negotiating rates with your customers.\nBe aware, however, that calculating the overall freight rate depends on various other factors. Below, you\u2019ll find what you need to consider when calculating trucking rates.\nFactor #1: Distance of travel\nImage credit: Nelson Gono via Unsplash\nWhether you\u2019re transporting locally or looking at over the road trucking rates, the distance between destinations is an important part of determining trucking rates per mile.\nYou want to ensure that you have the right mileage from the beginning to avoid any surprises along the way and get the correct per mile trucking rates.\nDouble-check that your driver will not be required to make any long detours because of road closures. Otherwise, you risk job profitability, timing, and changes to the rate per mile for truck drivers.\nFactor #2: The weight of the shipment\nAfter the distance, our findings show that the weight of the shipment is one of the most significant factors for the cost of trucking per mile. It is important to manage the overall weight load for your fleet to control costs and determine your per mile rate for trucking.\nTo be successful at this, you\u2019ll need to consider variables like heavy haul rates per mile, FTL trucking rates, number of passengers, etc.\nOtherwise, you stand to incorrectly answer \u201cWhat is the average freight cost per mile?\u201d.\nWhen it comes to your average per mile rate for freight, it\u2019s best to be on the safe side and start with higher rates per mile for trucking to allow your customer to negotiate while still ensuring revenue for your business.\nWith this approach, your average haulage cost per mile is sure to bring a profit to your business.\nFactor #3: Shipment density\nThe shipment density is another factor that will determine how much room a shipment will take up in your truck and, in turn, your trucking per mile rates.\nDrawing from our experience, once you know the weight of the shipment, calculating the shipment density is simple. All you have to do is divide the cargo weight by its cubic feet.\nFactor #4: Freight classification\nA question that often goes unanswered is \u201cWhat is the average freight rate per mile?\u201d.\nAnd the question makes sense based on our observations given the number of important industry standards to keep up with for freight classification.\nThe National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) has defined 18 classes of shipments that affect freight rates per mile.\nFreight classification is determined by factors such as:\nHaving a thorough knowledge of how to use these factors to calculate trucking rates per mile will ensure that your business remains competitive and profitable.\nOur findings show that most trucking companies charge customers per mile based on factors like:\nYou need to strike a good balance when setting your rates \u2013 setting a low rate may cause you to lose money, while setting a high rate may turn customers away toward cheaper companies.\nA good rule of thumb to stay competitive rate-wise is to keep an eye on both national and local trucking rates. And based on our observations, providing a fair rate with excellent service is the key to getting (and retaining) more customers.\nAt the time of writing, the national average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile. However, this is just a national average, which means your area may have higher or lower rates.\nTo set a fair price for your flatbed truck services, you need to consider things like:\nThrough our practical knowledge, setting a fair per-mile rate means you can pay truckers a fair wage, keep the clients happy, and still a profit.\nAlthough these are the main takeaways on how to calculate trucking rates, you want to ensure that you have the basic industry knowledge to determine other factors that may influence your truck rates.\nLet\u2019s take a look at some key trucking terms, beyond freight trucking rates, to set you up for success.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nThe terms in trucking you need to know\nKeeping up to date with all of the basic trucking terms is an important factor in knowing how to calculate trucking rates and freight cost per mile.\nFirst things first, there are several types of freight trucks, and they are each ideal to haul different cargo. Your freight type will determine your trucking rates per mile as freight costs per mile steeply influence your fuel spend.\nDifferent types of freight trucks include:\nHere are some other industry terms that play a factor in the national trucking rate per mile and that will help you understand what the going rate for freight per mile is.\nConsignor\nThe consignor is the party that is shipping the product you\u2019re transporting. They are also known as the seller and are your customer.\nThe consignor can be:\nThe ownership of the products stays with the consignor until the consignee pays them in full. Still, our investigation demonstrated that that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the liability stays with them.\nConsignee\nA consignee is a recipient of the products being shipped. You can think of them as the buyer, and they can be an individual or a company.\nThe consignee must be physically present to accept the shipment from the consignor unless specifically stated otherwise in the bill of lading.\nCarrier\nImage credit: Quintin Gellar via Pexels\nYour role in the shipping process will be that of the carrier. The carrier is the party in charge of delivering the products to their destination.\nAs a carrier, you\u2019re responsible for receiving the bill of lading and safely transporting items to the consignee.\nBill of lading (BOL)\nThe consignor sends the goods to you, the freight carrier, to ship them to the consignee. However, the ownership of the freight doesn\u2019t legally change until the recipient of the goods signs the bill of lading (BOL).\nA BOL is a document required in the shipping process that involves all parties: the consignor, consignee, and carrier. The consignor and consignee each get a copy of the BOL, and then there is usually a third copy for the bank.\nThe BOL includes relevant details necessary to ship the product and invoice the transaction correctly once it is completed.\nIt includes the following information:\nFree on board point (FOB)\nFree on board (FOB), also known as freight on board, is a term used to indicate whether the buyer or the seller is liable for goods that are lost, damaged, or destroyed during shipping.\nThe FOB shipping point indicates that the title and responsibility of goods transfer from the seller to the buyer when the goods are placed on your delivery vehicle.\nOn the other hand, a FOB destination means that the seller is responsible for the goods until the goods are delivered to the buyer.\nLoss and damage\nAs a carrier, you may have to deal with loss or damage claims from time to time.\nA damage claim involves visible damage to either the goods or the storage container that the goods are in. The damage should be noted on the bill of lading or another delivery document.\nA loss claim is when a shipment is not delivered or when it shows that it was delivered, but the recipient hasn\u2019t received it. This can be due to typography errors in the bill of lading causing the shipment to go to the wrong address.\nFull truckload shipping (FTL)\nFull truckload shipping (FTL) applies to a shipment that takes up an entire trailer. This is a key price variable as it affects the cost of freight per mile.\nWhen it comes to FTL freight rates factors, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s the smallest truck in your fleet or the largest as FTL applies as long as you use up your entire space. Typically, FTL freight will exceed 15,000 pounds.\nThe full truck load cost per mile typically costs a higher rate per mile since your truck is at full capacity.\nLess than truckload (LTL)\nA less than truckload shipment (LTL) doesn\u2019t take up an entire trailer but may need to move between vehicles during the shipping process. For this reason, LTL rates per mile aren\u2019t always standard across jobs and will affect your average LTL cost per mile.\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll need to charge your customers a different rate than the average truckload rate per mile if you\u2019re at less than a truckload.\nTrucking rates per mile for LTL will vary depending on how far your company will be taking the shipment.\nLoad rates for trucks\nLoad rates or freight rates are what you charge for a truck to deliver cargo from one place to another.\nLoad rates are typically paid per mile and can be influenced by factors such as:\nAdditional services like warehouse storage, loading and unloading, and automotive insurance may be included in calculating a customer\u2019s load rates.\nOur findings show that load rates also vary depending on the type of cargo being carried because different cargo may need different types of trucks to transport.\nDrayage\nDrayage is a term that involves shipping goods at a short distance via ground freight. Basically, it is the process of moving a large container to your truck.\nBased on our firsthand experience, this may be an extra cost that you have to consider when giving your customer an estimate of the total cost of your services.\nPallets\nPallets are portable platforms used to package items for freight shipping. Pallets come in different sizes, but the most common size that you\u2019ll find is the standard 40 x 48 size to ship items.\nPallets not only make loading and unloading items easier, but they also allow you to maximize space in your truck. This may reduce your total cost and allow you to provide more competitive trucking rates per mile.\nStop keeping unit (SKU)\nAn SKU (Stock keeping unit) is a service identification code. They\u2019re usually displayed alphanumerically or as a barcode.\nSKUs help track products in inventory as they contain all factors required to identify an item, such as:\nHundredweight (CWT)\nA hundredweight, also known as a CWT, is a unit of measurement. In North America, a hundredweight refers to 100 pounds, whereas the British consider a hundredweight to be 112 pounds.\nIn the past, packages that take up less than an entire truckload were measured by CWTs, but it is not common to measure packages by CWT today. Measuring by pounds or kilograms is now the standard.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nIn order to continue to offer competitive trucking rates per mile, you need to know how much do trucking companies charge per mile. Cost per mile is influenced by factors such as:\nFinancing is also a cost that may influence the cost per mile. The cost of financing trucks and trailers ranges from 0% to 30% of revenue.\nAs of July 2021, trucking rates per mile remain steady. Here are the current rates for the most popular freight truck types:\nFuel prices have been steadily increasing over the past year and are a huge variable in knowing how to calculate transportation rates.\nThe national diesel price was sitting at $3.34 per gallon, with a $0.05 increase from June 2021 to July 2021. However, in 2024 prices have increased greatly with high rates of fluctuation when it comes to price and supply availability.\nAverage rate per mile for owner-operators\nIn contrast to company drivers, owner-operators are truckers who own or lease their own trucks. These people usually work with a trucking company to get back-office support and find trucking jobs.\nOwner-operators generally earn about 70 to 80 percent of the loads they take. For example, if flatbed truck transport is $3.14 per mile, the owner-operator can earn up to $2.51 per mile. If they\u2019re out on the road often, they may earn up to $156,000 annually.\nWhere does the rest of your per-mile rate go? The remaining 20 to 30 percent goes to your trucking company. An owner-operator at a trucking company benefits from access to cargo jobs, in-house mechanics, and gas station location optimization.\nBeing an owner-operator is a great way to earn more money, but it also means you will be dealing with the stress and finances largely on your own.\nFor example, you\u2019ll have to shoulder truck maintenance, health insurance, and other business expenses.\nIf you\u2019re not prepared to take on the added risk and costs, becoming a company trucker is always viable.\nTrucking rates per mile 2024 FAQs:\nHere are the top questions truckers have in 2024:\nDo trucking companies pay for empty miles?\nEmpty miles, also known as non-revenue or deadhead miles, are miles garnered by the truck when it isn\u2019t earning any revenue.\nBased on our observations, this happens when there\u2019s a load to the destination but no load back. Empty miles range from 33 \u2013 40% of total miles driven, making them very wasteful for your trucking business.\nTo avoid empty miles, try to minimize any unnecessary movement of goods and improve your scheduling so that your trucks are carrying a load as often as possible.\nIf you can\u2019t avoid an empty mile, it\u2019s best to add a portion of it to your rate per mile trucking costs.\nWhat is a good rate per mile for trucking companies to charge?\nAfter putting it to the test, it is difficult to determine an average rate for trucking rates per mile, but if you keep up with industry news, you\u2019ll always have a good idea of average trucking rates.\nTo answer your question on what is the going rate per mile for trucking \u2014 current trucking rates per mile 2024 averages are:\nKeep in mind that these are just average per mile trucking rates, and your business may profit from a different rate. Based on our observations, providing the lowest rates may not be enough to bring your revenue, but a rate that\u2019s too high may price you out of the competition.\nThe same goes for how much you offer your drivers. As per our expertise, you need to know what is the average rate per mile for truck drivers in your area so you can be fair as well as competitive when it comes to wages.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nThe average going rates for trucking per mile are:\nMany things influence trucking freight rates. Some key factors include:\nWhy are trucking rates so low?\nOur findings show that recent trucking rates are low because of a larger supply compared to the available demand.\nWhen the pandemic began, people needed more things shipped, and the for-hire trucking market soared. Trucking companies started large recruiting drives, and many people decided to start trucking businesses of their own.\nBut now that the volume of shipments is falling to pre-pandemic levels, there are simply too many truckers and not enough demand for shipments by truck. As the laws of supply and demand dictate, an abundance of supply means that prices are going to fall.\nHowever, that\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s thrown a wrench in the trucking industry. Recent global developments, such as the war in Ukraine raising fuel prices and a COVID resurgence in China\u2019s export centers causing commodity prices to rise, have made it harder for truckers to make a profit.\nThat said, the decreased demand for consumer goods doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all bad for truckers. While consumer goods shipments are down, 70-80% of freight consists of manufactured goods, and manufacturing companies are still willing to pay for truck deliveries.\nHow much do owner-operators make per mile?\nOwner-operators generally make 70 to 80% of their load per mile.\nIf we take flatbed rates as an example, a flatbed truck owner-operator stands to make up to $2.51 per mile out of the $3.14 per mile average rate.\nThe rest of the money goes to the trucking company to pay for benefits such as:\nThis is in contrast to company drivers, who may only get 38 to 52 cents per mile with the same load. However, the larger cut that owner-operators get comes with extra risks.\nAlthough they get benefits from their trucking company, owner-operators are still independent contractors who need to do everything themselves.\nWhile owner-operators stand to gain more money, they also need to set aside more cash for life and automotive insurance, fuel and maintenance, and taxes.\nBecause of this, owner-operators are more likely to be experienced truckers. Typically, those who have worked as company drivers for several years want more freedom and the chance to make their own decisions.\nIf you\u2019re a new trucker or are simply averse to taking more risks and responsibilities, you can become a company driver first to gain more experience and confidence.\nHow much does a freight broker charge per load?\nFreight brokers usually charge around 25-35% of the load.\nA freight broker is a middleman between a shipper and the carrier. They take the shipment from the customer and contact a carrier fleet to take the shipment to its destination.\nShippers like working with freight brokers because the broker deals with everything related to the carriers, becoming the single point of contact for updates. On the other side, carriers also like working with freight brokers because they can optimize routes and give the truckers multiple shipments to reduce deadhead miles.\nWhy trucking rates are important\nYour number one goal is to have a profitable trucking business, and keeping up with average trucking rates per mile is the best way to ensure that your business continues to grow. The key to this is having the right cost per mile trucking, so you win jobs and turn a profit.\nHopefully, you\u2019ve learned everything from what is the average rate per mile for hauling freight to standard truck shipping rates per mile in this article.\nTo recap, the truck rates you use for your business can be influenced by the:\nBy becoming an expert on what is the average trucking rate per mile and keeping up with industry trends, you\u2019ll be able to offer competitive prices and attract more customers, meaning more revenue.\nImage credit: Zetong Li via\u00a0Unsplash\nStreamline your business with Method\nStart your free trial \u2014 no credit card, no contract.\nFeatures\nCompany\n\nResources\nSupport\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Method Integration.

    "Document2": "Amazon Fee Changes 2024: Significant Fee Updates\nAmazon regularly introduces changes to their FBA fulfillment fees in order to complement the changes in the global eCommerce industry. This year, the tech giant introduced significant changes in core Amazon FBA fees and other Amazon selling fees in general, the majority of which will take effect on February 5th, 2024.\nThe upcoming Amazon fee changes are brought about by multiple factors affecting Amazon\u2019s business operations and the eCommerce industry in its totality. The new Amazon fees for 2024 are designed to motivate sellers to utilize the platform\u2019s services to benefit all parties involved, facilitating faster deliveries and ensuring efficient use of space in Amazon fulfillment centers.\nAmazon Fee Changes in 2024 | Summary\nAs Amazon continues to invest in technology, infrastructure, transportation, and people in order to innovate its services, additional costs are bound to be incurred. The changes to Amazon fees are largely focused on fulfillment, referral, storage, unit sales, and returns processing.\nAs an overview of the impact of these changes in Amazon fees, an average increase of $0.15 in fees per unit sold is to be expected by Amazon sellers. However, Amazon emphasizes that such an increase is \u201csignificantly less than other logistics providers.\u201d\nTo further enlighten sellers on the changes in Amazon selling fees this year, here are some core fee adjustments to be implemented in 2024.\nAmazon Referral Fees Update for 2024\nStarting January 15, 2024, there will be some changes in Amazon referral fees for apparel products, while other referral fees will remain unchanged. Apparel products priced at a certain level will be updated.\nAs mentioned, referral fees for other Amazon products will remain unchanged. You may refer on the table below for the referral fees of specific Amazon categories:\n15% for products with a total sales price greater than $10.00\n15% for items with a total sales price greater than $10.00\n8% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $300.00\n8% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $100.00\n15% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $100.00 up to $1,000.00,\n10% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $1,000.00 up to $5,000.00, and\n5% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $5,000.00\n10% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $200.00\n15% for products with a total sales price greater than $15.00\n5% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $250.00\n8% for products with a total sales price greater than $500.00\n3% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $1,500.00\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cReferral fee rates,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nFBA Fulfillment Fees (Excluding Apparel)\nOn February 5th, 2024, the new granular rate cards for standard-sized products and large bulky & extra-large size tiers will take effect. Moreover, starting April 15th, 2024, FBA fulfillment fee rates for the aforementioned size tiers will be implemented.\nTo better understand the FBA fulfillment fees in 2024, you may refer to the chart below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cTable 1. FBA fulfillment fees (excluding Apparel),\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cTable 2. FBA fulfillment fees (excluding Apparel),\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Table 3. FBA fulfillment fees (excluding Apparel),\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nInbound and Outbound Fee Changes\nThe new inbound placement service fee aligns with the changes in Amazon seller fees for 2024. Starting March 1st, 2024, there will be an inbound placement service fee for standard and Large Bulky-sized products. The standard-sized products will have an average fee of $0.27 per unit, whereas Large Bulky-sized products will have an average fee of $1.58 per unit.\nThe implementation of this inbound placement service fee will commence 45 days after the products are received. It means that Amazon will start charging sellers inbound placement fees on April 15th, 2024. For reference, you can check the table below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cFBA inbound placement service fee,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cFBA inbound placement service fee,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nTo minimize or eliminate fees associated with inbound placement services, Amazon recommends opting for the \u201cDiscounted\u201d FBA inbound placement service, provided your shipping plan meets the criteria. This choice will significantly reduce or completely eliminate fees for dispatching your inventory to various inbound locations within the Amazon network.\nIn relation to inbound fees, effective March 1, 2024, Amazon will introduce an inbound defect fee. This particular Amazon fee will cover shipments delivered to the wrong fulfillment center or deleted and abandoned shipments. The below outlines the per-unit inbound defect fee amount.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cInbound defect fees,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nFor outbound products, sellers will also observe a reduced FBA fulfillment fee rate of $0.20 per unit for standard-sized products and $0.61 per unit for large bulky-sized products for large bulky-sized products.\nAnother fee update relating to fulfillment fees includes a fulfillment fee discount ranging from $0.04 to $1.32, depending on item size and weight, for eligible products in the Ships in Product Packaging (SIPP) program.\nAccordingly, items certified as SIPP will automatically receive lowered FBA fulfillment fees on each certified unit shipped. You may refer to the table below for the allotted discount per SIPP-certified unit in 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Jan 24, 2024.\nInventory and Storage Fee Changes\nAmazon recommends that sellers using Fulfillment by Amazon ensure they have a healthy inventory level to minimize order fulfillment costs, including shipping costs.\nIn an effort to promote healthy inventory levels among third-party sellers, Amazon is introducing a low-inventory-level fee for standard-sized products that consistently fall below customer demand. The said fee is set to be implemented on April 1st, 2024, and for guidance may refer to the table below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Jan 24, 2024.\nIn relation to storage fee updates, Amazon indicated that non-peak monthly storage for standard-size product fees will be reduced. Amazon FBA sellers can expect a non-peak monthly inventory storage fees reduction to an average of $0.09 per cubic foot, effective April 1st, 2024. On the other hand, monthly storage fees for non-standard sizes will remain unchanged.\nFurthermore, Amazon will also be introducing more granular fee tiers to the storage utilization surcharge primarily affecting professional sellers.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Jan 24, 2024.\nAmazon FBA Fees 2024 for Removal, Disposal and Liquidation\nStarting February 5th, 2024, Amazon will implement changes to its removal and disposal order fees. It is worth noting that, for Amazon sellers who place removal or disposal orders before February 5, 2024 the new fees won\u2019t apply. For reference, you can check the table below for the updated 2024 Amazon FBA removal and disposal fees:\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cFBA removal, disposal and liquidation order fee changes,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nAmazon Returns Processing Fee Updates\nStarting June 1st, 2024, returns processing fee will be implemented for high-return rate products in all categories, except apparel and shoes. This Amazon fee update is intended to address operational costs and reduce waste. You may refer to the 2024 returns processing fee table below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cReturns processing fee,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nFinal Thought\nThe upcoming Amazon fee changes are relatively minimal, but will definitely affect the average fees paid by sellers. It\u2019s crucial to thoroughly assess these fee increases in the context of your profit margins. The use of Amazon seller tools like an Amazon FBA calculator and an Amazon repricer can prove invaluable in effectively navigating these changes.\nPost navigation\nRelated Posts\nBlog: Home\nAUTHOR:\nIan Kaneshiro, November 5, 2019January 2, 2023\nWith BlackFriday right around the corner there are some important strategic moves you may want\u2026\nAUTHOR:\nNel Ayala, March 10, 2022November 6, 2023\nWith over 5,000 monthly search volume and 2.4 billion search results in 2022, \u201chow to\u2026\nAUTHOR:\nNel Ayala, November 28, 2022November 8, 2023\nWhether you are an Amazon FBA or FBM seller, you will need to follow the\u2026\nStart repricing today with The Game Theory Amazon Repricer\nx\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 | SELLER SNAP | All Rights Reserved\nSeller Snap offers you a fully automated Amazon Repricer, applying Game Theory tactics to guarantee the best possible performance no matter how the competition changes.

Significant business model issues have been starting to manifest for fleets already deploying battery-electric trucks.\nIn many respects, Sanchez\u2019s message echoed that of J.B. Hunt President Shelley Simpson the previous day.\nBEV Technology is Still in its Infancy\nLooking at diesel versus electric in light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, Sanchez said that while Ryder expected to see cost increases for adopting BEVs instead of conventional diesel trucks, they did not expect to see the magnitude of those costs, which he cited as a major barrier to widespread adoption at the current time.\n\u201cWe know the commercial EVs beyond light-duty transit vans are not ready for mass adoption due to price range and payload limitations,\u201d Sanchez told show attendees.\n\u201cWe also know that we have a lack of critical charging infrastructure, and we would [have to] make major improvements to their power grid in order to support it.\n\u201cFrom our point of view, for commercial EVs to work in the real world, we need a breakthrough in battery technology and an expansion of the charging infrastructure. We need an inflection point.\u201d\nToday's EVs are Like the First Mobile Phones\nSanchez produced a vintage Motorola \u201cbrick\u201d cell phone from the podium to make his next point: That BEV technology \u2014 much like the brick cell phone in the late 1970s \u2014 is still in the very earliest stage of its development path.\nOver time, of course, cellphone technology improved exponentially. Better batteries were developed. Phones got smaller. And, as more and more capabilities were added, they eventually evolved into smartphones.\nThere\u2019s a distinct parallel between the evolution of cellular and commercial zero-emissions vehicle technology, Sanchez said. Like the cell phone, he added, the industry needs electric vehicle costs to come down.\n\u201cWe need smaller, lighter and more powerful battery technology to improve the range and capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need a nationwide infrastructure. We need the fastest applicable charges available where professional drivers can conveniently charge their trucks.\u201d\nWe Need a Technological Breakthrough\nThe North American trucking industry clearly needs a new technological breakthrough to drive capabilities up and costs down. The problem, Sanchez cautioned, is that we don\u2019t know when that breakthrough will come, and what kind of changes it will bring.\nThe real-world numbers highlight the scope of issue.\n\u201cAt Ryder, we have a stable of nearly 250,000 commercial vehicles,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnd only 60 of those trucks are EVs.\n\u201cWe also have 40,000 commercial vehicle customers. And so far, only 18 of them have chosen to deploy EVs in their fleets.\u201d\nThose figures hold true for the North American trucking industry at large, Sanchez added. He said that there are nearly 16 million commercial vehicles in service in North America today. And to date, only 28,000 of them are EVs.\n\u201cThe problem is not lack of interest,\u201d Sanchez explained. \u201cWe have many customers who asked about the cost benefit of converting to EVs. We found that there was significant barrier to conversion in the total cost of transport, or the TCT.\u201d\nTCT, he explained, includes the cost of vehicle, fuel or electricity, driver wages, as well as other factors that go into transporting the same load the same distance and achieving the equivalent delivery times.\nThe business case for converting to BEV technology just isn\u2019t there yet, Sanchez said.\nIn fact, he added, if you take the average load that is currently being moved by a heavy-duty diesel truck today and convert that tractor to electric, it requires nearly two vehicles and more than two trailers to deliver the same load at the same time as one diesel vehicle, at more than double TCT.\n\u201cI think most of you would agree that this is a tough sell.\u201d\nThe Diesel and Electric Total Cost of Transport Gap\nRyder did the math to better understand how significant the TCT gap between diesel and battery-electric trucks actually is. The results are detailed in a white paper, \u201cCharged Logistics: The cost of electric vehicle conversion for U.S. commercial fleets.\u201d\nRyder analyzed the total cost to transport, in one-to-one comparisons, for transitioning Class 4 (light-duty), Class 6 (medium-duty), and Class 8 (heavy-duty) vehicles operating in California and Georgia from internal combustion engines to EVs in today\u2019s market.\nThen it also examined the TCT for transitioning a mixed fleet (light, medium, and heavy) of 25 ICE vehicles to EVs. The mix was based on the overall mix of commercial vehicles in the U.S. according to Polk Data Services.\nThe analysis is based on representative network loads and routes from Ryder\u2019s dedicated fleet operations, which includes more than 13,000 commercial vehicles and professional drivers, as well as the impact of EV charging time and maximum payload to achieve equivalent delivery times.\nCritical factors include general labor, energy costs, loads and routes, Sanchez explained.\n\u201cWe then factored in a number of cost assumptions using current market prices for vehicles, maintenance, fuel, and charging infrastructure. We also factored in driver\u2019s wages, other professional costs, as well as general and administrative expenses.\u201d\nThen, Ryder took the range and payload capabilities needed to achieve equivalent diesel delivery targets and ran the numbers.\n\u201cIt currently costs about $170,000 a year to run the light-duty diesel Transit van,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cFor electric vehicles, that cost increases an estimated 3%. The cost of the vehicle nearly doubles. However, maintenance cost savings largely offset the increase in vehicle cost.\u201d\nThe additional driver hours needed for EV charging time in Georgia costs a fleet about $156,000 per year. And while equipment maintenance costs remain the same as that of California, Sanchez noted, Georgia\u2019s lower fuel and energy costs do not provide the same level of savings while transitioning from diesel to electric. All this results in a higher cost disadvantage for Georgia than California.\nHeavy-Duty Comparison\nAs the study moved from light-duty to larger vehicles, the cost benefits start to wane even more.\nLooking at Class 8, in Georgia, it costs a fleet about $291,000 to run a diesel-powered truck. In California, it\u2019s about $334,000 per year.\nBut given current BEV range and payload limitations, Sanchez said it could require nearly twice the equipment and more than twice the labor compared to a diesel truck for fleets to deliver the same loads.\nSo for that same fleet in Georgia, an electric truck would take $622,438 to deliver the same loads.\nIn California, the cost to deliver those same loads with electric would cost $648,712.\nOverall, Ryder\u2019s analysis estimates cost increases of 94% to 114% to convert heavy-duty trucks to EVs and 56% to 67% to convert mixed fleets of 25 vehicles, depending on which state.\nOverall, Ryder\u2019s analysis estimates cost increases of 94% to 114% to convert heavy-duty trucks to EVs.\nImage: HDT graphic\nUltimately, consumers will have to pay for those prices increases.\n\u201cKeep in mind that nearly three-quarters of all goods in the U.S. are transported by trucks,\u201d he added.\n\u201cSo if you extrapolate the TCT analysis for the entire U.S. fleet of commercial vehicles to a 100% transition to EVs, and passing the average total cost of transport on to consumers, we estimate that this increased costs cumulatively adding from .5% to 1% in overall inflation.\u201d\nCan the Cost Parity Gap Be Closed?\nSanchez said the purpose of Ryder\u2019s analysis is to quantify the current gap in cost between diesel and EVS and to identify the cost drivers.\nThis, in turn, will help equipment manufacturers, technology companies, innovators, and regulators to better focus their ZEV development efforts.\n\u201cWe believe those to be advanced battery technology to address payload and range limitations, reducing vehicle costs, and building out sufficient charging networks and delivering power,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe believe [by addressing] those three areas \u2026 we can start to close the gap and created a cost parity between diesel and electric trucks.\u201d\nThere are also multiple ways to reduce vehicle emissions, including electric, natural gas, hydrogen, hybrid carbon capture, as well as continuing to advance diesel emissions technology, Sanchez added.\n\u201cPeople and businesses will see the benefits of zero-emission vehicles,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cAnd mass adoption will follow. It will take all of us in this room and throughout the industry, working together to strike a balance between encouraging innovation, safeguarding the interests of businesses and consumers and the environment alignment.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Freight rates: Trucking rates per mile 2024\n\nIf you own a trucking business, ensuring profitability is crucial. Determining the best trucking rates per mile is key, but it can be complex due to constantly changing rates. This guide provides insights into current trucking rates per mile and essential industry terms.\n\nHow to calculate trucking freight rates\n\nTrucking rates are calculated by multiplying the rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points. The total trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles). Factors influencing trucking rates include distance, weight of the shipment, shipment density, and freight classification.\n\nKey factors in calculating trucking rates:\n\n1. Distance of travel: Ensure accurate mileage to avoid surprises and maintain profitability.\n2. Weight of the shipment: Manage overall weight load to control costs.\n3. Shipment density: Calculate by dividing cargo weight by its cubic feet.\n4. Freight classification: The NMFTA defines 18 classes of shipments affecting rates.\n\nTrucking companies charge customers per mile based on these factors. National average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile, but rates vary by area. Setting a fair per-mile rate ensures fair wages for truckers, happy clients, and profitability.\n\nIndustry terms to know:\n\n- Consignor: The party shipping the product.\n- Consignee: The recipient of the products.\n- Carrier: The party delivering the products.\n- Bill of lading (BOL): A document required in the shipping process.\n- Free on board point (FOB): Indicates liability for goods during shipping.\n- Loss and damage: Claims for visible damage or undelivered shipments.\n- Full truckload shipping (FTL): A shipment that takes up an entire trailer.\n- Less than truckload (LTL): A shipment that doesn't take up an entire trailer.\n- Load rates: Charges for delivering cargo, influenced by various factors.\n- Drayage: Shipping goods a short distance via ground freight.\n- Pallets: Portable platforms for packaging items for freight shipping.\n- Stop keeping unit (SKU): A service identification code for tracking products.\n- Hundredweight (CWT): A unit of measurement (100 pounds in North America).\n\nCurrent trucking rates per mile (2024 averages):\n\n- Flatbed: $3.14 per mile\n- Reefer: $3.19 per mile\n- Dry van: $2.50 per mile\n\nOwner-operators generally earn 70-80% of the load per mile. For example, with flatbed rates at $3.14 per mile, an owner-operator can earn up to $2.51 per mile. The remaining 20-30% goes to the trucking company for benefits like access to cargo jobs and in-house mechanics.\n\nTrucking rates are influenced by factors such as fuel prices, supply and demand, and global developments. Keeping up with industry trends and average rates ensures competitive pricing and profitability for your trucking business.",

    "Document2": "WBEZ\nChicagoans living near heavy-traffic corridors breathe the most polluted air\n\n\n      Maria Ines Zamudio\n    \n\n From\nWhen Irma Morales moved to Little Village nearly three decades ago, she vividly remembers the thin layer of dust blanketing the ground. The single mother of five lived about a mile from a coal plant.\n\"When I walked outside, my shoes would be covered with dust,\" Morales said in Spanish.\nMorales joined the 12-year community-led effort to close the Crawford Power Plant.\nHow does Chicago's air quality affect you? Share your story.\n\"We shut them down,\" said Morales, adding she was diagnosed with a brain tumor during the campaign. \"But for what? So they can bring more diesel trucks?\"\nThe plant closed in 2012 and was replaced by a 1 million-square-foot Target warehouse bringing an estimated hundreds of trucks per day to the neighborhood. Morales and other protesters tried to stop the development.\nEven the building process polluted the neighborhood. A botched implosion of a 378-foot smokestack from the old coal plant left her neighborhood blanketed in dust in April 2020.\n\"Why are you selling ... [our health] to the highest bidder?\" Morales asked of city officials, saying her neighborhood is basically a \"sacrifice zone\" for industry.\nIndeed, in one of the most wide-scale surveys of air quality in Chicago, some stretches of this mostly Mexican community were found to have the highest pollution levels in the city, along with portions of Austin, Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Irving Park and Avondale that see heavy traffic or are near industrial areas, an analysis of readings from newly-installed air sensors show.\nThe data is supplied by Microsoft, which consulted with the city and community groups before installing 115 of the sensors mostly on CTA bus shelters last summer, and has been collecting readings from them every five minutes over the past 10 months.\nEven with more than 100 sensors, it's not nearly enough to cover the entire city and that inhibits a complete analysis of pollution for large swaths of the Southeast and Far South sides \u2014 areas long known to have poor air quality. Still, the data provide some of the most extensive hyperlocal measurements of air quality in Chicago, specifically in the high-pollution months of July through October 2021.\nThis story is part of a monthslong reporting collaboration on Chicago's air quality by the Sun-Times, WBEZ and MuckRock.\nThe newsrooms' analysis found that the worst air pollution levels among areas with sensors were recorded last year near the following locations:\nalong 26th Street near Central Park and California avenues, and near the intersection of California and Cermak in Little Village;\nat two locations along streets near the Kennedy Expressway in Irving Park and Avondale;\nat six locations in Austin, with the highest near a bus stop at Chicago and Cicero avenues;\nand along Halsted near 74th Street in Englewood and 87th in Auburn Gresham.\nResidents who live in these areas are exposed to high levels of air pollution known as particulate matter 2.5 \u2014 tiny material made up of many chemicals and other contaminants \u2014 that can lodge deep in the lungs and cause serious health problems. The pollutants measure 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller, which make them a fraction of the diameter of a human hair.\nFine particulate matter is the single largest environmental contributor to death and is linked to a number of health problems, including heart and lung disease and asthma. An estimated 5% of all premature deaths in Chicago can be attributed to particle pollution. Health experts compare the harm of breathing these particle pollutants to cigarette smoking.\nTens of thousands of diesel trucks travel in and out of the city's industrial corridors on a daily basis, transportation experts say, and they are a known source of particle pollution.\nChicago's poor air quality, and many of its hotspots, have been well-known to residents for decades. But the new data reveal the gulfs between neighborhoods. For example, levels of pollution in these hotspots are consistently higher than in neighborhoods that abut the lakefront on the North Side, including Lincoln Park, Lake View, Uptown and Rogers Park. The Microsoft data also provides other insights into air quality in Chicago.\nThe worst time of day for particle pollution readings, at least in Little Village, was the 6 p.m. evening rush hour \u2014 although 6 a.m. was also bad.\nBut even days when most people aren't working can be hazardous. The Fourth of July and other holidays \u2014 when many people clog the roads to vacation, attend barbecues or other events \u2014 ranked among the most heavily polluted days of the year.\nBut it was Friday, July 23, 2021, a 90-degree day, with wildfire smoke plumes arriving from the West, that stood out as one of the year's worst days for particulate matter. Wildfire smoke, hot temperatures and stagnant air worsen air pollution, including both ozone and particulate matter.\nTo be sure, the sensors are not as precise as the high-quality monitors used by the Environmental Protection Agency to take readings and set policy.\nAnd there may be blind spots in the data on the Far South and heavily industrial Southeast sides, where the EPA monitors almost 250 facilities for air pollution.\nMicrosoft said in a statement that it was limited by a lack of bus shelters and gaps in cell tower connectivity that prevented devices on the Southeast Side from reporting readings. In a statement, the company said it is working on improving antenna placements.\nChicago's air is improving but still harmful to the most vulnerable\nParticulate matter pollution has dropped over the past 20 years, largely thanks to government efforts, including programs under the federal Clean Air Act, to reduce harmful emissions from trucks, cars and power plants.\nThe levels in Chicago currently do not exceed standards set by the EPA, which maintains an annual average limit of 12 micrograms per cubic meter of fine particle pollution. But critics say that standard is way too high and the agency is expected to lower that maximum concentration this year. The World Health Organization says the level should be no higher than 5 micrograms per cubic meter, though health experts say no level of particulate matter is safe.\n\"Even a little particulate matter in the air is going to trigger asthma attacks and heart attacks, put people with lung and heart disease and other chronic diseases in the hospital and cause premature deaths,\" said Brian Urbaszewski, director of environmental health policy at the Respiratory Health Association in Chicago. It also can contribute to birth complications, developmental and mental health issues and cognitive decline.\nChicago's particle pollution is in addition to the smog, or ozone pollution, we breathe, resulting in among the worst levels of pollution in the country, the American Lung Association said last month.\nCritics have said EPA standards and methodology for collecting particle pollution data are flawed. The large spaces between sensors \u2014 there are just a dozen official sensors in Cook County \u2014 provide limited data. The agency also uses computer modeling to assess pollution levels in the city where there are no sensors.\n\"If you rely on EPA monitors, you will miss quite a few hotspots,\" said Yang Liu, department chair of Environment Health at Emory University.\nThe more sensors, the better\nIn a statement, the EPA said the Microsoft and other lower-grade monitors give a wider picture of air-quality in the area although they don't meet \"stringent regulatory criteria.\"\nChicago officials say they want to increase the number of air monitors in the city as part of a wider environmental impact study.\n\"The goal ultimately is to get more real-time, more hyperlocal data to help us make decisions,\" said Megan Cunningham, managing deputy commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health.\nThe city also is studying seven Southwest industrial corridors and the impact of truck traffic on safety and air pollution. While city economic development officials have promoted growth of transportation, distribution and logistics facilities in the area, the study is intended to address community concerns.\nTraffic is a known \"source of air pollution in Chicago,\" the city health department said in a statement. \"We are doing our part to provide guidance and health-based recommendations to other departments.\"\n\"People who live or work in urban areas ... have health issues\"\nEven though the sensors were largely on bus stops, pollution from a CTA bus alone isn't enough to cause the higher readings in the hotspots around the city. Microsoft said it placed the sensors in certain areas to account for both population and traffic.\nStill, heavy traffic is a potential source for the high readings in Avondale, where the sensor is located directly above the Kennedy Expressway on Addison Street, and in Irving Park, where the sensor is just west on a busy stretch of Irving Park Road. On average, more than 190,000 cars and trucks a day clog the expressway as it runs through the area.\nThe intersection of 87th and Halsted is heavily traveled with tens of thousands of cars, trucks and other vehicles driving through daily. The intersection is near two school bus depots where older, diesel-fuel vehicles contribute to air pollution. It's also near a Metra train station.\nFarther north at 74th and Halsted, there is less traffic but there are railroad tracks for freight trains nearby. That sensor was particularly high for the last two weeks of July and the first week of August.\nIn Austin, an air sensor on the bus shelter at West Chicago and North Cicero avenues is exposed to heavy traffic at the intersection of two major streets. Cicero is also U.S. Highway 50. The area is surrounded by light industry and a large construction project nearby.\nOnce a thriving community, the stretch of busy roads lacks trees and greenspace.\n\"Most people think those kind of [pollution] issues left when the vast majority of industry left,\" said the Rev. Joseph Kyles, who has been pastor at The Promise Church of Chicago for 17 years.\nKyles, who grew up in Austin but now lives in Oak Park, didn't know there was an air monitor at the bus shelter outside the church's front door. He wasn't surprised Austin ranked among the most polluted spots in the city.\n\"It's a known problem,\" said the 61-year-old Kyles, who had a double-lung transplant six years ago. \"People who live or work in urban areas are going to have health issues.\"\nStill, he notes that with the economic and social challenges and a lack of adequate health care in the Austin community, \"It's just one more thing.\"\nThough the sensors were placed within city limits, they could reveal implications for surrounding suburbs, towns and villages.\nOne example is Cicero, where more than 90% of the population is Hispanic and the air is impacted by similar industrial and diesel pollution to neighboring Little Village. Microsoft did not install any sensors in Cicero, but there are several on 26th Street just east of Cicero Avenue, which separates Cicero and Little Village, and several above Cicero in Austin on Laramie and Central avenues. Using surrounding sensors like these, the newsrooms' analysis suggests that high concentrations of particulate matter in Little Village are similarly high in Cicero.\nBack in Little Village, Morales says no one is listening to them. She's been organizing for decades to improve air quality.\n\"It feels like they don't care about our community even though we are homeowners and pay taxes,\" she said.\nMorales, who co-founded the community organization \u00danete La Villita, told neighbors last month during a vigil near the site of the botched implosion that it's important to transform outrage and frustration into activism.\n\"That anger is the fuel keeping some of us in the struggle,\" Morales said. \"It keeps us fighting for justice, accountability. We wanted and want a fair transition plan from the coal plant the community fought years to close down.\"\nOther community organizers agree it's beyond time for government officials to act.\nTiffany Werner, a community science organizer with the Environmental Law and Policy Center who has been a liaison between Microsoft and local community groups, urged the city to begin crafting policy changes, such as limiting the number of new warehouse facilities in a given area.\nThey say while the new data isn't perfect, there is no need to wait for additional studies about the city's hotspots.\n\"The information is already out there,\" said Alfredo Romo, executive director of the McKinley Park group Neighbors for Environmental Justice. \"It has gotten to the point \u2014 what is the city going to do with that information?\"\nIndi Khera of WBEZ and April Alonso and Irene Romulo of the Cicero Independiente contributed reporting.\nDillon Bergin and Smarth Gupta are reporters for MuckRock, a nonprofit collaborative newsroom that works on editorial projects with partners, and brings together journalists, researchers and the public on its news platform. Support for this project also came from Columbia University's Brown Institute for Media Innovation, which provides grants to encourage and support new technological endeavors in media.\nMar\u00eda In\u00e9s Zamudio is a reporter for WBEZ's Race, Class and Communities desk.

The new Microsoft data goes a step further.\nBetween April and July 2021, 115 sensors were installed across Chicago.\nThe first sensors were placed at EPA regulatory stations in May. An additional 100 sensors were installed in July, 80 of which were placed atop city bus shelters based on a random sampling of Chicago-area traffic and density data.\nTwenty sensors were placed in coordination with environmental justice groups. Microsoft is partnered with the Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago, which assembled a group of community organizations to weigh in on some sensor locations including Blacks In Green in West Woodlawn, BUILD Inc. in Austin representing the border West Side, Neighbors for Environmental Justice in McKinley Park, Latinos Progresando in Marshall Square and the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization.\nMicrosoft's leaf-shaped air quality sensors are solar-powered, cellular-connected devices that collect readings on fine particulate matter, PM2.5, humidity and barometric pressure.\nThey have air vents on the top and bottom and feed data using a connection to a Microsoft cloud service into a real-time website maintained by the tech company. The devices collect data on particulate matter using a Sensirion SPS30 sensor, which is among the best performing low-cost air quality sensors in lab and field tests.\nBut there are limitations.\nThe difference in data quality between the low-cost Microsoft sensors and regulatory-grade EPA monitors is large, said Zac Adelman, executive director of the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium. Microsoft's calibrated +/- 29% error rate is below the EPA Air Sensor guidebook's recommended threshold of +/- 30% but the large error rate of the raw particulate matter readings makes them difficult to rely on for hourly or daily figures by sensor.\nAnd there have been a handful of problems during the study: Some devices weren't able to get the cellular signal they needed. In the winter, devices \u2014 particularly those near tall buildings that block out sunlight \u2014 went into hibernation mode, resulting in lost data. In one instance, a sensor was stolen. One of the bus shelters where a sensor was located was destroyed in a car accident.\nThe temperature readings from the devices are largely inaccurate as the sensors overheated during hot days. The gaseous readings still need calibration before they can be used for analysis and thus were not released with the rest of the data.\nBut when the particulate matter readings are \"calibrated\" \u2014 compared to other sensors in the same network and EPA monitors for consistency \u2014 and compared to each other, they are revealing.\n\"What low-cost sensors tend to be good for is looking at patterns across time. Maybe the exact number isn't right, but you're seeing spikes or dips in the readings across time, or areas of higher or lower concentrations across an urban area \u2014 that's what I think we're seeing is really interesting with these sensors,\" Adelman said.\nThe sensors can also be used to fill in gaps where there aren't high quality expensive sensors, to identify spikes and hotspots, and to empower people with concerns about the air pollution in their neighborhoods, experts say. Microsoft said it is also working to create \"a suite of analytics \u2014 including anomaly detection methods \u2014 to better enable broader accessibility to the data.\"\nWhat we did to analyze Microsoft's air quality data\nMicrosoft gave us access to its Eclipse sensor data through the project's Application Programming Interface, or API. The API acts as a pipeline to the 115 sensors around Chicago and the information those sensors have recorded for 10 months \u2014 every five minutes, every hour of the day.\nIf all this data were placed into one spreadsheet, it would be more than 8 million rows.\nBecause of the massive amount of data, and the details in each reading, MuckRock and Columbia University's Brown Institute for Media Innovation, WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times aimed not to answer all questions at once, but one critical question first:\nIn each month since the sensors have been installed, what areas of Chicago have been PM2.5 pollution hotspots?\nTo do this, reporters stored the dataset in our own database, and then averaged sensor readings by hour, day and month. At each aggregation step, a so-called \"data completion criteria\" was applied to match the data quality standards laid out by the EPA for Hotspot Identification and Characterization. Any sensor's aggregated reading which had a sampling rate of less than 75% in the defined aggregation period was excluded. We also looked for hyperlocal correlations of these sensors and removed any sensor that had anomalous readings.\nAt this point, the collected readings still only showed the amount of PM2.5 recorded at each individual sensor.\nTo estimate how the reading of an individual sensor might explain pollution in specific neighborhoods, census tracts or community areas, reporters used a mathematical formula called Inverse Distance Weighting, or IDW. This is a popular interpolation technique, which makes use of the readings from all sensors at a given time, and uses those readings, based on the sensor's distance, to estimate the level of PM2.5 pollution in regions between sensors.\nThe reporters used this technique to estimate air quality levels at more than 50,000 uniformly distributed geocoordinates in the entire Chicago region and then generated tract level aggregated estimates. These estimates were then normalized based on the average estimated air quality in Chicago.\nWhile IDW is a popular approach for modeling the spread of pollution in neighborhoods, estimates are not as accurate in regions with few nearby sensors. Microsoft's research team also cautioned that interpolations outside the edges of the sample, like those in Cicero, will be more uncertain because the network was designed for the city of Chicago.\nEarlier this month, a project called ChiVes, housed at the Healthy Regions and Policies Lab at the University of Chicago, began visualizing weekly readings by sensor, census tract, and time of week. ChiVes has also collected dozens of sources to help scientists and community members explore environmental metrics alongside demographic, health and ecological data.\n\u00a9 2024 WBEZ\nQuestions or comments about the story?\n\nWBEZ values your feedback.\n        \nMore Local Stories From WBEZ\n\n                Johnny Pippins has earned bachelor's and master's degrees behind bars.

Mitigation strategies are, therefore, needed to reduce urban heat, particularly against a background of urbanization, anthropogenic warming and increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves. In this Review, we evaluate the potential of green infrastructure as a mitigation strategy, focusing on greenery on the ground (parks) and greenery on buildings (green roofs and green walls). Green infrastructure acts to cool the urban environment through shade provision and evapotranspiration. Typically, greenery on the ground reduces peak surface temperature by 2\u20139\u2009\u00b0C, while green roofs and green walls reduce surface temperature by ~17\u2009\u00b0C, also providing added thermal insulation for the building envelope. However, the cooling potential varies markedly, depending on the scale of interest (city or building level), greenery extent (park shape and size), plant selection and plant placement. Urban planners must, therefore, optimize design to maximize mitigation benefits, for example, by interspersing parks throughout a city, allocating more trees than lawn space and using multiple strategies in areas where most cooling is required. To do so, improved translation of scientific understanding to practical design guidelines is needed.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nRelevant articles\nOpen Access articles citing this article.\nImproved human greenspace exposure equality during 21st century urbanization\nNature Communications\nOpen Access\n13 October 2023\nSpatial\u2013temporal variation and temperature effect of urbanization in Guangdong Province from 1951 to 2018\nEnvironment, Development and Sustainability\nOpen Access\n27 March 2023\nNumerical evaluation of enhanced green infrastructures for mitigating urban heat in a desert urban setting\nBuilding Simulation\nOpen Access\n10 October 2022\nAccess options\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n$29.99 /\u00a030\u00a0days\ncancel any time\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 digital issues and online access to articles\n$99.00 per year\nonly $8.25 per issue\nRent or buy this article\nPrices vary by article type\nfrom$1.95\nto$39.95\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nReferences\nAkbari, H. & Kolokotsa, D.

    "Summarized_Document1": "The air quality index (AQI) in Los Angeles from March 2024 to September 2024 showed significant fluctuations. The AQI values were recorded as follows: 92, 77, 74, 73, 71, 71, 70, 69, 69, and 68 at different times. On September 23, 2024, the AQI was 63, indicating moderate air quality. The PM2.5 concentration was 3.1 times the WHO annual air quality guideline value. The forecast for the upcoming days showed moderate AQI values ranging from 53 to 64, with occasional good AQI values of 37 and 25. The data was contributed by 125 contributors operating 269 stations, including government, non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and individual contributors. The air quality in Los Angeles was monitored and reported in real-time, providing critical information to help reduce exposure to air pollution.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "When Irma Morales moved to Little Village nearly three decades ago, she noticed a thin layer of dust from a nearby coal plant. Morales joined a 12-year effort to close the Crawford Power Plant, which was replaced by a Target warehouse, bringing hundreds of diesel trucks daily. The neighborhood faced pollution from the building process, including a botched implosion in April 2020. A survey found Little Village, Austin, Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Irving Park, and Avondale had the highest pollution levels in Chicago. Microsoft installed 115 air sensors, collecting data every five minutes over 10 months, revealing high levels of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) in these areas. PM2.5 can cause serious health issues, including heart and lung disease. The worst pollution times were during rush hours and holidays, with July 23, 2021, being notably bad due to wildfire smoke and high temperatures. Despite improvements in air quality over 20 years, Chicago's levels still pose health risks. The EPA's standards are criticized for being too high, and more sensors are needed for accurate data. The city plans to increase air monitors and study the impact of truck traffic. Heavy traffic and industrial areas contribute to high pollution levels, affecting residents' health. Microsoft\u2019s sensors, though less precise than EPA monitors, provide valuable data on pollution patterns. The data helps identify hotspots and informs community activism for better air quality policies.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "The absence of vegetation in urban areas contributes to the urban heat island effect, increasing thermal stress for residents and driving morbidity and mortality. Mitigation strategies are needed to reduce urban heat, especially with increasing urbanization, anthropogenic warming, and more frequent heatwaves. Green infrastructure, such as parks, green roofs, and green walls, can cool urban environments through shade and evapotranspiration. Ground-level greenery typically reduces peak surface temperatures by 2\u20139\u00b0C, while green roofs and walls can reduce surface temperatures by ~17\u00b0C and provide thermal insulation for buildings. The cooling potential varies based on city or building level, park shape and size, plant selection, and placement. Urban planners should optimize designs by interspersing parks, allocating more trees than lawn space, and using multiple strategies where cooling is most needed. Improved translation of scientific understanding to practical design guidelines is essential. Key references include studies on urban heat islands, mitigation technologies, and the impact of green spaces on urban temperatures.",

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website.

Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

The higher the rate, the more it costs for a buyer to buy. When interest rates rise, it has the same effect as a seller raising his price and fewer homes sell because mortgage payments are higher.

    "Document1": "\n\nArticles\n\n\nApril 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\nAccording to the Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the small but meaningful affordability gains seen since the start of the year were eclipsed by a renewed rise in mortgage rates, fueled by stronger-than-expected inflation and employment readings in March and April.\u00a0\nWhile the nation\u2019s median list price did not increase compared with last year due to an influx of more affordable and smaller homes, the typical home\u2019s price per square foot continued to grow, and, driven by rising rates, the cost to purchase a home once again outpaced wage growth after just a one-month reprieve in March.\nMeanwhile, sellers continued to list homes at a greater rate than last year. This has led to a promising increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. In response, the time a typical home spends on the market continues to be below pre-pandemic levels\u2014but the gap is shrinking. Sellers are also continuing to adjust to market conditions, with price reductions remaining above the previous year\u2019s levels.\u00a0\nHome listing availability continues to improve in April\nThere were 30.4% more homes actively for sale on a typical day in April compared with the same time in 2023, marking the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth.\nFor the first four months of this year, the inventory of homes actively for sale was at its highest level since 2020. However, while inventory this April is much improved compared with the previous three years, it is still down 35.9% compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. This is a slight improvement compared with last month\u2019s 37.9% gap, as inventory continues to slowly improve toward normalcy.\n\nIn April, as in the previous two months, the growth in homes particularly priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range outpaced all other price categories, as home inventory in this range grew by 41.0% compared with last year, surpassing even last month\u2019s high 30.5% growth rate. As we show in the next section, this increase is primarily fueled by a greater availability of smaller and more affordable homes in the South.\nThe total number of homes for sale, including homes that were under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared with last year, growing on an annual basis for the fifth month in a row after ending a seven-month streak of annual total listing declines.\u00a0\n\nThe number of homes under contract but not yet sold (pending listings) increased by 6.3%, which is similar to last month\u2019s 6.2% growth rate. After reports of unexpectedly persistent inflation, mortgage rates increased in April on expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely push back its first cut to the primary policy rate, which was originally expected in June of this year.\nNext month, we may see the growth in pending listings slow, and as pending home sales are an early indicator of the direction of existing-home sales, it is possible that sales may decelerate further in April and May, after dipping 4.3% in March.\n\nHowever, providing a boost to overall inventory, which has been a drag on sales the past couple of years, sellers turned out in higher numbers this April as newly listed homes were 12.2% above last year\u2019s levels, matching last month\u2019s growth rate. This marked the sixth month of increasing listing activity after a 17-month streak of declines. However, sellers, of whom roughly three-quarters plan to also purchase a home, have been fairly rate-sensitive over this past year.\nIf mortgage rates remain elevated over the next few months, the housing market may see a return to the holding pattern of scarce inventory, as we\u2019ve seen over the past few years. For buyers, that could mean fewer opportunities for finding their ideal home as summer approaches.\u00a0\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends\nThe South leads the way in more affordable inventory growth\nThe South has been largely driving the increase in availability of homes in the $200,000 to $350,000 price range, and the increase in availability of homes overall. Home listings located in the South made up more than half (56.6%) of available inventory in April 2024, up from 52.0% last year and 47.7% in April 2019.\nIn April, all four regions saw active inventory grow over the previous year. The South saw listings grow by 43.0%, while inventory grew by 27.4% in the West, 17.6% in the Midwest, and only 4.0% in the Northeast.\nThe inventory of homes for sale increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros compared with last year. In seven large metros, inventory was above pre-pandemic levels. Metros that saw the most inventory growth included Tampa (+69.5%), Orlando (+64.2%), and Jacksonville (+59.1%). In large Florida metros, the inventory growth was primarily driven by an increase in the availability of attached homes (condos, townhomes, or row homes).\u00a0\nDespite higher inventory growth compared with last year, most metros still had a lower level of inventory compared with pre-pandemic years. Among the 50 largest metro areas, only seven saw higher levels of inventory in April compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. However, this is up from only four metros last month. The top metros that saw inventory surpass pre-pandemic levels were Austin (+28.9%), San Antonio (+27.4%), and Denver (+15.2%).\nThe South saw newly listed homes increase the most compared with last year\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South, by 19.7%, whereas new inventory grew by 18.4% in the West, 7.5% in the Midwest, and 2.9% in the Northeast.\nIn April, 48 of the 50 largest metros saw new listings increase over the previous year, but only three saw more newly listed homes than the typical April from 2017 to 2019. The metros that saw the largest growth in newly listed homes included Seattle (+46.5%), San Jose (+40.6%), and Austin (+36.1%), while Detroit (-3.8%) and Cincinnati (-1.6%) saw new listings decline. Only Austin (+18.8%), San Antonio (+2.6%), and Jacksonville (+1.6%) saw more new listings enter the market this April compared with typical pre-pandemic levels.\nHomes are spending slightly more time on the market compared with last year\u00a0\nThe typical home spent 47 days on the market this April, which is 1 day more than the same time last year and a week less than the average April from 2017 to 2019. April was the first month since September 2023 to see homes spend more time on the market than the previous year.\nMeanwhile, the gap between time on the market this year and typical pre-pandemic levels, while still present, is shrinking as inventory grows. The gap shrank from 12 days last month to just seven days this month.\n\nRegional and metro area time on the market trends\nThis month, not all regions saw the inventory of homes for sale spend less time on the market than last year. In the South, where the growth in home inventory has been the largest, the typical home spent two days more on the market in April compared with last year. However, in the Midwest, Northeast, and West, homes are still spending two days less on the market than last April.\nWhile all regions were still seeing time on the market below pre-pandemic levels, in the West, homes are spending only one day less on the market compared with the typical April from 2017 to 2019. Time on the market was nine days less than pre-pandemic levels in the South, 11 days less in the Midwest, and 15 days less in the Northeast.\nMeanwhile, time on the market decreased compared with last year in 26 of the 50 largest metro areas this April, down from 41 markets last month. It decreased the most in Kansas City (-15 days), Las Vegas (-11 days), and Raleigh (-10 days). Time on the market increased compared with last year in 21 of the 50 largest metros, including Hartford (+9 days), Denver (+8 days), Pittsburgh, and Phoenix (+5 days each). Ten predominantly Western markets saw homes spend more time on the market than typical 2017 to 2019 pre-pandemic timing, including Phoenix (+11 days), Seattle (+8 days), Denver, and Portland (+7 days each).\nThe median list price remained stable compared with last April, but the price per square foot continues to rise\nThe national median list price continued to increase seasonally, to $430,000 in April compared with $424,900 in March, and the median list price remained stable compared with the same time last year, when it was also $430,000.\u00a0\nCompared with last year, sellers are inching back to list more small and affordable homes, particularly in the South, and this change in the mix of available homes has kept the nation\u2019s median list price stable.\nWhile the median list price remained relatively unchanged, on an adjusted per-square-foot basis, the median list price grew by 3.8%, as homes continue to retain their value despite increased inventory compared with last year.\nMeanwhile, higher mortgage rates compared with last April still increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $148 (6.9%) compared with a year ago. This increased the required household income to purchase the median-priced home by $5,900, to $116,000, after also accounting for the cost of tax and insurance.\u00a0\nFor the past several months, growth in the monthly cost to purchase a home was slowing. However, the renewed mortgage rate growth seen in April has once again fueled an increase in the growth rate of the cost to purchase a home (+6.9% year over year). In March, average hourly earnings for private employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, grew by 4.1% annually. However, this increase is no longer outpacing the increase in the cost to purchase a home as it did last month.\n\nWhile the percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% in April of last year to 15.5% this year, the overall share of inventory is no longer historically high, as the share dipped back below pre-pandemic levels seen in 2017 and 2018 (15.8%, respectively).\nLast month we noted that sellers were adjusting to an increase in more competitive home listings. Indeed, a Realtor.com survey also showed that sellers have more realistic market expectations this year, with fewer potential sellers expecting a bidding war or sale within a week or sale above their asking price compared with last year. Yet while sellers continue to adjust expectations and are cutting prices at a greater rate than last year, when inventory levels were historically low, historical data shows that their behavior in adjusting prices is not unusual for pre-pandemic norms.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends\nIn April, listing prices remained stable on a year-over-year basis in the South (-0.1%), where competitive home inventory has grown the most, but prices continued to increase in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%) compared with the same time last year. On an adjusted per-square-foot basis, prices in all regions grew similarly, by 3.9% to 5.2%, as soft median list price growth in the South was driven by a larger inventory of affordable, smaller homes available for sale.\nThe median list price in Buffalo (+14.0%), Cleveland (+13.4%), and Rochester (+11.4%) saw the biggest increases among large metros. Meanwhile, 21 metros saw their median list price decline compared with last year, up from 18 last month. The metros included Miami (-10.7%), San Francisco (-10.7%), and Kansas City (-8.3%). However, on a price-per-square-foot basis, listing prices in Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City declined only by 6.6%, 2.8%, and 4.3%, respectively, as the mix of listing inventory consisted of smaller homes relative to the previous year.\nNotably, 34 of the 50 largest metro areas required a household income of more than $100,000 to afford the median-priced home at current interest rates, and six even required a household income of more than $200,000. Midwestern metros were commonly among the 16 remaining metro areas that required a household income of less than $100,000. The most affordable by this measure were Pittsburgh ($67,000), Detroit ($69,000), and Cleveland ($71,000). The most expensive metros were predominantly in the West, including San Jose ($361,000), Los Angeles ($298,000), and San Diego ($259,000).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that recent price and interest rate trends are affecting the income required to buy a home differently. In six markets, the median home listing price has fallen enough over the past year to offset rising mortgage rates and the income needed to buy a home has dropped. These markets were Miami (-6.2% required income year over year), San Francisco (-5.5%), Kansas City (-3.6%), Denver (-2.9%), Oklahoma City (-2.2%), and Seattle (-0.6%). In 15 markets, the median list price has declined, but rising mortgage rates have pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. These markets included San Jose (+1.1% required income year over year), Raleigh (+2.7%), and Cincinnati (+2.7%). Yet in the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates have combined to push required incomes higher, and in 14 of the 50 largest metros, the required income grew by double digits compared with last year. The top three metros that saw the required income increase the most were Buffalo (+20.0%), Cleveland (+19.3%), and Pittsburgh (+17.1%).\nThe share of price reductions was up compared with last year in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw the share of price reductions increase compared with last April, up from 34 in March. Portland saw the greatest increase (+9.7 percentage points), followed by Tampa (+8.8 percentage points) and Jacksonville (+7.3 percentage points).\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics vs. Pre-Pandemic 2017\u201319\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Housing Overview of the 50 Largest Metros\u00a0\n* The required income to purchase a home, assuming an affordability price-to-income ratio of 30%, a 20% down payment, a 30-year term, a 30-year fixed mortgage rate, and local tax and insurance rates\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMethodology\nRealtor.com housing data as of April 2024.

The higher the rate, the more it costs for a buyer to buy. When interest rates rise, it has the same effect as a seller raising his price and fewer homes sell because mortgage payments are higher.

    "Summarized_Document1": "April 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\n\nAccording to Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the affordability gains seen earlier in the year were overshadowed by rising mortgage rates due to stronger-than-expected inflation and employment figures in March and April. The national median list price remained stable compared to last year, but the price per square foot continued to grow. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate than last year, leading to an increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. The time a typical home spends on the market is still below pre-pandemic levels, but the gap is shrinking.\n\nHome listing availability improved in April, with 30.4% more homes actively for sale compared to April 2023. This marked the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth. Inventory in April was at its highest level since 2020 but still down 35.9% compared to 2017-2019 levels. Homes priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range saw the most significant growth, with inventory in this range increasing by 41.0% compared to last year. The total number of homes for sale, including those under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared to last year.\n\nPending listings increased by 6.3%, similar to last month's 6.2% growth rate. Mortgage rates increased in April, likely delaying the Federal Reserve's first policy rate cut. This may slow the growth in pending listings and existing-home sales in the coming months. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate, with newly listed homes 12.2% above last year's levels, marking the sixth month of increasing listing activity.\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends showed the South leading in affordable inventory growth, with listings growing by 43.0%. The West saw a 27.4% increase, the Midwest 17.6%, and the Northeast 4.0%. Inventory increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros, with Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville seeing the most growth. Despite higher inventory growth, most metros still had lower inventory levels compared to pre-pandemic years.\n\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South by 19.7%, followed by the West (18.4%), Midwest (7.5%), and Northeast (2.9%). Seattle, San Jose, and Austin saw the largest growth in newly listed homes. Homes spent slightly more time on the market compared to last year, with the typical home spending 47 days on the market in April, one day more than last year.\n\nThe national median list price remained stable at $430,000, the same as last year. However, the price per square foot grew by 3.8%. Higher mortgage rates increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by $148 (6.9%) compared to last year, raising the required household income to $116,000. The percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% last year to 15.5% this year.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends showed stable listing prices in the South (-0.1%) but increases in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%). Buffalo, Cleveland, and Rochester saw the biggest increases in median list prices, while Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City saw declines. The required household income to afford the median-priced home exceeded $100,000 in 34 of the 50 largest metro areas, with the most expensive metros in the West.\n\nRecent price and interest rate trends affected the income required to buy a home differently across markets. In six markets, the median home listing price fell enough to offset rising mortgage rates, reducing the required income. In 15 markets, rising mortgage rates pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. In the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates combined to push required incomes higher, with 14 metros seeing double-digit increases in required income compared to last year.\n\nThe share of price reductions increased in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw an increase in price reductions compared to last April, with Portland, Tampa, and Jacksonville seeing the greatest increases.",

This has led to a promising increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. In response, the time a typical home spends on the market continues to be below pre-pandemic levels\u2014but the gap is shrinking. Sellers are also continuing to adjust to market conditions, with price reductions remaining above the previous year\u2019s levels.\u00a0\nHome listing availability continues to improve in April\nThere were 30.4% more homes actively for sale on a typical day in April compared with the same time in 2023, marking the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth.\nFor the first four months of this year, the inventory of homes actively for sale was at its highest level since 2020. However, while inventory this April is much improved compared with the previous three years, it is still down 35.9% compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. This is a slight improvement compared with last month\u2019s 37.9% gap, as inventory continues to slowly improve toward normalcy.\n\nIn April, as in the previous two months, the growth in homes particularly priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range outpaced all other price categories, as home inventory in this range grew by 41.0% compared with last year, surpassing even last month\u2019s high 30.5% growth rate. As we show in the next section, this increase is primarily fueled by a greater availability of smaller and more affordable homes in the South.\nThe total number of homes for sale, including homes that were under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared with last year, growing on an annual basis for the fifth month in a row after ending a seven-month streak of annual total listing declines.\u00a0\n\nThe number of homes under contract but not yet sold (pending listings) increased by 6.3%, which is similar to last month\u2019s 6.2% growth rate. After reports of unexpectedly persistent inflation, mortgage rates increased in April on expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely push back its first cut to the primary policy rate, which was originally expected in June of this year.\nNext month, we may see the growth in pending listings slow, and as pending home sales are an early indicator of the direction of existing-home sales, it is possible that sales may decelerate further in April and May, after dipping 4.3% in March.\n\nHowever, providing a boost to overall inventory, which has been a drag on sales the past couple of years, sellers turned out in higher numbers this April as newly listed homes were 12.2% above last year\u2019s levels, matching last month\u2019s growth rate. This marked the sixth month of increasing listing activity after a 17-month streak of declines. However, sellers, of whom roughly three-quarters plan to also purchase a home, have been fairly rate-sensitive over this past year.\nIf mortgage rates remain elevated over the next few months, the housing market may see a return to the holding pattern of scarce inventory, as we\u2019ve seen over the past few years. For buyers, that could mean fewer opportunities for finding their ideal home as summer approaches.\u00a0\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends\nThe South leads the way in more affordable inventory growth\nThe South has been largely driving the increase in availability of homes in the $200,000 to $350,000 price range, and the increase in availability of homes overall. Home listings located in the South made up more than half (56.6%) of available inventory in April 2024, up from 52.0% last year and 47.7% in April 2019.\nIn April, all four regions saw active inventory grow over the previous year. The South saw listings grow by 43.0%, while inventory grew by 27.4% in the West, 17.6% in the Midwest, and only 4.0% in the Northeast.\nThe inventory of homes for sale increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros compared with last year. In seven large metros, inventory was above pre-pandemic levels. Metros that saw the most inventory growth included Tampa (+69.5%), Orlando (+64.2%), and Jacksonville (+59.1%). In large Florida metros, the inventory growth was primarily driven by an increase in the availability of attached homes (condos, townhomes, or row homes).\u00a0\nDespite higher inventory growth compared with last year, most metros still had a lower level of inventory compared with pre-pandemic years. Among the 50 largest metro areas, only seven saw higher levels of inventory in April compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. However, this is up from only four metros last month. The top metros that saw inventory surpass pre-pandemic levels were Austin (+28.9%), San Antonio (+27.4%), and Denver (+15.2%).\nThe South saw newly listed homes increase the most compared with last year\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South, by 19.7%, whereas new inventory grew by 18.4% in the West, 7.5% in the Midwest, and 2.9% in the Northeast.\nIn April, 48 of the 50 largest metros saw new listings increase over the previous year, but only three saw more newly listed homes than the typical April from 2017 to 2019. The metros that saw the largest growth in newly listed homes included Seattle (+46.5%), San Jose (+40.6%), and Austin (+36.1%), while Detroit (-3.8%) and Cincinnati (-1.6%) saw new listings decline. Only Austin (+18.8%), San Antonio (+2.6%), and Jacksonville (+1.6%) saw more new listings enter the market this April compared with typical pre-pandemic levels.\nHomes are spending slightly more time on the market compared with last year\u00a0\nThe typical home spent 47 days on the market this April, which is 1 day more than the same time last year and a week less than the average April from 2017 to 2019. April was the first month since September 2023 to see homes spend more time on the market than the previous year.\nMeanwhile, the gap between time on the market this year and typical pre-pandemic levels, while still present, is shrinking as inventory grows. The gap shrank from 12 days last month to just seven days this month.\n\nRegional and metro area time on the market trends\nThis month, not all regions saw the inventory of homes for sale spend less time on the market than last year. In the South, where the growth in home inventory has been the largest, the typical home spent two days more on the market in April compared with last year. However, in the Midwest, Northeast, and West, homes are still spending two days less on the market than last April.\nWhile all regions were still seeing time on the market below pre-pandemic levels, in the West, homes are spending only one day less on the market compared with the typical April from 2017 to 2019. Time on the market was nine days less than pre-pandemic levels in the South, 11 days less in the Midwest, and 15 days less in the Northeast.\nMeanwhile, time on the market decreased compared with last year in 26 of the 50 largest metro areas this April, down from 41 markets last month. It decreased the most in Kansas City (-15 days), Las Vegas (-11 days), and Raleigh (-10 days). Time on the market increased compared with last year in 21 of the 50 largest metros, including Hartford (+9 days), Denver (+8 days), Pittsburgh, and Phoenix (+5 days each). Ten predominantly Western markets saw homes spend more time on the market than typical 2017 to 2019 pre-pandemic timing, including Phoenix (+11 days), Seattle (+8 days), Denver, and Portland (+7 days each).\nThe median list price remained stable compared with last April, but the price per square foot continues to rise\nThe national median list price continued to increase seasonally, to $430,000 in April compared with $424,900 in March, and the median list price remained stable compared with the same time last year, when it was also $430,000.\u00a0\nCompared with last year, sellers are inching back to list more small and affordable homes, particularly in the South, and this change in the mix of available homes has kept the nation\u2019s median list price stable.\nWhile the median list price remained relatively unchanged, on an adjusted per-square-foot basis, the median list price grew by 3.8%, as homes continue to retain their value despite increased inventory compared with last year.\nMeanwhile, higher mortgage rates compared with last April still increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $148 (6.9%) compared with a year ago. This increased the required household income to purchase the median-priced home by $5,900, to $116,000, after also accounting for the cost of tax and insurance.\u00a0\nFor the past several months, growth in the monthly cost to purchase a home was slowing. However, the renewed mortgage rate growth seen in April has once again fueled an increase in the growth rate of the cost to purchase a home (+6.9% year over year). In March, average hourly earnings for private employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, grew by 4.1% annually. However, this increase is no longer outpacing the increase in the cost to purchase a home as it did last month.\n\nWhile the percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% in April of last year to 15.5% this year, the overall share of inventory is no longer historically high, as the share dipped back below pre-pandemic levels seen in 2017 and 2018 (15.8%, respectively).\nLast month we noted that sellers were adjusting to an increase in more competitive home listings. Indeed, a Realtor.com survey also showed that sellers have more realistic market expectations this year, with fewer potential sellers expecting a bidding war or sale within a week or sale above their asking price compared with last year. Yet while sellers continue to adjust expectations and are cutting prices at a greater rate than last year, when inventory levels were historically low, historical data shows that their behavior in adjusting prices is not unusual for pre-pandemic norms.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends\nIn April, listing prices remained stable on a year-over-year basis in the South (-0.1%), where competitive home inventory has grown the most, but prices continued to increase in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%) compared with the same time last year. On an adjusted per-square-foot basis, prices in all regions grew similarly, by 3.9% to 5.2%, as soft median list price growth in the South was driven by a larger inventory of affordable, smaller homes available for sale.\nThe median list price in Buffalo (+14.0%), Cleveland (+13.4%), and Rochester (+11.4%) saw the biggest increases among large metros. Meanwhile, 21 metros saw their median list price decline compared with last year, up from 18 last month. The metros included Miami (-10.7%), San Francisco (-10.7%), and Kansas City (-8.3%). However, on a price-per-square-foot basis, listing prices in Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City declined only by 6.6%, 2.8%, and 4.3%, respectively, as the mix of listing inventory consisted of smaller homes relative to the previous year.\nNotably, 34 of the 50 largest metro areas required a household income of more than $100,000 to afford the median-priced home at current interest rates, and six even required a household income of more than $200,000. Midwestern metros were commonly among the 16 remaining metro areas that required a household income of less than $100,000. The most affordable by this measure were Pittsburgh ($67,000), Detroit ($69,000), and Cleveland ($71,000). The most expensive metros were predominantly in the West, including San Jose ($361,000), Los Angeles ($298,000), and San Diego ($259,000).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that recent price and interest rate trends are affecting the income required to buy a home differently. In six markets, the median home listing price has fallen enough over the past year to offset rising mortgage rates and the income needed to buy a home has dropped. These markets were Miami (-6.2% required income year over year), San Francisco (-5.5%), Kansas City (-3.6%), Denver (-2.9%), Oklahoma City (-2.2%), and Seattle (-0.6%). In 15 markets, the median list price has declined, but rising mortgage rates have pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. These markets included San Jose (+1.1% required income year over year), Raleigh (+2.7%), and Cincinnati (+2.7%). Yet in the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates have combined to push required incomes higher, and in 14 of the 50 largest metros, the required income grew by double digits compared with last year. The top three metros that saw the required income increase the most were Buffalo (+20.0%), Cleveland (+19.3%), and Pittsburgh (+17.1%).\nThe share of price reductions was up compared with last year in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw the share of price reductions increase compared with last April, up from 34 in March. Portland saw the greatest increase (+9.7 percentage points), followed by Tampa (+8.8 percentage points) and Jacksonville (+7.3 percentage points).\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics vs. Pre-Pandemic 2017\u201319\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Housing Overview of the 50 Largest Metros\u00a0\n* The required income to purchase a home, assuming an affordability price-to-income ratio of 30%, a 20% down payment, a 30-year term, a 30-year fixed mortgage rate, and local tax and insurance rates\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMethodology\nRealtor.com housing data as of April 2024.

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website.

Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

The higher the rate, the more it costs for a buyer to buy. When interest rates rise, it has the same effect as a seller raising his price and fewer homes sell because mortgage payments are higher.

    "Summarized_Document1": "April 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\n\nAccording to Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the affordability gains seen earlier in the year were overshadowed by rising mortgage rates due to stronger-than-expected inflation and employment figures in March and April. The national median list price remained stable compared to last year, but the price per square foot continued to grow. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate than last year, leading to an increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. The time a typical home spends on the market is still below pre-pandemic levels, but the gap is shrinking.\n\nHome listing availability improved in April, with 30.4% more homes actively for sale compared to April 2023. This marked the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth. Inventory in April was at its highest level since 2020 but still down 35.9% compared to 2017-2019 levels. Homes priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range saw the most significant growth, with inventory in this range increasing by 41.0% compared to last year. The total number of homes for sale, including those under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared to last year.\n\nPending listings increased by 6.3%, similar to last month's 6.2% growth rate. Mortgage rates increased in April, likely delaying the Federal Reserve's first policy rate cut. This may slow the growth in pending listings and existing-home sales in the coming months. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate, with newly listed homes 12.2% above last year's levels, marking the sixth month of increasing listing activity.\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends showed the South leading in affordable inventory growth, with listings growing by 43.0%. The West saw a 27.4% increase, the Midwest 17.6%, and the Northeast 4.0%. Inventory increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros, with Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville seeing the most growth. Despite higher inventory growth, most metros still had lower inventory levels compared to pre-pandemic years.\n\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South by 19.7%, followed by the West (18.4%), Midwest (7.5%), and Northeast (2.9%). Seattle, San Jose, and Austin saw the largest growth in newly listed homes. Homes spent slightly more time on the market compared to last year, with the typical home spending 47 days on the market in April, one day more than last year.\n\nThe national median list price remained stable at $430,000, the same as last year. However, the price per square foot grew by 3.8%. Higher mortgage rates increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by $148 (6.9%) compared to last year, raising the required household income to $116,000. The percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% last year to 15.5% this year.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends showed stable listing prices in the South (-0.1%) but increases in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%). Buffalo, Cleveland, and Rochester saw the biggest increases in median list prices, while Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City saw declines. The required household income to afford the median-priced home exceeded $100,000 in 34 of the 50 largest metro areas, with the most expensive metros in the West.\n\nRecent price and interest rate trends affected the income required to buy a home differently across markets. In six markets, the median home listing price fell enough to offset rising mortgage rates, reducing the required income. In 15 markets, rising mortgage rates pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. In the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates combined to push required incomes higher, with 14 metros seeing double-digit increases in required income compared to last year.\n\nThe share of price reductions increased in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw an increase in price reductions compared to last April, with Portland, Tampa, and Jacksonville seeing the greatest increases.",

    "Document1": "\n\nArticles\n\n\nApril 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\nAccording to the Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the small but meaningful affordability gains seen since the start of the year were eclipsed by a renewed rise in mortgage rates, fueled by stronger-than-expected inflation and employment readings in March and April.\u00a0\nWhile the nation\u2019s median list price did not increase compared with last year due to an influx of more affordable and smaller homes, the typical home\u2019s price per square foot continued to grow, and, driven by rising rates, the cost to purchase a home once again outpaced wage growth after just a one-month reprieve in March.\nMeanwhile, sellers continued to list homes at a greater rate than last year. This has led to a promising increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. In response, the time a typical home spends on the market continues to be below pre-pandemic levels\u2014but the gap is shrinking. Sellers are also continuing to adjust to market conditions, with price reductions remaining above the previous year\u2019s levels.\u00a0\nHome listing availability continues to improve in April\nThere were 30.4% more homes actively for sale on a typical day in April compared with the same time in 2023, marking the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth.\nFor the first four months of this year, the inventory of homes actively for sale was at its highest level since 2020. However, while inventory this April is much improved compared with the previous three years, it is still down 35.9% compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. This is a slight improvement compared with last month\u2019s 37.9% gap, as inventory continues to slowly improve toward normalcy.\n\nIn April, as in the previous two months, the growth in homes particularly priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range outpaced all other price categories, as home inventory in this range grew by 41.0% compared with last year, surpassing even last month\u2019s high 30.5% growth rate. As we show in the next section, this increase is primarily fueled by a greater availability of smaller and more affordable homes in the South.\nThe total number of homes for sale, including homes that were under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared with last year, growing on an annual basis for the fifth month in a row after ending a seven-month streak of annual total listing declines.\u00a0\n\nThe number of homes under contract but not yet sold (pending listings) increased by 6.3%, which is similar to last month\u2019s 6.2% growth rate. After reports of unexpectedly persistent inflation, mortgage rates increased in April on expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely push back its first cut to the primary policy rate, which was originally expected in June of this year.\nNext month, we may see the growth in pending listings slow, and as pending home sales are an early indicator of the direction of existing-home sales, it is possible that sales may decelerate further in April and May, after dipping 4.3% in March.\n\nHowever, providing a boost to overall inventory, which has been a drag on sales the past couple of years, sellers turned out in higher numbers this April as newly listed homes were 12.2% above last year\u2019s levels, matching last month\u2019s growth rate. This marked the sixth month of increasing listing activity after a 17-month streak of declines. However, sellers, of whom roughly three-quarters plan to also purchase a home, have been fairly rate-sensitive over this past year.\nIf mortgage rates remain elevated over the next few months, the housing market may see a return to the holding pattern of scarce inventory, as we\u2019ve seen over the past few years. For buyers, that could mean fewer opportunities for finding their ideal home as summer approaches.\u00a0\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends\nThe South leads the way in more affordable inventory growth\nThe South has been largely driving the increase in availability of homes in the $200,000 to $350,000 price range, and the increase in availability of homes overall. Home listings located in the South made up more than half (56.6%) of available inventory in April 2024, up from 52.0% last year and 47.7% in April 2019.\nIn April, all four regions saw active inventory grow over the previous year. The South saw listings grow by 43.0%, while inventory grew by 27.4% in the West, 17.6% in the Midwest, and only 4.0% in the Northeast.\nThe inventory of homes for sale increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros compared with last year. In seven large metros, inventory was above pre-pandemic levels. Metros that saw the most inventory growth included Tampa (+69.5%), Orlando (+64.2%), and Jacksonville (+59.1%). In large Florida metros, the inventory growth was primarily driven by an increase in the availability of attached homes (condos, townhomes, or row homes).\u00a0\nDespite higher inventory growth compared with last year, most metros still had a lower level of inventory compared with pre-pandemic years. Among the 50 largest metro areas, only seven saw higher levels of inventory in April compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. However, this is up from only four metros last month. The top metros that saw inventory surpass pre-pandemic levels were Austin (+28.9%), San Antonio (+27.4%), and Denver (+15.2%).\nThe South saw newly listed homes increase the most compared with last year\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South, by 19.7%, whereas new inventory grew by 18.4% in the West, 7.5% in the Midwest, and 2.9% in the Northeast.\nIn April, 48 of the 50 largest metros saw new listings increase over the previous year, but only three saw more newly listed homes than the typical April from 2017 to 2019. The metros that saw the largest growth in newly listed homes included Seattle (+46.5%), San Jose (+40.6%), and Austin (+36.1%), while Detroit (-3.8%) and Cincinnati (-1.6%) saw new listings decline. Only Austin (+18.8%), San Antonio (+2.6%), and Jacksonville (+1.6%) saw more new listings enter the market this April compared with typical pre-pandemic levels.\nHomes are spending slightly more time on the market compared with last year\u00a0\nThe typical home spent 47 days on the market this April, which is 1 day more than the same time last year and a week less than the average April from 2017 to 2019. April was the first month since September 2023 to see homes spend more time on the market than the previous year.\nMeanwhile, the gap between time on the market this year and typical pre-pandemic levels, while still present, is shrinking as inventory grows. The gap shrank from 12 days last month to just seven days this month.\n\nRegional and metro area time on the market trends\nThis month, not all regions saw the inventory of homes for sale spend less time on the market than last year. In the South, where the growth in home inventory has been the largest, the typical home spent two days more on the market in April compared with last year. However, in the Midwest, Northeast, and West, homes are still spending two days less on the market than last April.\nWhile all regions were still seeing time on the market below pre-pandemic levels, in the West, homes are spending only one day less on the market compared with the typical April from 2017 to 2019. Time on the market was nine days less than pre-pandemic levels in the South, 11 days less in the Midwest, and 15 days less in the Northeast.\nMeanwhile, time on the market decreased compared with last year in 26 of the 50 largest metro areas this April, down from 41 markets last month. It decreased the most in Kansas City (-15 days), Las Vegas (-11 days), and Raleigh (-10 days). Time on the market increased compared with last year in 21 of the 50 largest metros, including Hartford (+9 days), Denver (+8 days), Pittsburgh, and Phoenix (+5 days each). Ten predominantly Western markets saw homes spend more time on the market than typical 2017 to 2019 pre-pandemic timing, including Phoenix (+11 days), Seattle (+8 days), Denver, and Portland (+7 days each).\nThe median list price remained stable compared with last April, but the price per square foot continues to rise\nThe national median list price continued to increase seasonally, to $430,000 in April compared with $424,900 in March, and the median list price remained stable compared with the same time last year, when it was also $430,000.\u00a0\nCompared with last year, sellers are inching back to list more small and affordable homes, particularly in the South, and this change in the mix of available homes has kept the nation\u2019s median list price stable.\nWhile the median list price remained relatively unchanged, on an adjusted per-square-foot basis, the median list price grew by 3.8%, as homes continue to retain their value despite increased inventory compared with last year.\nMeanwhile, higher mortgage rates compared with last April still increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $148 (6.9%) compared with a year ago. This increased the required household income to purchase the median-priced home by $5,900, to $116,000, after also accounting for the cost of tax and insurance.\u00a0\nFor the past several months, growth in the monthly cost to purchase a home was slowing. However, the renewed mortgage rate growth seen in April has once again fueled an increase in the growth rate of the cost to purchase a home (+6.9% year over year). In March, average hourly earnings for private employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, grew by 4.1% annually. However, this increase is no longer outpacing the increase in the cost to purchase a home as it did last month.\n\nWhile the percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% in April of last year to 15.5% this year, the overall share of inventory is no longer historically high, as the share dipped back below pre-pandemic levels seen in 2017 and 2018 (15.8%, respectively).\nLast month we noted that sellers were adjusting to an increase in more competitive home listings. Indeed, a Realtor.com survey also showed that sellers have more realistic market expectations this year, with fewer potential sellers expecting a bidding war or sale within a week or sale above their asking price compared with last year. Yet while sellers continue to adjust expectations and are cutting prices at a greater rate than last year, when inventory levels were historically low, historical data shows that their behavior in adjusting prices is not unusual for pre-pandemic norms.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends\nIn April, listing prices remained stable on a year-over-year basis in the South (-0.1%), where competitive home inventory has grown the most, but prices continued to increase in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%) compared with the same time last year. On an adjusted per-square-foot basis, prices in all regions grew similarly, by 3.9% to 5.2%, as soft median list price growth in the South was driven by a larger inventory of affordable, smaller homes available for sale.\nThe median list price in Buffalo (+14.0%), Cleveland (+13.4%), and Rochester (+11.4%) saw the biggest increases among large metros. Meanwhile, 21 metros saw their median list price decline compared with last year, up from 18 last month. The metros included Miami (-10.7%), San Francisco (-10.7%), and Kansas City (-8.3%). However, on a price-per-square-foot basis, listing prices in Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City declined only by 6.6%, 2.8%, and 4.3%, respectively, as the mix of listing inventory consisted of smaller homes relative to the previous year.\nNotably, 34 of the 50 largest metro areas required a household income of more than $100,000 to afford the median-priced home at current interest rates, and six even required a household income of more than $200,000. Midwestern metros were commonly among the 16 remaining metro areas that required a household income of less than $100,000. The most affordable by this measure were Pittsburgh ($67,000), Detroit ($69,000), and Cleveland ($71,000). The most expensive metros were predominantly in the West, including San Jose ($361,000), Los Angeles ($298,000), and San Diego ($259,000).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that recent price and interest rate trends are affecting the income required to buy a home differently. In six markets, the median home listing price has fallen enough over the past year to offset rising mortgage rates and the income needed to buy a home has dropped. These markets were Miami (-6.2% required income year over year), San Francisco (-5.5%), Kansas City (-3.6%), Denver (-2.9%), Oklahoma City (-2.2%), and Seattle (-0.6%). In 15 markets, the median list price has declined, but rising mortgage rates have pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. These markets included San Jose (+1.1% required income year over year), Raleigh (+2.7%), and Cincinnati (+2.7%). Yet in the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates have combined to push required incomes higher, and in 14 of the 50 largest metros, the required income grew by double digits compared with last year. The top three metros that saw the required income increase the most were Buffalo (+20.0%), Cleveland (+19.3%), and Pittsburgh (+17.1%).\nThe share of price reductions was up compared with last year in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw the share of price reductions increase compared with last April, up from 34 in March. Portland saw the greatest increase (+9.7 percentage points), followed by Tampa (+8.8 percentage points) and Jacksonville (+7.3 percentage points).\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics vs. Pre-Pandemic 2017\u201319\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Housing Overview of the 50 Largest Metros\u00a0\n* The required income to purchase a home, assuming an affordability price-to-income ratio of 30%, a 20% down payment, a 30-year term, a 30-year fixed mortgage rate, and local tax and insurance rates\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMethodology\nRealtor.com housing data as of April 2024.

    "Summarized_Document1": "April 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\n\nAccording to Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the affordability gains seen earlier in the year were overshadowed by rising mortgage rates due to stronger-than-expected inflation and employment figures in March and April. The national median list price remained stable compared to last year, but the price per square foot continued to grow. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate than last year, leading to an increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. The time a typical home spends on the market is still below pre-pandemic levels, but the gap is shrinking.\n\nHome listing availability improved in April, with 30.4% more homes actively for sale compared to April 2023. This marked the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth. Inventory in April was at its highest level since 2020 but still down 35.9% compared to 2017-2019 levels. Homes priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range saw the most significant growth, with inventory in this range increasing by 41.0% compared to last year. The total number of homes for sale, including those under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared to last year.\n\nPending listings increased by 6.3%, similar to last month's 6.2% growth rate. Mortgage rates increased in April, likely delaying the Federal Reserve's first policy rate cut. This may slow the growth in pending listings and existing-home sales in the coming months. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate, with newly listed homes 12.2% above last year's levels, marking the sixth month of increasing listing activity.\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends showed the South leading in affordable inventory growth, with listings growing by 43.0%. The West saw a 27.4% increase, the Midwest 17.6%, and the Northeast 4.0%. Inventory increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros, with Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville seeing the most growth. Despite higher inventory growth, most metros still had lower inventory levels compared to pre-pandemic years.\n\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South by 19.7%, followed by the West (18.4%), Midwest (7.5%), and Northeast (2.9%). Seattle, San Jose, and Austin saw the largest growth in newly listed homes. Homes spent slightly more time on the market compared to last year, with the typical home spending 47 days on the market in April, one day more than last year.\n\nThe national median list price remained stable at $430,000, the same as last year. However, the price per square foot grew by 3.8%. Higher mortgage rates increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by $148 (6.9%) compared to last year, raising the required household income to $116,000. The percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% last year to 15.5% this year.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends showed stable listing prices in the South (-0.1%) but increases in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%). Buffalo, Cleveland, and Rochester saw the biggest increases in median list prices, while Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City saw declines. The required household income to afford the median-priced home exceeded $100,000 in 34 of the 50 largest metro areas, with the most expensive metros in the West.\n\nRecent price and interest rate trends affected the income required to buy a home differently across markets. In six markets, the median home listing price fell enough to offset rising mortgage rates, reducing the required income. In 15 markets, rising mortgage rates pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. In the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates combined to push required incomes higher, with 14 metros seeing double-digit increases in required income compared to last year.\n\nThe share of price reductions increased in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw an increase in price reductions compared to last April, with Portland, Tampa, and Jacksonville seeing the greatest increases.",

This has led to a promising increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. In response, the time a typical home spends on the market continues to be below pre-pandemic levels\u2014but the gap is shrinking. Sellers are also continuing to adjust to market conditions, with price reductions remaining above the previous year\u2019s levels.\u00a0\nHome listing availability continues to improve in April\nThere were 30.4% more homes actively for sale on a typical day in April compared with the same time in 2023, marking the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth.\nFor the first four months of this year, the inventory of homes actively for sale was at its highest level since 2020. However, while inventory this April is much improved compared with the previous three years, it is still down 35.9% compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. This is a slight improvement compared with last month\u2019s 37.9% gap, as inventory continues to slowly improve toward normalcy.\n\nIn April, as in the previous two months, the growth in homes particularly priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range outpaced all other price categories, as home inventory in this range grew by 41.0% compared with last year, surpassing even last month\u2019s high 30.5% growth rate. As we show in the next section, this increase is primarily fueled by a greater availability of smaller and more affordable homes in the South.\nThe total number of homes for sale, including homes that were under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared with last year, growing on an annual basis for the fifth month in a row after ending a seven-month streak of annual total listing declines.\u00a0\n\nThe number of homes under contract but not yet sold (pending listings) increased by 6.3%, which is similar to last month\u2019s 6.2% growth rate. After reports of unexpectedly persistent inflation, mortgage rates increased in April on expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely push back its first cut to the primary policy rate, which was originally expected in June of this year.\nNext month, we may see the growth in pending listings slow, and as pending home sales are an early indicator of the direction of existing-home sales, it is possible that sales may decelerate further in April and May, after dipping 4.3% in March.\n\nHowever, providing a boost to overall inventory, which has been a drag on sales the past couple of years, sellers turned out in higher numbers this April as newly listed homes were 12.2% above last year\u2019s levels, matching last month\u2019s growth rate. This marked the sixth month of increasing listing activity after a 17-month streak of declines. However, sellers, of whom roughly three-quarters plan to also purchase a home, have been fairly rate-sensitive over this past year.\nIf mortgage rates remain elevated over the next few months, the housing market may see a return to the holding pattern of scarce inventory, as we\u2019ve seen over the past few years. For buyers, that could mean fewer opportunities for finding their ideal home as summer approaches.\u00a0\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends\nThe South leads the way in more affordable inventory growth\nThe South has been largely driving the increase in availability of homes in the $200,000 to $350,000 price range, and the increase in availability of homes overall. Home listings located in the South made up more than half (56.6%) of available inventory in April 2024, up from 52.0% last year and 47.7% in April 2019.\nIn April, all four regions saw active inventory grow over the previous year. The South saw listings grow by 43.0%, while inventory grew by 27.4% in the West, 17.6% in the Midwest, and only 4.0% in the Northeast.\nThe inventory of homes for sale increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros compared with last year. In seven large metros, inventory was above pre-pandemic levels. Metros that saw the most inventory growth included Tampa (+69.5%), Orlando (+64.2%), and Jacksonville (+59.1%). In large Florida metros, the inventory growth was primarily driven by an increase in the availability of attached homes (condos, townhomes, or row homes).\u00a0\nDespite higher inventory growth compared with last year, most metros still had a lower level of inventory compared with pre-pandemic years. Among the 50 largest metro areas, only seven saw higher levels of inventory in April compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. However, this is up from only four metros last month. The top metros that saw inventory surpass pre-pandemic levels were Austin (+28.9%), San Antonio (+27.4%), and Denver (+15.2%).\nThe South saw newly listed homes increase the most compared with last year\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South, by 19.7%, whereas new inventory grew by 18.4% in the West, 7.5% in the Midwest, and 2.9% in the Northeast.\nIn April, 48 of the 50 largest metros saw new listings increase over the previous year, but only three saw more newly listed homes than the typical April from 2017 to 2019. The metros that saw the largest growth in newly listed homes included Seattle (+46.5%), San Jose (+40.6%), and Austin (+36.1%), while Detroit (-3.8%) and Cincinnati (-1.6%) saw new listings decline. Only Austin (+18.8%), San Antonio (+2.6%), and Jacksonville (+1.6%) saw more new listings enter the market this April compared with typical pre-pandemic levels.\nHomes are spending slightly more time on the market compared with last year\u00a0\nThe typical home spent 47 days on the market this April, which is 1 day more than the same time last year and a week less than the average April from 2017 to 2019. April was the first month since September 2023 to see homes spend more time on the market than the previous year.\nMeanwhile, the gap between time on the market this year and typical pre-pandemic levels, while still present, is shrinking as inventory grows. The gap shrank from 12 days last month to just seven days this month.\n\nRegional and metro area time on the market trends\nThis month, not all regions saw the inventory of homes for sale spend less time on the market than last year. In the South, where the growth in home inventory has been the largest, the typical home spent two days more on the market in April compared with last year. However, in the Midwest, Northeast, and West, homes are still spending two days less on the market than last April.\nWhile all regions were still seeing time on the market below pre-pandemic levels, in the West, homes are spending only one day less on the market compared with the typical April from 2017 to 2019. Time on the market was nine days less than pre-pandemic levels in the South, 11 days less in the Midwest, and 15 days less in the Northeast.\nMeanwhile, time on the market decreased compared with last year in 26 of the 50 largest metro areas this April, down from 41 markets last month. It decreased the most in Kansas City (-15 days), Las Vegas (-11 days), and Raleigh (-10 days). Time on the market increased compared with last year in 21 of the 50 largest metros, including Hartford (+9 days), Denver (+8 days), Pittsburgh, and Phoenix (+5 days each). Ten predominantly Western markets saw homes spend more time on the market than typical 2017 to 2019 pre-pandemic timing, including Phoenix (+11 days), Seattle (+8 days), Denver, and Portland (+7 days each).\nThe median list price remained stable compared with last April, but the price per square foot continues to rise\nThe national median list price continued to increase seasonally, to $430,000 in April compared with $424,900 in March, and the median list price remained stable compared with the same time last year, when it was also $430,000.\u00a0\nCompared with last year, sellers are inching back to list more small and affordable homes, particularly in the South, and this change in the mix of available homes has kept the nation\u2019s median list price stable.\nWhile the median list price remained relatively unchanged, on an adjusted per-square-foot basis, the median list price grew by 3.8%, as homes continue to retain their value despite increased inventory compared with last year.\nMeanwhile, higher mortgage rates compared with last April still increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $148 (6.9%) compared with a year ago. This increased the required household income to purchase the median-priced home by $5,900, to $116,000, after also accounting for the cost of tax and insurance.\u00a0\nFor the past several months, growth in the monthly cost to purchase a home was slowing. However, the renewed mortgage rate growth seen in April has once again fueled an increase in the growth rate of the cost to purchase a home (+6.9% year over year). In March, average hourly earnings for private employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, grew by 4.1% annually. However, this increase is no longer outpacing the increase in the cost to purchase a home as it did last month.\n\nWhile the percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% in April of last year to 15.5% this year, the overall share of inventory is no longer historically high, as the share dipped back below pre-pandemic levels seen in 2017 and 2018 (15.8%, respectively).\nLast month we noted that sellers were adjusting to an increase in more competitive home listings. Indeed, a Realtor.com survey also showed that sellers have more realistic market expectations this year, with fewer potential sellers expecting a bidding war or sale within a week or sale above their asking price compared with last year. Yet while sellers continue to adjust expectations and are cutting prices at a greater rate than last year, when inventory levels were historically low, historical data shows that their behavior in adjusting prices is not unusual for pre-pandemic norms.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends\nIn April, listing prices remained stable on a year-over-year basis in the South (-0.1%), where competitive home inventory has grown the most, but prices continued to increase in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%) compared with the same time last year. On an adjusted per-square-foot basis, prices in all regions grew similarly, by 3.9% to 5.2%, as soft median list price growth in the South was driven by a larger inventory of affordable, smaller homes available for sale.\nThe median list price in Buffalo (+14.0%), Cleveland (+13.4%), and Rochester (+11.4%) saw the biggest increases among large metros. Meanwhile, 21 metros saw their median list price decline compared with last year, up from 18 last month. The metros included Miami (-10.7%), San Francisco (-10.7%), and Kansas City (-8.3%). However, on a price-per-square-foot basis, listing prices in Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City declined only by 6.6%, 2.8%, and 4.3%, respectively, as the mix of listing inventory consisted of smaller homes relative to the previous year.\nNotably, 34 of the 50 largest metro areas required a household income of more than $100,000 to afford the median-priced home at current interest rates, and six even required a household income of more than $200,000. Midwestern metros were commonly among the 16 remaining metro areas that required a household income of less than $100,000. The most affordable by this measure were Pittsburgh ($67,000), Detroit ($69,000), and Cleveland ($71,000). The most expensive metros were predominantly in the West, including San Jose ($361,000), Los Angeles ($298,000), and San Diego ($259,000).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that recent price and interest rate trends are affecting the income required to buy a home differently. In six markets, the median home listing price has fallen enough over the past year to offset rising mortgage rates and the income needed to buy a home has dropped. These markets were Miami (-6.2% required income year over year), San Francisco (-5.5%), Kansas City (-3.6%), Denver (-2.9%), Oklahoma City (-2.2%), and Seattle (-0.6%). In 15 markets, the median list price has declined, but rising mortgage rates have pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. These markets included San Jose (+1.1% required income year over year), Raleigh (+2.7%), and Cincinnati (+2.7%). Yet in the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates have combined to push required incomes higher, and in 14 of the 50 largest metros, the required income grew by double digits compared with last year. The top three metros that saw the required income increase the most were Buffalo (+20.0%), Cleveland (+19.3%), and Pittsburgh (+17.1%).\nThe share of price reductions was up compared with last year in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw the share of price reductions increase compared with last April, up from 34 in March. Portland saw the greatest increase (+9.7 percentage points), followed by Tampa (+8.8 percentage points) and Jacksonville (+7.3 percentage points).\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics vs. Pre-Pandemic 2017\u201319\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Housing Overview of the 50 Largest Metros\u00a0\n* The required income to purchase a home, assuming an affordability price-to-income ratio of 30%, a 20% down payment, a 30-year term, a 30-year fixed mortgage rate, and local tax and insurance rates\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMethodology\nRealtor.com housing data as of April 2024.

The higher the rate, the more it costs for a buyer to buy. When interest rates rise, it has the same effect as a seller raising his price and fewer homes sell because mortgage payments are higher.

    "Summarized_Document1": "April 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\n\nAccording to Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the affordability gains seen earlier in the year were overshadowed by rising mortgage rates due to stronger-than-expected inflation and employment figures in March and April. The national median list price remained stable compared to last year, but the price per square foot continued to grow. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate than last year, leading to an increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. The time a typical home spends on the market is still below pre-pandemic levels, but the gap is shrinking.\n\nHome listing availability improved in April, with 30.4% more homes actively for sale compared to April 2023. This marked the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth. Inventory in April was at its highest level since 2020 but still down 35.9% compared to 2017-2019 levels. Homes priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range saw the most significant growth, with inventory in this range increasing by 41.0% compared to last year. The total number of homes for sale, including those under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared to last year.\n\nPending listings increased by 6.3%, similar to last month's 6.2% growth rate. Mortgage rates increased in April, likely delaying the Federal Reserve's first policy rate cut. This may slow the growth in pending listings and existing-home sales in the coming months. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate, with newly listed homes 12.2% above last year's levels, marking the sixth month of increasing listing activity.\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends showed the South leading in affordable inventory growth, with listings growing by 43.0%. The West saw a 27.4% increase, the Midwest 17.6%, and the Northeast 4.0%. Inventory increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros, with Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville seeing the most growth. Despite higher inventory growth, most metros still had lower inventory levels compared to pre-pandemic years.\n\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South by 19.7%, followed by the West (18.4%), Midwest (7.5%), and Northeast (2.9%). Seattle, San Jose, and Austin saw the largest growth in newly listed homes. Homes spent slightly more time on the market compared to last year, with the typical home spending 47 days on the market in April, one day more than last year.\n\nThe national median list price remained stable at $430,000, the same as last year. However, the price per square foot grew by 3.8%. Higher mortgage rates increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by $148 (6.9%) compared to last year, raising the required household income to $116,000. The percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% last year to 15.5% this year.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends showed stable listing prices in the South (-0.1%) but increases in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%). Buffalo, Cleveland, and Rochester saw the biggest increases in median list prices, while Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City saw declines. The required household income to afford the median-priced home exceeded $100,000 in 34 of the 50 largest metro areas, with the most expensive metros in the West.\n\nRecent price and interest rate trends affected the income required to buy a home differently across markets. In six markets, the median home listing price fell enough to offset rising mortgage rates, reducing the required income. In 15 markets, rising mortgage rates pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. In the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates combined to push required incomes higher, with 14 metros seeing double-digit increases in required income compared to last year.\n\nThe share of price reductions increased in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw an increase in price reductions compared to last April, with Portland, Tampa, and Jacksonville seeing the greatest increases.",

    "Document1": "Subway and bus ridership for 2023\n2023 ridership reflects continued growth\nIn 2023, subway ridership posted a 14% annual increase to 1.15 billion annual paid rides, hitting the billion-ride milestone six weeks earlier than in 2022.\nRidership patterns have shifted since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with discretionary travel becoming more popular than commutation travel. Increased telecommuting and more flexible work-from-home policies have made traditional five-day commuting less common. Commutation ridership is now highest on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Overall subway ridership is now at 68% of 2019 levels. At 77%, weekend recovery is higher than the weekday recovery of 66%. Paid ridership has also benefited from a slightly lower fare evasion rate in 2023, as the MTA continues to combat subway fare evasion.\nBus ridership experienced a modest annual increase of 0.3% to 426 million rides, 63% of the 2019 level. This was slower than the 11% growth observed in 2022. Significant factors contributing to slower growth include rising bus fare evasion and the introduction of a fare-free pilot program on five bus routes starting in September 2023.\nOverview of New York City\u2019s transit system\nWe operate the largest public transportation agency in North America and one of the largest in the world.\nThe subway has a daily ridership of approximately 3.6 million and buses have a daily ridership of 1.4 million, representing 68% and 63%, respectively, of pre-pandemic ridership levels.\nOur system includes:\nHow we calculate ridership\nSubways\nWe include:\nWe do not include:\nBuses\nWe include:\nWe do not include:\nAverage weekday, Saturday, and Sunday ridership includes every weekday, Saturday, and Sunday in the year, except major holidays and days when the subway system was closed or operated fare-free.\nAverage weekend ridership is the two-day sum of average Saturday plus average Sunday ridership. Ridership on major holidays (New Year\u2019s Day, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas) is included only in the annual total.\nSummary of subway ridership\nYear\nAverage weekday\nAverage Saturday\nAverage Sunday\nAverage weekend\nAnnual total\n2018\n5,437,586\n3,046,289\n2,392,658\n5,438,947\n1,680,060,402\n2019\n5,493,875\n3,087,043\n2,407,152\n5,494,195\n1,697,787,002\n2020\n2,040,580\n1,203,072\n932,240\n2,135,312\n639,541,029\n2021\n2,369,655\n1,639,067\n1,249,552\n2,888,620\n759,976,721\n2022\n3,189,904\n2,067,734\n1,635,751\n3,703,485\n1,013,425,465\n2023\n3,625,326\n2,356,521\n1,880,758\n4,237,280\n1,151,998,158\nTop 10 busiest subway stations in 2023\nRank\nStation/complex\nLines\nRidership\n1\nTimes Sq-42 St/Port Authority Bus Terminal\nA/C/E/B/D/F/M/N/Q/R/W/S/1/2/3/7\n54,266,441\n2\nGrand Central-42 St\nS/4/5/6/7\n30,517,475\n3\n34 St-Herald Sq\nB/D/F/M/N/Q/R/W\n23,680,977\n4\n14 St-Union Sq\nL/N/Q/R/W/4/5/6\n21,527,757\n4\nFulton St\nA/C/J/Z/2/3/4/5\n17,887,203\n6\n34 St-Penn Station\nA/C/E\n16,974,543\n7\n59 St-Columbus Circle\nA/C/B/D/1\n15,842,348\n8\n34 St-Penn Station\n1/2/3\n15,224,047\n9\nJackson Hts-Roosevelt Av/74 St-Broadway\nE/F/M/R/7\n14,348,691\n10\nFlushing-Main St\n7\n13,876,213\nAbout our subway data\nWe have 472 stations, the largest number of public transit subway stations of any system in the world. Note that our table lists 424 stations. We combined ridership data for station complexes, where stations are connected by transfer passageways. (We can't accurately allocate ridership to each station in a complex.)

    "Document2": "Three ways bikeshare can be more equitable in\u00a0DC\nBicyclingBy Yipeng Su (Urban Institute),\u00a0Robin Wang (Urban Institute) February 15, 2019\u00a021\n CaBi in Petworth by Bekah Richards licensed under Creative Commons.\nThis article was first published by the Urban Institute on February 11, 2019.\nBikesharing has gained popularity in US cities as concerns about health, congestion, and climate change have increased. In 2010, the DC Department of Transportation introduced the first city-operated bikesharing system in North America. Since then, Capital Bikeshare users have generated millions of rides, but use and station placement varies around the city.\nThe DC Department of Transportation clearly considers equity in its bikeshare development plan, and the department used online crowdsourcing to allow residents to vote on new station placement. But is bikesharing reinforcing DC\u2019s existing disparities, or is it effectively acting to reverse them?\nTo answer this question, we need data. Unlike many privately owned, dockless bike or scooter sharing services, Capital Bikeshare makes anonymized ridership data available online. We focused our analysis only on registered members (who account for three-quarters of the total trips in DC, compared with casual nonmember users) because these riders are more likely to be local residents. View our methodology (PDF) here.\nWith funding support from the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, we took a closer look at Capital Bikeshare\u2019s potential to address the city\u2019s racial and economic disparities. We placed the 2017 data in the context of DC\u2019s socioeconomic characteristics to identify challenges and opportunities for developing bikeshare equitably. Our analysis revealed two primary challenges.\n1. Station placement isn\u2019t equitable and follows patterns of existing infrastructure.\nDC has 276 Capital Bikeshare stations, distributed in 118 of 179 census tracts (66% of tracts in DC). The density of bikeshare stations varies across neighborhoods. Census tracts with the most stations are generally near popular destinations for tourists and residents, like the National Mall.\nAreas with higher shares of white residents, lower poverty rates, higher income, and higher college attainment tend to have more stations available. On average, tracts in the top quartile in terms of share of white population and income level have more than twice the amount of bike share stations available, compared to tracts in the bottom quartile\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nBikeshare station placement generally follows existing transportation infrastructure, such as Metro and Metrobus stations. About 67% of bikeshare stations are located within half a mile of a Metro station, and 99% of bikeshare stations are within a half mile of a Metrobus stop.\nRiders also seem to appreciate stations that are closer to a Metro station. Bike stations within a half mile of a Metro station (185 stations) generate 82% of trips, on average.\n2. Station use differs by neighborhood.\nA single bikeshare station at Union Station saw an impressive 60,371 member rides in 2017, but another station near Capitol Heights (61st Street and Banks PIace NE) generated only 51 member rides.\nThe most popular centers during noncommute hours are concentrated in neighborhoods that have low unemployment rates, high income levels, more people with a college degree, and fewer people of color. This trend is consistent with findings from a 2016 survey (PDF) that found 80% of bikeshare members are white.\nUse is clustered in high-income neighborhoods\nSource: American Community Survey five-year Estimates 2012-2016 and 2017 Capital Bikeshare Trip History Data.\u00a0Notes:\u00a0Only bike share stations located in DC are kept in our analysis and maps; as a result, bike trips originating from or traveling to locations outside DC are not included. Neighborhood information for census tract 006202 (Potomac Parks and National Mall) is not presented due to very small numbers of residents living in the area. \nSuch racial disparity is also reflected by the east-west divide made by the Anacostia River. We grouped DC stations by east and west of the river and looked at bikeshare stations and use, and the equity gap is huge. Wards 7 and 8 (east of the Anacostia river), which are predominately black, accounted for 10% of DC\u2019s total stations, but they generated only 0.5% of the total trips in 2017. While 37% of the trips generated from east of the Anacostia ended up across the river, only 0.1% of trips generated from west of the river ended up east of the Anacostia.\nUse is clustered in less diverse neighborhoods\nSource: American Community Survey five-year Estimates 2012-2016 and 2017 Capital Bikeshare Trip History Data.\u00a0Notes: Only bike share stations located in DC are kept in our analysis and maps; as a result, bike trips originating from or traveling to locations outside DC are not included. Neighborhood information for census tract 006202 (Potomac Parks and National Mall) is not presented due to very small numbers of residents living in the area. \nThese data suggest that people lack incentive to use bikeshare services in these neighborhoods, even when stations are available. The five stations that members used the least in 2017 are all stations added to Wards 7 and 8 toward the end of the year as part of the mayor\u2019s effort to expand DC\u2019s bike network. But even excluding these stations, four of the five least-used stations are still east of the Anacostia.\nHow can the city use bikeshare service to support its equity goals?\nBikeshare service could improve mobility and connectivity across DC\u2019s racial and socioeconomic boundaries. But our analysis shows that people don\u2019t use bikeshares more just because they are available, raising perhaps the most important question for planners and decisionmakers: what provides incentive for communities to use bikeshares, and what are the barriers diminishing the incentives for certain communities?\nDrawing from best practices and studies on potential barriers for accessing bikeshares, here are some ideas policymakers should consider.\n1. Promote transparent decisionmaking and access to data.\nCapital Bikeshare conducts a user survey every two years that reveals user demographics but doesn\u2019t share individual-level trip data, making it hard to analyze trip patterns by different types of users.\nGPS data, also not included in the survey, could show whether certain neighborhoods are attracting trips by revealing routes and speeds through different neighborhoods. More nuanced data should be collected to boost understanding of how people use bikeshare service.\nClarity in the decisionmaking process for future stations could also be a major step toward involving the community and ensuring equitable growth.\nAllowing people to vote online for future stations is a good start, but it doesn\u2019t ensure equitable development. Communities that need stations and better overall transportation access often also lack internet access and the ability to weigh in on how new infrastructure is built.\nLike New York and Chicago, DC does not specify how stations are selected based on input from locals, so a thorough community engagement plan is crucial for equitable decisionmaking. (Capital Bikeshare is a public-private partnership venture, and DC\u2019s Department of Planning is actively involved in the planning process. View its development plan here.)\n2. Develop infrastructure equitably.\nHistoric disinvestment certainly contributed to the lack of bikeshare use by people of color in low-income neighborhoods. Lack of designated bike lanes in Wards 7 and 8 could also deter people from biking around their neighborhoods.\nIf public infrastructure like roads, bike lanes, bus stops, and train stations are not evenly developed, Capital Bikeshare will likely only reinforce the existing divides of poverty and economic opportunity.\n3. Ease barriers to access for disadvantaged communities.\nUnderbanked communities also face barriers to accessing bikeshare service. Capital Bikeshare does not provide cash payment options at docks, so users must sign up for memberships online or pay with credit card and make a $100 deposit. Lacking a credit card or a smartphone could be a barrier for some DC residents seeking to integrate bikeshare service into their travel.\nCapital Bikeshare already offers financial assistance programs like cash payment options and heavily discounted memberships, but it\u2019s unclear if communities in need are aware of these programs, and data on their success aren\u2019t available.\nPhiladelphia adopted an innovative program to remove these financial barriers that showed promising results. Communities in the city also had bikeshare ambassadors to promote bikeshare use in underserved areas. In Boston, doctors are \u201cprescribing\u201d heavily subsidized bikeshare memberships to people in communities where bikeshare memberships are unaffordable but whose health could benefit the most from greater use.\nDC\u2019s Capital Bikeshare has partnered with more than 30 community groups to offer need-based $5 annual membership. Such programs are promising for serving disadvantaged communities in DC, but better understanding of the demographics of bikeshare users and barriers to to the uptake of reduced-price memberships could help improve outcomes. In an upcoming blog post, we analyze trip destinations and different diversity measures to gather a picture of travel patterns in DC.\nContinue the conversation about urbanism in the Washington region and support GGWash\u2019s news and advocacy when you\u00a0join the GGWash Neighborhood!\nYipeng Su is a research analyst in the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute.

This includes a new ChatBot for improved customer service, ongoing work with our transit partners at Metra, Pace and RTA to deliver innovative fare products, plus a new, dedicated program that will provide pre-loaded Ventra Cards to victims and survivors of domestic abuse.\n\u201cI deeply believe that an examination of an agency\u2019s budget is all that is required to understand who and what it prioritizes. The CTA\u2019s proposed 2024 budget puts a high premium on providing the highest levels of service, customer comfort, modernization and equity,\u201d said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. \u201cI am pleased with the continued progress and positive trends that CTA continues to make, but we still have work to do to provide the service that I believe our customers deserve and expect. I am committed to returning more scheduled service to our bus and rail systems in 2024.\u201d\nCTA ridership grew steadily throughout 2023, reaching a pandemic-era high of more than 25.83. million rides during the month of September. Overall system-wide ridership for 2023 is forecasted to finish 12 percent higher than in 2022. Ridership is projected to increase further in 2024, approximately 5.7 percent over the 2023 forecasted ridership.\nThe continued strengthening of CTA\u2019s workforce is critical to further improving the delivery of its services.\nIn 2023, the CTA made tremendous progress toward addressing this issue, hosting seven job fairs that attracted more than 3,000 potential employees, while hiring hundreds of new workers into a variety of positions. As a result of CTA\u2019s ongoing aggressive recruiting efforts, it has already surpassed its goal of hiring 700 new bus operators in 2023, and anticipates hiring more than 900 bus operators by the end of the year.\nCTA is also on track to hire approximately 100 bus mechanics in 2023, which is more than double the normal rate. On the rail side, almost 100 flaggers will have been trained and transitioned into rail operator positions by the end of 2023, which is significantly more rail operators trained than the number of rail operators historically trained in a year.\nOverall, CTA is projecting to hire more than 2,000 new employees for the current year, also far exceeding the 1,200 annual hiring norm. CTA will continue to plan, monitor, and respond to the shifting employment landscape to meet its people and service needs. As such, CTA anticipates continued optimization of its service schedules to reflect its growing workforce\u2013additional service is expected to be added in 2024.\nSince the start of the pandemic, federal funding has been crucial to allow transit agencies across the country, including the CTA, to maintain their operations. Federal funding from the American Rescue Plan will help the CTA close a projected $473 million budget gap in 2024\u2014and allow the agency to continue providing as much service as possible with its available workforce. Despite the financial challenges, the CTA continues to look for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively, and to best serve the region.\n\u201cWhile more and improved funding and investment is unquestionably the most important issue facing CTA finances, our number one priority is always the people who take hundreds of millions of rides on our system every year. It is incumbent upon us to work diligently to find better ways to serve them and improve their travel experience.\u201d Carter added.\nThe CTA\u2019s 2024-2028 Capital Improvement Program\u2014which is separate from the agency\u2019s operating budget\u2014calls for $3.61 billion in projects over the next five years. This budget reflects CTA\u2019s ongoing commitment towards the modernization and improvement of its physical infrastructure\u2014tracks, rail stations, buses and trains, facilities and technologies. Among the many important investments is the Red Line Extension, which will extend the CTA\u2019s busiest rail line to the southern City limits and will provide greatly improved transit access and connectivity to the Far South Side of Chicago.\nOther capital projects to continue or begin in 2024 include:\nMore information on the proposed 2024 budget is at transitchicago.com/finance/.\nA public hearing will be held on Thursday, November 9, 2023 at 6:00 p.m. at CTA headquarters located at 567 W.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Subway and bus ridership for 2023\n2023 ridership reflects continued growth\nIn 2023, subway ridership increased by 14% annually to 1.15 billion paid rides, reaching the billion-ride milestone six weeks earlier than in 2022. Ridership patterns have shifted since the COVID-19 pandemic, with discretionary travel becoming more popular than commutation travel. Increased telecommuting and flexible work-from-home policies have made traditional five-day commuting less common. Commutation ridership is now highest on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Overall subway ridership is now at 68% of 2019 levels, with weekend recovery at 77% and weekday recovery at 66%. Paid ridership has also benefited from a slightly lower fare evasion rate in 2023.\n\nBus ridership experienced a modest annual increase of 0.3% to 426 million rides, 63% of the 2019 level.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Bikesharing has gained popularity in US cities due to concerns about health, congestion, and climate change. In 2010, the DC Department of Transportation introduced the first city-operated bikesharing system in North America, Capital Bikeshare. Despite its success, the distribution and usage of bikeshare stations in Washington D.C. reveal significant disparities. The DC Department of Transportation considers equity in its bikeshare development plan, using online crowdsourcing for station placement. However, data shows that bikeshare station placement and usage are not equitable. Stations are more densely located in areas with higher shares of white residents, lower poverty rates, higher income, and higher college attainment. About 67% of bikeshare stations are within half a mile of a Metro station, and 99% are within a half mile of a Metrobus stop. Stations near Metro stations generate 82% of trips. In 2017, a station at Union Station saw 60,371 member rides, while a station near Capitol Heights generated only 51 rides. The most popular stations are in high-income neighborhoods with low unemployment rates and more college-educated residents. Wards 7 and 8, predominantly black areas east of the Anacostia River, have only 10% of DC\u2019s stations but generated just 0.5% of total trips in 2017. To address these disparities, policymakers should promote transparent decision-making, develop infrastructure equitably, and ease barriers to access for disadvantaged communities. Capital Bikeshare offers financial assistance programs, but awareness and data on their success are limited. Innovative programs in other cities, like Philadelphia and Boston, show promising results in removing financial barriers and promoting bikeshare use in underserved areas. DC\u2019s Capital Bikeshare has partnered with community groups to offer need-based $5 annual memberships, but better understanding of user demographics and barriers is needed to improve outcomes.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) proposed a $1.99 billion operating budget for 2024, reflecting a 9.2% increase over the previous year. This budget maintains current fare levels and bus and rail services, with plans to increase service to meet growing ridership. Key investments include enhanced security, improved Ventra fare system features, and a new ChatBot for customer service. CTA ridership reached a pandemic-era high of over 25.83 million rides in September 2023, with a 12% increase in overall ridership for the year. Ridership is projected to grow by 5.7% in 2024. The CTA has made significant progress in workforce recruitment, surpassing its goal of hiring 700 new bus operators and expecting to hire over 900 by the end of 2023. Additionally, the CTA plans to hire more than 2,000 new employees in 2023, far exceeding the annual norm of 1,200. Federal funding from the American Rescue Plan will help close a projected $473 million budget gap in 2024. The CTA's 2024-2028 Capital Improvement Program includes $3.61 billion in projects, such as the Red Line Extension. A public hearing on the proposed budget will be held on November 9, 2023, with opportunities for written and oral comments.",

    "Document1": "Subway and bus ridership for 2023\n2023 ridership reflects continued growth\nIn 2023, subway ridership posted a 14% annual increase to 1.15 billion annual paid rides, hitting the billion-ride milestone six weeks earlier than in 2022.\nRidership patterns have shifted since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with discretionary travel becoming more popular than commutation travel. Increased telecommuting and more flexible work-from-home policies have made traditional five-day commuting less common. Commutation ridership is now highest on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Overall subway ridership is now at 68% of 2019 levels. At 77%, weekend recovery is higher than the weekday recovery of 66%. Paid ridership has also benefited from a slightly lower fare evasion rate in 2023, as the MTA continues to combat subway fare evasion.\nBus ridership experienced a modest annual increase of 0.3% to 426 million rides, 63% of the 2019 level. This was slower than the 11% growth observed in 2022. Significant factors contributing to slower growth include rising bus fare evasion and the introduction of a fare-free pilot program on five bus routes starting in September 2023.\nOverview of New York City\u2019s transit system\nWe operate the largest public transportation agency in North America and one of the largest in the world.\nThe subway has a daily ridership of approximately 3.6 million and buses have a daily ridership of 1.4 million, representing 68% and 63%, respectively, of pre-pandemic ridership levels.\nOur system includes:\nHow we calculate ridership\nSubways\nWe include:\nWe do not include:\nBuses\nWe include:\nWe do not include:\nAverage weekday, Saturday, and Sunday ridership includes every weekday, Saturday, and Sunday in the year, except major holidays and days when the subway system was closed or operated fare-free.\nAverage weekend ridership is the two-day sum of average Saturday plus average Sunday ridership. Ridership on major holidays (New Year\u2019s Day, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas) is included only in the annual total.\nSummary of subway ridership\nYear\nAverage weekday\nAverage Saturday\nAverage Sunday\nAverage weekend\nAnnual total\n2018\n5,437,586\n3,046,289\n2,392,658\n5,438,947\n1,680,060,402\n2019\n5,493,875\n3,087,043\n2,407,152\n5,494,195\n1,697,787,002\n2020\n2,040,580\n1,203,072\n932,240\n2,135,312\n639,541,029\n2021\n2,369,655\n1,639,067\n1,249,552\n2,888,620\n759,976,721\n2022\n3,189,904\n2,067,734\n1,635,751\n3,703,485\n1,013,425,465\n2023\n3,625,326\n2,356,521\n1,880,758\n4,237,280\n1,151,998,158\nTop 10 busiest subway stations in 2023\nRank\nStation/complex\nLines\nRidership\n1\nTimes Sq-42 St/Port Authority Bus Terminal\nA/C/E/B/D/F/M/N/Q/R/W/S/1/2/3/7\n54,266,441\n2\nGrand Central-42 St\nS/4/5/6/7\n30,517,475\n3\n34 St-Herald Sq\nB/D/F/M/N/Q/R/W\n23,680,977\n4\n14 St-Union Sq\nL/N/Q/R/W/4/5/6\n21,527,757\n4\nFulton St\nA/C/J/Z/2/3/4/5\n17,887,203\n6\n34 St-Penn Station\nA/C/E\n16,974,543\n7\n59 St-Columbus Circle\nA/C/B/D/1\n15,842,348\n8\n34 St-Penn Station\n1/2/3\n15,224,047\n9\nJackson Hts-Roosevelt Av/74 St-Broadway\nE/F/M/R/7\n14,348,691\n10\nFlushing-Main St\n7\n13,876,213\nAbout our subway data\nWe have 472 stations, the largest number of public transit subway stations of any system in the world. Note that our table lists 424 stations. We combined ridership data for station complexes, where stations are connected by transfer passageways. (We can't accurately allocate ridership to each station in a complex.)

DART faces uncertain future as North Texas cities try to cut funding\nCity officials say poor service and a lack of transparency underlie recent votes to cap funding to the agency. \nBy Amber GaudetTransportation and mobility reporter\nTransportation and mobility reporter\n6:00 AM on Aug 9, 2024 CDT\nDallas Area Rapid Transit, the region\u2019s largest mass transit agency ferrying nearly 50 million passengers last year, could lose $6 billion in funding during the next two decades if cities that pay the bulk of its budget get their wish.\nSix of DART\u2019s 13 member cities have passed resolutions since June in support of cutting sales tax contributions to the transit agency by a quarter. Another member city, Dallas, has discussed doing the same.\nSince DART was formed in 1983, participating cities have paid a penny sales tax \u2014 a 1% tax on every dollar spent \u2014 to DART. Sales tax revenue represents about 70% of the transit agency\u2019s overall budget. Other revenue sources include fares, federal funds, interest and debt issuances. Plano and Irving, two of DART\u2019s biggest sources of sales tax revenue, would each save about $30 million annually by cutting contributions by a quarter.\nDART leaders have said that would cripple the agency, leading to deep service cuts throughout the region. Member cities, however, say they\u2019ve waited years to get answers from DART about where their dollars are going \u2014 and are ready to take the fight over funding to the Texas Legislature to change the laws governing regional transit agencies.\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\nOr with: \nBy signing up you agree to our\u00a0Terms of Service\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy Policy\nDART\u2019s system services about 700 square miles in Dallas-Fort Worth, operating 692 buses and one of the longest light rail systems in the country. The urban rail and bus network is the primary source of transportation for thousands of area residents traversing the sprawling metroplex. The usefulness and scope of that system is now in question by cities looking to claw back millions of dollars in contributions, which have grown to $870 million a year.\nHow DART was formed and funded\nIn August 1983, voters in 14 cities in Dallas-Fort Worth cast ballots in favor of forming a regional transportation authority that collected a 1-cent sales tax from member cities. Seven suburban cities voted against the proposal.\nThat support led to the creation of DART. It was the second attempt to form a regional transit authority supported by a 1-cent sales tax.\nAs early as 1988, according to The Dallas Morning News archives, some local officials and residents were expressing doubts about the newly formed DART, complaining of poor system design, excessive costs and mismanaged funds.\nIt\u2019s long been common for transportation agencies to be the subject of poor public opinion, according to Michael Walk, a researcher at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute.\n\u201cThe norm for transit systems, particularly across the U.S., is to struggle with public perception, whether it\u2019s the riders themselves being maybe dissatisfied with the way the routes work or with safety or cleanliness of systems or nonriders seeing public transit as a less desirable service,\u201d Walk said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s an ongoing challenge to correct those perceptions or to mitigate the ramifications of them.\u201d\nThe state\u2019s Transportation Code gives transportation agency boards the authority to voluntarily ask the state comptroller to collect sales taxes at a lower rate than what the public authorized when DART was formed. If the DART Board of Directors does not do that on its own as member cities that have passed resolutions want, officials would be forced to ask the legislature to change the code to create another avenue to cut funding.\nAs cities demand answers, riders fear cuts\nWhen Dallas resident Alexander Dunn heard Plano passed a resolution in June to cut their contributions to DART, he started organizing. On a Saturday afternoon in late July, Dunn and about 50 other DART riders and advocates gathered in a small community room in downtown Dallas to discuss how to respond.\n\u201cPeople are really keyed into the fact that this is an existential fight for the future of DART,\u201d Dunn said.\nDunn\u2019s group, Dallas Area Transit Alliance, says riders will ultimately pay the price for funding reductions. Although he\u2019s a casual user of DART who owns a car, he knows many rely on the system as their sole source of transportation.\nAlthough exactly what cuts would happen would be determined if funding reductions were finalized, they could include less frequent buses, cuts to paratransit service for disabled riders, workforce reductions and deferred maintenance.\n\u201cMany options from my personal perspective exist including consolidation of bus routes, increased schedule intervals for buses, light rail and commuter rail, as well as the reduction up to removal of GoLink service,\u201d DART board member Randall Bryant said in a public statement. Bryant represents Dallas on the board.\nThe alliance launched an online petition objecting to the cuts that has collected more than 1,400 signatures as of Aug. 6.\n\u201cAll of the progress DART\u2019s been making over the past year, more than a year, with regards to security, cleanliness, maintenance, reliability, frequency \u2014 all of that would go away if DART loses a quarter of its sales tax revenue,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cAnd even beyond that, we now have to be starting to work from the bottom trying to get back to that [current service levels] before we can even think about improvements.\u201d\nOfficials say they empathize with riders and are advocating to make the system they rely on better.\n\u201cPlano is very pro-transit \u2014 I think that gets lost in some of the discussions and media surrounding the discussion,\u201d said Plano director of government relations Andrew Fortune. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion around, \u2018Oh, my goodness, this is going to harm riders or it\u2019s going to cut services\u2019 and that\u2019s really not the proposal.\u2019\u201d\nRowlett Mayor Blake Margolis said he understands riders\u2019 concerns and does not want to see service in his city reduced.\n\u201cWe support transit,\u201d Margolis said. \u201cWe want to see DART perform well, we want to see trains be clean and safe, and we want to see ridership go up. But we also know that just the way that the business is functioning today is not working in the best interest of DART member cities.\n\u201cAnd if we want to see this transit system grow regionally, then  something of some kind needs to change with this structure.\u201d\n\u2018Rendering the entire system useless\u2019\nLeaders at the mass transit agency say reduced contributions would mean significant cuts to the frequency and number of critical routes. Service frequency could be cut back from 15 minutes to as much as one hour on some routes, and paratransit services for disabled residents would also be cut back to federally mandated minimums, DART CEO Nadine Lee said.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re getting to those levels of service on your best lines, best corridors, you\u2019re really rendering the entire system useless,\u201d Lee said.\nThe agency would also have to halt or delay maintenance and modernization projects. Those include efforts to upgrade original rail signal systems, infrastructure and vehicles and to modernize passenger amenities and facilities.\n\u201cBoth the light rail fleet as well as the bus fleet is ending its useful life or reaching the end of its useful life,\u201d Lee said.\n\u201cWe know that we need to program a tremendous amount of money to modernize our system because it is aging and because it is becoming increasingly more expensive for us to maintain what we have because of the age of our assets. And so the spending that we\u2019re doing is prudent.\u201d\nThe agency hopes to expand services as the region contends with a growing population.\nGrowing contributions means more accountability\nSeveral member cities that have publicly supported capping DART contributions have said they do not want service cuts and the recent resolutions were an attempt to get answers from the agency. Top officials from three member cities said they have been asking DART for years to provide a detailed breakdown of what services the cities get for their dollars, along with local ridership numbers.\n\u201cWe continue to look at how much revenue is increasing year over year, and still can\u2019t get an accounting of what it costs to provide services in Plano, so that really became a driving aspect,\u201d Plano City Manager Mark Israelson said. \u201cI think Plano has been very patient in waiting for some of those answers over these years, and we\u2019re at that point of really wanting to know what that provides to our community.\u201d\nThe agency provided a cost allocation report by city in 2022, DART chief financial officer Jamie Adelman said.\n\u201cThere were three or four attempts that we made to try to allocate the cost by city in order to answer the question that we were hearing from the cities, and I will tell you that every time we turned something in to the cities for their review, they were not happy with it, [but] they were not clear about what they weren\u2019t happy with,\u201d DART CEO Lee said.\nFiguring out how to break down systemwide costs like light rail by city has remained a challenge, according to Lee.\nDART has commissioned a study examining the return on investment for each city by Ernst & Young, results of which are expected in September.\nAlso expected in the fall is the Transit 2.0 report, a study commissioned by the North Central Texas Council of Governments to examine regional transportation needs, including DART funding, through 2050. Lee and North Central Texas Council of Governments Regional Transportation Council director Michael Morris have separately urged cities to wait for the results of the studies before taking action.\n\u201cThe resolutions that the cities are taking are premature and the reason why they\u2019re premature is we\u2019ve already outlined the process to get their questions answered,\u201d Morris said.\nAmong other top issues for member cities is service. Officials from cities voting to cut funding have said they regularly hear complaints from residents about poor system design, crime and unclean buses and trains. Meanwhile, the dollar amount of tax contributions by member cities to DART has grown for the past 10 years and is expected to increase about 4.5% in fiscal year 2025.\n\u201cWhat would have the most impact positively toward their ridership is to enhance their basic services, making sure their trains and busses are clean, making sure that there\u2019s proper fare enforcement, making sure that people feel safe while riding public transportation, which has been a plague on the system and which my constituents tell me is the reason why they don\u2019t feel safe riding the train anymore,\u201d Rowlett\u2019s Margolis said. \u201cThis is about saying, \u2018Hey, wake up, let\u2019s refocus back on the important things that DART needs to focus on and get right.\u2019\u201d\nNot all member cities think DART is doing a bad job. Officials in Garland and Richardson have expressed support for DART in public meetings, though none have taken formal action in support of the agency.\nDART said they have tried to engage with city leaders about how to meet the needs of each community, but often haven\u2019t gotten clear answers on what those needs are. Some member cities haven\u2019t engaged at all, staff said during a committee meeting earlier this month, though the agency keeps trying.\nDART, cities face revenue pressures\nMember cities have pointed to low ridership as a reason to cut funds. DART says ridership has recovered about 83% since the COVID-19 pandemic, ahead of the national average, though they did not specify what metrics they use for the figure. Online ridership data shows fiscal year-to-date ridership through June 2024 is at 41.4 million compared to 52.8 million in June 2019, about 22% lower than during the pre-pandemic measure. DART\u2019s fiscal year runs October through September.\n\u201cWe spend ... this year the projections are $108 million \u2014 that\u2019s more money than we spend on anything,\u201d Irving Mayor and DART board member Rick Stopfer said. \u201cAnd what are our residents getting for it? Are they really getting the service that $100 million deserves?\u201d\nBoard member Patrick Kennedy, who represents Dallas, said cities should be looking to increase density around stations to encourage ridership.\n\u201cLike 80% of where ridership comes from is the built environment and land use patterns,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe should be going pedal to the metal for the next 10 years doing that rather than trying to take away revenue.\u201d\nLike other organizations, transit agencies have been subject to inflationary pressures that have squeezed finances, according to transportation researcher Walk.\n\u201cIn addition to just general inflation and labor costs increases, it\u2019s been a very big challenge to keep the workforce and to then have to pay them what they need in order to stay in a very difficult job,\u201d Walk said. \u201cJust like the rest of the industry, and every person is experiencing, whether it\u2019s parts or fuel, or supplies, professional services, everything has been going up recently, and so transit agencies feel those pressures, just like every other business and company.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not to say every transit agency is 100% efficient, Walk said. There are significant maintenance and operational costs to running a large transit system that might be difficult to communicate in a direct service-for-dollars way that cities desire. Those cost pressures can get in the way of investing in service upgrades like frequency increases.\nCity leaders from Rowlett, Plano and Irving have complained the DART system is a magnet for crime and the service is losing money because residents with other options are choosing not to ride DART.\nDART crime reports increased 18% for the second quarter of 2024 over the same time last year. DART says that is because of increased efforts to be proactive in addressing issues. The agency has added more than 100 armed security officers to address crime and partnered with Parkland Health for homeless and mental health outreach.\nMargolis has pointed to fare evasion as an area where DART could shore up funds. Fares generally make up a small percentage of overall revenue, and things like day passes and federally mandated discount fares for certain groups complicate the fare picture, Lee said.\nThe agency had 73 fare enforcement officers last year. Increasing enforcement through a wider deployment of officers would result in more costs than returns, according to Lee.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a perception that we\u2019re missing out on a significant amount of fares, and I don\u2019t think that that is accurate,\u201d Lee said.\nDART has said cutting funding would only introduce more issues into the system.\n\u201cThat means now you don\u2019t have money to do the repairs on a 40-year-old system that needs to be done to keep the system up to date, and you keep making the entire system worse and worse,\u201d DART spokesperson Jeamy Molina said in July.\nLooking to Austin for answers\nAny reduction to the 1-cent tax could potentially put DART in default with bondholders, staff told the board during a committee meeting earlier this month. About 25% of what DART spends every year is on debt service.\nMember cities say they are dealing with their own budget constraints. Dallas has discussed whether to divert DART funds to deal with its pension crisis, though only the DART board or the Texas Legislature can trigger changes to DART\u2019s funding structure. Officials have pointed to a 2019 state law that capped local government property tax increases at 3.5% without voter approval.\n\u201cWe had that implemented, and we had to adjust very quickly,\u201d Plano\u2019s Israelson said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an extended period to be able to do that. So we\u2019ve learned to live with revenue caps. We think DART can, too.\u201d\nIsraelson said the goal is to lower the city\u2019s sales tax contribution to .75 cents per dollar. A revenue cap could also have incremental growth baked in to account for inflation.\n\u201cRight now, we would challenge the discussion that if they are fully funded at the dollar amount that they have this year and going forward they have a revenue cap that has some sort of increment of growth in it, I would challenge the question, tell us how that\u2019s a service reduction versus the current service level,\u201d Israelson said.\nPlano and Irving send more than $100 million a year to DART. The $30 million or more that would be saved under their funding cut requests could provide relief to city budgets struggling to pay for other services.\nIsraelson said it would be up to Plano voters how those dollars are spent. In Irving, Stopfer said he would keep that money focused on getting residents where they need to go \u2014 though he isn\u2019t sure what that might look like. Bus stops, sidewalks and streets all need attention in Irving\u2019s DART service areas, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of dollars that need to be spent so that the individuals that are using these buses  are in a clean, safe, accessible environment,\u201d Stopfer said.\nWith the DART board not expected to offer a resolution to reduce funding, cities are weighing their options ahead of the next legislative session.\n\u201cIf we really want to deal with these issues, it\u2019s going to require legislation,\u201d Stopfer said.\nA proposal being considered by Plano officials would amend the Texas Transportation Code to restrict the issuance of future debt pledges to 3/4 a cent of tax revenue and \u201cimmediately\u201d institute a revenue cap equivalent to DART\u2019s sales tax projections for fiscal year 2024. An annual 2% growth index from sales tax revenue would be allowed for one-time expenditures, with any growth above 2% dedicated to paying off debt faster.\nThe proposal is a starting place for discussions and is the result of a consensus among member cities that passed resolutions supporting DART revenue caps, according to Plano\u2019s Fortune.\nMost of the items in Plano\u2019s proposal can be accomplished by the DART board without legislative action, which Plano officials still hope for, Fortune said. But if DART doesn\u2019t come to the table, officials will take the fight to Austin.\nPlano will likely finalize its legislative program in October.\nStopfer said he would like to see legislative action to allow cities to join DART for less than a full penny and to allow funds in excess of a capped amount to be returned to member cities.\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s got to be a certain amount of transparency on how the dollars are spent, [and] I think that there\u2019s got to be some correlation between ridership and dollars spent,\u201d Stopfer said. \u201cI think that if you\u2019re truly going to bring other people on board, in addition to lowering the percentage, you\u2019re going to have to change the makeup of the board because no one is going to come on a board that they can\u2019t have a voice on.\u201d\nBoard members are appointed based on a member city\u2019s population, giving Dallas eight representatives on the board. Other cities have at most two each.\nRowlett is also thinking about contingencies, according to Margolis, though he said it was too early to share specifics.\n\u201cConversations are happening more and more between a coalition of member cities \u2014 we\u2019re working on our next steps and formulating that and getting ready,\u201d Margolis said.\nDART is considering its own legislative priorities. The board recently postponed a vote to finalize a legislative agenda that included language opposing \u201clegislation that could detrimentally impact DART\u2019s mission, finances, governance or operations, including changes to DART\u2019s sales tax statute.\u201d\nThe board will revisit the issue in September.\nDART wants to keep talks about how to move transit forward local, Lee said, and continue discussions with member cities about how to meet the unique needs of each area through its area planning process.\n\u201cWe have had conversations with each individual city about their vision for the future,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to accomplish in the future, where they see development patterns happening, where they see their major travel corridors where we can add that travel capacity for them. How we incorporate transit as more of an essential piece of the fabric of their cities.\n\u201cThose are the conversations I want to be having instead of trying to fight something down in Austin.\u201d\nAmber is a staff writer for The Dallas Morning News.

This includes a new ChatBot for improved customer service, ongoing work with our transit partners at Metra, Pace and RTA to deliver innovative fare products, plus a new, dedicated program that will provide pre-loaded Ventra Cards to victims and survivors of domestic abuse.\n\u201cI deeply believe that an examination of an agency\u2019s budget is all that is required to understand who and what it prioritizes. The CTA\u2019s proposed 2024 budget puts a high premium on providing the highest levels of service, customer comfort, modernization and equity,\u201d said CTA President Dorval R. Carter, Jr. \u201cI am pleased with the continued progress and positive trends that CTA continues to make, but we still have work to do to provide the service that I believe our customers deserve and expect. I am committed to returning more scheduled service to our bus and rail systems in 2024.\u201d\nCTA ridership grew steadily throughout 2023, reaching a pandemic-era high of more than 25.83. million rides during the month of September. Overall system-wide ridership for 2023 is forecasted to finish 12 percent higher than in 2022. Ridership is projected to increase further in 2024, approximately 5.7 percent over the 2023 forecasted ridership.\nThe continued strengthening of CTA\u2019s workforce is critical to further improving the delivery of its services.\nIn 2023, the CTA made tremendous progress toward addressing this issue, hosting seven job fairs that attracted more than 3,000 potential employees, while hiring hundreds of new workers into a variety of positions. As a result of CTA\u2019s ongoing aggressive recruiting efforts, it has already surpassed its goal of hiring 700 new bus operators in 2023, and anticipates hiring more than 900 bus operators by the end of the year.\nCTA is also on track to hire approximately 100 bus mechanics in 2023, which is more than double the normal rate. On the rail side, almost 100 flaggers will have been trained and transitioned into rail operator positions by the end of 2023, which is significantly more rail operators trained than the number of rail operators historically trained in a year.\nOverall, CTA is projecting to hire more than 2,000 new employees for the current year, also far exceeding the 1,200 annual hiring norm. CTA will continue to plan, monitor, and respond to the shifting employment landscape to meet its people and service needs. As such, CTA anticipates continued optimization of its service schedules to reflect its growing workforce\u2013additional service is expected to be added in 2024.\nSince the start of the pandemic, federal funding has been crucial to allow transit agencies across the country, including the CTA, to maintain their operations. Federal funding from the American Rescue Plan will help the CTA close a projected $473 million budget gap in 2024\u2014and allow the agency to continue providing as much service as possible with its available workforce. Despite the financial challenges, the CTA continues to look for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively, and to best serve the region.\n\u201cWhile more and improved funding and investment is unquestionably the most important issue facing CTA finances, our number one priority is always the people who take hundreds of millions of rides on our system every year. It is incumbent upon us to work diligently to find better ways to serve them and improve their travel experience.\u201d Carter added.\nThe CTA\u2019s 2024-2028 Capital Improvement Program\u2014which is separate from the agency\u2019s operating budget\u2014calls for $3.61 billion in projects over the next five years.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Subway and bus ridership for 2023\n2023 ridership reflects continued growth\nIn 2023, subway ridership increased by 14% annually to 1.15 billion paid rides, reaching the billion-ride milestone six weeks earlier than in 2022. Ridership patterns have shifted since the COVID-19 pandemic, with discretionary travel becoming more popular than commutation travel. Increased telecommuting and flexible work-from-home policies have made traditional five-day commuting less common. Commutation ridership is now highest on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Overall subway ridership is now at 68% of 2019 levels, with weekend recovery at 77% and weekday recovery at 66%. Paid ridership has also benefited from a slightly lower fare evasion rate in 2023.\n\nBus ridership experienced a modest annual increase of 0.3% to 426 million rides, 63% of the 2019 level. This was slower than the 11% growth observed in 2022. Factors contributing to slower growth include rising bus fare evasion and the introduction of a fare-free pilot program on five bus routes starting in September 2023.\n\nOverview of New York City\u2019s transit system\nThe MTA operates the largest public transportation agency in North America and one of the largest in the world. The subway has a daily ridership of approximately 3.6 million, and buses have a daily ridership of 1.4 million, representing 68% and 63%, respectively, of pre-pandemic ridership levels.\n\nSummary of subway ridership\nYear\tAverage weekday\tAverage Saturday\tAverage Sunday\tAverage weekend\tAnnual total\n2018\t5,437,586\t3,046,289\t2,392,658\t5,438,947\t1,680,060,402\n2019\t5,493,875\t3,087,043\t2,407,152\t5,494,195\t1,697,787,002\n2020\t2,040,580\t1,203,072\t932,240\t2,135,312\t639,541,029\n2021\t2,369,655\t1,639,067\t1,249,552\t2,888,620\t759,976,721\n2022\t3,189,904\t2,067,734\t1,635,751\t3,703,485\t1,013,425,465\n2023\t3,625,326\t2,356,521\t1,880,758\t4,237,280\t1,151,998,158\n\nTop 10 busiest subway stations in 2023\nRank\tStation/complex\tLines\tRidership\n1\tTimes Sq-42 St/Port Authority Bus Terminal\tA/C/E/B/D/F/M/N/Q/R/W/S/1/2/3/7\t54,266,441\n2\tGrand Central-42 St\tS/4/5/6/7\t30,517,475\n3\t34 St-Herald Sq\tB/D/F/M/N/Q/R/W\t23,680,977\n4\t14 St-Union Sq\tL/N/Q/R/W/4/5/6\t21,527,757\n5\tFulton St\tA/C/J/Z/2/3/4/5\t17,887,203\n6\t34 St-Penn Station\tA/C/E\t16,974,543\n7\t59 St-Columbus Circle\tA/C/B/D/1\t15,842,348\n8\t34 St-Penn Station\t1/2/3\t15,224,047\n9\tJackson Hts-Roosevelt Av/74 St-Broadway\tE/F/M/R/7\t14,348,691\n10\tFlushing-Main St\t7\t13,876,213\n\nSummary of bus ridership (New York City Transit)\nYear\tAverage weekday\tAverage Saturday\tAverage Sunday\tAverage weekend\tAnnual total\n2018\t1,811,605\t1,122,626\t868,057\t1,990,683\t569,361,220\n2019\t1,770,394\t1,108,809\t847,931\t1,956,740\t557,036,504\n2020\t980,374\t671,835\t532,002\t1,203,837\t316,768,454\n2021\t984,865\t646,302\t482,090\t1,128,392\t311,893,583\n2022\t1,094,415\t662,179\t523,178\t1,185,357\t343,092,963\n2023\t1,082,428\t670,755\t535,911\t1,206,666\t340,766,398\n\nSummary of bus ridership (MTA Bus Company)\nYear\tAverage weekday\tAverage Saturday\tAverage Sunday\tAverage weekend\tAnnual total\n2018\t392,617\t224,751\t170,892\t395,643\t121,448,276\n2019\t388,075\t228,364\t171,762\t400,126\t120,551,580\n2020\t207,042\t132,387\t99,713\t232,100\t65,655,990\n2021\t228,425\t142,112\t102,744\t244,856\t71,431,466\n2022\t268,124\t150,399\t113,157\t263,556\t82,609,386\n2023\t279,247\t159,451\t121,069\t280,520\t86,216,666\n\nTop 10 busiest bus routes by ridership in 2023\nRank\tRoute\tBorough\tRidership\n1\tM15 Local/SBS\tManhattan\t10,468,682\n2\tQ58\tQueens\t7,119,884\n3\tB6\tBrooklyn\t6,049,383\n4\tBx12 Local/SBS\tBronx\t5,900,063\n5\tB82 Local/SBS\tBrooklyn\t5,647,706\n6\tB46 Local/SBS\tBrooklyn\t5,547,520\n7\tB44 Local/SBS\tBrooklyn\t5,468,965\n8\tQ27\tQueens\t5,414,302\n9\tB41\tBrooklyn\t4,759,664\n10\tQ44\tQueens\t4,715,292",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), the largest mass transit agency in North Texas, is facing potential funding cuts that could total $6 billion over the next two decades. Six of DART\u2019s 13 member cities have passed resolutions since June 2024 to reduce their sales tax contributions by a quarter, with Dallas also considering similar measures. This sales tax, a 1% levy on every dollar spent, constitutes about 70% of DART\u2019s budget. Plano and Irving, two major contributors, would each save about $30 million annually with the proposed cuts.DART, which services 700 square miles in the Dallas-Fort Worth area with 692 buses and one of the longest light rail systems in the country, argues that these cuts would severely impact service, including less frequent buses, reduced paratransit services, workforce reductions, and deferred maintenance. The agency's ridership has recovered to about 83% of pre-pandemic levels, with fiscal year-to-date ridership at 41.4 million through June 2024, compared to 52.8 million in June 2019.The funding cuts are driven by member cities' demands for greater transparency and accountability from DART. Cities like Plano and Irving have been asking for detailed breakdowns of services and local ridership numbers for years. DART has attempted to provide cost allocation reports, but cities have found them unsatisfactory. A study by Ernst & Young on the return on investment for each city is expected in September 2024, along with the Transit 2.0 report examining regional transportation needs through 2050.Riders and advocates, like the Dallas Area Transit Alliance, fear that funding reductions will lead to significant service cuts, affecting thousands who rely on DART as their primary mode of transportation. An online petition against the cuts has garnered over 1,400 signatures.City officials argue that the current system is inefficient and plagued by issues such as crime, poor design, and uncleanliness. They believe that reducing contributions will force DART to improve its services. However, DART officials warn that such cuts would only exacerbate existing problems, making it harder to maintain and modernize the aging system.The debate over DART\u2019s funding is expected to continue, with cities potentially taking their case to the Texas Legislature. Proposals include amending the Texas Transportation Code to cap future debt pledges and institute a revenue cap. DART, on the other hand, aims to keep discussions local and work with member cities to address their unique needs.In summary, the implementation of the new light rail line in Dallas in June 2024 has been overshadowed by the broader issue of funding cuts and their potential impact on public transportation usage. While the new line may have contributed to the 83% recovery in ridership, the looming financial challenges and service reductions pose significant risks to the future of DART and its ability to serve the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) proposed a $1.99 billion operating budget for 2024, reflecting a 9.2% increase over the previous year. This budget maintains current fare levels and bus and rail services, with plans to increase service to meet growing ridership. Key investments include enhanced security, improved Ventra fare system features, and a new ChatBot for customer service. CTA ridership reached a pandemic-era high of over 25.83 million rides in September 2023, with a 12% increase in overall ridership for the year. Ridership is projected to grow by 5.7% in 2024. The CTA has made significant progress in workforce recruitment, surpassing its goal of hiring 700 new bus operators and expecting to hire over 900 by the end of 2023. Additionally, the CTA plans to hire more than 2,000 new employees in 2023, far exceeding the annual norm of 1,200. Federal funding from the American Rescue Plan will help close a projected $473 million budget gap in 2024. The CTA's 2024-2028 Capital Improvement Program includes $3.61 billion in projects, such as the Red Line Extension. A public hearing on the proposed budget will be held on November 9, 2023, with opportunities for written and oral comments.",

    "Document1": "Reducing Traffic Congestion and Improving Travel Options in Los Angeles\nWhile traffic congestion plagues many cities, Los Angeles stands apart. The Texas Transportation Institute tracks congestion statistics for U.S. metropolitan areas on an annual basis, and Los Angeles routinely ranks first for both total and per-capita congestion delays. Considering the value of wasted time and fuel, TTI estimates the annual cost of traffic congestion in greater Los Angeles at close to $10 billion.\nThe map in Figure 1, based on 2006 Caltrans sensor data, illustrates the weekday pattern of traffic congestion on the LA freeway network. Congestion is pervasive throughout much of the county; most freeways have segments on which traffic averages less than 35 mph at least two hours per day, and many bottlenecks are congested at least four hours per day.\nFigure 1. Traffic Conditions on the LA Freeway Network\nConditions on the surface streets are not much better. The map in Figure 2, based on 2004 volume-to-capacity (V/C) estimates from SCAG, depicts the pattern of afternoon traffic congestion on the county\u2019s largest arterials. Here again it is evident that traffic congestion is broadly dispersed, yet the pattern is particularly intense between downtown Los Angeles and the Westside.\nFigure 2. Traffic Conditions on LA Surface Streets\nWith the recent run-up in fuel prices followed by a severe recession, total travel in Los Angeles has declined over the past two years, and congestion has correspondingly eased. Yet if past trends hold, this reprieve is likely to be fleeting. Should the region\u2019s economy and population grow in the coming decades, as some forecasts predict, the probable outcome is even more vehicle travel and in turn more intense congestion.\nControversial Solutions for a Daunting Problem\nResearchers at the RAND Corporation were asked to recommend strategies capable of reducing LA traffic within five years or less (the short timeframe rules out land-use reforms along with major infrastructure investments). The resulting report, Moving Los Angeles: Short-Term Policy Options for Improving Transportation, offers recommendations at once controversial and likely inescapable. To achieve lasting traffic relief, it will be necessary to manage the demand for travel through pricing reforms (e.g., congestion tolls) that increase the cost of driving and parking in the busiest corridors and areas during peak travel hours. Other measures\u2014better transit service, ridesharing programs, traffic signal synchronization, and the like\u2014can complement pricing, but are not on their own sufficient to stem current and projected future traffic congestion.\nFew Strategies Offer Much Promise\nJust why should this be so? Consider, first, that traffic congestion results from an imbalance between the supply of roads and peak-hour automotive travel. In fact, congestion can be viewed as a solution (though an unpleasant one) to this imbalance; when demand exceeds supply, congestion makes us wait our turn for available road space to balance the equation. Over the past several decades, the gap between supply and demand has widened considerably; population growth, economic expansion, and rising incomes have fueled the demand for more vehicle travel, while road construction has stagnated. We have therefore been relying, more and more, on congestion to resolve this imbalance.\nOne response would be to build or expand more roads to accommodate additional vehicle travel. Setting aside policy concerns related to greenhouse gas emissions and energy security, the prospects for \u201cbuilding our way out of congestion\u201d are limited. To begin with, there simply isn\u2019t much space to build new roads in Los Angeles, particularly in the most densely developed urban areas. As shown in Figure 3, the density of the road network in the greater Los Angeles region, measured in lane miles per square mile, is already far greater than in any other large metropolitan area in the country.\nFigure 3. Road Network Density in Major Metropolitan Areas\nWe also lack the resources to engage in an extensive road building spree. In recent decades, federal and state elected officials have failed to increase fuel taxes enough to offset the effects of inflation and improved fuel economy, thus hobbling the major source of funding for road construction and repairs.\nEven if we could expand the road network, though, the benefits would be limited by a phenomenon described as \u201ctriple convergence.\u201d Congestion has been a problem for years, and many individuals deliberately alter their travel patterns to avoid severe traffic. When an investment in road capacity reduces peak-hour congestion, many will conclude that they no longer need to go out of their way to avoid congestion delays and will thus \u201cconverge\u201d on the improvement from (a) other times, (b) other routes, or (c) other modes of travel. The net effect is that the initial traffic-reduction benefits will usually not last over time. This is why we often see, for instance, that the improved traffic flow resulting from a new freeway lane does not last for more than a couple of years.\nIf supply-side remedies do not create sustainable reductions in traffic, it becomes necessary to examine ways of reducing peak-hour travel demand. Commonly employed options include improved transit service, voluntary ridesharing programs, flexible work hours, and telecommuting. Unfortunately, the congestion-reduction benefits of these strategies are likewise undermined by triple convergence. If a new subway line induces some peak-hour drivers to switch to transit, other drivers will soon converge on more freely flowing roads to take their place. Indeed, the effects of triple convergence explain why traffic congestion has grown steadily worse despite considerable state and local investment in a broad range of congestion-reduction strategies.\nOnly Pricing Strategies Promise Sustainable Reductions in Traffic Congestion\nThis brings us to the rationale for pricing strategies. Among the many possible options for reducing traffic congestion, only pricing resist the effects of triple convergence. By increasing the cost of driving or parking in the busiest areas or corridors during the busiest times of day, pricing measures manage the demand for peak-hour travel, in turn reducing congestion. Once traffic flow improves, the prices remain in place, thus deterring excessive convergence on the newly freed capacity.\nPricing strategies offer two additional benefits. First, pricing generates revenue to support needed transportation investments. And in comparison to sales taxes, a common option for raising local transportation revenue, pricing has been shown to reduce the relative tax burden on lower income groups (though wealthier individuals consume more taxable goods than their less-affluent counterparts, to an even greater extent they (a) drive more, (b) are more likely to travel during peak hours, and (c) are more likely to pay peak-hour tolls rather than alter their travel choices). Second, pricing enables more efficient use of the road capacity that we already have, because roads on which traffic flows smoothly (at roughly 40 mph or higher) can carry far more vehicles per lane per hour than roads snarled in stop-and-go congestion. Paradoxically, then, we see that the introduction of pricing enables roads to accommodate more peak-hour trips. It is therefore useful to think of pricing as a means of managing peak-hour travel demand rather than reducing it.\nPricing Strategies Will Be Particularly Valuable in Los Angeles\nPricing holds promise for most major cities, but the case in Los Angeles is especially compelling. To understand why, it is necessary to consider the interactions between population density and travel behavior, factors that help to explain the severity of LA traffic.\nContrary to its reputation for sprawl, Los Angeles is quite densely populated when viewed at the regional scale. Downtown Los Angeles isn't as dense as, say, Manhattan or central Chicago, but the suburbs surrounding Los Angeles are much denser than the typical suburb, leading to high aggregate density on a regional basis.\nAs population density increases, individuals tend to drive less on a per-capita basis. Trip origins and destinations are closer together, leading to shorter car trips, and in dense neighborhoods people can rely on alternatives such as walking, biking, or transit for a larger share of trips. Yet this can be overwhelmed by the fact that there are also more drivers competing for the same road space within a given area, thus intensifying traffic congestion. The net effect is that greater population density tends to exacerbate congestion\u2014think downtown Manhattan.\nLA traffic congestion is further exacerbated by the fact that Angelinos do not curtail their driving as much as one would expect in response to higher population density. Figure 4 compares per-capita vehicle miles of travel (VMT) and population density for the 14 largest metropolitan regions in the country.\nFigure 4. Population Density vs. Per-Capita VMT for the 14 Largest U.S. Metropolitan Regions\nLooking across the different regions, there is a fairly consistent relationship in which per-capita VMT declines with regional density. Los Angeles, though, bucks this trend. The only other metropolitan regions with higher per-capita VMT (Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Detroit) are all much less dense than Los Angeles. For regions in which the level of density approaches that of Los Angeles (San Francisco, Washington D.C., and New York), per-capita VMT is much lower.\nIn short, we see a confluence of three density-related factors that combine to explain the severity of congestion in Los Angeles: (1) congestion is likely to rise with increased population density; (2) Los Angeles is much denser than its peers at the regional level; and (3) Los Angeles exhibits a surprisingly high level of per-capita VMT relative to its density. The third of these underscores the importance of pricing strategies as a means of managing the demand for automotive travel in Los Angeles.\nIn the end only pricing strategies promise sustainable reductions in traffic congestion. Other measures \u2013 including improvements in alternative transportation modes \u2013 can be beneficial, but none will be nearly as effective as pricing. This recommendation will no doubt stir controversy, but pricing offers the only realistic prospects for managing peak-hour travel demand in the most traffic-choked of American metropolises.\nDr. Paul Sorensen is an operations researcher at the RAND Corporation, wherehe serves as Associate Director of the Transportation, Space, and Technology program.\nDr. Sorensen has published peer-reviewed studies in the areas of geographic information analysis, location optimization modeling, emergency response logistics, and transportation finance policy, and he also holds aU.S. patent on a methodology for forecasting the demand for ambulance services. Dr. Sorensen received a BA in computer science from Dartmouth College, an MA in urban planning from UCLA, and a PhD in geography from UCSB.\nComment viewing options\nCongestion in LA ch III\nMeasuring truck performance vs. truck contribution to congestion (impacts)\nIn current practice, truck performance is most often measured in VMTs and VHTs.\nThe approach focuses on a driver but does not inform about \u201ccosts\u201d or comparative impacts on the region.\nIt does not assess contribution made by PCs and trucks to congestion or consumption of roadway capacity.\nPlanners need to develop measures which would enable them to evaluate these phenomena and evaluate impacts of the vehicle types in a comparable way.\nThe most straightforward solution is to utilize: VMT multiplied by Passenger Car Equivalencies (VMT*PCE), Vehicle Hours Traveled multiplied by PCE (VHT*PCE), and delay multiplied by PCE (delay*PCE).\nA recent study, conducted in Oregon (ODOT), recommends three other useful measures, although, a bit more onerous and limited - they do not allow region-wide comparisons.\nAnother measure that could be used to compare inter-regional conditions is VMT*PCE per lane mile of freeways, highways, or both.\nTruck Logistics\nTruck logistics in LA are \u201cimperfect\u201d/faulty.\nA geographical illustration of these logistics can be found on a map of warehousing, SCAG P&P TAC meeting of 8/11/10, \u201cGoods Movement Update\u201d, page 4.\nThe region cannot afford to build-up on the logistics.\nNew approach needs to be developed.\nFirstly, analysis of truck operations should be broken into three trip categories: (a) local/delivery trips, (b) out-of-region trips, and (c) in-transit/through trips.\nThen, one shall develop brand new logistics for the future and compare them to those currently projected.\nFinally, a realistic evaluation should be made - what can and what cannot be changed of the projected logistics.\nThe evaluation should be based on real and inclusive cost-benefit analysis.\nDifferent objectives can be set for each of truck trip category.\nFor example: for delivery trucks one may want to minimize VMT or, potentially, minimize VMT of goods transported.\nThe current trend of delivering more and more goods by super-heavy duty trucks circling the city and delivering a \u201ccase of beer\u201d per destination should be reversed.\nThe region needs more, smaller warehouses located in close distance to the customer.\nThen, smaller trucks can deliver \u201cretail\u201d orders, minimizing miles traveled.\nSpecific, more focused objectives can be set for the other categories.\nTraffic Congestion Geography\nThe freeway congestion, shown on Figure 1, indicates a radial pattern with a center in Downtown LA.\nSeveral maps that I\u2019ve saved at various hours from PeMS web network and other services including Google, Yahoo, and Sigalert since 2007, confirm the above observation.\nIn addition, one can see frequent, and apparently worsening, adverse conditions on SR-605 between SR-105 and SR-60 and on SR-91 east of SR-710.\nDuring peak periods there is substantial congestion on SR-101 between Downtown LA and west of SR-405.\nAs for surface streets, I respectfully disagree with the conclusion that West LA has the worst conditions (see also \u201cMoving Los Angeles\u201d).\nAs can be seen on Figure 2, and Figure 3.10 in \u201cMoving Los Angeles,\u201d the worst traffic conditions are in and around Downtown LA.\nWhen you compare the traffic congestion patterns, especially those on the freeways, with a map of warehousing, mentioned above, it appears that they are spatially co-related.\nSomebody should conduct a GIS correlation analysis on the phenomenon.\nTraffic Variability and Reliability\nI reason that trucks are, at least partially, responsible for variability of traffic patterns in LA Region, especially during peak periods.\nMost of the other traffic during these periods \u2013 commuter traffic \u2013 has stable patterns.\nOther trip types (than Home-to-Work trips) have certain level of variability.\nThe trip variability issue is worth exploring further/researching, since reliability is critical to improvement of mobility.\ntbc\nAiR-B\nCongestion in LA - ch II\nDemystifying Transit\nTransit \u2013 at the last RTP, a witty professional implied that there is a common public misconception regarding public transit subsidies.\nThe pro suggested conducting a study that would determine real transit subsidies v. real auto trip subsidies.\nThe auto trip costs comprise of everything needed for driving automobile, including the costs of building and maintaining freeways, roads, operation costs of all sorts, congestion costs, health costs, etc. etc.\nThe study could research the costs under current LA conditions (i.e., low density development), but also compare it to other places with more dense development and transit friendly policies such as San Francisco or Toronto, Canada.\nPerhaps these cities can tell us something about LA potential future.\nThis is the challenge to academic community \u2013 who is up to it?\nThe City of LA is trying to accelerate the schedule of future transit improvements.\nCan we help?\nTrucks Taking Over Freeways?\nTrucks \u2013 truck traffic is projected to grow massively.\nThe region needs to consider carefully all potential benefits and costs, including ripple effects of the increase.\nThe last RTP, Goods Movement Report, shows some of the potential impacts.\nTables A8, A10 and A12 imply that future truck traffic will dominate LA freeways, jostling out autos.\nThe autos may be left with little choice but to use surface streets instead of freeways.\nPassenger cars and drivers would incur extra delay, increased driving costs, increased pollution, etc.\nWhat will be the real costs of lost mobility for the residents of the region?\nTbc.\nAiR_B\nCongestion in LA\nVery good article.\nI've read others, apparently related.\nThe congestion caused by truck traffic seems to be under-reported if not underestimated.\nConsidering the facts that a very rapid growth of truck traffic is projected, that the truck fleet changes - more super-heavy vehicles, a closer look into the truck caused congestion seems necessary.\nThe measurements that are commonly used to estimate truck traffic increase - VMT - are not compatible with passenger cars VMT.\nVHT may not fully reflect impact of trucks on congestion.\nI would like to see a change to some statistically proper measurements.\nGood Article\nLA is one of those outlier cities that contradict definitions we use to define places.\nI've heard the term \"dense sprawl\" used to describe LA and I think it's very fitting, and too many people focus on density only in defining sprawl too.\nWhile it has a reasonably high density gradient over the entire metro area, it lacks a true central downtown / job concentration center, has very little mass transit use, and its land uses are oriented heavily towards automobile use.\nI think it's sprawl for every definition of the word, but that's not true in all circumstances.\nI think something can be learned about sprawl, congestion, and metro areas by simply viewing Los Angeles -- as you have -- and comparing it to other metro areas in the US and even abroad.\nGood stuff.\nstill skeptical about those density numbers\nI know you said you are considering regional density, but without seeing how you define the \"region\", that might cause the density numbers to be misleading.\nFor example, if you look at Phoenix, it may be denser than Seattle when considering the giant footprint of all its outlying areas, but ignoring the fact that Seattle is incredibly denser and centralized at its core reduces the usefulness of the numbers you use for this comparison with VMT.\nThe equivalent outlying areas of Seattle might be non-commuting farmland that unfairly bring down its density numbers, as opposed to the sprawling commuting suburbs of Phoenix which give a false impression of relative density.\nI'd be curious to see the same comparison using actual city limits instead of regions.\nRegions defined based on urbanized area within MSAs\nA note of clarification: the regional statistics presented within this article, and in the underlying RAND report, are based on only the \"urbanized area\" within a metropolitan statistical area. As defined by the Census, the urbanized area includes core blocks or block groups with a population density of at least 1000 persons per square mile plus periphery blocks or block groups with a population density of at least 500 persons per square mile. Any blocks or block groups with lower population density are not included in the calculations.\nExcellent point\nThe whole city versus SMSA versus region gets very [statistically] confusing.\nGreat article\nExcellent use of graphics.\nI understand a LOT more about LA traffic than I did before.\nMakes me very happy that I live in Denver.\nDave Barnes\n+1.303.744.9024\nhttp://www.MarketingTactics.com\nAbout Pricing and Impact on Poor...\nThanks for this thought-provoking essay. One of the issues that has confounded earlier attempts at \"volume pricing\" has been the accusation such practices adversely affect the poor and lower middle classes due to lower elasticities of highway travel. This has certainly been cited in discussions about raising the gas tax even higher here in California.\nI see in your piece that, \"pricing has been shown to reduce the relative tax burden on lower income groups.\" If this case can be made more publicly, or, if there can be some sort of trade-off between gas taxes and user fees, this concept could receive greater public support.\nDon't forget about land use patterns\nThanks for the thoughtful article.\nMy only quibble comes with the statement \"contrary to its reputation for sprawl, Los Angeles is quite densely populated when viewed at the regional scale\".\nI've heard this claim made a few times in defense of LA not being \"sprawl\". The problem I have is not with the fact cited, but with the implicit definition of sprawl used.\nIf the word \"sprawl\" is to have any use as a concept, then it cannot be simply a proxy for density.\nFigure 4 demonstrates this - there is clearly something going on in LA that is not captured by density but nonetheless causes it to merit the label of sprawl.\nI would argue that this \"something\" is the pattern of land use.\nIt doesn't matter if you live in a residential neighborhood with 30 units to the acre, if the only thing that's around you for 1/2 a mile is other homes, then you're still probably going to drive to your destination.\nAuto dependence and land use segregation feed back on each other too, since residential areas will be unwilling to accept commercial establishments if they bring excessive traffic in with them.\nThe result is the worst of both worlds, where residents get all the downsides of density with few of the benefits.\nA truly comprehensive solution to congestion requires addressing both transportation policies and land use policies.\nSubscribe to NG Articles\nCONNECT WITH US:\nNewGeography.com is a joint venture of Joel Kotkin and Praxis Strategy Group\nFeatured Content\nThe Coming of Neo-Feudalism\nJoel Kotkin's newest book The Coming of Neo-Feudalism: A Warning to the Global Middle Class is now available to order.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Reducing Traffic Congestion and Improving Travel Options in Los Angeles\n\nLos Angeles is notorious for its severe traffic congestion, consistently ranking first in the U.S. for both total and per-capita congestion delays. The Texas Transportation Institute estimates the annual cost of traffic congestion in greater Los Angeles at nearly $10 billion. Congestion is widespread, affecting both freeways and surface streets, particularly between downtown Los Angeles and the Westside.\n\nRecent economic downturns and rising fuel prices have temporarily eased congestion, but this is expected to be short-lived. As the region's economy and population grow, so will vehicle travel and congestion.\n\nRAND Corporation researchers recommend short-term strategies to reduce LA traffic, focusing on pricing reforms like congestion tolls to manage travel demand. Other measures, such as better transit service and ridesharing programs, can complement pricing but are insufficient on their own.\n\nTraffic congestion results from an imbalance between road supply and peak-hour travel demand. Building more roads is not a viable solution due to space constraints, limited resources, and the phenomenon of 'triple convergence,' where initial traffic reduction benefits are short-lived as drivers adjust their travel patterns.\n\nReducing peak-hour travel demand through improved transit, ridesharing, flexible work hours, and telecommuting is also undermined by triple convergence. Only pricing strategies, which increase the cost of driving or parking during peak hours, promise sustainable reductions in traffic congestion. Pricing not only manages demand but also generates revenue for transportation investments and enables more efficient use of existing road capacity.\n\nLos Angeles, with its high regional population density and high per-capita vehicle miles traveled (VMT), is particularly suited for pricing strategies. Despite its reputation for sprawl, LA's regional density exacerbates congestion, making pricing an effective tool for managing travel demand.\n\nIn conclusion, pricing strategies offer the most realistic prospects for managing peak-hour travel demand in Los Angeles. Other measures can be beneficial but are not as effective as pricing in achieving sustainable traffic congestion reductions.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) conducts timely analyses of fatal traffic crash reports provided by the Chicago Police Department (CPD) to understand the circumstances of such crashes. These analyses help identify trends, patterns, and correlations, which are then grouped into fatal crash typologies. This supports CDOT\u2019s efforts to develop data-informed actions to increase traffic safety.In March 2024, there were several fatal traffic crashes in Chicago. Notable incidents include:- On March 1, a driver struck a light pole and trees at 4140 W 83rd St.- On March 3, a driver struck a pedestrian on Marquette Rd, and another incident involved a left-turning driver failing to yield, resulting in a passenger's death.- On March 13, a driver struck a pedestrian on the sidewalk at 1700 W Van Buren St.- On March 15, a driver struck a parked semi-truck at 4901 W Madison St.Fatal traffic crashes in March 2024 (provisional data) show:- 4 pedestrians killed- 0 bicyclists killed- 7 motor vehicle occupants killed- Total of 11 fatalitiesComparing data from January to March 2024 with the same period in 2023:- 2024: 12 pedestrians, 0 bicyclists, 12 motor vehicle occupants, total 24 fatalities- 2023: 16 pedestrians, 0 bicyclists, 17 motor vehicle occupants, total 33 fatalitiesHistorical data from IDOT for January to March averages:- 5-year average (2018-2022): 8.6 pedestrians, 1.2 bicyclists, 16.8 motor vehicle occupants, total 26.6 fatalities- 10-year average (2013-2022): 9 pedestrians, 0.8 bicyclists, 16 motor vehicle occupants, total 25.8 fatalitiesTraffic fatalities in Chicago have varied over the years, with notable increases in certain years. For example, in 2021, there were 186 fatalities, compared to 160 in 2022. Serious injuries also show fluctuations, with 2,215 serious injuries in 2022 compared to 2,299 in 2021.The data highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and analysis to improve traffic safety and reduce fatalities and serious injuries in Chicago.",
    "Summarized_Document3": "The document outlines the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) scheduled construction-related lane closures on state roads in Miami Beach. The projects listed include various Financial Identification Numbers (FINs) with specific details on lane closures and detours. Some projects have no lane closures affecting access to/from and in Miami Beach, while others have marked lane closures and detours on the map. The document also includes an archive of past construction schedules from 2020 to 2024, detailing weekly updates on lane closures and detours. The impact of road construction on traffic flow in Miami from March 2024 to July 2024 can be inferred from the specific projects listed during that period, which include lane closures and detours marked on the map.",
