Volatility : 53.17% (As of Oct. 29, 2024)\nView and export this data going back to 2010. Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\n\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap. Note that \"N/A\" values will not show up in the chart.\n\nTesla's Volatility Distribution in the Vehicles & Parts Industry\nFor the Vehicles & Parts industry and Consumer Cyclical sector, Tesla's Volatility distribution charts can be found below:\n* The bar in red indicates where Tesla's Volatility falls into.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Calculation\nThe annualized volatility is calculated as following:\n\u03c3A=\u03c3M*\u221a12=\u221a 1/(n-1) \u2211(Ri - R')^2*\u221a12\nWhere: \u03c3M is the monthly volatility, n is the number of months in the period, Ri is the security's historical monthly returns and R' is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns.\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD.\n* For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

This was in direct response to the Bank of Japan hiking interest rates. The interest rate hikes wiped out trillions of dollars worth of market capitalization across big tech. However, Tesla stock\u2019s share price has since recovered, gaining 8.04% over the past five days.\nI have taken a definitively bullish stance on companies like TSLA due to the falling volatility in the market. The sharp sell-off was characteristically fueled by panic. And many market bargains are ready to be scooped up by investors during this volatile time period.\nI give Tesla stock a buy rating due to its projected earnings and revenue increases that are on the horizon. Also, I\u2019ll delineate a sell case for Tesla stock. This will provide a balanced view of the firm\u2019s opportunities and risks in the market.\nTesla\u2019s Cyclical Wobbles and New Models\nDespite Tesla\u2019s \u201cdifficult environment,\u201d the company actually managed to exceed my expectations for its recent quarterly results in some cases. Therefore, I take a contrarian stance with Tesla stock. Many factors were cyclically affecting other electric vehicle (EV stocks) too. This includes a lack of semiconductor chips from firms such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm still managed to beat analyst expectations and achieve record quarterly revenues of $25.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year (YOY). However, it\u2019s also true that its earnings fell 43% to 52 cents per share. Therefore, it missed analyst expectations by a wide margin.\nWhere my contrarian case takes hold is in Tesla\u2019s plans for new vehicles. That includes more affordable models such as its $25,000 entry-level Redwood model. It remains on track for production in the first half of 2025. Over time, Tesla\u2019s market share has come under attack by far cheaper Chinese-made EVs. Autos produced by Byd Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) currently dominate the Asian market. Yet, consider the 10,000 vehicle production target for TSLA\u2019s Redwood model. Additionally, the company expects profitability for its Cybertruck near the end of the year. These factors shape Tesla into a position of strong recovery. Also, it provides more equal footing with its budget competitor.\nBullish Technical Momentum\nWhile Tesla stock might have disappointed the market with its earnings, I see several indicators pointing to bullish momentum in the short term. And this is evidenced by strong signs in the options market for Tesla\u2019s put and call contracts. Particularly important is the open interest for the August 16 expiration, which is this Friday. The put/call open interest ratio is 0.61, showing significantly more open interest in calls compared to puts. The implied volatility of 6.45% may suggest that investors will be in for a much smoother ride this week compared to previous ones, largely in part of the VIX falling 62.23% over the past five days.\nAnother bullish signal is that after Tesla stock dipped into oversold territory on August 7, momentum has steadily risen over the past trading session. Also, investors can find underlying strength in terms of volume. This could potentially signal a bullish reversal in the near future. However, relatively little interest is being shown TSLA by bulls or bears. So, I see a gradual upward climb for Tesla stock as opposed to violent swings in its valuation.\nReasons to Sell\nDespite my bullishness of Tesla\u2019s prospects, a compelling sell case can be made from Tesla bears. Investorplace author Faizan Farooque recently wrote that the company\u2019s aggressive price cuts have led to shrinking profit margins. And gross margins dropped from 23.8% to 17.6%, and operating margin fell from 16% to 8.2%.\nAdditionally, I believe that due to the persistent undercutting by Chinese EV makers and Tesla\u2019s efforts to keep up, it is undergoing a bit of an identity crisis. For some, Tesla stock is synonymous with American-made quality (and luxurious) EV vehicles.\nTo me, an appeal to Tesla is its luxury and high technology, but as the features of EVs become more commoditized over time, there could be less differentiating features across EVs as a whole to make a specific Tesla model stand out and justify the higher price tag. So, Tesla must create its own edge in the market and not become another me-too brand. Otherwise, it becomes a race to the bottom, and that\u2019s not a competition that Tesla will ever win against its Chinese competitors.\nHowever, I maintain my buy rating for Tesla stock as it adapts to the nascent EV market. It might no longer be considered a high-end vehicle in the future. Yet, its R&D efforts can put it on the bleeding edge of the most modern vehicles. This is especially true for its cars that rest in the higher tiers such as the Cybertruck. These polarizing and unique designs may be a hint of what we can expect from the company in the future.\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nKenneth Dorell\ninvestor@meta.com\u00a0/ investor.fb.com\nPress:\nRyan Moore\npress@meta.com\u00a0/ about.fb.com/news/\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations.

These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

This lowers the interest rate target to a range of 4.75% to 5%.1\nThe Fed\u2019s decision to ease monetary policy is likely to support growth and stabilize a slowing labor market. Our strategists believe this is the beginning of the Fed moving into a new stance \u2013 in the Fed\u2019s eyes, recent slowing in the labor market is now a bigger risk than inflation. This cut in policy rates, and plans to lower rates further, is designed to support economic growth.\nNoteworthy changes in the Fed\u2019s statement\nIn the FOMC statement, the Fed reiterated that the economy \u201ccontinued to expand at a solid pace\u201d and that it remains committed to \u201cachieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of two percent over the longer run.\u201d2\nHowever, the statement included noteworthy changes from the prior statement regarding inflation and the labor market. The Committee noted that it has \u201cgained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards two percent\u201d and the risks to its dual mandate \u201care roughly in\u201d balance, compared to being in \u201cbetter\u201d balance as noted in the prior statement. This follows August\u2019s inflation data which showed inflation is now at 2.5%, considerably closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target.3\nThe statement describes job gains as having \u201cslowed,\u201d a change from \u201cmoderated\u201d in the past statement, and underscores it is now \u201cstrongly committed to supporting maximum employment.\u201d4 This follows August\u2019s labor market data,\u00a0which revealed that the labor market is slowing more quickly than expected, but not breaking.\nShifts in the Summary of Economic Projections\nThe much-anticipated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed that the median FOMC participant is penciling in 50 basis points of further cuts across the remaining two meetings this year, followed by 100 basis points of cuts in 2025 and 50 basis points more in 2026 to a terminal rate of 2.9%, where they sees rates remaining through 2027.5\nOfficials raised their end of 2024 median forecast for the unemployment rate to 4.4% from 4%, a slight decline from the current rate of 4.2%.6\nThese projections reflect the Committee\u2019s belief that the risks to inflation have become broadly balanced while risks to the unemployment rate are now weighed to the upside. This will likely lead to further rate cuts for risk management purposes, to help prolong the expansion.7\nEconomic and monetary policy outlook\nEconomic variables are trending in the right direction, which allowed for the Fed to begin easing monetary policy. Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that inflation is \u201cmuch closer\u201d to its 2% target and the labor market is \u201cless tight\u201d than pre-pandemic in 2019. He highlighted that the \u201cprimary focus\u201d has shifted from \u201cbringing down inflation\u201d to supporting maximum employment.8\nGoing forward, Chair Powell underscored that the Fed\u2019s decision on the direction of rates continues to be made on a \u201cmeeting by meeting\u201d basis with data leading the way. This measured approach allows the committee to carefully assess the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.9\nOur strategists believe that there will likely be two additional rate cuts in 2024, and expect the cuts to continue into 2025. This cut in policy rates should help support labor markets from slowing too quickly.\nMarket reaction\nU.S. equities were initially higher in the afternoon following the Fed\u2019s announcement on September 18, as stocks made an intra-day all-time high, while bond yields \u2013 especially at the short end \u2013 moved lower. However, by the end of the day, the S&P 500 declined by 0.29%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 0.25% and the Nasdaq declined by 0.31%. In early trading on Thursday, the market was up big, with S&P 500 futures in the green by 1.5%.\nWhat a rate cut could mean for investors\nEven though bond yields have fallen, our strategists still think excess cash should find a better home while the Fed is cutting rates. This decision to cut 50 basis points reinforces that reinvestment risk is real, and bond yields could still move lower from here. But it\u2019s not too late \u2013 over the last 12 cutting cycles (from first cut to last cut), fixed income has outperformed cash in all but one. When the Fed cuts rates outside of recession, equities tend to deliver strong performance.\nReferences\n1.Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \u201cFederal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement.\u201d (September 18, 2024)\n2.Ibid.\n3.Ibid.\n4.Ibid.\n5.Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \u201cSummary of Economic Projections\u201d (September 18, 2024).\n6.Ibid.\n7.Ibid.\n8.Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \u201cTranscript of Chair Powell\u2019s Press Conference Opening Statement\u201d (September 2024).\n9.Ibid.\nConnect with a Wealth Advisor\nOur Wealth Advisors begin by getting to know you personally.

    "document": "Knowledge\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Top 5 Trends for Defence in 2024\r\n\t\t\t\nGreat challenges will bring huge opportunities in 2024, as the defence and aerospace industry seeks to rise to a diverse range of hurdles. Amid these headwinds, Defence Engage looks at the trends which could come to characterise 2024, from battling skills shortages to pivotal digitalisation efforts.\nMarked by ongoing conflicts in Israel-Palestine and Ukraine, 2024 will see ongoing tensions with China and Iran which pose significant threats to the international order. Geopolitical concerns aside, the industry grapples with supply chain issues, talent shortages, operational risks, and rising costs amid inflation. In the biggest global election year in history we could see significant strategic changes from key players such as the USA, UK, India, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Russia. Here are the five key trends likely to dominate 2024\u2026\n\u00a0\n#1 AI and digitalisation efforts to bring security and efficiencies\nThe defence industry faces challenges in rapidly adopting new defensive systems and procedures to keep up with adversaries' technological innovations. From upgrading aging software to mitigate cyber threats, to expanding access to, and the adoption of, key cyber credentials, keeping up with digital trends remains pivotal. Meanwhile, governments are prioritising bringing AI to maturity while ensuring its development is safe and responsible. The rapid adoption of AI, spurred by recent advancements like Chat-GPT, is underway in industry, and indeed OpenAI has already started the year by easing its stance on the use of ChatGPT for military purposes.\nThe impact of AI for defence is forecast to be significant, from helping front-line users detect threats to activating cyber defences faster and with greater agility. Additionally, the integration of AI into defence supply chains could improve platform and parts delivery efficiency, reducing delays and costs, whilst improving security. Meanwhile, digital twins, coupled with machine learning, can enhance visibility of supply chain problems or complexities. According to a BAE report, 86% of defence and aerospace decision makers say their nation has adopted AI for defence applications, so the technology is set to become increasingly mature in 2024.\n\u00a0\n#2 Decarbonisation initiatives continue\nFollowing recent data which indicates that 2023 was the hottest year ever, the impetus behind decarbonisation efforts sees renewed urgency. The contribution of the global defence industry to carbon emissions has come under a microscope, with some having suggested that the sector had been overlooked, but there have been some major decarbonisation initiatives, including the establishment of NATO\u2019s Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and the UK\u2019s Sustainable Support Strategy.\nThe impact of climate change upon defence goes beyond the weight of its own contributions, with both the UN and NATO describing climate change as a \u2018threat multiplier\u2019, alluding to the destabilising impact climate can have on societies and economies. Industry is rising to meet the challenge, with innovations such as new power solutions or increased circularity in manufacturing. \u00a0Last year the EU signalled its intention for defence supply chains to become more sustainable, alongside developing more localised energy in a drive for logistical resilience. Individual initiatives such as the Royal Air Force\u2019s first use of sustainable aviation fuel in a fighter aircraft are lighting the way towards a greener, more sustainable, military.\n\u00a0\n#3 Recruitment challenges to persist\nDefence is facing significant challenges when it comes to acquiring talent, skills and retention, from front-line military roles to cyber, quantum and manufacturing. In recent weeks the UK\u2019s Royal Navy has seen significant problems with hiring, at a critical time for the force, with ships being deployed to the Red Sea to counter Houthi Rebels. Last month, the Times reported that Armed forces and defence companies are locked in \u2018a war for talent\u2019.\nDwindling forces are due to the lack of recruits for basic training, a lack of digital skills, and the pull of incentives given by neighbouring sectors. The EU and US have recently signalled their plans to try and combat personnel shortages in key areas. The US\u2019 new Defence Industrial Strategy, cites \u2018workforce readiness\u2019 as a key strategic focus, with a desire to develop a \u2018sufficiently skilled and staffed workforce\u2019. Meanwhile, the European Commission expects skills shortages to increase into the future, with defence urgently requiring skills and talent acquisition, as procurement organisations seek to develop and manage emerging disruptive technologies.\n\u00a0\n#4 Agile supply chains to be prioritised\nThe scramble to arm Ukraine and Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China have highlighted US and allied supply chain vulnerabilities. The last couple of years have seen efforts to build a more resilient supply chain. The US CHIPS act and the EU CHIPS Act designed to securitise semiconductor supply, the European Defence Agency has set out to ensure \u2018security of supply\u2019 across the EU, and at the start of 2024, the US\u2019 Defence Industrial Strategy took aim at supply chain fragility, seeking to make it more sustainable alongside more flexible acquisition processes.\n2024 will see more emphasis on agile supply chains: increasing pressure to move away from lengthy procurement processes that cannot react quickly enough or where the end product could be outdated by the time it comes into service. There will be a race to secure and effect easy access to increasingly scarce resources such as minerals driven by the appetite for batteries and the move away from fossil fuels. The surge of additive manufacturing creates a \u2018just in time\u2019 supply option, while new military tactics such as the use of drones and increasing need for cyber security will continue to push military to commercial and more readily available solutions.\n\u00a0\n#5 Alliances and collaboration lead development and procurement\nCollaborative development programmes such as the sixth-generation fighter efforts: Tempest (by Italy, Japan and the UK) and FCAS (by France, Germany and Spain), are key initiatives designed to combine the best of each nation\u2019s domestic capabilities and combat declining resources. Meanwhile, the AUKUS programme demonstrates how two established nuclear navies (UK and US) are aiding Australia in bolstering Indo-Pacific security. Furthermore, NATO\u2019s Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA), which opened its doors with three innovation challenges in 2023, has established test centres and accelerator units across Europe and North America. The collaboration of NATO members is nothing new, but this more centralised effort to progress on emerging disruptive technologies is hoped to go from strength to strength in 2024.\nGroup-purchases have become increasingly common amongst NATO allies in recent years, with a marked increase since the war in Ukraine began. Just two weeks ago, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain agreed to jointly purchase $5.5 billion worth of Patriot missiles following their effective use observed in Ukraine. Additionally, the research opportunities posed by the war in Ukraine have seen allies and industry testing experimental tech in partnership with Ukrainian soldiers, helping speed up development initiatives, particularly for drones. Following on from the big trend of multi-domain integration, Defence Engage expects multi-national development, purchases and bids to strengthen regional military power and aid embattled allies such as Israel and Ukraine, to continue in 2024 amid ongoing geopolitical upheaval.\n\u00a0\nKeep ahead of the trends\nDefence Engage connects suppliers and buyers to help make defence accessible, follow us on LinkedIn or register for our weekly Defence Contracts Digest to stay apprised of new solutions and collaboration opportunities this year.\nWant to discover more about how Defence Engage can enhance your lead-gen efforts and boost your discoverability in Defence?

For the 12-month's ending March 2024, dividends set a record $593.1 billion payments, up 3.4% on an aggregate basis from the prior 12-month March 2023's $573.7 billion.\nTotal shareholders return of buybacks and dividends increased to $388.4 billion in Q1 2024,\u00a0up 4.1% from Q4 2023's $373.2 billion and up 7.2% from Q1 2023's $362.3 billion. Total shareholder returns for the 12-months ending March 2024 decreased 1.5% to $1.410 trillion from the prior 12-month March 2023's $1.431 trillion.\nThe 1% tax on net buybacks, which started in 2023, reduced the Q1 2024 S&P 500 operating earnings by 0.47%, up from Q4 2023's 0.44% impact, and As Reported GAAP earnings by 0.54% up from the prior 0.50%; for the 12-month March 2024 period they reduced earnings 0.41% for operating and 0.46% for As Reported.\n\"The share count impact on EPS increased for the first time after five consecutive quarters of declines as companies increased their overall buyback expenditure by 8%, which countered the impact of both share issuance and employee options being exercised. While\u00a0buybacks supported share price, 13.3% of the issues saw a significant increase (of at least 4%) in their EPS due to share count reduction, compared to 18.5% in Q1 2023. For Q1 2024, more issues did buybacks and spent more. While the 13.3% remains lower than the 17.5% average and pales compared to the almost 25% rate posted in Q1 2019, the increase comes after five quarters of declines, and hints to a forward upswing. Companies with strong cashflows continued to aggressively do buybacks, as the top 20 issues accounted for 50.9% of the buybacks in Q1 2024,\" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\"Given the market's current expectations for interest rates to decline later in the year and the continued uncertainty over geopolitical and domestic issues, companies may be shy to finance buybacks going forward as discretionary buybacks, which reduce share count, may need to be financed from ongoing operations. Top-tier cash-flow issues however are seen as continuing their buybacks and positively impacting their EPS.\"\n1% Buyback Excise Tax:\nThe 1% excise tax on net buybacks reduced Q1 2024 operating earnings by 0.47%, up from Q4 2023's 0.44% and up from the 0.45% for Q1 2023. The 12-month impact was 0.41%, up from 2023's 40% and down from the proforma 2022 of 0.51%. The tax on As Reported GAAP earnings impact increased to 0.54%, up from the Q4 2023 0.50% and up from the Q1 2023 0.49%. The 12-month impact was 0.46%, up from 2023's 0.45% and down from the proforma 2022 0.58%.\nSilverblatt added: \"The 1% tax remains an expense but has not impacted overall buybacks at this point. However, given the initial 1% buyback tax had bipartisan support and remains an attractive cash generator for the government, there is an expectation that some increase or potential change to the type of buybacks that are taxed will remain on the table following the election cycle. Given the current corporate sensitivity to costs, a buyback tax rate of 2%-to-2.5% was seen as impacting both buybacks and the EPS impact of share-count-reduction (which is already at a lower level due to high stock prices). This is because some of the expenditures may shift from buybacks to dividends. However, any shift would not be on a-dollar-for-dollar basis as dividends remain a long-term pure cash-flow item which must be incorporated into corporate budgets.\"\nQ1 2024 GICS\u00ae Sector Analysis:\nInformation Technology maintained its lead in buybacks, representing 24.2% of all buybacks for the quarter. Q1 2024 expenditures increased 1.8% to $57.3 billion, compared to Q4 2023's $56.3 billion, it was up 24.8% from Q1 2023's $45.9 billion expenditure.

We test these views by examining US stock buyback announcements data, and find little evidence to support these claims. There is some evidence that share buybacks are announced following a short-term period of stock price declines, which could either represent opportunistic purchasing at an attractive price or an attempt by management to stem the decline. However, on the whole, companies that announce share buybacks appear to have stronger-than-average fundamentals and long-term stock performance exceeding the market, with excess profits and cash flows that could reasonably be returned to shareholders.\nCorporate stock buybacks in the US have grown in frequency and size over the past decades (see Figure 1 below), leading to a host of concerns from\u00a0market\u00a0commentators. Among the most frequent concerns are that share purchases may be artificially propping up equity prices, suppressing market volatility, and weakening corporate balance sheets to name a few. In this\u00a0Street View, we test these views by examining nearly 25 years of US stock buyback announcements, and find little evidence to support the aforementioned concerns.\nThis\u00a0Street View\u00a0is structured as follows:\nWe performed our study on Russell 3000 Index constituents2\u00a0over a period spanning from Jan 1st, 1998 to Apr 30th, 2019. We used Bloomberg to obtain the list of share buyback announcement dates for these stocks over the period of study. There were a total of 9,698 buyback announcements,3\u00a0though accounting for multiple announcements from the same company in the same month resulted in 7,327 unique buyback events.\nWe base all the results presented in sections 3 and 4 on idiosyncratic returns to the Russell 3000 constituents relative to a CAPM-style risk model (i.e., after adjusting for the estimated market beta of each stock).\u00a04\nWe start by investigating the claim that companies tend to announce buybacks when their stock prices are declining or amid rising volatility, potentially as an attempt by management to support prices and/or reduce stock volatility. To test how past stock performance may affect the probability of a buyback announcement in the subsequent month, we use a logistic regression model5\u00a0to estimate the probability of a firm announcing a share buyback in the next month conditional on two measures of trailing performance:6\nWe split our analysis into two discrete periods: before and after the Global Financial Crisis,7\u00a0as we found notable differences in their results. To account for time-varying dispersion in the returns and volatilities of individual stocks, we also transform the historical Sharpe ratios and volatility ratios for all 3,000 stocks within each calendar month into cross-sectional z-scores before fitting the logistic regressions over all stock-month observations in each period.\nThe table below shows the z-scores quantifying the statistical significance of the dependence of the likelihood of a stock buyback announcement on the two measures of past performance we described above. A score with an absolute value greater than 2.0 roughly denotes a statistically significant relationship. A positive (negative) value of the score implies that the higher the value of the predictor, the higher (lower) the likelihood of a buyback announcement in the next month.\nA handful of key results from Table 1 deserve highlighting:\nWe can check the robustness of these regression results by also looking at the empirical frequency of buyback announcements for stock-month observations with historical Sharpe ratio or volatility ratio z-scores falling into particular narrow ranges, and plotting those empirical frequencies against the estimated probability from our logistic regression. Figure 2 shows these plots for the post-GFC period with a 36-month lookback window for both stock performance metrics. Again, there are a handful of results to highlight:\n\nMore broadly, these results suggest that buybacks tend to come from firms with strong long-term performance whose share prices had recently hit a rough patch, but without much rise in volatility. This provides some support for the hypothesis that management tends to opportunistically announce buybacks when shares appear undervalued, or as a short-term price support.8\nThe post-GFC data especially does not support the hypothesis that share buybacks have been suppressing broader market volatility, as buybacks tend to be announced more often by firms with level or declining volatility compared to history. However, this finding does not rule out the counterfactual possibility that firms announcing buybacks avoided a rise in share price volatility that would have otherwise occurred. To investigate the potential impact of share buybacks on the broader market\u2019s returns and volatility, we now turn to analyzing the average impact on share prices before and after the announcement.\nBy performing an event time study, we estimated the cumulative average abnormal returns (CAAR) in excess of the market earned by Russell 3000 Index constituents that announce a share buyback over the period immediately preceding and following the announcement month. Our results, in Figure 3, suggest that while a typical buyback announcer is selling off in the six months leading up to the buyback announcement (as shown in the previous section), the post-announcement recovery is relatively weak.\nLeading up to the buyback announcement, the average announcer\u2019s share price has been selling off, with noticeably larger negative CAAR for the pre-GFC period than post-GFC. This squares with the logistic regression results in Table 1: both periods show that buybacks tend to be more likely following a six-month period with a negative idiosyncratic returns Sharpe ratio, but the pre-GFC period also shows buybacks tend to follow rising idiosyncratic volatility, while there is no such effect in the post-GFC period. As the historical Sharpe ratio measure used in this study divides the average idiosyncratic returns by the idiosyncratic volatility, the larger denominator (from rising volatility) in the pre-GFC period suggests we should also see more strongly negative returns in the numerator.\nThe announcement month itself shows a positive market response, with roughly 0.5-0.75% average excess returns in both the pre- and post-GFC datasets.9\u00a0Here, the results from the two periods diverge again, as buyback announcers do not recover any further on average over the pre-GFC period, while the postGFC period shows an average recovery roughly to the pre-selloff level. Although the total trough-to-peak recovery for buyback announcers in the post-GFC period appears strongly statistically significant,10\u00a0the total CAAR from the beginning of the sell-off to six months after the announcement is less than 0.5% and not statistically significant.11\u00a0While the buyback announcement does appear to provide share price support in the more recent dataset, the recovery to pre-selloff levels suggests that buybacks on average do not appear to lead to \u201cartificially\u201d elevated valuations.12\nFigure 3 implies a stark difference in the recovery of a stock\u2019s price after a share buyback announcement across the pre and post GFC periods. This could point to the possibility of markets becoming more efficient in pricing a buyback announcement over recent years that now leads to quicker price recovery than what is observed pre GFC. Many other possibilities exist, such as a significant change in financial regulation post GFC, changes in market structure due to an increased flow of capital into quantitative trading strategies, and etc. This difference is an interesting question in itself and we defer its investigation to a future\u00a0Street View.\nWe now turn to the effects on share price volatility, with Figure 4 presenting the average daily idiosyncratic volatility of a buyback announcer over the twelve months preceding and following the announcement month. As suggested by the regression results in Section 3, the pre-GFC period shows a rise in short-term volatility in the months leading up to the buyback announcement, while this effect is much less clear in the post-GFC data. Volatility spikes in the announcement month for both periods as the market digests the news, with a positive average outcome as seen in Figure 3.\nHowever, share price volatility is not suppressed after a buyback is announced. In fact, the average level of idiosyncratic volatility post-announcement is slightly higher than the preannouncement volatility in both the pre- and post-GFC periods.13\u00a0We note that this effect is actually in the direction that a simple corporate finance model would suggest, as a share buyback should increase the leverage of a company\u2019s equity while leaving the underlying business risk unchanged, thus boosting the expected equity volatility.\nFinally, we want to take a deeper look at the fundamental characteristics of companies that announce share buybacks versus the broader market, to see if the data supports beliefs that companies are significantly weakening their balance sheets or foregoing worthwhile investment to return capital. To test for significant differences between firms announcing a buyback and the average Russell 3000 firm, we used the style factor definitions from MSCI Barra\u2019s most recent US risk model: the US Total Market Equity Trading Model. These style factor exposures per stock provide point-in-time scores for how each individual stock compares to the rest of the US market on a large number of dimensions, including technical factors such as momentum, beta, and residual volatility; fundamental factors such as firm profitability, earnings quality (mostly driven by cash earnings being in line with accounting earnings), and leverage; and measures combining market prices and fundamentals such as valuation metrics and market capitalization.\nWe investigated which characteristics most strongly differentiated buyback announcers from the rest of the market by comparing the distribution of scores (or loadings) on each style factor for stocks on the day before their buyback announcements to the loadings of all the stocks in our study. We performed a difference-of-means test between the two distributions to determine which style factor loadings showed statistically significant differences from the market as a whole, and the results of this analysis for the factors with the most significant differences between the buyback announcers and the broad market are presented in Figure 5 below.\nStocks announcing a share buyback tend to have significantly stronger fundamentals than average, with higher scores on Earnings Yield (i.e., lower price-to-earnings ratio), Earnings Quality (i.e., more cash earnings), and Profitability (i.e., higher return on equity and return on assets). These firms also tend to be larger (positive Size and Mid-Cap loadings), with lower Leverage and lower market-implied risk (both lower Beta and lower Residual Volatility).\nThese results suggest that corporations buying back stock are exactly those with the greatest ability to return cash to shareholders while still supporting future growth, and provide little evidence that the firms are endangering themselves through excess leverage to fund the capital returns.\nContrary to the worst claims about share buybacks, we find little evidence from our large-scale study of individual buyback announcements that they are artificially suppressing market volatility or requiring companies to forgo otherwise profitable investments or take on excess leverage. There is some evidence that share buybacks are announced following a short-term period of stock price declines, which could either represent opportunistic purchasing at an attractive price or an attempt by management to stem the decline.14\u00a0However, on the whole, companies that announce share buybacks appear to have stronger-than-average fundamentals and long-term stock performance exceeding the market, with excess profits and cash flows that could reasonably be returned to shareholders.\nOur study points towards a noticeable difference in the extent of post buyback announcement price recovery across the pre and post GFC periods. One could think of a few\u00a0a priori\u00a0explanations for this difference (that we mention in Section 4); we pose this as an open question to the wider Financial Economics research community and plan to revisit this topic in a future\u00a0Street View.\nTags\nReferences\nStephen Gandel. \u201cAdd Stock Buybacks to the Causes of the Market Downturn.\u201d Bloomberg.

    "document": "Stock Buybacks: Benefits of Share Repurchases\n There are several ways in which a company can return wealth to its shareholders. Although stock price appreciation and\u00a0dividends\u00a0are the two most common ways, there are other ways for companies to share their wealth with investors.\n\n In this article, we will look at one of those overlooked methods: share buybacks or repurchases. We'll go through the mechanics of a share\u00a0buyback\u00a0and what it means for investors.\n\nKey Takeaways\n  What Is a Stock Buyback?\u00a0  \n A stock buyback occurs when a company buys back its shares from the marketplace with its accumulated cash. Also known as a share repurchase, a stock buyback allows a company to re-invest in itself. The repurchased shares are absorbed by the company, reducing the number of outstanding shares\u00a0on the market. Because there are fewer shares on the market, the relative ownership stake of each investor increases.\n\n There are two ways that companies conduct a buyback: A tender offer or through the open market:\n\nJOSH EDELSON\u00a0/\u00a0Contributor / Getty Images\n  The Motives  \n Why do companies buy back shares? A firm's management is likely to say that a buyback is the best use of\u00a0capital\u00a0at that particular time. After all, the goal of a firm's management is to maximize return for shareholders, and a buyback typically increases\u00a0shareholder value. The prototypical line in a buyback\u00a0press release\u00a0is \"we don't see any better investment than in ourselves.\" Although this can sometimes be the case, this statement is not always true.\n\n There are other sound motives that drive companies to repurchase shares. For example, management may feel the market has discounted its share price too steeply.\ufeff A stock price can be pummeled by the market for many reasons such as weaker-than-expected earnings results, an accounting scandal, or just a poor overall economic climate. Thus, when a company spends millions of dollars buying up its own shares, it can be a sign that management believes that the market has gone too far in\u00a0discounting\u00a0the shares\u2014a positive sign.\n\n\nThe market typically perceives a buyback as a positive indicator for a company, and the share price often shoots up following a buyback. On May 2, 2024, Apple (APPL) announced $110 billion for share buybacks.\n  Improving Financial Ratios  \n A corporation may execute a share buyback to improve its financial ratios. These are the\u00a0metrics that investors use to analyze a company's value. But this motivation is questionable. That's because reducing the number of shares may signal issues with management. But if a company's motive for initiating a buyback is sound, better financial ratios as a result could simply be a byproduct of a good corporate decision.\n\n Let's look at how this happens:\n\n  Example  \n Suppose a company repurchases one million shares at $15 per share for a total cash outlay of $15 million. Below are the components of the ROA and\u00a0earnings per share (EPS) calculations and how they change as a result of the buyback.\n\n As you can see, the company's\u00a0cash hoard was reduced from $20 million to $5 million. Because cash is an asset, this will lower the total assets of the company from $50 million to $35 million. This increases ROA, even though earnings don't change. Prior to the buyback, the company's ROA was 4% ($2 million \u00f7 $50 million). After the repurchase, ROA increases to 5.71% ($2 million \u00f7 $35 million). A similar effect can be seen for EPS, which increases from 20 cents ($2 million \u00f7 10 million shares) to 22 cents ($2 million \u00f7 9 million shares).\n\n The buyback also improves the company's\u00a0price-earnings ratio (P/E), which is one of the most well-known and often-used measures of value. At the risk of oversimplification, the market often thinks a lower P/E ratio is better. Therefore, if we assume that the shares remain at $15, the P/E ratio before the buyback is 75 ($15 \u00f7 20 cents). After the buyback, the P/E decreases to 68 ($15 \u00f7 22 cents) due to the reduction in outstanding shares. In other words, fewer shares + same earnings = higher EPS, which leads to a better P/E.\n\n Based on the P/E ratio as a measure of value, the company is now less expensive per dollar of earnings than it was prior to the repurchase despite the fact there was no change in earnings.\n\n  Dilution  \n Another reason that a company may move forward with a buyback is to reduce the\u00a0dilution\u00a0that is often caused by generous\u00a0employee stock option plans (ESOP).\n\n Bull markets\u00a0and strong economies often create a very competitive labor market. Companies have to compete to retain personnel, and ESOPs comprise many compensation packages. Stock options have the opposite effect of share repurchases as they increase the number of shares outstanding when the options are\u00a0exercised.\n\n As in the above example, a change in the number of outstanding shares can affect key financial measures such as EPS and P/E. In the case of dilution, a change in the number of outstanding shares has the opposite effect of repurchase: it weakens the financial appearance of the company.\n\n If we assume that the shares in the company had increased by one million, the EPS would have fallen to 18 cents per share from 20 cents per share. After years of\u00a0lucrative\u00a0stock option programs, a company may decide to repurchase shares to avoid or eliminate excessive dilution.\n\n  Tax Benefit\u00a0  \n On Aug. 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. One of the provisions included an excise tax of 1% on share buybacks. The new rule goes into effect for repurchases after Dec. 31, 2022, that are valued at over $1 million. And it excludes stock that is reserved for new public issues and for employee stock or pension plans.\n\n Prior to this, corporations generally weren't taxed at all if they repurchased their shares and boosted value for their shareholders. This is contrary to the tax treatment of dividends, which is a portion of a company's earnings distributed to shareholders. Dividends are taxed at ordinary\u00a0income tax\u00a0rates when received. Tax rates and their effects typically change annually. As such, investors consider the annual tax rate on capital gains versus dividends as ordinary income when looking at the benefits.\n\n\nThe idea for an excise tax was introduced by Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH). The Stock Buyback Accountability Act was introduced in the Senate in September 2021 and proposed a 2% tax on share buybacks. The bill aimed to address concerns that corporate executives used buybacks to benefit themselves by boosting share prices rather than investing in the economy and their workers.\nWhy Do Companies Buyback Shares?\nThere are many reasons that a company may wish to buyback its shares. Often companies with excess capital will say that share buybacks are the best use of their capital because it will have the effect of maximizing value for the shareholders.\nIs Share Buyback a Good Thing?\nIf the reason for the share buyback is to maximize shareholder value, then it is a good thing.\nAre Share Buybacks Better Than Dividends?\nShare buybacks are a more efficient way to return capital to shareholders because the shareholder doesn't incur any additional tax on the buyback. Taxes are only triggered once the shareholder sells the shares.\n  The Bottom Line\u00a0  \n Are share buybacks good or bad? As is so often the case in finance, the question may not have a definitive answer. Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding and a company\u2019s total assets, which can affect the company and its investors in different ways. When you look at key ratios like EPS and P/E, a share decrease boosts EPS and lowers the P/E for a more attractive value. Ratios, such as ROA and ROE, improve because the denominator decreases, which increases the return.\n\n In the public market, a buyback will always increase the stock\u2019s value to the benefit of shareholders. However, investors should ask whether a company is merely using buybacks to prop up ratios, provide short-term relief to an ailing stock price, or get out from under excessive dilution.\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"Tax Provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (H.R. 5376),\" Page 3.\nApple.com. \"Apple Reports Second Quarter Results.\"\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 550 (2021), Investment Income and Expenses.\"\nCongress.gov. \"S.2758 - Stock Buyback Accountability Act of 2021.\"\nThomson Reuters. \"The Long Read: Excise on Stock Buybacks Draws Mixed Response.\"\n",

Through the end of October, FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has approved 38 new drugs. Which companies \u00a0and products have made the cut, and which may be best poised for market success?\nBy Patricia Van Arnum, Editorial Director, DCAT, pvanarnum@dcat.org\nNew drug approvals thus far in 2024Although not following a strictly chronological path, examining the pace of new drug approvals is an important measure of product innovation in the bio/pharma industry. Through the end of October (as of October 31, 2024), the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) had approved 38 new molecular entities (NMEs) and biological therapeutics, compared to 46 new drugs approved through October 2023.\nLast year (2023) saw an uptick in new drug approvals compared to 2022, which was a recent dip in new drug approvals. In 2023, FDA\u2019s CDER approved 55 NMEs and new biological therapeutics, a 49% increase in the number of new drug approvals compared to 2022, when 37 new drugs were approved. The 55 new drugs approved in 2023 by FDA\u2019s CDER was in line with recent years. In 2021, 50 NMEs and new biological therapeutics were approved and 53 in 2020. The 55 new drugs approved in 2023 represented the second highest level of approvals in the past decade, except for 2018 when 59 new drugs were approved (see Figure 1).\nSmall molecules versus biologicsAnother important trend to look at is the product mix of new drug approvals. Of the 38 new drug approvals thus far in 2024 (as of October 31, 2024), 26, or 68%, were small molecules (24 drugs and two diagnostic/imaging agents), and 12, or 32%, were biologics. That is on par with the mix in 2023, when FDA\u2019s CDER approved 17 new biological therapeutics, which represented 31% of new drug approvals, and 38 small-molecule products or 69% of new drug approvals (see Figure 2).\nThe percentage of small-molecule approvals in 2023 was in line with recent years, except in 2022, which represented a recent low. In 2022, 59% of the new drug approvals by FDA\u2019s CDER were small molecules or 22 of the 37 new drug approved. Between 2018 and 2021, small molecules averaged 74% of new drug approvals. In 2021, small molecules represented 72% of new drug approvals, 75% in 2020,\u00a0 79% in 2019, and 71% in 2018.\nThe decrease in small molecules\u2019 share of new drug approvals in 2022 was largely due to the overall decline in new drug approvals in 2022 and a corresponding decline in small-molecule drug approvals and a rise in new biologic drug approvals. In 2022, FDA\u2019s CDER approved 22 new small-molecule drugs and 15 new biologics. The 17 new biologics approved in 2023 surpassed 2022 levels and matched a recent high in 2018, when 17 new biologics were approved by FDA\u2019s CDER, far exceeding biologic approvals of 14 in 2021, 13 in 2020, and 10 in 2019.\nLarge bio/pharma companies versus mid-tier/small companiesThe quantity of new drug approvals, alone, is not a singular measure of product innovation, but tracking it show some interesting trends, notably the increasing contribution of small bio/pharma companies, particularly in the small-molecule drug space. \u00a0\nOf the 38 new drugs approved thus far in 2024, 13, or 34%, were from large companies (defined as the top 25 bio/pharma companies based on 2023 revenues and one large medical technology company with approval of a diagnostic agent), and 25, or 66%, were from mid-sized or small companies. In looking at product mix, biologics accounted for more than half (54%) of new drug approvals by the large companies, but only 20% from mid-sized-to-small companies.\nThe large bio/pharma companies have had seven new biological therapeutics approved thus far in 2024 and five small-molecule drugs. For purposes of this analysis, new biological therapeutics only include those approved by FDA\u2019s CDER, which reviews and approves new molecular entities and new biological therapeutics. Other biologic-based products, including blood products, vaccines, allergenics, tissues, and cellular and gene therapies, are reviewed and approved by a separate center within FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\nSo which companies made the cut in biologics? The seven biologics approved from the large bio/pharma companies were: Amgen\u2019s Imdelltra (tarlatamab-dlle) for treating extensive-stage small cell lung cancer; Astellas\u2019 Vyloy (zolbetuximab-clzb) for treating gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, a rare type of cancer of the esophagus; Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Ebglyss (lebrikizumab-lbkz) for treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema); Lilly\u2019s Kisunla (donanemab-azbt) for treating early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease;\u00a0 Merck & Co.\u2019s Winrevair (sotatercept-csrk) for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare disease in which blood vessels in the lungs thicken and narrow, causing strain on the heart; \u00a0Pfizer\u2019s Hympavzi (marstacimab-hncq) for preventing or reducing bleeding episodes related to hemophilia A or B; and Roche\u2019s Piasky (crovalimab-akkz) for treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare blood disorder.\nThe five small-molecule drug approvals from the large bio/pharmaceutical companies were: AstraZeneca\u2019s Voydeya (danicopan) for treating extravascular hemolysis with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disease; Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Cobenfy (xanomeline and trospium chloride) for treating schizophrenia; Gilead Sciences\u2019 Livdelzi (seladelpar) for treating primary biliary cholangitis, a chronic autoimmune disease that damages the liver\u2019s bile ducts, causing a buildup of bile and toxins;\u00a0 Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Lazcluze (lazertinib) for treating non-small cell lung cancer; Roche\u2019s Itovebi (inavolisib) for treating locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In addition, GE Healthcare gained FDA approval for Flyrcado (flurpiridaz F 18), a radioactive diagnostic drug to evaluate for myocardial ischemia and infarction.\nMid-tier & small bio/pharma companies: new drug approvalsSmall-molecules by far dominated new approvals from mid-sized to small companies, with many of the drugs indicated for rare diseases. Below is a roundup of small-molecule drug approvals from mid-sized and small companies thus far this year (as of October 31, 2024):\nOn the biologics side, small-to-mid-sized bio/pharma companies have had five biologics approved thus far in 2024. These are: BeiGene\u2019s Tevimbra (tislelizumab-jsgr) for treating unresectable or metastatic esophageal cancer; Galderma\u2019s Nemluvio\u00a0(nemolizumab-ilto) for treating prurigo nodularis, a chronic skin disorder with itchy nodules; Hugel-Aesthetics\u2019 Letybo (letibotulinumtoxinA-wlbg) for temporarily improving the appearance of moderate-to-severe glabellar lines (i.e., so-called \u201cfrown lines\u201d); ImmunityBio\u2019s Anktiva (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept-pmln) for treating bladder cancer; and Incyte\u2019s Niktimvo (axatilimab-csfr) for treating chronic graft-versus-host disease.\n\n\nBio/Pharma\u2019s Rising Stars: The Companies Emerging on the Industry\u2019s Radar\nA Shortage of Inspectors Curtailing FDA Inspections: The Impact on Pharma\nA Look Ahead: Bio/Pharma\u2019s Top Policy Issues in US Elections Aftermath\nA Strong Contract ADC Market Drives Expansions in High-Potency Manufacturing\nOne Washington Blvd., Suite 6\nRobbinsville, NJ 08691, USA\n+1-609-208-1888\nToll Free: +1-800-640-DCAT (3288)\n\u00a9 2024 DCAT | Privacy Policy\nDCAT Value Chain Insights is produced by the Drug, Chemical &\nAssociated Technologies Association, a not-for-profit business\ndevelopment association for companies engaged in the global bio/pharmaceutical manufacturing value chain.

Results from Phase I, II and III clinical studies, and FDA or European approvals (and rejections), can send stocks soaring.\nEveryone is familiar with these monster moves. Recent examples include Amarin Corp's (AMRN) 3X move in one day, or Zosano Pharma Corporations' (ZSAN) 100% rip on recent study results. Now, a new entrant in the large neurological market, NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC), could be on the eve of their first FDA approval, and few investors are paying attention to this small company because it's so new and quiet about what they're doing.\nNevertheless, NMTC is 10% owned by the Mayo Clinic and has a stable of veteran physicians and researchers on their board and advisory board. With the possibility of two FDA clearances in 2019 for their first planned medical devices, the company could have a breakout year if they execute and move from unknown to mainstream.\nNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2019 / Small healthcare stocks are known for making heroic moves, often when their development-phase drugs or devices move closer to going commercial. Completion of Phase I, II, and III trials can all send stocks rallying, as can approvals from European and U.S. regulators.\nCase in point, Zosano Pharma's (ZSAN) recent monster 100% move recently when they announced success in a Trial of their drug for migraines. Amarin Corp (AMRN) saw their stock price triple after their drug Vascepa succeeded in a large Phase III study.\nThe largest moves tend to happen when most investors aren't paying much attention, and that could be the setup for a newer neuro company that recently made their way to the public markets. NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC) is a small developer of electrode technology that just quietly submitted their first product to the U.S. FDA for a possible clearance early in 2019. NeuroOne's technologies - sometimes known as ''neurostimulation'' devices - have been tested at the Mayo Clinic, which is also a 10% owner of the company's public stock. Now that the company is headed towards their first possible FDA clearance, and with a second possible clearance for another device right on its heels, NMTC is a healthcare company to be aware of before it gets discovered.\nNeuroOne Operates In An $8B And Growing Device Market\nThe emerging field of neurostimulation refers to technologies that electrically stimulate or monitor the nervous system to treat and diagnose disorders. Though humans have learned much about the nervous system in the last twenty years, it remains a mysterious organ and technology has only recently begun to unlock some new treatment options. These devices are now helping in a variety of difficult neurological disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, Dystonia, Epilepsy and even in the treatment of pain and some nerve damage.\nIt's an exciting time as this industry takes off. In 2019 the research firm Global Markets Insights expect this to be a $8.196 billion industry across the globe, and $6.5 billion in North America and Europe alone.\nOne of the earliest successes for neurostimulation devices was in Epilepsy and Parkinson's using Deep Brain Stimulation, or DBS and ablation. After identifying brain tissue that may be causing Epileptic seizures or movement problems as in severe Parkinson's, neurologists can selectively modulate or destroy this tissue with a DBS or ablation device, reducing or sometimes eliminating symptoms of the disorder. In fact, ablation can cure about 50% of Epileptic patients.\nThe hangup for many Parkinson's, Dystonia, or Epilepsy patients who are eligible for DBS or ablation is the traumatic surgical requirements, not only for treatment but also to diagnose and pinpoint the affecting brain tissue. It can take weeks in the hospital, sometimes with wires protruding from a patient's skull!\nHere's where NeuroOne hopes to make its mark on the industry. The company's initial devices are high-fidelity electrodes designed to enhance and possibly shorten this diagnostic/treatment process. These thin-film electrodes, used in a procedure called an EEG (electroencephalogram), may provide more accurate detection of irregular brain activity over currently available technology. In limited clinical testing so far, doctors at the Mayo Clinic have been able to document pre-seizure activity (called micro-seizures) during clinical research with their patients using NeuroOne's technology. The electrodes are being developed as strips and depth electrodes, and they've already demonstrated an improvement in inflammatory response compared to existing products when used on some brain tissue. With better diagnostic process, NeuroOne hopes that their products can shorten the diagnostic time and improve safey for Epileptics and patients suffering from movement disorders.\nCombined, this first technology addresses a demand for improved diagnostic options among neurologists, and NeuroOne is now racing to market with their first medical devices for approval.\nNMTC Quietly Made Their First FDA Clearance Application\nNeuroOne has been mostly quiet on the investor front, but in a recent SEC filing they revealed that they filed their first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) application on January 28, 2019. The application covers their cortical and strip electrodes for temporary (less than 30 day) use with recording, monitoring, and acute stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring and stimulation of electrical signals on the surface of the brain.\nIn the case of this 510(k) process, which is used when the device holds a low risk to the patient, the FDA will aim to complete its review within 90 days of receiving the notification.\nThis is the biggest gating event for NeuroOne since the company went public, and it could take them from a development stage company to commercial and their first revenue. An FDA clearance could launch the into the mainstream of healthcare companies, and investors will undoubtedly take notice of this tiny company.\nThe company also plans to file a FDA 510(k) marketing clearance for their first depth electrode during the second quarter. Following that, they're working on a unique diagnostic/ablation device that could further shorten and simplify the treatment time for patients.\nNMTC could have two value-driving events in the next 5-6 months, and the markets are barely paying attention.\nStrong Advisory Board Backs NeuroOne, And Mayo Owns 10% Of The Company\nThe breadth of expertise involved in NeuroOne is impressive. The company has strong advisors and executives, and their technology has been tested over the years by both the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the Mayo Clinic, the latter of which is also a 10% holder of NMTC's public stock.\nSince going public, NeuroOne has been building a team of experienced medical tech and neurology advisory members: Mayo Clinic's Greg Worrell MD, PhD and Gregory J. Esper, MD, MBA of Emory University both sit on the company's scientific advisory board. More recently, Dr. Kip Ludwig, former Program Director for Neural Engineering at the NIH, became chair of the company's new \"artificial intelligence\" advisory board, which will focus on deploying NeuroOne's electrode technology in artificial intelligence and bioelectronics applications. Dr. Cristin Welle of the Univ. of Colorado joined, a founder of the Neural Interfaces Program at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of Science and Engineering Labs; plus Dr. Doug Weber, a Program Manager in the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) at DARPA.\nEvaluating AI opens up some unique possible opportunities as more researchers have considered the potential for electrode/brain interfaces. The possibility for some kind of translational work in this space is intriguing.\n2019 Should Be A Big Year For NMTC Shareholders\nNeuroOne has been operating in stealth mode for the last year, but 2019 could be when investors start to pay attention. The company will likely have 2 FDA clearances in the next 6 months if the FDA signs off on their cortical and depth electrode 510(k) filings. As this stock has been mostly flat since going public, these events may be the first time that investors stand up and take notice. Additionally, NMTC plans to apply for a listing on the Nasdaq, another catalyst that could create significant value for shareholders if NMTC can qualify. With CEO Dave Rosa's successful track record building venture stage healthcare companies, multiple value creating catalysts on the horizon, and an awesome technology with blue sky potential, investors long NMTC could be handsomely rewarded for a patient long position in this relatively unknown healthcare company.\nAbout One Equity Stocks\nOne Equity Stocks is a provider of paid-for research on publicly traded emerging growth companies.

Mitigation plans involve massive engineering feats that may help in the short-term, but will eventually be overrun.\nEarth.Org takes a closer look.\n\u2014\nA major centre of finance, commerce, culture, arts and trade, Miami is a global city with a USD $345 billion GDP. Built on a broad, low-lying plain between Everglades wetlands and Biscayne Bay, its citizens are already experiencing early signs of climate change.\nWhy?\nSince 1870, global sea levels have risen by an average of 20 cm, but Southeast Florida\u2019s local levels have risen by 30 cm. By 2060, it could double or triple that.\u00a0\nThe impacts of sea level rise in Miami\nIn light of the last point, officials have decided to build a network of huge pumps that force water out of flood-prone areas and into Biscayne Bay. There are over 30 pumps today, with 90 planned in total. The estimated cost for 3 pumps, including land acquisition, is USD $ 200 million. Unfortunately, even all 90 cannot protect the larger Miami area.\u00a0\nThe city of Miami still toils away to mitigate flooding, raising roads and buildings, hoping to buy time. The world would do well to keep an eye on how Miami fares, as it may be the first major victim of climate change.\nEarth.Org has mapped severe flooding in southern Florida by the end of the century to illustrate the impending danger.\nSea Level Rise: Miami\u2019s Map\nSea level rise projections by 2100 for two scenarios with the amount of rise in meters indicated (mild = 1m; extreme = 4m). Percentage and total population displacement indicated bottom right, yellow star on the city of Miami.\nMethodology\nGlobal mean sea level is projected to rise by 2m at the end of this century. However, in order to determine local sea level rise (SLR), one has to take into account local coastal flood levels which could be 2.8m above Mean Higher-High Water (MHHW) at extreme forecasts. These local levels bring variability to the projected SLR from 1m to 6.5m (eg. Rio vs Kolkata).\nThe SLR scenarios used in this study are based on the forecasts from Climate Central \u2013 Coastal Risk Screening Tool \u00a0with the following parameters:\nSea level Projection Source:\nFrom two highly cited journals by Kopp et al., estimating SLR mainly due to ocean thermal expansion and ice melt. The mid-range scenario projected 0.5-1.2m of SLR based on different representative concentration pathways (RCP) defined by the IPCC. While the pessimistic scenario added more mechanisms of ice-sheet melting, estimating SLR at 1m-2.5m in 2100, with a projection of 10m SLR at 2300.\nCoastal Flooding\nMore frequent coastal flooding is a direct impact of sea-level rise. Based on the Global tides and surge reanalysis by Muis et al., (2016), it is estimated that the extreme coastal water level could be from 0.2 \u2013 2.8m over the mean level. While in extreme cases like China and the Netherlands it could experience 5-10m of extreme sea levels. Here, the coastal local flood level is added on top of the projected SLR.\nPollution Scenario:\nAllows choosing the RCP, the greenhouse gas concentration trajectory defined by the IPCC.\u00a0 The mild level is based on RCP4.5, of 2\u00b0C temperature rise; while the Extreme level is based on RCP 8.5, of 4\u00b0C temperature rise.\nLuck:\nApplies to the baseline SLR, defined in the \u201cSea level projection\u201d section, upon which we add flooding. \u201cMild\u201d refers to the mid-range scenario of 0.5-1.2m, and \u201cextreme\u201d to the pessimistic scenario of 1-2.5m. We used the high-end value of each scenario (mild = 1m; extreme = 2.5m).\nYou might also like: Sea Level Rise by 2100 \u2013 New York City\nA Graphical History of Atmospheric CO2 Levels Over Time\n11 Interesting Climate Change Facts\nThe Statistics of Biodiversity Loss [2020 WWF Report]\nHand-picked stories weekly or monthly.

Mitigation plans involve massive engineering feats that may help in the short-term, but will eventually be overrun.\nEarth.Org takes a closer look.\n\u2014\nA major centre of finance, commerce, culture, arts and trade, Miami is a global city with a USD $345 billion GDP. Built on a broad, low-lying plain between Everglades wetlands and Biscayne Bay, its citizens are already experiencing early signs of climate change.\nWhy?\nSince 1870, global sea levels have risen by an average of 20 cm, but Southeast Florida\u2019s local levels have risen by 30 cm. By 2060, it could double or triple that.\u00a0\nThe impacts of sea level rise in Miami\nIn light of the last point, officials have decided to build a network of huge pumps that force water out of flood-prone areas and into Biscayne Bay. There are over 30 pumps today, with 90 planned in total. The estimated cost for 3 pumps, including land acquisition, is USD $ 200 million. Unfortunately, even all 90 cannot protect the larger Miami area.\u00a0\nThe city of Miami still toils away to mitigate flooding, raising roads and buildings, hoping to buy time. The world would do well to keep an eye on how Miami fares, as it may be the first major victim of climate change.\nEarth.Org has mapped severe flooding in southern Florida by the end of the century to illustrate the impending danger.\nSea Level Rise: Miami\u2019s Map\nSea level rise projections by 2100 for two scenarios with the amount of rise in meters indicated (mild = 1m; extreme = 4m). Percentage and total population displacement indicated bottom right, yellow star on the city of Miami.\nMethodology\nGlobal mean sea level is projected to rise by 2m at the end of this century. However, in order to determine local sea level rise (SLR), one has to take into account local coastal flood levels which could be 2.8m above Mean Higher-High Water (MHHW) at extreme forecasts. These local levels bring variability to the projected SLR from 1m to 6.5m (eg. Rio vs Kolkata).\nThe SLR scenarios used in this study are based on the forecasts from Climate Central \u2013 Coastal Risk Screening Tool \u00a0with the following parameters:\nSea level Projection Source:\nFrom two highly cited journals by Kopp et al., estimating SLR mainly due to ocean thermal expansion and ice melt. The mid-range scenario projected 0.5-1.2m of SLR based on different representative concentration pathways (RCP) defined by the IPCC. While the pessimistic scenario added more mechanisms of ice-sheet melting, estimating SLR at 1m-2.5m in 2100, with a projection of 10m SLR at 2300.\nCoastal Flooding\nMore frequent coastal flooding is a direct impact of sea-level rise. Based on the Global tides and surge reanalysis by Muis et al., (2016), it is estimated that the extreme coastal water level could be from 0.2 \u2013 2.8m over the mean level. While in extreme cases like China and the Netherlands it could experience 5-10m of extreme sea levels. Here, the coastal local flood level is added on top of the projected SLR.\nPollution Scenario:\nAllows choosing the RCP, the greenhouse gas concentration trajectory defined by the IPCC.\u00a0 The mild level is based on RCP4.5, of 2\u00b0C temperature rise; while the Extreme level is based on RCP 8.5, of 4\u00b0C temperature rise.\nLuck:\nApplies to the baseline SLR, defined in the \u201cSea level projection\u201d section, upon which we add flooding. \u201cMild\u201d refers to the mid-range scenario of 0.5-1.2m, and \u201cextreme\u201d to the pessimistic scenario of 1-2.5m. We used the high-end value of each scenario (mild = 1m; extreme = 2.5m).\nYou might also like: Sea Level Rise by 2100 \u2013 New York City\nA Graphical History of Atmospheric CO2 Levels Over Time\n11 Interesting Climate Change Facts\nThe Statistics of Biodiversity Loss [2020 WWF Report]\nHand-picked stories weekly or monthly.

While there is no way to definitively answer that question \u2013 by definition, our fiscal problems are due to the disconnect between spending and revenue \u2013 one way to evaluate our situation would be to put spending and revenue in a historical context as a share of economic output. From that perspective, it is clear the answer is \"both.\"\nIncorporating the effects of the recent budget deal, federal spending is expected to total 21.1 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, while revenue is expected to total about 16.6 percent of GDP. With 50-year historical averages for spending and revenue at 20.3 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively, that means spending will be higher and revenue will be lower than their historical\u00a0averages by about the same amount:\u00a00.8 percent of GDP.\nThis wasn't always so. As recently as 2017, revenue was close to its historical average, and as recently as 2018, spending was as well. But thanks in large part to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, both have departed from these averages.\nDue to the rising costs of health, retirement, and interest spending, spending is projected to diverge from its average even further. We estimate that over the next decade, spending will rise to 23.1\u00a0percent of GDP by 2029, which is 2.8 percentage points\u00a0above the historical average. Revenue will rise above its historical average but largely because the net revenue-losing portions of the TCJA are scheduled to expire, mostly after 2025. If those and other tax cuts were continued as the Congressional Budget Office presents in its Alternative Fiscal Scenario (AFS), revenue would remain below its historical average at least through the next decade, with revenue 0.4 percentage points below that average in 2029.\u00a0\nThe fact that spending and revenue are above and below their historical averages, respectively, is troubling, especially since even at these\u00a0averages debt has risen by about 50 percent of GDP over the past half century to its highest level since just after World War II.\nIn the past when the economy was strong and unemployment was low, revenue usually rose above average levels as a share of GDP while spending fell below. This time, policymakers have continued to cut taxes and increase spending regardless of the fiscal consequences.\nTrending\n$700 Billion of Easy Deficit Reduction\nWith the national debt approaching record levels and interest costs exploding, lawmakers will need to consider substantial spending cuts and revenue increases to put the national debt on a more...\nAs the Fed Cuts Rates, Treasury Yields Are Rising\nWith last week\u2019s rate decision, the Federal Reserve has now cut the federal funds rate by 75 basis points over the past eight weeks.

Areas that are hydrologically connected to the ocean are shown in shades of blue (darker blue = greater depth).\nLow-lying areas, displayed in green, are hydrologically \"unconnected\" areas that may also flood. They are determined solely by how well the elevation data captures the area\u2019s drainage characteristics. The mapping may not accurately capture detailed hydrologic/hydraulic features such as canals, ditches, and stormwater infrastructure. A more detailed analysis, may be required to determine the area\u2019s actual susceptibility to flooding.\nThere is not 100% confidence in the elevation data and/or mapping process. It is important not to focus on the exact extent of inundation, but rather to examine the level of confidence that the extent of inundation is accurate (see mapping confidence tab).\nScenarios\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

These new scenarios were developed by the U.S. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force as input into the U.S. Global Change Research\r\n                            Program Sustained Assessment process and, Fifth National Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios\r\n                            provide an update to the NOAA 2017 scenarios, which were developed as input to the Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            While these RSL scenarios begin in 2005, they have been adjusted to 2000 to more easily compare them with the 2017 RSL scenarios. They take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion.  \r\n                        \n\r\n                            By 2050 (relative to sea level in 2000), RSL projections range from 0.40\u20100.45 meters along the East Coast,\r\n                            0.55\u20100.65 meters along the Gulf Coast, 0.20\u20100.30 meters along the West Coast, 0.20\u20100.35 meters along\r\n                            the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands, 0.30 meters along the northern coast of Alaska, and an RSL\r\n                            decrease along the southern coast of Alaska\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Another important change from the 2017 scenarios is the exclusion of the extreme (2.5 meter)\r\n                            scenario. Based on the most recent scientific understanding, and as discussed in the IPCC AR6, the\r\n                            uncertain physical processes that could lead to much higher increases in sea level are now viewed as\r\n                            less plausible in the coming decades before potentially becoming a factor toward the end of the 21st\r\n                            century. A GMSL increase of 2.5 meters is thus viewed as less plausible and the associated scenario has\r\n                            been removed.\r\n                        \n2017 Sea Level Rise Technical Report:\n\r\n                            The five relative sea level rise (RSL) scenarios shown in this tab are derived from NOAA Technical Report\r\n                            NOS CO-OPS 083: \u201cGlobal and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States\u201d using the same\r\n                            methods as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change Curve Calculator.

These RSL scenarios provide a revision to the global scenarios that were developed\r\n                            (Parris et. al, 2012) as input to the Third National Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            These RSL scenarios begin in 2000 and take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional\r\n                            changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local\r\n                            vertical land motion.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            For almost all the scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be greater than the global average in the U.S. Northeast\r\n                            and the western Gulf of Mexico. In intermediate and low scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be less than the\r\n                            global average in much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For high scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be\r\n                            higher than the global average along all U.S. coastlines outside Alaska.\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nAdditional Information:\n\r\n                            A RSL-change adjustment to the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983-2001) will cause a minimal\r\n                            offset that may be needed for some applications. The USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator can\r\n                            correct for this offset.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Rounding to the nearest 1-foot mapping increment to view potential impacts is appropriate based on\r\n                            the accuracy of the elevation and tidal surface data used as mapping inputs.\r\n                        \nMapping Confidence\nThe inundation areas depicted in the Sea Level Rise tab are not as precise as they may appear. There are many unknowns when mapping future conditions, including natural evolution of the coastal landforms (e.g., barrier island overwash and migration), as well as the data used to predict the changes. The presentation of confidence in these maps only represents the known error in the elevation data and tidal corrections.\nBlue areas denote a high confidence of inundation, orange areas denote a high degree of uncertainty, and unshaded areas denote a high confidence that these areas will be dry given the chosen water level.\nIn this application 80% is considered a high degree of confidence such that, for example, the blue areas denote locations that may be correctly mapped as 'inundated' more than 8 out of 10 times. Areas with a high degree of uncertainty represent locations that may be mapped correctly (either as inundated or dry) less than 8 out of 10 times.\r\n                        For a detailed description of the confidence levels and their computation, see the methods document.\nMarsh\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

You can learn more about them within the Local\r\n                            Scenarios Tab of this viewer.\r\n                        \nNote: We do not show the low scenario as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nSocial Vulnerability\nBy overlaying social and economic data on a map that depicts sea level rise, a community can see the potential impact that sea level rise can have on vulnerable people and businesses.\nThe Social Vulnerability Index, which shows areas of high human vulnerability to hazards, is based on population attributes from Census 2010 (e.g., age and poverty) and the built environment. By looking at the intersection of potential sea level rise and vulnerable Census tracts, one can get an idea of how vulnerable populations might be affected by sea level rise. Dark red indicates tracts having a high vulnerability, and the lighter reds indicate decreasing vulnerability.\nHigh Tide Flooding\nAnnual occurrences of tidal flooding\u2014exceeding local thresholds for minor impacts\r\n            \t\t\tto infrastructure\u2014have increased 5- to 10-fold since the 1960s in several U.S. coastal\r\n            \t\t\tcities. The changes in high tide flooding over time are greatest where elevation is lower, local RSL rise is higher, or extreme variability is less.\nIn a sense, today\u2019s flood will become tomorrow\u2019s high tide, as sea level rise will cause flooding to occur more frequently and last for longer durations of time.\nThe red layer in the map represents areas currently subject to tidal flooding, often called \u201crecurrent or nuisance flooding.\u201d\nClick on a NOAA tide station icon in the map to see historical inundation events in flood days per year. The flood thresholds used in these plots are derived national flood thresholds from NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 086: Patterns and Projections of High Tide Flooding Along the U.S. Coastline Using a Common Impact Threshold. The derived thresholds used here provide a national definition of coastal flooding and impacts for quantifying and communicating risk. These thresholds may deviate from NWS impact thresholds which take into account local flood risk and are used to issue NWS coastal flood watches, warnings,  and advisories.\nCurrent Location\nHigh Tide Flooding\nHistorical Yearly Inundation Events\n\nCoastal County Snapshots\nUse the sea level rise snapshot to communicate potential impacts at the county level\nLake Level Viewer\nVisualize potential lake level changes and impacts for the U.S. Great Lakes\nCoastal Flood Exposure Mapper\nMap people, places, and natural resources that are potentially exposed to coastal flooding\nTakeaways from the 2022 Sea Level Rise Technical Report\nWatch this video to explore four takeaways from the report and key actions that communities can take\nGet more sea level rise and inundation resources and tools from the Digital Coast.\nAbout Sea Level Rise Viewer v 3.0.0\nThe purpose of this map viewer is to provide federal, state, and local coastal resource managers and planners with a preliminary look at sea level rise and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses best-available, nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help estimate impacts and prioritize actions for different scenarios.\nThe data and maps in this tool illustrate the scale of potential flooding, not the exact location, and do not account for erosion, subsidence, or future construction. Water levels are shown as they would appear during the highest high tides (excludes wind-driven tides). The data, maps, and information provided should be used only as a screening-level tool for management decisions. As with all remotely sensed data, all features should be verified with a site visit. The data and maps in this tool are provided \u201cas is\u201d without warranty to their performance, merchantable state, or fitness for any particular purpose. The entire risk associated with the results and performance of these data is assumed by the user. This tool should be used strictly as a planning reference tool and not for navigation, permitting, or other legal purposes.\nAdditional Resources\nLeveed Areas Disclaimer\nLevees are displayed as yellow lines, and enclosed leveed areas are displayed as a white stippled pattern.\nMajor federal leveed areas were assumed high enough and strong enough to protect against inundation depicted in this viewer, and therefore no inundation was mapped in these regions.\nMinor (nonfederal) leveed areas were mapped using the best available elevation data that capture leveed features. In some cases, however, breaks in elevation occur along leveed areas because of flood control features being removed from elevation data, limitations of the horizontal and vertical resolution of the elevation data, the occurrence of levee drainage features, and so forth. Flooding behind levees is only depicted if breaks in elevation data occur or if the levee elevations are overtopped by the water surface. At some flood levels, alternate pathways around\u2014not through\u2014levees, walls, dams, and flood gates may exist that allow water to flow into areas protected at lower levels. In general, imperfect levee and elevation data make assessing protection difficult, and small data errors can have large consequences.\nAs new elevation data become available, or as stakeholders provide additional levee information, the NOAA Office for Coastal Management will periodically update the inundation and levee data.\n",

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows.

When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

    "document": "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 (Week 16) using Drought Monitor Data Gregg Ibendahl April 19, 2024 Week 16 prediction1 Kansas wheat estimate for 4/19/24 Using Drought Monitor Data Yield range from 39.1 to 46.2 Predicted yield of 42.6 Abstract This paper uses data from the U.S. drought monitor website (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu2) to predict yields on a crop reporting district (CRD) level for Kansas. These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F. A. 2017.\nDrought Severity and Cover- age Index.\nUnited States Drought Monitor.\ndroughtmoni-tor.unl.edu/About/AbouttheData/ DSCI.aspx 4Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available. In other words, the drought index only shows moisture deficit levels and not excess moisture levels.\nWhile this report currently indicates a below average wheat year, the wide confidence intervals indicate these predictions could improve with timely rains. It is still early spring after all. The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5",

    "document": "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 (Week 16) using Drought Monitor Data Gregg Ibendahl April 19, 2024 Week 16 prediction1 Kansas wheat estimate for 4/19/24 Using Drought Monitor Data Yield range from 39.1 to 46.2 Predicted yield of 42.6 Abstract This paper uses data from the U.S. drought monitor website (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu2) to predict yields on a crop reporting district (CRD) level for Kansas. These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F. A. 2017.\nDrought Severity and Cover- age Index.\nUnited States Drought Monitor.\ndroughtmoni-tor.unl.edu/About/AbouttheData/ DSCI.aspx 4Bain, R. and T. R.

St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available. In other words, the drought index only shows moisture deficit levels and not excess moisture levels.\nWhile this report currently indicates a below average wheat year, the wide confidence intervals indicate these predictions could improve with timely rains. It is still early spring after all. The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5",

The crop is rated as either: very poor, poor, fair, good, or excellent. For wheat, these estimates are reported for a few weeks in late fall and then the estimates start again in the spring. As shown by Ibendahl in previous reports on AgManager.com, these crop reports can be used to build a model to predict final crop yields. In this publication, Ibendahl estimates Kansas wheat yields based on the week #15 (April 14, 2004) crop condition report from NASS.\nAs of week 15 in Kansas, for the winter wheat crop, 6% was rated very poor, 13% was poor, 38% was fair, 38% was good, and 5% was excellent. While it is still very early in the wheat season, this paper explains the model process and projects a possible yield. This paper is the first estimate of wheat yields for 2024 in Kansas.\nBackground The USDA has historical state wheat yields going back to 1866. Figure 1 plots these as a line graph.\nWhat is interesting about this graph is that wheat yields were flat until 1950. Since then, yields have been steadily increasing. As shown in Figure 1, a regression of the last 30 years (the blue line) shows a 0.22 bushel increase in yield each year. The lowest yield in any year since 1970 has been 25% higher than the highest year before 1950. Figure 1 also shows the state average wheat yield has a large amount of variability. Yields were only 28 bushels per acre in 2014 while in 2016, yields were 57 bushels per acre.\n1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu 1 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Estimate of Crop Condition The weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report issued by the USDA National Agricultural Statis-tics Service, includes temperature, precipitation, and progress of crop planting, development and harvesting. This report is issued weekly, except during winter months when it is entered monthly.\nWhile this report gives the current crop condition, it doesn\u2019t make any projections about wheat yields. Predicting yields for wheat can be di\ufb00icult as the crop often does better than it looks in the field and can quickly improve with timely rains.\nThere has been some research that has attempted to match the crop condition report back to yields. Bain and Fortenbery (Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO.\n[http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134]) presented a paper that used an index of the crop con-dition report to estimate crop yields. Their procedure, described below, is used in this paper to show the relationship between crop conditions and wheat yields.\nProcedure Bain and Fortenbery construct an index of weekly crop conditions: CCIndex = (% acreage Excellent) * 1 +\uffff (% acreage Good) * 0.75 +\uffff (% acreage Fair) * 0.50 +\uffff (% acreage Poor) * 0.25 +\uffff (% acreage Very poor) * 0 The index ranges from [0, 100]. An index value of 100 corresponds to 100 percent of the surveyed crop being reported in excellent condition, and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop is in very poor condition. A value of 50 indicates the average crop condition for the state is in fair condition.\nWeekly crop condition reports are available from NASS and go back to 1988. The start of the weakly wheat report in Kansas varies but for all the years since 1988, there is a weekly crop report available by either the last week of March or the first week in April. There is also a series of crop reports in the fall before a break occurs. The last 20 years of the wheat crop condition for week #14 in Kansas is shown in Figure 2.\nIn this analysis, the April 14, 2024 crop condition reports (week #15) are used to construct a CCI index for the last 30 years. These CCI indexes are then used in a regression analysis to estimate the wheat yield per acre where the yield is a function of the CCI index. To account for the yield trend, the actual model is an estimation of the deviation from the yield trend as a function of the CCI index. Figure 3 plots the deviation from the state average wheat yield tend line on the left axis and the CCI index on the bottom axis. The dark gray band represents the standard error.\nThe standard error of the regression is the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line.\n@ibendahl 2 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Results As might be expected for a wheat crop condition report the second week of April, the model doesn\u2019t predict very well. Based on week #15 scores, the model predicts wheat yields with an R-squared of 0.38. The estimated yield equation is Yield = 0.381 * CCI_score - 21.2 That is, an improvement of 1% in the CCI score can increase the average state yield by nearly 0.4 bushels per acres. However, the low R-squared value is the result of large variations in the final wheat yield for a given CCI score. In other words, the CCI index is far from a perfect indicator of final wheat yields in the state, especially with the winter report on crop conditions. The large variability can easily be seen in Figure 3. A model that was able to predict yield perfectly would have all the individual points aligning along the blue regression line. Thus the model presented here should be looked at as more of an initial impression of wheat yields in the state.\nAs of week #15 for 2024, the trend line yield is 43.7 bu/ac. The CCI score of 55.8 has the model predicting a yield 0.03 bu/ac above trend. Thus the estimated yield for 7/14/24 is 43.7 bu/ac with a range from 41.5 to 45.9 bu/ac. Figure 4 shows the history of yield estimates since 4/7/24. This latest estimate is half a bushel lower from last week.\nImplications Producers should look at these results as only a guide. In Kansas, moisture is key and timely rainfall or the lack of rainfall will make a big difference in yields. Ibendahl plans to regularly this model. The reliability of the model will improve as harvest gets closer.\n@ibendahl 3 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 10 20 30 40 50 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025 Year Yield (bu/ac) Historical Kansas Wheat Yields Figure 1: Historical State Wheat Yields from Kansas @ibendahl 4 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 19% 60% 31% 16% 15% 10% 46% 16% 12% 28% 30% 33% 7% 42% 5% 19% 20% 27% 23% 4% 30% 43% 14% 33% 55% 50% 59% 12% 51% 49% 28% 26% 30% 69% 25% 71% 37% 45% 36% 38% 76% 38% 38% 26% 36% 29% 35% 31% 42% 33% 39% 44% 44% 37% 24% 33% 24% 44% 35% 37% 39% 20% 32% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Condition Very poor Poor Fair Good Excellent Condition of Kansas Wheat as of WEEK #15 4/14/24 Figure 2: Historical Crop Conditions for Wheat in Kansas for Specific Week @ibendahl 5 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 \u221210 0 10 30 40 50 60 70 CCI Score Deviation from Trend \u2212 Bu/Ac WEEK #15 Yield Prediction Based on CCI Score Figure 3: Expected Yield (Trend Deviation) for Various CCI Index Values for Specific Week @ibendahl 6 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Apr 07 Apr 09 Apr 11 Apr 13 Apr 15 Date of prediction Bu/ac Estimate Expected High Low Expected Wheat Yield for Kansas by Date of Estimation Figure 4: Weekly Model Predictions Since 4/7/24 @ibendahl 7",

    "document": "\nMain Menu\nBreadcrumb\nU.S. climate outlook for September 2024\nAfter a very hot early and middle part of summer, August provided a welcome relief across much of the nation, with much-above-normal temperatures largely confined to the Deep South. The summer as a whole did average much warmer than average across the western and eastern parts of the nation, with only the central part of the nation having an average summer.\nSummer precipitation was generally below normal across most of the country, with only those areas that were hit by tropical systems (Beryl in the middle of the nation during July, Debby in the East during August) seeing above-average rainfall for the summer. Those summer precipitation deficits contributed to a large increase in drought, with the amount of the country experiencing drought more than doubling between early June and late August.\nAs we head into fall, will temperatures remain moderate, or will summer (in the form of hot weather) make a return? Will drought continue to expand across the nation or will beneficial rains start to reduce drought? Here\u2019s the outlook from NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) for September.\nThe U.S. temperature outlook for September 2024, showing where the monthly temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red) for September or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average September.\u00a0Much warmer\u00a0or\u00a0much cooler than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of average September temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nOn August 31, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for September 2024. The temperature outlook in general favors well above average temperatures across most of the western and central parts of the nation, along the Gulf Coast and in New England. Below-average temperatures are favored in the Mid-Atlantic, with no tilt in odds toward any category for locations in between. The precipitation outlook favors well above average precipitation along the Pacific Northwest Coast and in a region extending from the Southern Plains, through the Southeast, to the southern mid-Atlantic. Well below average precipitation is favored across much of the North, from the Northern Rockies eastward to parts of the Northeast and also in the central Rockies and the Southwest.\nThe precipitation outlook for September 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens) or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average September.\u00a0Much higher\u00a0or\u00a0much lower than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total September precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nIn addition to providing more specifics about the outlooks and their basis, I\u2019ll discuss the current state of drought, changes in drought observed during August, and the drought outlook for September. Finally, here\u2019s my monthly reminder that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the most likely outcome, but that other outcomes are always possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found here.\nThe updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC\u2019s own Week 2 and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. With the expected arrival of La Ni\u00f1a somewhat delayed, it did not play a role in the September outlooks. Recent boundary conditions such as coastal sea surface temperatures (which can impact temperatures along the coast) and observed soil moisture (extremes in soil moisture (both wet and dry) can influence temperatures and precipitation during the warm part of the year) were also considered for these outlooks.\nTemperature outlook favors more heat in the West, uncertainty in much of the East\nThe September temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across much of the western half of the nation, along the Gulf Coast into Florida, and in parts of the Northeast. (Well above average means \u201cin the warmest third of all Septembers in the recent climate record.\u201d) Well below normal temperatures are slightly favored for parts of the Mid-Atlantic region with equal chance odds found (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average) in the remainder of the eastern half of the country and along the Pacific coastal regions.\nThe best odds for a warmer-than-normal September are in southern Florida and out West in a region extending from the Northern Plains southward to the desert Southwest, with probabilities exceeding 60%. Temperatures are forecast to be above average in the western region in all CPC outlooks (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4), as well as in Florida, where well above normal sea surface temperatures surround the peninsula. Above-average temperatures are favored early in the month along the West Coast, but troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) is predicted during the latter half of the month, which injects enough uncertainty into the monthly average that the forecast is \u201cequal chances\u201d along the coast.\nIt\u2019s a much different story in the eastern half of the nation, as September looks to begin with below-average temperatures during the first half of the month. Longer range outlooks (Weeks 3-4) do favor above-average temperatures, so \u201cequal chances\u201d is the outlook for much of this region. The exception is the mid-Atlantic, where the cooler temperatures early in the month are likely to outweigh the warmer temperatures later in the month.\nPrecipitation outlook tilts wet in across the South, mainly dry across the North\nThe precipitation outlook for September once again has a fairly large amount of the country with a non-\u201cequal chances\u201d forecast. Above-average rainfall is favored across much of the South, from West Texas eastward across the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic and also in the coastal Pacific Northwest. The tilt in the odds is largest in Texas, where heavy rainfall is anticipated during the first week of the month and in Florida where above-average rainfall is favored during most of the month. Finally, although the month is predicted to start dry in the Northwest, forecasts for Week-2 and Weeks 3-4 favor above-average rainfall with the approaching trough.\nBelow-average precipitation is slightly favored from parts of the Southwest northward across the Central Rockies into Montana, consistent with a dry start to the month and longer-range guidance favoring either below normal or equal chances. Throughout the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes, confidence for below-average September precipitation is higher, as below-normal rainfall is favored during all time periods.\nU. S. Drought area increases further during August\nThe amount of drought increased during August across the continuous United States, from about 20% to almost 28%, with another 35% of the nation in the DO category (abnormally dry) as we begin September. The percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing extreme and exceptional drought) also increased during the month to almost 2.5%, although that is still fairly low by historical standards.\nThe summer of 2024 has been relatively hot and dry across much of the contiguous United States, and the area that is either abnormally dry (yellow) or in some level of drought (moderate, light orange; severe, orange; extreme, bright red; exceptional, dark red) expanded considerably between June 4 (left) and August 27 (right). Areas of exceptional drought appeared in Montana, Texas, West Virginia, and Ohio. Moderate to severe drought was in place in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and the Deep South. NOAA Climate.gov map from our\u00a0Data Snapshots Collection,\u00a0based on data from the U.S. Drought Monitor project.\u00a0\nRegionally, much of the nation saw drought degradation, particularly from the Southern Plains into the Deep South. Much of this region recorded 2-3 class changes. Mainly 1 class degradation was observed over parts of the West, central and northern Great Plains (up to 2 class changes) and in parts of Ohio and West Virginia, where despite modest changes (1-2 classes), exceptional drought (D4) developed for the first time in the 25-year Drought Monitor history. In contrast, significant drought improvement (often drought removal) was observed in parts of the East, mainly along the path of Debby, where upwards of 10 inches of rain eliminated drought in most of South Carolina and lesser amounts of rainfall improved drought conditions by 1-2 classes farther north.\nDrought outlook mainly predicts persistence and development, but improvement across parts of the South\nU.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in September 2024. Across Texas and the Deep South, drought is likely to end (green) or at least improve (tan). But significant parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Rockies, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and northern West Virginia and the Ohio River valley are likely to see drought develop (yellow) or persist or worsen (dark brown). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). See\u00a0CPC version\u00a0for Alaska and Hawaii.\nWith above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation favored during September over much of the western half of the nation, drought persistence with some new development is most likely. The exception is in parts of eastern New Mexico and Texas, where improvement or removal is likely, consistent with the expectation of above-normal rainfall, particularly during the beginning of the month. The eastern half of the nation is more of a mixed bag, with improvement and removal likely in regions where above-normal rainfall is favored across much of the South and persistence and some development (over parts of the Midwest) where the odds favor either below-average rainfall or there is no tilt in the odds towards any category.\nTo read the entire discussion of the monthly climate outlooks from the Climate Prediction Center, check out their\u00a0website.\nWe value your feedback\nHelp us improve our content\nRelated Content\nNEWS & FEATURES\nMAPS & DATA\nTEACHING CLIMATE\nCLIMATE RESILIENCE TOOLKIT\nStay Connected\n",

Corn is no exception and to ensure a future supply we must begin to understand how climate impacts both the phenological development of corn and the productivity. Temperature and precipitation are the two climate factors that will have a major benefit on corn phenology and productivity. The warming climate will accelerate the phenological development because the number of thermal units required for leaf appearance is relatively constant in the vegetative stage. Productivity of corn is reduced when extreme temperature events occur during pollination and is further exaggerated when there are water deficits at pollination. During the grain-filling period, warm temperatures above the upper threshold cause a reduction in yield. Model estimates suggest that for every 1\u00b0C increase in temperature there is nearly a 10% yield reduction. To meet world demand, new adaptation practices are needed to provide water to the growing crop and avoid extreme temperature events during the growing season. Climate change will continue to affect corn production and understanding these effects will help determine where future production areas exist and innovative adaptation practices to benefit yield stability could be utilized.\nKeywords\nAuthor Information\n*Address all correspondence to: jerry.hatfield@ars.usda.gov\n1. Introduction\nCorn (Zea mays L.) is grown throughout the world and as such is subject to a wide variety of climates and potential scenarios of climate change. Production area continues to increase in response to the increased demand for corn grain and the production per unit area (yield) has continued to increase due to enhanced technology (Figure 1). What is imperative to stability and increases in future production is understanding how climate change will impact this trend in corn production and the areas of the world where corn is produced. Corn is a grain crop with both food and feed uses and variation in production at the local scale can have major impact on local economies and local food supplies as well as world food security.\nWorld corn yield and area harvested since 1960 (data obtained from FAO stat, http://www.fao.org/faostat/en, downloaded March 8, 2018).\nWorld corn yield and area harvested since 1960 (data obtained from FAO stat, http://www.fao.org/faostat/en, downloaded March 8, 2018).\nThe trend line for corn yield has shown a steady increase and a small amount of variation among the years; however, at the local scale is where the impacts of seasonal weather and trends in climate become more noticeable. Across the United States, there have been large deviations from the trend line in years in which weather events have caused yield reductions (Figure 2). Throughout this chapter, we will focus on the impacts of climate on corn phenology and production to provide an understanding of the potential for adaptation strategies. In this chapter we will focus on three components critical to corn production: the changing climate, impact of climate on corn phenology and phenological models, and impact of climate on corn productivity.\nDeviations from the yield trend line for corn production in the United States from 1950 to 2017.

Projections of climate change\nProjections of climate change are a result of a combined set of simulation models using various scenarios of changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and the associated forcing functions [1]. The current CO2 concentrations are at nearly 400\u00a0ppm in 2018 and are projected to increase to a range of 794\u20131142\u00a0ppm by 2100 without any abatement scenarios [1]. The result of these efforts can be summarized as [1, 2]:Global mean temperatures will continue to increase throughout the twenty-first century if CO2 concentrations continue to increase and under the highest emission scenario would range from 2.6 to 4.8\u00b0C.These temperatures changes will not be uniform across regions with increases over land surfaces being larger than over the oceans.As the global temperatures increase there will be more hot extremes and fewer cold extremes at both daily and seasonal time scales.Precipitation will increase with increases in global mean surface temperature and could increase 1 to 3% \u00b0C\u22121; however, there will be substantial spatial variation in these changes.The water holding capacity of air increases by 7% \u00b0C\u22121. The air can take up more water, and water vapor inclines. That leads to higher intensity of precipitation, i.e. higher amount of rainfall per rain event.Annual surface evaporation will increase as the temperatures increases; however, over land, evaporation will be linked to precipitation.\nGlobal mean temperatures will continue to increase throughout the twenty-first century if CO2 concentrations continue to increase and under the highest emission scenario would range from 2.6 to 4.8\u00b0C.\nThese temperatures changes will not be uniform across regions with increases over land surfaces being larger than over the oceans.\nAs the global temperatures increase there will be more hot extremes and fewer cold extremes at both daily and seasonal time scales.\nPrecipitation will increase with increases in global mean surface temperature and could increase 1 to 3% \u00b0C\u22121; however, there will be substantial spatial variation in these changes.\nThe water holding capacity of air increases by 7% \u00b0C\u22121.

A general summary of climate impacts on crops was prepared by Hatfield et al. [3] and reveal for corn that temperature and precipitation are the two critical factors. Since corn is a C4 plant, the response to increasing CO2 will be minimal. Leakey et al. [4] found that leaf photosynthetic response was 3% to a doubling of CO2 concentrations while total biomass and grain yield increased by 4%. They did observe that leaf stomatal conductance was decreased by 34% under these same experiments. These differences in physiological activity due to increased CO2 are small compared to C3 species and will not the most evident response to the changing climate. Therefore, in this chapter we will focus on temperature and precipitation impacts on corn.\n3. Phenology of corn\nThe phenology of corn has been described as the appearance of leaves or leaf collars during the vegetative stage and accumulation of material in the grain during the reproductive stage. The developmental stages of corn has been recently described by Abendroth et al. [5] and similar guidelines are used to quantify the phenological stage of corn during the growth cycle. What is important for assessing the effect of climate on corn is to explore what role climate variables have on corn phenology. The most critical variable in phenological development is temperature and each plant has a specific range of temperatures for growth as defined as the upper and lower limit (threshold) and an optimum [3]. For corn during the vegetative stage this has been identified as 8 to 38\u00b0C with an optimum of 34\u00b0C [6, 7] while the range for the reproductive stage is 8\u201330\u00b0C [8]. Typically, the lower temperature limit in growth models has assumed to be 10\u00b0C. Survival of pollen are sensitive to temperature, e.g., temperatures exceeding 35\u00b0C have been proven detrimental to pollen viability [9, 10]. There is a strong interaction of temperature with vapor pressure deficit and the viability in the time of movement from the tassel to the silk has been shown to decrease with decreasing moisture content [11]. These results would suggest that as the temperature increases and vapor pressure deficit increases that disruption of the pollination process could become more likely especially with the potential for more extreme temperature events. Quantifying the impact of episodes of temperature extremes on pollen viability and the disruption of reproductive processes will become more important with the projection that extreme temperature events will increase under climate change (Tebabldi et al. [12]). These temperature ranges and the potential for extreme events will become important for corn growth and production because of the projection that temperatures will increase in the future.\nThe relationship of corn phenology to temperature has been described through the use of growing degree days with a growing degree day (GDD) calculated as (Tmax\u00a0+\u00a0Tmin)/2 \u2013 Tbase, where Tmax is the maximum daily temperature, Tmin is the daily minimum temperature and Tbase is the temperature at which growth stops. Kumudini et al. [13] evaluated eight different thermal models for the estimation of corn phenological development. These thermal models were classified into empirical linear typical of the GDD model first shown by Gilmore and Rogers [14] with the most robust model having a Tbase of 10\u00b0C and an optimum of 30\u00b0C. Another class of thermal models is the empirical nonlinear model described by Brown and Bootsma [15] where the following relationships were used to estimate crop heat units (CHU): if Tmin\u00a0<\u00a04.4\u00b0C then Tmin\u00a0=\u00a04.4\u00b0C to derive CHUmin\u00a0=\u00a01.8(Tmin \u2013 4.4\u00b0C); if Tmax\u00a0<\u00a010\u00b0C then Tmax\u00a0=\u00a010\u00b0C; to derive CHUmax\u00a0=\u00a03.33(Tmax \u2013 10\u00b0C) \u2013 0.084(Tmax \u2013 10\u00b0C)2 and CHU\u00a0= (CHUmax\u00a0+\u00a0CHUmin)/2. Stewart et al. [16] used a non-linear empirical model and separated the vegetative and reproductive stages of growth with different functions. The third class of thermal models can be classified as the process-based models similar to the thermal functions used in Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) as described by Wilson et al. [17] which are based on estimates of air temperature at 3 hour intervals throughout the day and given as: if T\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b0C then T\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0C and if T\u00a0>\u00a044\u00b0C then T\u00a0=\u00a044\u00b0C and calculated for different temperature ranges as 0\u00b0C\u00a0=\u00a0< T\u00a0<\u00a010\u00b0C: IR\u00a0=\u00a0T(10/18\u00b0C); 18\u00b0C\u00a0=\u00a0< T\u00a0<\u00a034\u00b0C: IR\u00a0=\u00a0T \u2013 8\u00b0C; and 34\u00b0C\u00a0=\u00a0< T\u00a0<\u00a044\u00b0C: IR\u00a0=\u00a026\u00b0C \u2013 (T \u2013 34\u00b0C)2.6 and thermal units are given as \u2211(IR/8), where IR\u00a0=\u00a0instantaneous rates or measurements. In comparing these different approaches, Kumudini et al. [13] found that the precision in terms of goodness of fit was calendar days < empirical linear < process-based < empirical non-linear.\nAn application of the GDD approach was developed by Neild and Richman [18] where they combined thermal units with precipitation in an agroclimatic index to determine where different corn hybrids could be grown around the world. Currently, this type of model has been replaced with simulation models similar to APSIM [19] to determine climate impacts on corn growth and production. If the thermal units per leaf appearance rate is constant for the vegetative stage of growth then as the temperature increases there will be a more rapid accumulation of leaves in the crop. This effect as observed by Hatfield [20] and Hatfield and Prueger [21] for corn grown under climatic normal (1980\u20132010) for Ames, Iowa and normal +4\u00b0C temperatures throughout the complete growing season for three different corn hybrids. There was no difference in the total number of leaf collars and cumulative leaf area between temperature regimes; however, there was a large difference in yield with the higher temperatures greatly reducing grain yield (Figure 4). Analysis revealed there was no difference in the GDD\u2019s for leaf collar appearance between the two temperature regimes suggesting that as temperatures increase there will be a more rapid rate of advancement in the phenological development with no effect on the size of the corn plant at the end of the vegetative stage. There was a large difference in grain yield between temperature regimes with a faster rate of maturity with a subsequent reduction in grain production.\nDifferences in total leaf collars, cumulative leaf area, and grain yield of three corn hybrids grown under normal Ames, Iowa temperatures and normal +4\u00b0C temperatures.

Effects of increased temperatures have shown a large degree of variation with projections of reduced production by less than 5% with temperature increases of 1\u00b0C [3] to over 50% with 4\u00b0C increases [22]. Productivity of corn is affected by temperatures exceeding 35\u00b0 C during pollination due to dehydration of the pollen [3]. Controlled environment studies have confirmed the effect of high temperatures on corn with temperatures greater than or equal to 3\u00b0C above normal temperatures showing maize yield reductions of over 50% in grain yield [20, 21]. They observed an increased rate of phenology with increased temperatures; however, the largest effect on productivity was attributed to the increase in minimum temperatures during the grain-filling period. Field studies on corn have shown under field conditions yield reductions from 13 to 88% due to increased temperature 6\u00b0C above normal temperatures [23]. The negative effects of high temperatures during the grain-filling period were attributed to pollen survivability and the efficiency of the grain-filling process. Increasing temperatures likely to be experienced under climate change demonstrate several negative effects plant growth and phenology. Lizaso et al. [24] recorded a reduction of corn yield under field and controlled conditions owing to reduced pollen viability as impacted by increased temperatures. A critical knowledge gap under future climate scenarios will be to evaluate the interaction of high temperature and increased humidity on pollen survivability and the efficiency of the pollination process. Lobell and Field [25] found maize yields decreased 8.3% per 1\u00b0C rise without any additional effect due to water stress which was confirmed by Mishra and Cherkauer [26] for Midwest corn grain yields. Challinor et al. [27] compiled a meta-analysis of over 1700 published simulations for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), and corn. They found that without implementing adaptation strategies there would be a loss in yield in both temperate and tropical regions with only 2\u00b0C of warming. They also found that adaptation practices could increase simulated yields by 7\u201315% with this same temperature increase; however, the practices were more effective in wheat and rice than for corn. There was consensus among the simulation models that yield decreases were be greater in the second half of the century with the greater declines in the tropical areas compared to the temperate regions. They estimated that corn yields would decrease by nearly 15% in temperate regions with a 4\u00b0C increase and no adaptation but showed no decrease with adaptation practices [27].\nTemperature and precipitation interact to affect corn productivity. Short-term water deficits and drought reduce growth and grain yield and are often the largest cause of crop losses. In the United States, drought was related to 41% of crop losses, while excess water was attributed to 16% of the yield loss [28]. Drought stress during the early and middle reproductive stages affected grain yields and these phenological stages were found to be the most sensitive to water stress [29]. Increases in spring precipitation can cause yield reductions due to aeration stress caused by flooded soils; however, drought stress remained the primary factor linked with reduced grain production [29]. In rainfed environments where corn is primarily grown, temperature and precipitation changes under climate change will negatively impact grain production and these interactions need to be more fully understood. In an analysis of wheat production in Europe, Semenov et al. [30], stated that understanding of the effects of higher temperatures and drought stresses during the booting and flowering periods would potentially lead to adaptation practices with the potential to reduce losses in grain numbers and grain weight. With both short-term water stress and drought as major factors affecting grain yield, improved water availability through more extensive root system and changes in root architecture would benefit yield stability [31]. The excess soil moisture in the root zone will require improved soil structure to facilitate gas exchange between the root system and the atmosphere [32]. The impact of precipitation is a combination of the precipitation amount and the soil water holding capacity. This was illustrated in an analysis by Egli and Hatfield [33] where they found average county level corn yields were a function of the soils ability to supply water.\nEvaluation of corn yield response to climate is complex because of the interactions of the impacts of temperature and precipitation. To provide a more robust framework for evaluating yield response the utilization of the yield gap as the difference between potential yield and actual yield has been utilized ([34]; van Bussel et al. [35]). This concept has been discussed and utilized for several decades but recently has been extended to create a yield gap atlas for the world. The yield gap approach allows for a quantitative assessment of the ability of the crop to achieve its potential yield and the inability of closing the yield gap can often be ascribed to climatic stress. Potential yield has been defined as \u201cthe yield of a cultivar when grown in environments to which it is adapted; with nutrients and water not limiting; and with pests, diseases, weeds, and other stresses effectively controlled\u201d [36]. Potential yield (YP) is an expression of the ability of a crop canopy to convert solar radiation into dry matter with no stress during the growth cycle and radiation use efficiency can be used as a measure of this efficiency [37]. The goal of agronomic science is the evaluate practices and increasing the farmer yield (YF) may prove to be more fruitful than increasing potential yield (YP) ([38]; Lobell et al. [39]. Utilizing the yield gap approach provides a framework for evaluating the factors which affect crop yields and the phenological stage which these factors are having the most significant impact during the growing season. These studies are not simple analyses, because of the interactions of multiple factors affecting yield, and Sinclair and Ruffy [40] argue that nitrogen and water limit crop yield more than plant genetics and should be considered as the primary factors limiting yield. Understanding the yield gap requires being able to quantify both potential and actual yield and comparison among studies is often limited by the lack of consistent data and to advance our understanding of yield gaps will require standardized method for yield comparisons [41]. Fischer et al. [41] introduced attainable yield (YA) as a metric between YF and YP defined as the yield achieved by a producer under near optimum weather and management inputs. Hatfield et al. [42] utilized this approach on county level corn yields in the Midwest United States and defined the attainable yield as the years with the highest yield in the long-term record as illustrated in Figure 5. The values for attainable yield are derived by statistically fitting a line through the frontier of the yield observations and then computing the yield gap as the difference between the attainable and actual observed yield for each year. In this analysis, data from 1950 through the present are used because this represents the period of time with corn hybrids and enhanced production technology. This approach has been used for different crops and regions of the world to obtain yield gaps.\nYield gap analysis for Story County, Iowa, USA using attainable yields derived from annual production values. (data obtained from the National Agricultural Statistics Service, www.nass.usda.gov, accessed March 8, 2018).\nYield gap analysis for Story County, Iowa, USA using attainable yields derived from annual production values. (data obtained from the National Agricultural Statistics Service, www.nass.usda.gov, accessed March 8, 2018).\nHatfield et al. [42] utilized the yield gap approach for the Midwestern US to quantify the effects of climate variability on corn production and found three dominant climatic factors related to the yield gap. These were July maximum temperatures, August minimum temperatures, and July\u2013August total precipitation. Yield gaps increased when July maximum temperatures exceeded 32\u00b0C, August minimum temperatures exceeded 20\u00b0C, and July\u2013August precipitation totals decreased below 150\u00a0mm. The physiological reasons for these variables are related to the disruption of pollination (July temperatures), increased rate of senescence and reduced efficiency of grain-fill (August minimum temperatures), and water deficits during a period of the year with high crop water requirements (July\u2013August precipitation). These relationships were observed for each county in the Midwest and utilized to project the impact of future climate change on the yield gap on corn production. They found that with the trends in temperature for the summer in the Midwest US that yield gaps would exceed 50% by the year 2075 in the southern portion of the Corn Belt. There were some counties in the Midwest in which excess moisture in the spring was related to the yield gap but these relationships were not robust enough for use in projections of future climates. The yield gap framework provides a robust method for assessing the impact of climate on yield variation over time and when combined with efforts similar to those used by Challinor et al. [27] could be used to quantify the impact of adaptation practices.\n5. Agroclimatic indices to define corn production regions\nCorn is produced around the world and within these areas there may be shifts in production areas due to the changing climate. Green et al. [43] have quantified the changes in the US Corn Belt and provided a geographic analysis to depict these shifts in distribution. Development and utilization of agroclimatic indices has value in being able to assess these shifts because they are related to temperature and precipitation. Neild and Richman [18] were among the first to use the GDD concept to define potential differences among corn hybrids. Development of tools to define where crops can be produced is critical to understand crop distribution and productivity [44]. Estimation of crop distribution within arable areas is necessary to determine whether a species can thrive in an agroclimatic zone and will become more critical with the projected increases in temperature. Zomer et al. [45] extended this concept to demonstrate how climate zones could be used to evaluate technologies that would enhance the ability of management practices to offset the impacts of climate change on crop production. There have continued to be advances in the development of agroclimatic indices to evaluate the suitability of a location for a particular crop since Neild and Richman [18]. Siddons et al. [46] cautioned that development of robust agroclimatic indices requires observations collected over long time periods and extensive observations from experimental locations. There has been an evolution in agroclimatic indices to include more factors affecting plant growth and development to derive values that characterize the environment and the potential for crop production. Typical factors are: average daily minimum temperatures below 0\u00b0C; daily mean temperature to estimate crop development rates; average daily maximum temperature above 35\u00b0C to estimate exposure to heat stress, especially during pollination; average daily soil water availability (precipitation\u2013reference evapotranspiration (ET)); and length of specific phenological periods to estimate the effects of changing phenological development on biomass accumulation and crop yield [47]. They found a positive relationship between productivity and their suitability index [47]. This approach is a refinement of the effort by Neild and Richman [18] and incorporated more factors to more link crop physiological responses with phenological development.\nAgroclimatic zones are a combination of factors affecting plant growth to evaluate the potential for grain or forage crop production (e.g., [18, 44, 48?51]). The form of the index depends upon the assumption of the factors limiting growth. Soil water availability is often the determining factor in crop production in all ecosystems and the application has ranged from determination of irrigation water requirements or potential impacts on production caused by water deficits. Daccache et al. [49] incorporated soil water variability to evaluate the need for irrigation for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production in England and Wales. Their index was based on the potential soil moisture deficit (PSMD) index defined as:\nwhere PSMDi is the value in month i and PSMDi\u22121 is the value for the previous month, ETi is the reference ET for the current month calculated with the Penman-Monteith equation formulated by Allen et al. [52], and Pi the precipitation in the current month. They found increased variation in precipitation decreased potato production in an area currently suited for production, unless supplemental water was provide through irrigation. This type of analyses could be utilized to determine the need for supplemental irrigation to ensure crop production.\nAnother form of this type of framework was developed by Moeletsi and Walker [51] to quantify climate risk for corn production in South Africa. They based their index, Poone AgroClimatic Suitability Index (PACSI), on three climatic parameters; onset of rains, frost risk, and drought risk utilized a weighed distribution of climate parameters as\nwhere O is the probability planting conditions are met, FF is the probability of a frost-free growing period, and the water requirements satisfaction index (WRSI). These indices require sufficient data over a long period of record to develop the probability of the different indices to develop reliable probability assessments [46]. An aspect of this index is the assessment of drought risk which is a complex interaction by soil water holding capacity and any change in the soil affecting water availability (Eq. 2).\nPrecipitation effects on crop productivity are defined by the occurrence of the water deficits in the soil profile which fail to meet the evaporative demand. Agroclimatic indices for arid and semiarid regions are often based on precipitation amounts adequate to exceed the ET rate at the time of planting in order to ensure crop establishment [18, 47, 48, 49, 51]. Moeletsi and Walker [51] evaluated soil water dynamics based on the WRSI to determine the potential to meet crop water requirements at any phenological stage as\nwhere WRi is the water requirements for a decadal period during growing season, PETi is the potential ET during this decadal period, and kci the crop coefficient for this corresponding phenological period. For any decadal period during the growing season, the soil water balance can be used to estimate plant available water (WAi) as\nand Preci is the precipitation in a given decadal period and SWi-1 is the profile soil water content for the previous decadal period. Soil water holding capacity (WHC) becomes a critical component of this method because available SW is a function of WHC. They computed the WRSI as\nwith WDi the water deficit for decadal period i, defined as\nOr\nIn this process soil water in the profile is quantified as\nUsing this methodology, Moeletsi and Walker [51] were able to evaluate the suitability for maize production for various planting dates with a correlation of 0.8 between the PACSI and grain yields.\nPrecipitation is changing in intensity and frequency, and directly affect WAi (Eq. 3). Precipitation patterns are projected to increase in annual totals, with decreasing summer precipitation amounts over the US [1, 53]. If we link these precipitation patterns with the PACSI (Eq. 2), then corn production could become more variable among years because of soil water availability.\nUtilization of agroclimatic indices as a tool for the assessment of climate impacts on corn production areas will provide a quantitative view of shifts in production areas but potential risks to production within areas where corn is currently produced. The continued development of these tools will benefit corn production because we can evaluate the potential role of management and genetic resources on increasing yield stability over time.\n6. Simulation models to quantify climate effects\nSimulation models have been extensively used to estimate the impact of a changing climate on productivity. In 2014, Challinor et al. [27] summarized 1700 published reports using simulation models and the number of papers has increased rapidly since that time. Simulation models provide the capability of assessing the potential impacts of the change in temperature and precipitation under a given CO2 regime and often models using the different emission scenarios to determine the expected temperature and precipitation parameters which are then placed into crop simulation models [54, 55]. It has been found that an ensemble of crop models provides a more rigorous approach to estimating crop responses to climate. This is being conducted under the Agricultural Model Implementation and Improvement Project (AgMIP) framework as described by Rosenzweig et al. [56]. Bassu et al. [57] used this framework to compare 23 different corn models and found temperature decreased yield by approximately \u22120.5\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121\u00b0C\u22121 while doubling the CO2 from 360 to 720\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0mol\u22121 increased yield by 7.5% across all models and sites. They concluded that temperature increases would be the dominant factor affecting corn yields. Zhao et al. [58] summarized a number of published results and found for each 1\u00b0C increase, corn yields decreased by 7.4%. Jin et al. [59] used the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model to evaluate the effect of different CO2 scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for corn production in the US and found drought will be the largest factor affecting production. However, they stated that combined impacts of temperature and water stress need to be evaluated in breeding programs and adaptation strategies [59]. Earlier, Jin et al. [60] evaluated the algorithms in 16 different corn models and concluded that heat and drought stress was best simulated when models used event-based heat and water stress descriptions, accounted for nighttime temperature stresses, and evaluated the interactions of multiple stresses. Crop models allow for an assessment of the role of genetics and management on productivity for a range of present and future environmental conditions. Hatfield and Walthall [31] utilized this concept as the G x E x M (genetics \u00d7 environment \u00d7 management) framework to determine how these interactions would need to be understood to provide food security for the future population growth.\nThere have been efforts to combine observations with crop simulation models to evaluate changes in yield and yield stability. Leng [61] found yield variability across the US Corn Belt has decreased from 1980 to 2010 with climatic variability the major factor affected variability among years and regions. He found that statistical models explained more of the yield variation than crop simulation models. Bhattarai et al. [62] used the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model with the combined results for eight general circulation models to show that under low and medium carbon scenarios, corn yields during the period 2080\u20132099 increased compared to the 2015\u20132034 period, while under the high carbon scenario yields during these same periods decreased. Lychuk et al. [63]) also used EPIC for the southeastern United States and found in the near-term corn yields increased, but from 2066 to 2070 yields decreased 5\u201313% because of the increased temperature stress. Huang et al. [64] combined field experiments with crop simulation models to evaluate the potential effect of different growing season length corn hybrids and found the longer growing season hybrid did not yield as high as the medium length hybrid. These results suggest that efforts be placed in evaluating the efficiency of plant growth relative to the changes in temperature and the accumulation of growing degree days.\nThe Global Agro-ecological zones model (GAEZ) categorizes areas suitable for crop production by climate, soil, terrain, management, and the specific growth limitations of crops, among others [65, 66]. One essential concept of GAEZ climate module is the temperature growing period (LGPt), where air temperature is used as a proxy to estimate days of the growing period with optimal, sub-optimal, and no suitable crop production conditions for a specific crop. The growing period L is defined as the number of days with average daily temperature\u00a0>\u00a05\u00b0C (i.e., LGPt5). The corn-specific LGPt\u2019s are summarized in Table 1. For example, assume a temperate corn cultivar for grain production with a total growing period between 90 and 180\u00a0days. During this period average daily air temperature shall not decrease below 5\u00b0C, and the number of days with daily average air temperature between 10 and 15\u00b0C shall be below \u215f5 of the total growing period to reach optimum growing conditions. In addition to air temperature, the length of the growing period is further limited by the moisture regime, defined as actual ET\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.5 * reference ET.\nTable 1.\nCorn growing period L (LGPt5), optimum, and sub-optimum conditions of tropical lowland, tropical highland, and subtropical and temperature cultivars for grain production, as well as subtropical and temperate cultivars for silage production.\nAdapted and simplified from [66]\nThe GAEZ model also estimates potential yield of a specific crop in a specific agro-ecological zone, and applies constraint factors, such as heat or water stress, to calculate actual yield and yield gap. For example, periods of potential water stress occur when actual ET is below the total water requirement of a crop, maximum ET, and the difference between both cannot be compensated by precipitation, plant available water, or irrigation. Maximum ET is calculated as reference ET multiplied by crop coefficient kc. Maximum ET is crop specific and changes during crop development by applying crop-development specific kc values (Figure 6). The derived water stress data is then used to calculate yield constraining factors. The GAEZ model also determines which production areas are threatened by climatic changes by applying different climatic scenarios. Using this approach, Teixeira et al. [67] estimated that 5 Mha of cropland suitable for corn production are at risk due to climate change induced heat stress, and that yield declines are expected especially in the Northern hemisphere between 40 and 60\u00b0N latitudes.\nCrop development specific kc values for corn: kc1, kc2, kc3, and kc4 applies for the initial (d1), vegetative (d2), reproductive (d3), and maturation (d4) development period, respectively. Crop coefficient kc5 applies to the end of the growing period. Corn kc2 and kc4 data are linearly interpolated between kc1, kc3, and kc5. The four corn development stages make up 15, 30, 35, and 20% of the total growing period. Data, equations, and redrawn graph according to IIASA/FAO [66]. In this example, total growing period (day of planting until harvest) was 173\u00a0days, for two corn fields nearby Ames, IA, USA from 2006 to 2017.\nCrop development specific kc values for corn: kc1, kc2, kc3, and kc4 applies for the initial (d1), vegetative (d2), reproductive (d3), and maturation (d4) development period, respectively.

Integration of these two aspects into a single framework will allow for a more complete assessment of the corn production system being experienced by producers.\n7. Conclusions\nClimate impacts on corn production due to the changing temperature and precipitation regimes in the corn growing areas. The largest impact of these changes will be at the local scale where within season weather induced by the change in climate will become more noticeable. Increasing temperatures will increase the rate of phenological development during the vegetative and reproductive stages; however, the most negative effects will be exposure to high temperatures during the pollination and grain-filling stages. The largest impact on corn production will remain linked to the availability of soil water through precipitation and variation in precipitation during the grain-filling period will have the most detrimental impact on corn production. To overcome the effects of climate change there will be shifts in areas where corn is produced; however, these shifts may not be into areas with the capacity of the soil to support high production or have large variation in yield among years due to the variation in within season weather [33]. What will be critical is to increase our understanding of the G \u00d7 E \u00d7 M interactions as suggested by Hatfield and Walthall [31] in order to reduce the risk in production from a changing climate. What will be critical will be to use our current knowledge base (i.e. genetic resources (G) and management techniques (M)) to determine the viability of potential adaptation strategies to overcome climate changes (E). Combining experimental studies with crop simulation models will advance our understanding of the complex interactions occurring between the biological system and the physical environment and guide us toward viable adaptation practices with the potential to offset the negative impacts of climate change.\nReferences\nSections\nCite this chapter\nThere are two ways to cite this chapter:\nNext chapter\nBy Amanullah and Shah Fahad\n1,343 downloads  | 4 cites\nWritten By\nSubmitted: 06 February 2018 Reviewed: 02 April 2018 Published: 10 October 2018\nCite this chapter\nThere are two ways to cite this chapter:\n\u00a9 2018 The Author(s).

    "document": "How Many Polar Bears Are Left?\nSeveral populations likely face grave danger from climate change\nPaul Souders / Getty Images\n The global polar bear population is thought to be between 22,000 and 31,000. These bears are divided into 19 subpopulations around the Arctic, with some containing fewer than 200 individuals and others consisting of more than 2,000.\n\n Polar bears' rapidly dwindling populations serve as a symbol of the climate crisis globally, but are they technically endangered? Their conservation status may surprise you. Learn more about polar bear populations, the threats these animals face, and what we can do to save them from extinction.\n\nDid You Know?\nPolar bears live in areas that fall under the jurisdiction of five countries: Canada (Labrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Qu\u00e9bec, Yukon); Denmark (Greenland); Norway (Svalbard, Jan Mayen); Russia (Yakutiya, Krasnoyarsk, West Siberia, North European Russia); and the U.S. (Alaska).\n  Are Polar Bears Endangered?  \nPaul Souders / Getty Images\n Polar bears are listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, a designation they first received in 1982 and that was upheld by the latest assessment in 2015. They are protected by the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, a multilateral treaty signed in 1973 by the five polar bear nations: Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the U.S. This agreement prohibits unregulated hunting of polar bears, including the use of aircraft or large motorized vehicles to hunt them. It compels member states to take appropriate actions to preserve the ecosystems that sustain polar bears.\n\n Although not technically endangered, the U.S. government has protected them under the Endangered Species Act since 2008, classifying them as threatened throughout their range. It's important to note that while these bears face potentially existential threats in some places, a few populations have rebounded in recent decades from overhunting in the last century, leading some people to argue polar bears are actually thriving.\n\n The late U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska was one of those people, saying in 2018 that \"there are now three times as many polar bears in the Arctic than there were in the 1970s,\" a claim that has periodically resurfaced since. According to the IUCN, it's not clear which way polar bear populations are swinging on the whole. World Wildlife Fund data from 2019 shows that more subpopulations are declining than are increasing. The largest subpopulations look to be stable.\n\nLaws Protecting Polar Bears\nCountries with polar bear populations have passed laws enacting various protections for the bears. In the U.S., polar bears are protected partly by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which prohibits the \"take\" of polar bears and other marine mammals without federal approval. They are also protected by the Endangered Species Act since being listed as a \"threatened\" species in 2008.\n  Limitations to the Data  \n Despite the encouraging rebound of some populations, there is little evidence to suggest polar bears are thriving overall. That's partly because there isn't enough long-term data on polar bears, especially for the northernmost regions.\n\n Those who doubt their current plight have claimed that only 5,000 polar bears were left in the 1960s, but that claim is largely contested by conservation experts.\n\n At least three polar bear populations are likely in decline, according to the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG), but nine of the 19 subpopulations have insufficient data. There is too little data to even estimate population size for the three in decline.\n\n While their specific status is more muddled than the overall outlook for climate change itself, there is significant evidence to suggest many polar bear populations are in peril.\n\n  How Is Climate Change Affecting Polar Bear Populations?  \nFloridaStock / Shutterstock\n To understand why polar bears are threatened by climate change, you have to consider what polar bears eat and how they get their food. Polar bears are apex predators and a keystone species in their Arctic habitats, and their favorite food, by far, is seals. They specifically target ringed and bearded seals due to their high-fat content.\n\n Polar bears spend about half their time hunting, typically by stalking seals from the sea ice and ambushing when they surface to breathe. They often travel long distances and wait hours or days for a single seal, and while only a fraction of their hunts succeed, it's generally worth the trouble for such a fatty meal.\n\n Polar bears are considered marine mammals, but while they are excellent swimmers, they are no match for a seal in the water. Sea ice is therefore instrumental to their hunting strategy, and it's now declining due to rising Arctic temperatures, now warming at roughly twice the rate of the planet overall.\n\nPaul Souders / Getty Images\n Arctic sea ice naturally waxes and wanes with the seasons, but its average late-summer minimum is now shrinking by 13% every decade, according to the NOAA. The oldest Arctic sea ice\u2014frozen for at least four years, making it more resilient than younger, thinner ice\u2014is now in steep decline. Whereas it comprised about 16% of the total ice pack in 1985, it now comprises less than 1%, representing a loss of 95% over just 33 years.\n\n In 2020, Arctic sea ice reached its second-lowest extent since record-keeping began. This decline is alarming for several reasons: Arctic sea ice performs key services for the planet like reflecting solar heat and influencing ocean currents. It's even more directly important for polar bears, as less sea ice means fewer chances for them to catch seals.\n\nPosnov / Getty Images\n The effects of climate change vary by location, and sea ice decline seems to be affecting some bears more than others. Western Hudson Bay had roughly 1,200 polar bears in the 1980s, for example, but that has since fallen to 842, and as Polar Bears International (PBI) notes, trends in their body condition, survival, and abundance have been linked to sea ice conditions. Bears in Southern Hudson Bay have also suffered a 17% decline since 2012, according to PBI, and their body conditions have similarly been linked to a longer ice-free period.\n\n Most other subpopulations are either considered stable or lack sufficient data, but many will likely also face dire challenges from the loss of sea ice in their habitats. Some might be able to adapt, but their options likely will be limited. Even if they can exploit new food sources on land, they could face competition or conflict with established residents like brown bears and people.\n\n Polar bears are slow to adapt due to their low reproductive rate and long time between generations. That doesn't bode well given the speed of modern climate change, already happening too quickly for many species to keep up.\n\nPolar bears can live up to about 30 years, but environmental factors (melting Arctic ice, for example) can significantly decrease their lifespans.\nPolar bears are apex predators and a keystone species in the Arctic. Without them, animals like Arctic foxes and seagulls would lose a food source. Seals, reindeer, whales, and birds that polar bears eat would become overpopulated.\nThe best way to help polar bear populations today is to fight climate change\u2014both systematically and in your own life. Drive less, reduce your energy consumption, recycle, and swap some of your meat intake with locally grown veggies. If you have the means, consider donating to a charity like Polar Bears International.\n\"Polar Bear Facts.\" World Wildlife Fund.\nWiig, \u00d8., et al.\u00a0\"Ursus maritimus.\"\u00a0The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\u00a02015: e.T22823A14871490.\u00a0Accessed on\u00a015 June 2022.\n\"Arctic Report Card.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Arctic Program. 2021.\n\"Climate Change: Arctic Sea Ice Summer Minimum.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 2020.\n\"Arctic Report Card.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Arctic Program. 2018.\n\"Arctic Sea Ice Extent.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\"Are Polar Bears Endangered?\" Polar Bears International.\nObbard, Martyn Ernest, et al. \"Estimating the abundance of the Southern Hudson Bay polar bear subpopulation with aerial surveys.\" Polar Biology. 2015.\nFollow Us\n",

In addition, approximately 300 polar bears are held in captivity. However, the world's population of polar bears is on a decline, and some scientists fear they could become extinct by 2100. To protect these majestic creatures, the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibit harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing polar bears.\nA significant portion of the polar bear population resides in Canada, where two-thirds of all polar bears live. About 16,000 polar bears are spread across 13 provinces and territories, including Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Northern Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland, and Labrador. Notably, Churchill, Manitoba, is known as the polar bear capital of the world due to its high concentration of these animals.\nIn the United States, Alaska is the only state with a polar bear population, estimated to be between 4,000 and 7,000 individuals. The polar bears in Alaska are primarily divided into two subpopulations: those in the Chukchi Sea, or Alaska-Chukotka, and the Southern Beaufort Sea.\nRussia is home to an estimated 26,000 polar bears, living on islands and the mainland coast. Wrangel Island, a UNESCO-protected nature reserve in Russia, is often referred to as a polar bear maternity ward. Additional polar bear populations in Russia are found in the Barents Sea region, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya, and the Far East Village.\nGreenland's fjords and glacial ice are also home to polar bears, though they are elusive and rarely seen. It's estimated that around 4,400 polar bears inhabit Greenland, with two protected areas, Melville Bay and Greenland National Park, supporting polar bear populations.\nThe Svalbard archipelago in Norway is another prime location for spotting polar bears, with an estimated population of around 3,000. Despite their remote habitats, polar bear encounters can sometimes be dangerous. Since the 1970s, there have been six recorded human fatalities due to polar bear attacks.\nMost polar bears in captivity are found in zoos, aquariums, and parks across Europe, North America, and Asia, contributing to conservation and education efforts about these iconic Arctic inhabitants.\n\nThe global polar bear population is estimated to be 20000-25000 individuals as of 2023, shared between all countries included in the species' range: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia, and the United States, as well as in international polar regions.\nPolar bears often roam from one country's territory into another, particularly in the winter when the polar ice reaches its broadest spread. As such, per-country population estimates are logistically challenging and can become outdated very quickly.\n\nCountry\nRegions Occupied\nCanada\nLabrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Yukon Territory\nGreenland\nGreenland\nNorway\nNorway\nRussia\nChukotka, Northern European Russia, Siberia\nUnited States\nAlaska\n\nUrsus Maritimus (Polar Bear) - IUCN Red List\n\nSources\n\u00a9 2024 World Population Review \u00a0Privacy PolicyTermsContactAbout\nCite This Page\nCite This Page",

    "document": "Graphing polar bear population estimates over\u00a0time\nI\u2019ve already commented on the 2013 update of polar bear population status released by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG).\nHowever, I thought it might be interesting to graph the changes in global population estimates over time (from 1981-2013) \u2014 not just the actual estimates from PBSG status tables (with their min/max error ranges) but those totals plus the so-called \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates that the PBSG have dropped from their accounts in recent (2005-2013) assessments: Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Queen Elizabeth Islands (now known as the \u201cArctic Basin\u201d), and Laptev Sea.\nIn 2001, those \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates contributed 5,000-5,400 bears to the global total, but now they\u2019re gone \u2014 no bears from those regions contribute to the official totals\u00a0listed on recent PBSG status tables.\nAdding those dropped estimates back into the global totals makes it possible to generate a graph in which the global estimates are truly comparable over time.\nTo see how the dropped estimates influenced the perception of population change over time, I\u2019ve also graphed the estimates given by the PBSG in their status tables. I\u2019ve combined the two into one image (Fig. 1, click to enlarge) to make comparison easy.\nUPDATE 5 December 2014: Links to more recent posts relevant to this issue added below. The most recent numbers, added 31 May 2015, are here.\nUPDATE 26 March 2019: See \u201cLatest global polar bear abundance \u2018best guess\u2019 estimate is 39,000 (26,000-58,000)\u201d\n\nFigure 1. Upper graph uses totals reported in PBSG status tables, with min/max; Lower graph uses the same figures, but adds back in the so-called \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates dropped 2005-2013. The 1960 figure * is a ballpark estimate\nWhat is apparent is that the global population of polar bears has not declined over the last 30 years, as the PBSG status tables indicate.\nAlthough it\u2019s true that the official estimates for 2005 and 2009 publicized by the PBSG (\u201c20,000-25,000\u201d) also indicated no recent change, the numbers listed on their status tables don\u2019t tell the same story. What\u2019s the point of insisting on supposedly more accurate \u201cscientific\u201d estimates if you don\u2019t use them to generate your official total?\nNote that the most recent status table released last week, for 2013, did not include a new total \u2014 if you wanted to know if the global total had changed (and if so, by how much), you had to add the figures up yourself. Nowhere on the PBSG website does it now list an official population estimate. What\u2019s that about?\n\nFinally, note that I\u2019ve included a ballpark estimate for 1960 that reflects international concern that many years of unregulated hunting had seriously depleted populations, as occurred for numerous other species (indicated as a broad range rather than a single figure). And while it is true that no one truly knows how many polar bears there were in 1960, it is also true that by that time, over-hunting had occurred on a large scale for decades, and that there were fewer bears then than there are now (see another discussion of that topic here).\nUPDATE 5 December 2014: Links to more recent posts relevant to this issue added below:\nStatus of Canadian polar bear populations has been changed \u2013 more good news October 28, 2014\nW Hudson Bay polar bear population no longer \u201cdeclining\u201d \u2013 where are the headlines? October 29, 2014\nThe Politics of Polar Bears documentary [excerpt links]  September 3, 2014\nNOTES ON METHODS\nWhere the PBSG status table for any given year (list below) gives a total range of estimates (maximum and minimum), as in 2001, I\u2019ve used the PBSG totals. Where the status tables do not give a total for the maximum, minimum and average numbers (i.e., 2005, 2009, 2013), I\u2019ve used those listed in the first column of each table (Fig. 2 below, and upper panel of Fig. 1). For example, the min/max and average estimates (rounded to nearest 10) from the status tables for 2005-2013 are:\n2005 15,130-27,760 (average 21,420)\n 2009 14,220-25,160 (average 19,610)\n 2013 13,070-24,240 (average 18,349)\nFig. 2 Graph using the figures listed in PBSG status tables only.\nWhile I acknowledge that earlier estimates (from the 80s and 90s) used different methods than later ones, which may have made them less accurate, they were the \u201cbest available science\u201d at the time. The purpose of this exercise is to compare the PBSG published numbers from these documents:\n1981 8th Meeting \u2013 Oslo, Norway (Anonymous 1985: Table 1)\n1993 11th Meeting \u2013 Copenhagen, Denmark (Wiig et al. 1995: Table 1)\n1997 12th Meeting \u2013 Oslo, Norway (Derocher et al. 1998: Table 1)\n2001 13th Meeting \u2013 Nuuk, Greenland (Lunn et al. 2002: Table 1)\n2005 14th Meeting \u2013 Seattle, Washington (Aars et al. 2006: Table 1)\n2009 15th Meeting \u2013 Copenhagen, Denmark (Obbard et al. 2010: Table 1)\n2013 Online status update, posted February 14, 2014\nAs I\u2019ve pointed out previously, adjustments made to the PBSG status tables that dropped to zero estimates that had formerly been included in the global totals suggested that by 2009, the totals must actually have increased by 2650 to 5700 bears since 2001.\nSo to make the population estimates comparable over time, we really need to add back in the ballpark estimates for the Queen Elizabeth Islands (which includes any bears residing there and in the Arctic Basin, last estimated at 200 bears), East Greenland (2,000 bears) and the Chukchi Sea (2,000 bears)1, which were dropped in the 2005 and 2009 PBSG assessments, as well as the estimate for the Laptev Sea (800-1200 bears, dropped in 2013, discussed here).\n[I did not include adjustments for Barents Sea changes in this graph (as I did previously), to keep the comparison simple and because some people might not agree that the Barents Sea adjustment qualifies as the same kind of change as the dropped estimates]\nFigure 3. Graph using figures from the PBSG status tables plus \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates dropped between 2005 & 2013.\nFootnote:\n1. Although the estimate for this region is indeed less \u201cscientifically\u201d accurate than those from regions that have been surveyed, it is very clear that large number of bears reside in the Chukchi Sea. For example, Rode and colleagues (Rode et al. 2014) used an estimate of 2,000 for the Chukchi Sea region (\u201cbased on extrapolation of den surveys\u201d) to argue that the Chukchi and the Southern Beaufort population of bears were of \u201csimilar size.\u201d PBSG biologists apparently like to have it both ways: ignore the Chukchi estimate when it doesn\u2019t suit them (for global estimates) but include it when they need it for statistical work.\nReferences\nAars, J., Lunn, N.

    "document": "The UN has made population projections for more than 50 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how accurate have they been?\nMost UN projections of global population have been close to the final estimates, several decades into the future.\nThe size of the human population is one of the most important metrics to understand the world. This is true globally, regionally, nationally, and at local levels. Total numbers are often meaningless without the context of population figures.\nThis doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just apply to population sizes today: we also want to understand what populations might look like in the future. We need it to allocate resources and budgets, and to understand health, socioeconomic, environmental, and other demographic trends.\nThat means accurate population projections are very valuable. They let us plan for the future.\nThe United Nations (UN) publishes projections in its World Population Prospects. It has been doing this periodically for more than 50 years.\nBut how much should we trust these projections?\nOne way to gauge the credibility of UN projections for the future is to look back at its track record of predictions in the past.\nIn this article, I compare the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historical projections to the latest population estimates to see how close they were.\nMost of the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historical population projections have been close to final estimates\nMany of the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historical projections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even as far back as the 1960s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been remarkably close to the truth.\nEvery few years, the UN publishes a new report on population trends, which it calls a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153revision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The report published in 2022 is called the \u00e2\u20ac\u01532022 revision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; the one from 1990 is the \u00e2\u20ac\u01531990 revision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, etc.\nIn the chart, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shown a range of these historical revisions, with their projections for the world population between 1970 and 2020. The UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest population estimates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is our closest estimate of the true population \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are also shown for comparison.\nIf you hover over the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclatest observed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data label on the chart you can see how it compares to the various projections around it.\nAs you can see, most historical projections were close to the final figure, even when projecting three to four decades in the future. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take a close look at the exact figures below.\nMost projections differed from the latest estimates by just 1% to 2%. Many were within 1%, and none differed by more than 5%.1 This is not bad, especially considering that global estimates of the world population today can vary by around 1% between sources.2\nWe can also take a closer look at how these historical projections stack up. In the table, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve provided the latest population estimates from the UN in the top row (so you can see the global population in 1980, 1990, 2000, etc.).\nBelow are the exact numbers that each UN population revision projected for these same years. So you can see that the 1968 revision projected that the world population in 1980 would be 4.46 billion. The actual number was 4.44 billion. So, pretty close. But further out the difference becomes considerable \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for the year 2000 the demographers back in the late 60s overestimated the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population size.\nYou can see that the projections across the years did vary, but most clustered within a small range and came pretty close to the final estimate.\nGlobal projections have been relatively accurate, but this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t true for every region\nWe should not assume that because global projections have been reasonably accurate, projections for individual countries or regions have been equally so. This also applies to specific age groups.\nOver- and under-estimates of particular populations canceled each other out, leading to a total figure that seemed more accurate than it was for individual groups. For example, an overestimate of the population in Asia could be partly canceled out by an underestimate in Europe.\nIn a paper published in Population Studies, the researcher Nico Keilman, studied the accuracy of UN population projections by looking at the errors of large regions, age groups, and specific estimates of fertility and mortality trends.3\nTo give one example: in Europe, UN projections would often overestimate the number of future children in a population but underestimate the number of elderly people. This was because the UN expected birth rates to be higher than they turned out, and it was at the same time too pessimistic about improvements in life expectancy (especially for women).\nAnother significant error for some regions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c affecting mostly Africa, Asia, and Latin America \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was inaccurate population estimates in the first place (in what we would call the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153base year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when the time-series starts). Many countries in these regions had poor census records and national statistics on the size and structure of the population. If the population in the start year is wrong, the projected population could be very wrong, even if you make reasonable assumptions about changes in fertility and mortality trends.\nKeilman notes that the quality of population data has improved over time, so this inaccuracy got smaller over time.\nLong-term projections are less accurate\nGlobal population projections often perform well when we compare them to reality 5, 10, or 20 years into the future. But over longer timescales, they often diverged from the real pathway.\nSee the chart below, which extends the historical projections further into the future \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to 2030. You can see that in earlier years, there was much less variation between them. But with time, they start to diverge.\nThis makes sense: to make projections about the population, researchers need to make assumptions about how fertility rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the number of children the average woman has \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and life expectancy will change. And researchers need to do this across the world, with very different starting points and socioeconomic futures. Small errors in these assumptions at the start of a trend will accumulate and turn into much larger ones.\nWe can understand the challenges in making long-term projections by looking at the most recent UN projections. In its 2019 revision, the UN projected that the world population would not peak by the end of the century: it expected numbers to reach 10.9 billion by 2100 and continue to grow slowly in the early 22nd century. Its 2022 revision however made quite a different projection: now the UN expects that the world population will peak at around 10.4 billion people in the mid-2080s.\nThis update, of course, came from an improved understanding of how fertility rates and other demographic indicators were changing across the world. But it highlights how hard it is to predict these changes for every country, 50 to 100 years into the future.\nTo summarize, short-to-medium-term projections have often been close to the true figure. But the global aggregates can hide errors on the national and regional level and we should be cautious about relying too heavily on long-term ones.\nEndnotes\nHere we look at UN reports dating back to 1968 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was not possible to find earlier versions of UN reports. However, other studies note that projections in the 1950s had much larger error margins: they were often out by more than 10%.\nKeilman, N. (2001).

    "document": "Heat Stress on the Great Barrier Reef\nMarch 4, 2024JPEG\nAustralia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef has been hit by widespread coral bleaching caused by heat stress, government officials confirmed on March 8, 2024. This is the fifth mass bleaching of the reef since 2016. \nAerial surveys of over 300 reefs conducted by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which monitors the health of the coral, found bleaching in shallow water areas spanning two-thirds of the reef. \n\u201cThe results of the aerial survey and the coral bleaching that we are seeing are consistent with the patterns of heat stress that have been building over the reef over the summer months,\u201d said Roger Beeden, chief scientist at the reef authority. \nThe Great Barrier Reef lies off the northeast coast of Queensland, Australia. It is one of the richest and most biodiverse natural ecosystems on Earth. Spread across 346,000 square kilometers (134,000 square miles) of the Coral Sea, it comprises 2,500 individual reefs and more than 900 islands. \nBleaching events are caused by sustained, warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae known as zooxanthellae, which provide the coral polyps with nutrients as well as their bright colors. Heat stress causes the corals to expel the zooxanthellae, leaving the skeletal structures with a \u201cbleached\u201d appearance. \nA common metric used to assess the risk to coral reefs from high water temperature is the number of weeks that sea surface temperatures have exceeded the mean monthly maximum temperature by 1 degree Celsius. Significant coral bleaching may occur after 4 weeks of elevated temperatures, and severe, widespread coral bleaching is likely after 8 such weeks. As of early March, parts of the reef had been exposed to between 8 and 10 hotter-than-normal weeks, according to the reef authority. \nThe map above shows sea surface temperature anomalies off the coast of eastern Australia on March 4, 2024. It is based on data from the MUR SST (Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) project, an effort by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) that blends measurements of sea surface temperatures from multiple NASA, NOAA, and international satellites, as well as ship and buoy observations. Rather than showing absolute temperature, the anomaly reflects the difference between the sea surface temperature on March 4, 2024, and the 2003-2014 average for that day. \nPrevious mass bleaching events on the reef occurred in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022. According to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, \u201cPrior to these years, there is no evidence of such widespread events in the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s 500-year coral record history.\u201d \nDuring the latter half of 2023 and beginning of 2024, trade winds in the Pacific Ocean relaxed, allowing warm water from the western Pacific to push into the eastern Pacific\u2014a phenomenon known as El Ni\u00f1o. This pattern, on top of human-caused climate change, has driven global average sea surface temperatures to record highs for the past 10 months. However, the relationship between El Ni\u00f1o and sea surface temperatures off the coast of eastern Australia is a bit more complicated. \n\u201cSea surface temperatures during El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events act a bit like a seesaw,\u201d said Josh Willis, a climate scientist at JPL. \u201cWhen ocean temperatures during an El Ni\u00f1o are higher in the eastern Pacific, they\u2019re typically lower in the western Pacific.\u201d \nResearch has found that patterns in large-scale ocean circulation and climate change alone do not fully explain trends in sea surface temperatures and bleaching in the Coral Sea. Rather, weather patterns during El Ni\u00f1o events have historically suppressed the Australian summer monsoon, resulting in reduced cloud cover and higher-than-average air temperatures. These conditions play a big role in determining temperatures in the Coral Sea and the extent and location of coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef. \nNASA Earth Observatory image by Michala Garrison, using data from the MUR SST (Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) project and reef information from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA).

Coral cover remains high while impacts of mass coral bleaching yet to be determined ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF CORAL REEF CONDITION 2023\u20132024 Published 7 August 2024 In Short \u2022 This report summarises the condition of coral reefs in the Northern, Central and Southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 94 reefs conducted between August 2023 and June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). \u2022 Over the past 38 years of monitoring by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), hard coral cover on reefs of the GBR has decreased and increased in response to cycles of disturbance and recovery. \u2022 Percent hard coral cover is one standard measure of reef condition recorded by scientists worldwide, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health and is used in this report. Other important data, such as diversity or composition of coral assemblages, are collected and reported by LTMP in other ways. \u2022 Changes in coral cover are qualified with respect to the margin of error, defined by 95% credible intervals (CIs). Credible intervals describe the level of uncertainty in the estimates of hard coral cover. \u2022 Above-average water temperatures (i.e. sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1\u20132.5\u00b0C) occurred on the GBR over the austral summer, peaking in March 2024 and resulting in the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016. \u2022 The mass coral bleaching on the GBR was part of a global event declared by NOAA and ICRI in April 2024. \u2022 The Central GBR was impacted by two tropical cyclones: Cyclone Jasper (Category 5 \u2013 December 2023) and Cyclone Kirrily (Category 3 \u2013 January 2024). Although Cyclone Jasper was a Category 5 in the Coral Sea, it was only Category 2 when traversing the GBR. \u2022 Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks have persisted on four Southern GBR reefs, while four reefs of the Northern GBR have low numbers of starfish. \u2022 In 2024, hard coral cover has increased across the GBR, but regional hard coral cover remains similar to that reported in 2022 and 2023. Importantly, most surveys were conducted prior to the mass coral bleaching event and passage of two cyclones, and the full impact of these events is yet to be determined. Its also important to note that bleached coral is still recorded as live coral during surveys, and the fate of these corals is not yet known. \u2022 Of the 94 reefs surveyed, only two reefs had hard coral cover <10%, 36 reefs had hard coral cover between 10% and 30%, and 35 reefs had coral cover between 30% and 50%. The remaining 21 reefs had hard coral cover between 50% and 75%. \u2022 On the Northern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs), a regional high, but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (35.8% average; 32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs). All surveys were completed prior to the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024. \u2022 On the Central GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), a regional high but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (30.7% average; 27.5% \u2013 34.0% CIs). Twenty-three of 39 reefs were surveyed before the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024, while 17 reefs were surveyed before cyclone impacts. \u2022 On the Southern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.1% (33.7% to 44.5% CIs) from 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) in 2023. Fourteen of 30 reefs were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. \u2022 The high coral cover reported this year is good news but does not mean all is fine on the GBR as it continues to face cumulative stressors. 2024 saw the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016 with the largest spatial footprint of coral bleaching yet recorded, coupled with the impact of two tropical cyclones. The impacts on coral cover from these events are partially captured in this year's report. A full assessment of changes in coral cover following these disturbances will be recorded during the next survey season. \u2022 It is important to note that recent increases in hard coral cover can be quickly undone, as many corals are susceptible to elevated heat stress, wave damage and crown-of-thorns starfish predation, all of which impacted the GBR this year. \u2022 The results presented here are our best understanding of reef condition before the impact of summer\u2019s disturbances.

Photo credit: AIMS LTMP Background: Sampling Methods and Analysis With reef surveys extending over 38 years, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring Program provides a unique and invaluable record of change in reef status by repeatedly and consistently surveying coral reef communities on representative reefs across the entire span of the Great Barrier Reef. This annual summary of the status and trends in hard coral cover is derived from manta tow surveys of coral reefs (Figure 1). These surveys are a broadscale technique that covers reef slopes of whole reef perimeters in a short amount of time. More detailed surveys of fish and coral assemblages are also conducted along permanently marked transects on 71 reefs; however, the data from these are still being analysed and undergoing quality assurance and quality checking. They will become available on the online dashboard once completed. Our Monitoring Dashboard presents a synthesis of all AIMS\u2019 coral reef monitoring data across each of the surveyed reefs and at various spatial aggregations (including Natural Resource Management regions and latitudinal sectors). For this annual summary, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Northern, Central and Southern GBR; Figure 1) that show different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time. These changes are mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances: severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. Since 2016, GBR-wide summaries are no longer displayed, as this spatial resolution oversimplifies the variability of coral cover dynamics. Presentation of patterns for the three regions separately offers an easily interpretable overview without oversimplification or getting lost in the complexity inherent at finer spatial scales (i.e. individual reefs). A total of 94 reefs were surveyed from August 2023 to June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). Online reports on the status and trends of individual reefs and reefs grouped by latitudinal sectors, including their disturbance history, are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip and quality checking of the data. Data summaries are available for download. The reefs of the GBR are dynamic, and there is considerable variation among regions in the decline and recovery cycles of hard coral cover and community composition in response to disturbances. Understanding these dynamics in the context of the disturbance regimes is critical for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). The number of reefs able to be surveyed each year is a small portion of the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs were selected to provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures multiple geographical and ecological gradients (e.g. latitude and position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continuous improvement in the analysis of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches for the type of ecological time series data used in this report. Temporal trends in hard coral cover presented in this report are analysed using Bayesian hierarchical models, and more detail of these analytical methods is presented here. Northern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cape York to Cooktown) Surveyed November 2023 to February 2024 Image 1: Photos showing the variable state of reefs in the Northern GBR in 2024. A. Low numbers of Crown-of-thorns starfish below outbreak levels were recorded on a number of reefs. B. McSweeney Reef is still in the early stages of recovery from recent disturbances. C & D. Minor bleaching was recorded on several reefs throughout the Northern GBR, such as Swinger Reef and North Direction Island. E. Outer shelf reefs such as Davie Reef have diverse fish and corals. F. Flourishing coral assemblages at Middle Banks. Note that all surveys were conducted before the peak summer heat in March 2024. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. There was substantial variation in the condition of the 25 individual reefs surveyed in the Northern GBR (Figure 1a, Image 1). Nine of 25 reefs had coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 12 reefs had >30% \u2013 50% cover and four reefs had >50% \u2013 75% cover (Figure 1a). A total of 24 of the 25 Northern GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Of these, six had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b). However, only two were outside the margin of error, and these declines were most likely due to crown-of-thorns starfish predation and coral disease. Region-wide hard coral cover was relatively stable from 1985 to 2010, then declined to the lowest recorded levels in 2017 following cumulative impacts from crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, severe tropical cyclones (STCs Ita and Nathan), and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. There was a period of strong recovery from 2017 to 2022. Hard coral cover has increased further since 2023, from 35.8% (32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs) to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs) in 2024, the highest level since surveys began, but it remains within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 2). Surveys in 2024 found low crown-of-thorns starfish numbers at some reefs in the region (Image 1A), but all reefs were classified as either No COTS or No Outbreak (Figure 1c). Additionally, COTS feeding scars were observed on 14 reefs, indicating the presence of low numbers of starfish. Northern GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP experienced accumulated heat stress between 3.64 and 8.73 DHWs1 during peak heat accumulation in March 2024. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted from November 2023 to February 2024 before the height of summer; however, low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) (Figure 1d, Image 1C,D). No bleaching was observed on the remaining seven reefs (Figure 1d). We discuss the severity and spatial extent of the 2024 mass coral bleaching event in more detail below. Figure 2: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 25 reefs were surveyed in 2024. Note that many reefs in this region were surveyed before the peak heat stress occurred in March 2024. 1 DHWs (degree heating weeks) expresses the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHWs and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHWs. Further information available from NOAA.

More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2024. Of the 39 reefs surveyed, two reefs had <10% hard coral cover; 18 had hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 14 reefs had hard coral cover >30% \u2013 50%, and five had hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a, Image 2). A total of 30 of the 39 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Thirteen of these reefs had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b), but only two had declines outside the margin of error. Hard coral cover was higher on 17 reefs (Figure 1b), with estimates outside the margin of error on 11 reefs. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly until 2016. From 2016, region-wide hard coral cover decreased continuously to 2019, largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown\u2010of\u2010 thorns starfish. From 2017 to 2022, hard coral cover recovered, but then declined in 2023. In 2024 it increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), the highest level since surveys began, but it remained within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 3). There were no Potential, Established or Severe Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2024 (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, small numbers of COTS feeding scars were observed on 11 reefs, indicating the presence of low levels of COTS on these reefs. Cyclone Jasper crossed the Central GBR between Cooktown and Port Douglas in December 2023. No reefs in the cyclone path were surveyed after the cyclone and impacts from this event will be gauged next season. Shortly after the storm, tourism operators noted a large flood plume causing freshwater bleaching and coral mortality at inshore reefs, especially Low Isles, which will be next surveyed in 2025. Cyclone Kirrily transited the Central GBR in late January and resulted in variable impacts on the 22 reefs that were surveyed after the passage of the storm. Some reefs, such as Kelso, John Brewer, Helix and Chicken, had evidence of storm damage and declines in hard coral cover ranging from 6% to 9.9% since last being surveyed. Other reefs appear to have escaped with little impact. Central GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP were exposed to accumulated heat stress of between 3.37 and 9.31 DHWs over the summer. This resulted in low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching (Image 2C,D) on 16 of the 39 survey reefs in the Central GBR during the 2024 LTMP surveys (Figure 1d). The remaining 23 reefs had no bleaching recorded (Figure 1d, Image 2E,F); however, these reefs were all surveyed in August and September 2023, months before the heat stress occurred. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 39 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 23 of these were completed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024, and the impacts of the bleaching remains to be determined. Southern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Proserpine to Gladstone) Surveyed September 2023 to May 2024 The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 38-year survey history. Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009 reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 4). A rapid and substantial increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2017, reaching 36.7% (30.1% \u2013 44.3% CIs). However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018, and regional coral cover decreased to 29.0% (22.8% \u2013 36.2% CIs) in 2019. In 2021, coral cover had increased to 37.8% (31.6% \u2013 44.4% CIs), but it declined again to 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) by 2023 (Figure 4). In 2024, coral cover had increased to 39.1% (33.7% \u2013 44.5% CIs), but it remains within the margin of error of the past three years. The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) with nine reefs having hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, nine reefs with hard coral cover >30% \u201350% and 12 reefs with hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a). Of the 30 reefs surveyed in 2024, 25 reefs had been surveyed in the past two years. Hard coral cover was lower than previous surveys on five of these, with estimates outside the margin of error on one reef (Figure 1b). Twenty reefs had higher hard coral cover than previously surveyed, of which nine had estimates outside the margin of error (Figure 1b). The Southern GBR has been the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in recent years and remained so in 2024 with the focus in the Swain reefs. One of the 30 reefs was classified as having a Severe Outbreak, one reef had an Established Outbreak and one reef had a Possible Outbreak (Figure 1c; Image 3A). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on four reefs classified as No Outbreak and the remainder had No COTS, while COTS outbreaks have run their course on other reefs with low coral cover (Image 3B). In 2024, Southern GBR reefs surveyed by LTMP were exposed to the highest levels of accumulated heat stress (6.22\u201311.64 DHWs) ever recorded in this region. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted at 11 reefs during the height of thermal stress in March. Very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90% of colonies) was recorded at four of these reefs, while three had high (>30% \u2013 60%) bleaching and the remaining four reefs had medium (>10% \u2013 30% bleaching (Figure 1d; Image 3C,D)). Five reefs were surveyed in May after peak heat had occurred and all had bleaching between 1% and 30% of corals. The remaining reefs in this region were all surveyed in September and October 2023, well before the onset of heat stress, with little bleaching recorded (Image 3E,F). Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 30 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 14 of these were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. Image 3: Various disturbance events have impacted the Southern GBR in 2024, including coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. A. A severe outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish was still active at Tern Island in the Pompeys. B. Elsewhere in the Southern GBR, crown-of-thorns starfish infestations have run their course and reduced coral cover to very low levels, particularly in the Swains, such as Gannet Cay. Coral bleaching was recorded in the Southern GBR including C. Pompey Reef No. 1 and D. Reef 21-060. High coral cover is still found at many reefs in the Southern GBR, like E. Masthead Island and F. Fairfax Island in the Capricorn-Bunkers. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. Why Hard Coral Cover? What does \u2018percent hard coral cover\u2019 mean? There are many ways to measure the status of coral reefs. One of the most common is to use percent hard coral cover as an indicator of reef condition because it describes the abundance of a critical ecosystem engineer on coral reefs. This measure describes the proportion of the seafloor that is covered in live hard coral. Percent hard coral cover is widely used by scientists worldwide and is a standard measure that applies to all locations. While it does not tell us anything about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health. Percent hard coral cover can be estimated using various techniques. The technique used for this report is manta tow surveys, which are visual estimates of percent hard coral cover over the area covered by an observer during one 2-minute tow (~2000 m2). The percent hard coral cover for a reef is then estimated as the average of the estimates from all tows around a reef and reported as broad categories (e.g. 0%, >0% \u2013 10%, >10% \u2013 30%, >30% \u2013 50%, >50% \u2013 75% and >75% \u2013 100%; Image 4). A coral reef consists of more than just hard coral and contains a diverse array of other corals, sponges, algae, sand, rock and invertebrates. It is relatively rare for GBR reefs to have 75% \u2013 100% hard coral cover, and AIMS defines >30% \u2013 50% hard coral cover as a high value, based on historical surveys across the GBR. Other techniques for determining percent hard coral cover involve counting the number of points within sampling units (quadrats and photos), as used by the LTMP during fixed-site surveys, or the linear distance along a tape measure (line-intercept) that intersect live hard coral colonies. Adding up the total number of points of live hard coral cover and then expressing this as a percent of the total number of points within a sample yields the estimates of hard coral cover. Data from both the fixed-site and manta tow surveys conducted by the LTMP are highly correlated and show the same trends in hard coral cover estimates. However, manta tow estimates are commonly lower than those obtained from fixed site surveys as they encompass the entire reef, including sandy back reef habitats that generally have low coral cover. Image 4: Examples of categories of percent hard coral cover a) >0% \u2013 10%, b) >10% \u2013 30%, c) >30% \u2013 50% and d) >50% \u2013 75%. The yellow areas show non-hard coral reef surfaces, and the categorisation is based on the proportion of the substrate covered in live hard coral colonies. The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event In the austral summer of 2023\u20132024, much of the GBR was subjected to a level of accumulated heat stress that caused mass coral bleaching to occur (Figure 5). This was the fifth mass bleaching event on the GBR since 2016 and part of the fourth global mass bleaching event. In response to this event, AIMS and the Reef Authority undertook aerial surveys of 1080 reefs (Image 5) across the GBR and Torres Strait during the peak summer heat in March 2024. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, AIMS also conducted dedicated in-water bleaching surveys on 36 reefs during this time (22 February to 20 March 2024) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys were conducted from Lizard Island in the Northern GBR to Lady Musgrave Island in the Southern GBR at three depths \u2013 Shallow (2\u20135m), Mid (7\u20139m) and Deep (9\u201312m) \u2013 and consisted of assessments of the prevalence of coral bleaching (i.e. the number of colonies affected). The level of bleaching of an individual coral colony was recorded as 1. No bleaching 2. Partial bleaching (5%\u201350% of colony white) 3. Fully bleached (>50% of colony white) 4. Dead (colony recently dead and overgrown with light green algae). Data were then summarised as the percent of colonies in each category at each depth at each site. The 2024 bleaching event had the highest levels of exposure to heat stress to date, with some reefs in the Southern GBR experiencing up to 15 DHWs (Figure 5), far surpassing the level of heat accumulation they had been subjected to in previous events. 2024 also saw a record-breaking spatial footprint of coral bleaching, with 49% of reefs having high levels (>30% of corals bleached) and 32% of reefs having very high to extreme levels of coral bleaching (>60% of corals bleached; Image 6). In-water surveys conducted at the height of the event also confirmed that severe bleaching (whole colonies fully bleached white) was prevalent at 94% of reefs, and recent mortality due to intense thermal stress was present at 89% of reefs across all three regions of the GBR. The severity and prevalence of bleaching was variable among reefs, but some clear regional patterns emerged. The Northern GBR aerial survey reefs were exposed to maximum heat accumulation between 1.84 and 9.7 DHWs over the summer (Figure 5). There was variation in the levels of heat stress accumulation across the Northern GBR. Aerial surveys revealed reefs north of Lockhart River were least affected, while the inner- and mid-shelf reefs between Lizard Island and Cape Sidmouth suffered very high and extreme levels of bleaching after being subjected to accumulated heat stress between 4.9 and 9.7 DHWs. Figure 5: Accumulated heat stress (points on map) and the level of bleaching (bar charts) recorded during aerial surveys of GBR reefs surveyed in March 2024. DHW categories: Bleaching low risk = 0\u20132 DHWs, Bleaching warning = 2\u20134 DHWs, Bleaching possible = 4\u20136 DHWs, Bleaching probable = 6\u20138 DHWs and widespread bleaching with possible mortality= >8 DHWs. Source: NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Coral Reef Watch program. Coral bleaching prevalence categories: 0 = no bleaching, 1 = low bleaching (<10% of corals), 2 = medium bleaching (>10% \u2013 30%), 3 = high bleaching (>30% \u2013 60%), 4 = very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90%), 5 = extreme bleaching (>90%). Note that these are the same categories used by LTMP manta tow surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event Levels of bleaching recorded from aerial surveys showed bleaching intensity decreased further north and at offshore reefs in the region. Throughout the Northern GBR, 27.6% of reefs had no bleaching recorded, 33% had low bleaching and 39.4% had high to extreme bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys (additional to LTMP) within Princess Charlotte Bay and around Lizard Island revealed partial to fully bleached colonies with low levels of early onset mortality at the time of survey (late February and early March 2024). In-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP were conducted just prior to the maximum period of heat stress (mid-March) and are likely to underrepresent the true extent of bleaching at the peak of the event (Figure 6). Furthermore, LTMP surveys in the Northern GBR, including around Lizard Island, were all conducted prior to March 2024, and coral cover for this region had not yet changed in response to this bleaching event. Nevertheless, early-onset low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 LTMP reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) prior to the onset of elevated heat stress. The Central GBR experienced elevated thermal stress throughout the summer, with aerial survey reefs ranging from 2.4 to 11.4 DHWs (Figure 5). Heat stress accumulation was highest around Cairns (5.1\u20139.5 DHWs), inshore reefs in the Palm Island Group around Townsville (5.2\u20139.5 DHWs) and the inner (5.8\u2013 8.95 DHWs) and outer shelf (5.2\u201311.4 DHWs) reefs of the Whitsundays (Figure 5). Levels of bleaching observed from the aerial surveys closely matched the accumulated heat stress levels. Across the Central GBR, 8.1% of aerial survey reefs were categorised as having no or low bleaching (1% \u2013 10% of corals), 15.8% as having medium bleaching (11% \u2013 30% of corals) and 76.1% having high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals; Figure 5). Around Cairns, 5% of aerial survey reefs had low bleaching, 40% had medium bleaching and 55% had high, very high or extreme bleaching. Townsville inshore aerial surveys recorded 22% of reefs with low bleaching, 18% with medium bleaching and 60% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. Aerial surveys recorded 19% of Whitsunday reefs with low bleaching, 22% with medium bleaching and 59% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, dedicated in-water bleaching surveys in the Central GBR recorded variable levels of bleaching prevalence and low levels of early onset coral mortality (Figure 6). In the Central GBR, 23 of 39 LTMP survey reefs were surveyed too early to detect the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event, but 16 reefs were surveyed between March and May 2024. These reefs all had low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching during the 2024 LTMP surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event The Southern GBR experienced the most intense exposure of the three regions, with the highest levels of accumulated heat stress on record for the GBR, high prevalence of fully bleached corals and the highest levels of early onset mortality recorded during in-water bleaching surveys (Figures 5, 6). While there was variation in the amount of heat stress recorded among aerial survey reefs (Figure 5), the highest levels of heat stress were recorded in southern inshore reefs around the Keppel Island group (11.4\u201313.3 DHWs), and further south near Gladstone (15.3\u201315.6 DHWs \u2013 cf LTMP survey reefs). Offshore reefs of the Capricorn-Bunker (10.9\u201311.7 DHWs) and Swain sectors (7.3\u20139.9 DHWs) all had heat stress accumulation to the level where widespread bleaching and coral mortality are expected (Figure 5). Aerial surveys also revealed that all reefs around the Keppel Island group and the Capricorn-Bunkers had high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals), and while the Swain reefs were more variable, 91% of reefs had high, very high or extreme bleaching levels in shallow reef habitats. In the Southern GBR, in-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP surveys revealed a much higher proportion of fully bleached corals than either the Northern or Central GBR, and higher levels of early onset mortality at the time of in-water bleaching surveys across all three depths (Figure 6). Of the 11 reefs surveyed by the LTMP during the height of the heat stress in March 2024, 7 had high to very high bleaching (>30% \u2013 90%) and a further 4 had medium bleaching of >10% \u2013 30%. All other Southern GBR LTMP reefs were surveyed either before the onset of heat stress or in May 2024, after the heatwave had abated; these surveys recorded bleaching of between 1% and 30%. The results from both the aerial and in-water surveys have documented the greatest spatial extent of accumulated heat stress and high to extreme bleaching to impact the GBR in recorded history. High to extreme bleaching was observed across all regions of the GBR, with the highest impacts in the inshore and mid-shelf reefs in the Southern, Central and Northern GBR. Prevalence of fully bleached corals in the Southern GBR was close to 100% in some shallow-water habitats, and early-onset mortality ranged from 1% to 75%. Reefs with a higher prevalence of partially bleached and fully bleached corals are more likely to suffer adverse health impacts from this bleaching event. Bleaching-related impacts can be direct effects (partial or whole colony mortality) that reduce coral cover or indirect, chronic effects such as reduced growth and reproduction and increased susceptibility to coral disease. These results only partly tell the story. The full effects of the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event will continue to unfold over the coming months, as fully bleached corals can remain that way for several months, as late as September or October, depending on the species. Further in-water surveys at permanent locations are required to capture changes in hard coral cover following the bleaching, and these surveys will begin in September 2024 when the LTMP scientists return to the reef.

Assessing the Long-term Health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust, long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the \u2018shifting baseline\u2019 syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The past few years have revealed increases in hard coral cover across much of the GBR. In 2022, we reported the highest-recorded coral cover in the Northern and Central GBR since the LTMP began monitoring in the 1980s, after rising from the lowest-recorded cover in the preceding decade. There was little change in hard coral cover in 2023, but this year coral cover has again increased. However, 60 out of 94 reefs were surveyed before the two cyclones and the mass coral bleaching event and impacts of these events will become apparent once surveys are completed next year. The 2024 mass coral bleaching event was the most extensive in terms of accumulated heat stress and the large spatial footprint of high to extreme bleaching. Some parts of the GBR saw unprecedented levels of heat accumulation. The increased frequency and extent of bleaching events since 2016 remains highly concerning. Crown-of-thorns starfish are coral predators, and their outbreaks represent a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\u2019s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak. The program deploys targeted surveillance and culling operations to systematically suppress starfish numbers and protect coral across hundreds of priority reefs. Recent evidence from the COTS Control Program and the LTMP demonstrates that targeted control has effectively suppressed outbreaks and protected coral from COTS predation across entire reefs and sectors. The findings also suggest that the southward progression of the outbreak \u2018wave\u2019 through the GBR may have been delayed and reduced via the suppression of adult COTS. In 2024, the number of Severe Outbreaks has continued to decrease from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. LTMP surveys revealed low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish in the far northern GBR and around Lizard Island, which suggests that starfish numbers are increasing in these areas. Much of the recent hard coral cover increase was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase that rapidly increases percent hard coral cover, as documented in the 2022 and 2024 results. However, fast-growing corals are particularly susceptible to waves generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to heat stress and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. Therefore, large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be overturned by disturbances on reefs where Acropora corals predominate. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves. The consequences of climate change are evidenced by multiple mass coral bleaching events since 2016 in the three GBR regions. Such bleaching events were rare prior to the late 1990s but have become a biennial occurrence in the last decade. Simultaneously, the continuing risk of tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry, can all negatively affect recovery rates. Additionally, more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Enabling coral reefs to survive these stressful conditions requires a combination of a reduction in global greenhouse emissions to stabilise temperatures, best practice management of local pressures, and the development of interventions to help reefs adapt to and recover from the effects of climate change. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS\u2019 research and monitoring.

This is a sharp increase from the previous assessment, published in 2008, which found a third of corals were in danger of being lost.\nClimate change is the leading cause of the declines, with high temperatures causing corals to eject the photosynthetic algae that live in their tissues. These events, known as bleaching, are becoming more extreme and more frequent, and causing mass die-offs in reefs across the world.\nThe IUCN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Director General, Dr Grethel Aguilar, has called for strong action to limit greenhouse gas emissions as the best option to protect these vital species.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis global coral assessment vividly illustrates the severe impacts of our rapidly changing climate on life on Earth and drives home the severity of the consequences,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealthy ecosystems like coral reefs are essential for human livelihoods \u00e2\u0080\u0093 providing food, stabilising coastlines, and storing carbon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe protection of our biodiversity is not only vital for our wellbeing but crucial for our survival. Climate change remains the leading threat to reef-building corals and is devastating the natural systems we depend on. We must take bold, decisive action to cut greenhouse gas emissions if we are to secure a sustainable future for humanity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nCorals get their colour from the photosynthetic algae that live inside them, as part of a relationship which has lasted for over 380 million years. \u00c2\u00a9 Alexandre.ROSA/ Shutterstock\nHow endangered are corals, and why are they important?\nThe results of the latest Red List are the latest reminder of the dangers that reef-building corals face, with the animals having become more threatened with every reassessment of their health.\nWhile Red List assessments have changed over the past 30 years, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimated that just 13 coral species were considered Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered in the 1990s. By the time of the next assessment in 2008, this figure had risen to 231.\nIt has now risen again, by more than 100, meaning almost half of all corals are at significant risk of extinction. This makes corals proportionately more endangered than all the major animal groups on land, including amphibians, mammals and reptiles.\nIf these coral species do become extinct, their loss would cause major changes for life in the oceans. Coral reefs support around a quarter of all marine life, and so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely that coral extinctions could cause losses among fish, crustaceans and many other groups.\nThe loss of coral reefs would also remove an important nursery habitat for fish, as the hard skeletons provide a safe area for small fish to grow up in, away from large predators. Fewer nursery habitats would likely mean fewer fish, impacting both predator populations and fisheries.\nThe economic impact of coral extinctions goes much further than fishing, with reefs estimated to prevent billions of pounds worth of damage from flooding and erosion every year by breaking up waves. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also likely tourism would suffer, cutting off a vital source of income for many communities.\nThe most at-risk reefs are in the Atlantic, where half of all species are at risk of extinction and a quarter are Critically Endangered. In a separate paper, published in PLOS One, researchers have examined the threats facing these corals in particular.\nThe staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis is found in the Atlantic, and is considered Critically Endangered under the most recent Red List. \u00c2\u00a9\u00c2\u00a0Alberto Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez-Ram\u00c3\u00adrez\nWhy are Atlantic corals so threatened?\nWhile the vast majority of reefs are found in the Indian and Pacific Ocean, around 10% are found in the Atlantic. These corals are very distinct from their relatives, having been separated from other corals by the joining of North and South America over three million years ago.\nIn total, 85 shallow-water coral species live in the Atlantic, with the most important hotspots found in the Caribbean and off the coast of Brazil.\u00c2\u00a0As study co-author Dr Nadia Santodomingo explains, the limited ability of these species to respond to the threats facing them means these reefs are more vulnerable to collapse.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAtlantic corals have been hit the hardest by reef decline,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Nadia, a Curator of Fossil Cnidaria at the Natural History Museum. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re facing a perfect storm of threats, of which climate change is just one part.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese corals are being significantly impacted by overfishing, pollution and coral diseases which are more prevalent in the Atlantic than in other regions. As a result, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprised to see the results of the IUCN assessment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDisease has perhaps had the most dramatic impact on Atlantic corals, devastating not only the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corals but also the animals they depend on. An unknown illness is suspected to have killed as much as 98% of the Caribbean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-spined sea urchins in the 1980s, meaning these grazers couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent algae from dominating many reefs.\nNew diseases are continuing to emerge, with stony coral tissue loss disease first detected in 2014. The illness has spread rapidly throughout the Caribbean, killing as many as 94% of all infected corals.\nRising temperatures are also an increasing threat, with bleaching just the tip of the iceberg. Higher levels of carbon dioxide are making the ocean more acidic, making it harder for corals to grow their calcium carbonate skeletons. Climate change has also been linked with rising numbers of hurricanes in the region, which are washing away centuries-old reefs in a matter of hours.\nWhile the PLOS One study raises plenty of cause for concern, it also notes some reasons to be hopeful. After the devastating declines of the 1970s and 1980s, the researchers found that the fall in Atlantic coral cover appears to be getting smaller.\nTo support these green shoots of recovery, further research needs to be taken to understand how corals can adapt to the challenges that face them. As Dr Beth Polidoro, a co-lead author of the paper, explains, this must go hand in hand with urgent action to combat climate change and the other threats facing coral.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions alongside action to address local threats if we want to give coral reefs a chance to survive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Beth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy acting now, we can slow the pace of ocean warming and broaden the window of opportunity for corals to potentially adapt and survive in the long term.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRead more\nDiscover oceans\nFind out more about why we need to protect oceans and read about the pioneering work of our marine scientists.\nRelated posts\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCoral reefs cover more of Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface than realised, new estimates reveal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSatellite images have revealed a missing 64,000 square kilometres of coral cover, an area similar to the size of Ireland.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOver half of coral reef cover across the world has been lost since 1950\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCoral reefs have declined by over half since the 1950s as they suffer from the effects of climate change and overfishing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe resilient coral reefs surviving ocean warming\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOcean warming is threatening coral reefs but some reefs are surviving the warming waters and offer hope for these vital ecosystems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHighlighting coral reefs at risk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhat can antique corals reveal about the impact of climate change on the ocean?\nDon't miss a thing\nReceive email updates about our news, science, exhibitions, events, products, services and fundraising activities.

March temperatures were above average across much of the contiguous U.S., while below-average temperatures were observed in small pockets of the West and Southwest.\nThe Alaska statewide March temperature was 14.1\u00b0F, 3.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the 100-year period of record for the state. Above-average temperatures were observed across much of the state with near-normal temperatures in parts of the North Slope, Interior, Southwest and parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\n\n\nFor January\u2013March, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 39.4\u00b0F, 4.2\u00b0F above average, ranking fifth warmest on record for this period. Temperatures were above average across most of the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast. Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine each ranked second warmest for the January\u2013March period.\nThe Alaska January\u2013March temperature was 9.4\u00b0F, 3.5\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Much of the state was above normal for the three-month period while temperatures were near average across the eastern portions of the state and in parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\nPrecipitation\n\n\nMarch precipitation for the contiguous U.S. was 2.85 inches, 0.34 inch above average, ranking in the wettest third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average across much of the West, in the Great Lakes and along the Gulf and East coasts and in parts of the northern Plains. Conversely, precipitation was below normal across much of the Ohio Valley, the Plains, and in parts of the Northwest and Florida. Maine and Rhode Island each had their second-wettest March on record.\nAlaska\u2019s average monthly precipitation ranked in the middle third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior, south-central Alaska and in parts of the Panhandle during the month.\n\n\nThe January\u2013March precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 8.15 inches, 1.19 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across much of the contiguous U.S., with Rhode Island having its second-wettest year-to-date period on record. Conversely, precipitation was below average across much of the northern Plains and in small parts of the Northwest, central and southern Plains, Ohio Valley and Southeast during the January\u2013March period.\nThe January\u2013March precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record, with above-average precipitation observed in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior and south-central Alaska, as well as southern portions of the Panhandle during this period.\nBillion-Dollar Disasters\nOne new billion-dollar weather and climate disaster was confirmed in March 2024 after a severe weather event impacted the central and southern U.S. during mid-March, with the most severe weather occurring on March 13\u201315.\u00a0The U.S. has sustained 378 separate weather and climate disasters since 1980 where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (including CPI adjustment to 2024). The total cost of these 378 events exceeds $2.675 trillion.\nOther Notable Events\nFive wildfires, including the Smokehouse Creek wildfire, were finally contained in the Texas Panhandle, the largest cattle-producing region in the world. The wildfires resulted in approximately 1.1 million acres scorched, hundreds of destroyed structures, hundreds of miles of ruined fencing and more than 7,000 dead cattle.Winter did not bring heavy snowfall to Wisconsin nor the temperatures necessary to maintain the snow, allowing fires to begin early and in high numbers. Between January\u2013March 2024, there have been more than 220 fires across Wisconsin.A 5.25-inch diameter hail stone fell in Ada, Oklahoma on March 14, which is the largest stone reported in Pontotoc County since 1950, as well as the largest to fall in the state in nearly 13 years.\nA state of emergency was declared for Ohio as several tornadoes struck the state, resulting in 3 fatalities on March 14 when an EF-3 tornado crossed Auglaize and Logan Counties.\nDrought\nAccording to the April 2 U.S. Drought Monitor report, about 18% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought, down about 3.6% from the end of February. Drought conditions expanded or intensified in portions of the Plains and in parts of the Northwest, central Mississippi Valley, northern Great Lakes and Hawaii this month. Drought contracted or was reduced in intensity across much of the Mississippi Valley, Puerto Rico and the West, and in parts of the Plains, Great Lakes and Carolinas.\nMonthly Outlook\nAbove-average temperatures are favored to impact much of the central U.S., Northwest and Northeast in April while above-average precipitation is likely from much of the Plains to parts of the East Coast and in much of the Southwest. Drought is likely to persist along portions of the Northern Tier, the Southwest, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Visit the Climate Prediction Center\u2019s Official 30-Day Forecasts and U.S. Monthly Drought Outlook website for more details.\nSignificant wildland fire potential for April is above normal across much of the Upper Midwest and in parts of the central and southern Plains. For additional information on wildland fire potential, visit the National Interagency Fire Center\u2019s One-Month Wildland Fire Outlook.\nThis monthly summary from NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making.

Each participant\u2019s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u2014including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u2014and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u201cAppropriate monetary policy\u201d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u2019s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 11\u201312, 2024.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n3.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants\u2019 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nThe confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\u2019 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.\n* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.\nTable 2.

As described in the box \"Forecast Uncertainty,\" under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.\n1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. Return to table\n2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. Return to table\n3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. Return to table\nForecast Uncertainty\nThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur.\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second and third years, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \u201cfan charts\u201d that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants\u2019 projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants' current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.\nBack to Top\nLast Update: September 18, 2024\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nAbout the Fed\nNews & Events\nMonetary Policy\nSupervision & Regulation\nFinancial Stability\nPayment Systems\nEconomic Research\nData\nConsumers & Communities\nConnect with the Board\n\nTools and Information\n\nContact\nPublications\nFreedom of Information (FOIA)\nOffice of Inspector General\nBudget & Performance | Audit\nNo FEAR Act\nEspa\u00f1ol\nWebsite Policies | Privacy Program\nAccessibility\n\nStay Connected\nFederal Reserve Facebook Page Federal Reserve Instagram Page Federal Reserve YouTube Page Federal Reserve Flickr Page Federal Reserve LinkedIn Page Federal Reserve Threads Page Link to Federal Reserve Twitter Page Subscribe to RSS Subscribe to Email\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551",

    "document": "L.A. County faces $12.5 billion in climate costs through 2040, study says\nA first-of-its-kind report has estimated  that Los Angeles County must invest billions of dollars through 2040 to protect residents from worsening climate hazards, including extreme heat, increasing precipitation, worsening wildfires, rising sea levels and climate-induced public health threats.\nThe report, published this week by the nonprofit Center for Climate Integrity, identified  14 different climate adaptation measures that authors calculated would  cost L.A. taxpayers at least $12.5 billion over the next 15 years, or approximately $780 million per year. The vast majority of those costs \u2014 more than $9 billion \u2014 will be incurred by local municipal governments, including the cities of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Santa Clarita, the report said.\n\u201cThese numbers don\u2019t include the costs of recovering from disasters \u2014 from extreme weather events that knock out power or damage infrastructure or do all the kinds of things they do,\u201d said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity. \u201cSo it\u2019s a very conservative estimate, and yet it\u2019s a really big number.\u201d \nAggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health and science.\nWiles said the costs for L.A. County are nearly as high as for the entire state of Pennsylvania, which faces about $15 billion in climate adaptation costs over roughly the same  period. \n\u201cThis is a big number, but this is going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThese costs will be incurred at some point, and it\u2019s just much better to pay now than it is to pay later. I can\u2019t emphasize that enough.\u201d\nThe most expensive adaptation categories are related to precipitation and heat, including an estimated $4.3 billion for improved stormwater management, $2.5 billion for cool pavement investments and $1.4 billion for tree canopies to combat urban heat islands, the report found. Other costs include wildfire mitigation; coastal defense and infrastructure protection; building upgrades for cooling and air conditioning; and responses to vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus.\nCounty officials said the findings weren\u2019t surprising and agreed that they may even be conservative given the scale of the threats. \n\u201cThe impacts of climate have become more and more visible over the past few years in particular,\u201d said Rita Kampalath, L.A. County\u2019s chief sustainability officer. \u201cWe know that we\u2019re facing really, really huge needs in terms of how we prepare our communities to face those, and to be resilient in the face of increased climate impacts. It\u2019s only going to increase from here.\u201d\nStormwater capture in particular has been on the minds of many Angelenos this winter as record-breaking rainfall pounded the region. A monster storm in February saw the Los Angeles River roar to life and funnel millions of gallons  into the Pacific Ocean.\nBut the  river \u2014 which was encased in concrete nearly a hundred years ago \u2014 and other local  flood channels will be no match for climate change-enhanced storms of the future. Though the long-term trend in the West is toward hotter and drier conditions, Los Angeles will still see bouts of severe storms and extreme wet years that will increase flood risk significantly, according to the state\u2019s fourth climate change assessment. \nTo mitigate these impacts, the county must expand its stormwater drainage infrastructure by installing bioswales, porous pavement and other opportunities for stormwater to seep into the ground, the report found. It noted that these \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d upgrades are the least expensive option to cope with extreme rainfall events, as opposed to increasing the size and scale of hard infrastructure such as drain pipes. \n Climate & Environment \n The unloved L.A. River just prevented a flood disaster. Can more of its water be saved? \nCapturing rainfall is only one part of the L.A. River\u2019s job. It is also a flood control channel that is critical to protecting lives and properties when stormwaters surge. \nFeb. 8, 2024\nThe county is making progress on this work through its Safe Clean Water Program, passed by voters as Measure W in 2018, Kampalath said. The program allocates about $280 million annually to stormwater capture projects, although recent reports have found that progress to date has been slow. \n\u201cWhile it is a big need, I do actually feel like the county has been investing, and our residents and voters in particular have shown that this is a high priority,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not as far as we would like to be \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say that about much of anything when it comes to climate \u2014 but I do think that we have resources available to try to address some of these needs.\u201d \nMeanwhile, extreme heat continues to pose a significant threat to L.A. County residents, and it is  predicted to only get worse in the years and decades ahead. The region is expected to experience an average of 48.5 days above 90 degrees per year between 2024 and 2040, the report says. That\u2019s about 12.5 more hot days per year than communities experienced between 1994 and 2013. \nSome of the best methods to combat the dangers of rising heat include installing cool pavements, expanding urban green space, painting railway  tracks with reflective paint to keep them at operable temperatures, and upgrading cooling systems for public buildings such as schools, the report says. Converting public parking lots to cool pavements that reflect instead of absorb sunlight can also help lower ambient temperatures.\nHeat is \u201cthe impact that affects communities of color the most, and people less able to adapt themselves and their personal lives,\u201d Wiles said. He noted that some urban areas can simmer up to 20 degrees hotter than surrounding neighborhoods with heavy tree canopies. \n\u201cFrom a public health perspective, these types of adaptations are increasingly critical just to make neighborhoods livable,\u201d he said.\nThe report comes at a moment when the state is facing a significant $37.9-billion budget deficit, which has prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom to slash $2.9 billion from California climate programs, delay an additional $1.9 billion and shift $1.8 billion to other funds. \nKampalath said it\u2019s too soon to say whether those cuts will trickle down to L.A. County\u2019s climate efforts, but that they could potentially affect  funds officials were hoping to take advantage of through grants and other programs.\nHowever, she noted that many of the county\u2019s climate adaptation strategies can have multiple benefits, such as tree canopy programs that help combat heat and improve stormwater management simultaneously.\n\u201cAs we\u2019re looking at how to address these impacts, we do need to think about a multi-benefit approach, and what kind of strategies we can put in place that are really going to address a wide range of things \u2014 not only climate, but biodiversity and health impacts and the well-being of our communities as well,\u201d she said.\n Climate & Environment \n As climate hazards converge, more Californians are living in harm\u2019s way \nWhen wildfire smoke and extreme heat combine, they create a \u201csynergistic effect\u201d or an additional burden on people\u2019s health, researchers say.\nFeb. 3, 2024\nUltimately, funding for the projects outlined in the report will come from taxpayers, whether at the municipal, state or federal level, Wiles said. But he also hopes that oil and gas companies will be held accountable for their role in the worsening climate crisis, as fossil fuel emissions are by far the largest driver of global warming.\nLast year, California filed a bombshell lawsuit against five of the largest oil and gas companies for their alleged \u201cdecades-long campaign of deception\u201d about the risks posed by fossil fuels, which have forced the state to spend billions of dollars to address environmental-related damages. State Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta is seeking to create a nuisance abatement fund to finance climate mitigation and adaptation efforts, among other outcomes. \n\u201cEach and every community in Los Angeles County should consider bringing similar legal actions to hold climate polluters accountable and ensure that taxpayers aren\u2019t left to pay the bill alone,\u201d the report says. \nIndeed, there are other climate hazards that will cost Angelenos billions in adaptation expenses over the next decade and a half, the report found. \nThey include an increase in vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus as more mosquitoes are drawn to the area\u2019s changing temperatures and precipitation patterns. About 500,000 new cases of the virus are expected in the county through 2040, which will cost an estimated $993 million to treat. Climate change will also lead to more pediatric asthma cases due to an increase in pollen, with about 160,000 new cases expected through 2040. \nThe county also needs about $680 million in road improvements as heat and rain contribute to more cracks, erosion and soft surfaces. A foot of sea level rise along the coast of L.A. County  will require at least $576 million for berms, flood walls, bank stabilization and other infrastructure measures to prevent flooding and to avoid infrastructure damage by 2040. \nWildfires, already getting larger, faster and more frequent across California, will necessitate nearly $1 billion  just to clear vegetation and other fuels from land around the county\u2019s infrastructure, the report found. It noted that L.A. County will face an average of 36 more high-fire days through 2040 when compared to the 1994-to-2013 baseline. \nThe estimated $919-million wildfire cost does not account for fighting fires or repairing damage from blazes. The 2018 Woolsey fire racked up an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion in insured losses alone. \nWiles said the expenses outlined in the report won\u2019t solve climate change but will help \u201chold things where they are today,\u201d or least prevent the hazards from getting worse. \nHe said he hoped the report would help guide county officials as they face difficult choices about where, how and to what limited funds should be allocated. Investing in climate adaptations now can save money \u2014 and lives \u2014 later, he said. \n\u201cThese costs are still coming,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cThe next disaster will happen. This is just what it\u2019s going to cost to prepare.\u201d\nToward a more sustainable California\nGet Boiling Point, our newsletter exploring climate change, energy and the environment, and become part of the conversation \u2014 and the solution.\n You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. \nMore to Read \n Endorsement: Yes on Proposition 4.

Therefore, the cost figures have value only from a historical point of view.\nAlthough the figures obtained at the end of the production process may have a definite value in correcting past practices if they are carefully analyzed, a key limitation is that inefficiencies and errors in production are not identified until after the damage is done.\nCost analysis requires the use of predetermined cost estimates, which are made on a more or less scientific basis, to generate standard costs.\nThese costs are prepared in advance of production or supply, and they are based on a correlation of the technical specification of materials and labor to the prices and wage rates estimated for a selected period of time.\nThe following differences exist between historical costing and standard costing:\n1. Costs used: Standard costing includes cost figures that are predetermined based on past experience and expert advice. In historical costing, data are included from costs that have actually been incurred.\n2.

Standard Costs are estimates that are made up front for materials, labor and overhead needed to produce goods or services. Historical costs can be obtained after production because they represent what actually occurred during the manufacturing process.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between standard costing and job order costing?\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Costing is used in a job order or Process Costing environment while actual costing is used in a batch or mass production environment.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between standard costs and variances?\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Costs are better to control costs, judge efficiency and improve operations of an organization. Variances can be calculated from either Standard Costs or historical costs. Historical costing is simply the process of determining costs after production.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between actual costs and standard costs?\n\n\n\n\n\nActual costs are determined by recording how much was actually spent on materials, labor and other expenses while Standard Costs are estimates that are calculated in advance based on data from past periods or expert advice.\n\n\nCan historical costs be used to test the reasonableness of standard costs?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, historical costs can be used in testing whether or not Standard Costs are in line with expected direct material and labor rates. Actual costs cannot however because they are simply what occurred during production.\nAbout the Author\nTrue Tamplin, BSc, CEPF\u00ae\nTrue Tamplin is a published author, public speaker, CEO of UpDigital, and founder of Finance Strategists.\nTrue is a Certified Educator in Personal Finance (CEPF\u00ae), author of The Handy Financial Ratios Guide, a member of the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing, contributes to his financial education site, Finance Strategists, and has spoken to various financial communities such as the CFA Institute, as well as university students like his Alma mater, Biola University, where he received a bachelor of science in business and data analytics. \nTo learn more about True, visit his personal website or  view his author profiles on Amazon, Nasdaq and Forbes.\nOur Services\nAsk a Financial Professional Any Question\nQuick Links\nOrganization\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinance Strategists\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n(213) 536-9984\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5550 Tech Center DriveColorado Springs,CO 80919\nDISCLAIMERS\nFinance Strategists has an advertising relationship with some of the companies included on this website.

As borders closed and people went into quarantine mode for almost two years, the fear remained consistent for a lot of popular tourist destinations as they wondered how they would recover following the global pandemic, and whether the industry would ever go back to the way it was before.\nWhile the same fears applied to the Maldives, a country where the economy largely depends on income from tourism, Maldives was one of the first destinations that opened its borders as early as July 2020. With this, visitors from all around the globe flooded the country, as the Maldives became a safe haven for anyone looking to get a glimpse of a more normal \u2018outside world\u2019. Even with this, people still remained skeptical about how the country\u2019s economy would recover from the downturn of the pandemic.\u00a0\nAnd now, almost three years after the pandemic, the fears are gone and the Maldivian tourism industry appears to be doing better. By the end of 2022, it became evident that the Maldivian tourism industry was picking up, better than ever following the pandemic as the country welcomed over 1.6 million tourists at the end of 2022. While this was a major accomplishment for the country, especially only a year after the lockdown was lifted for most nations, the arrivals really picked up for the Maldives in 2023.\u00a0\nIn the first few months of 2023, especially during January and February, the tourist arrivals for the Maldives were extremely positive, leaving the country\u2019s Tourism Ministry hopeful about reaching the 2 million milestone for the year 2023. In May 2023, however, there was a decline in the arrival rates, as the off-season hit the Maldives as the monsoon season is not popular among visitors travelling to the country. Even with this, the arrivals for this time period in 2022 were marked at 66,938 while this year the arrivals are at 62,816.\nThough May showed a decline in tourist arrivals, the total arrival numbers for the Maldives is proving to be positive as the annual total as of 10 June 2023 is at 846,674.\u00a0 This means the country is extremely close to hitting the million mark!\nAs of June 2023, the top arrival market for the Maldives remains very similar to last year with arrivals from India taking the top spot with 99,922 visitors, Russia following close with 99,356 visitors and the UK at a close third with 75,472 visitors as at 10 June 2023. China is at sixth place so far.\u00a0\nMaldives has a total 60,818 operational bed capacity as at 10 June 2023, with 68 percent of them in the resorts, and 24 percent in guesthouses.\u00a0\n\n                                    Eydhafushi is set to be transformed into a new urban hub with a housing project\n                                \n\n                                    Azerbaijan Airlines\u2019 inaugural flights link Azerbaijan and the Maldives\n                                \n\n                                    The Maldivian Government launches the Hiyaavahi Finance Scheme for affordable home construction projects\n                                \n\n                                    Noonu Atoll Maafaru Airport resumes international flights in time for peak tourist season\n                                \nMaldives Financial Review\n\n                            9th Floor, M.

    "document": "Strategies for Mitigating Environmental Impacts of Tourism\nHave you ever gazed upon a pristine beach, an unspoiled forest, or a historic site brimming with ancient stories and wondered how these places can be preserved amidst the growing pressures of tourism? The answer lies in effective impact mitigation measures, strategies specially designed to balance the need for tourism development with the imperative of environmental preservation. Let\u2019s explore the innovative approaches that can help sustain the beauty and integrity of tourist destinations for generations to come.\nTackling the Challenges: Understanding Environmental Impacts of Tourism \ud83d\udd17\nBefore delving into mitigation strategies, it\u2019s crucial to comprehend the environmental impacts tourism can have. These range from natural resource depletion, pollution, and habitat destruction to wildlife disturbance and cultural erosion. Recognizing these impacts is the first step in formulating robust measures to counteract them.\nDepletion of Natural Resources \ud83d\udd17\nTourism often leads to increased consumption of water, energy, and land, putting a strain on these vital resources. In areas with limited availability, this can lead to significant ecological imbalances.\nPollution and Habitat Destruction \ud83d\udd17\nThe influx of tourists can result in increased waste, air, and water pollution. This not only affects the scenic value of a destination but also leads to the destruction of critical habitats for flora and fauna.\nWildlife Disturbance \ud83d\udd17\nClose encounters with wildlife may seem like an enriching experience, but they can disrupt natural behaviors and breeding patterns, threatening the survival of species.\nCultural Erosion \ud83d\udd17\nTourism can sometimes lead to the commercialization of culture, where traditions are modified to suit tourist expectations, risking the authenticity of local customs and practices.\nStrategies for Sustainable Tourism \ud83d\udd17\nHow can we mitigate these impacts and ensure that tourism contributes positively to environmental preservation? The following strategies offer a pathway to sustainable tourism development:\nTargeting Alternative Tourist Types \ud83d\udd17\nNot all tourists have the same environmental footprint. By promoting and developing facilities for eco-tourists, cultural enthusiasts, and adventure seekers who are more inclined to respect and preserve the environment, destinations can reduce their overall impact.\nEnhancing Resource Resistance \ud83d\udd17\nBuilding resilience: Strengthening the ability of natural and cultural sites to withstand tourist pressures is key. This can include measures such as using sustainable materials in construction, implementing water-saving techniques, and adopting renewable energy sources.\nEducation and Awareness \ud83d\udd17\nEmpowering stakeholders: Educating tourists, local communities, and industry stakeholders about the importance of environmental preservation creates a shared responsibility. Informative campaigns, guided tours with a focus on sustainability, and training programs for local businesses are effective tools.\nRegulating Tourist Numbers \ud83d\udd17\nLimits of acceptable change: By determining the carrying capacity of sites and setting limits on visitor numbers, destinations can prevent the overuse of resources and maintain the quality of the tourist experience.\nImplementing Effective Mitigation Measures \ud83d\udd17\nUnderstanding the necessity of impact mitigation is one thing; putting these measures into practice is another. Here\u2019s how stakeholders can operationalize these strategies:\nPolicy and Planning \ud83d\udd17\nGovernment and planning authorities must incorporate sustainability into tourism policies, ensuring that environmental considerations are at the forefront of development decisions.\nCommunity Involvement \ud83d\udd17\nLocal communities should be active participants in tourism planning and management, as they are often the custodians of the natural and cultural resources that attract tourists.\nMonitoring and Evaluation \ud83d\udd17\nContinuous monitoring of the environmental impacts of tourism helps in evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation measures and provides data for informed decision-making.\nStakeholder Collaboration \ud83d\udd17\nFrom tour operators to conservationists, all stakeholders must work collaboratively to promote and implement sustainable practices within the tourism industry.\nPromoting Responsible Tourism Practices \ud83d\udd17\nTo facilitate the adoption of impact mitigation measures, promoting responsible tourism practices among all stakeholders is vital. Here\u2019s what that entails:\nFor Tourists \ud83d\udd17\nEncouraging travelers to adopt eco-friendly habits, such as minimizing waste, conserving water, and respecting local customs, plays a significant part in reducing environmental impacts.\nFor Businesses \ud83d\udd17\nTourism businesses can lead by example, implementing green initiatives in their operations and educating their clientele on the importance of sustainability.\nFor Governments \ud83d\udd17\nCreating incentives for sustainable practices and enforcing environmental regulations ensures that the tourism industry aligns with broader conservation objectives.\nConclusion \ud83d\udd17\nImpact mitigation measures in tourism are not just strategies; they are necessary actions to ensure the longevity and integrity of our planet\u2019s precious destinations. By understanding and addressing the environmental impacts of tourism, promoting responsible tourism practices, and fostering collaboration among stakeholders, we can achieve a balance between the economic benefits of tourism and the preservation of natural and cultural resources.\nWhat do you think?

    "document": "Hydrology and Big River Update\nAfter a wet and joyous 2023 water year, water managers and planners are feeling a little less optimistic about 2024. The good times from the previous period of plenty are now replaced with a feeling of foreboding, like the morning after a great party, as we face a below average forecast for 2024.\nLocally, there is good news to lessen the potential whiplash. Water supply conditions remain good with average to above average soil moisture conditions and healthy carryover storage projected for most of the reservoirs in the District. Also potentially hedging against a dry 2024, is the return of a strong El Ni\u00f1o, with near record warming of sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific. This is generally correlated with increased precipitation in the southwestern U.S, especially in the spring. According to NOAA Climate Prediction Center, \u201cEl Ni\u00f1o remains the major climate driver and is expected to be the primary influence on the mid-latitude circulation\u201d for the near term. Figure 1 reflects this with a slightly wetter near-term (Jan-March 2024) outlook.\nUnfortunately, the benefits of El Ni\u00f1o circulation patterns may be adversely influenced by the significant warming that is affecting the region and across the globe. Climate scientists have now confirmed that 2023 was officially the warmest year ever for the planet.\n\nAcross the Upper Basin and for inflows to Lakes Powell and Mead, the early water supply forecasts are not good and represent a significant departure from the heady days of 2023; the days of increasing or even stable reservoir levels may not persist into the near-term picture, without some changes.\nSince the last staff hydrology memo presented in October 2023, the once near-average seasonal inflow forecast volume for April to July of 2024 has decreased precipitously, losing more than 3 million acre-feet (\u201cmaf\u201d), according to the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center, due to excessively dry conditions. The current unregulated inflow forecast for Lake Powell is 4.80 maf or 75% of average and the unregulated inflow forecast for the entire water year for Lake Powell is 7.62 maf or 79% of average. Combined with a projected 7.48 MAF release from Glen Canyon dam, pursuant to the 2007 Interim guidelines, and consideration evaporation losses, annual inflow could be almost the same as annual outflow putting Lake Powell projected elevations to be unchanged at approximately the same elevation of 3668.5 feet AMSL at this same time next year, under this most probable (50% exceedance) inflow projection.\nFor Lake Mead, the most probable projection indicates that Level 1 shortages will likely persist in the Lower Basin in 2024, with Hoover Dam releases limited to about 8.4 million acre-feet to meet reduced downstream demands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Posts\t\t\t\t\t\nPhone: 970.945.8522 \nFax: 970.945.8799\nEmail: edinfo@crwcd.org\nColorado River Water Conservation District\n201 Centennial St., Suite 200\nGlenwood Springs, CO 81601\nInteractive Map\nFor accessibility inquiries or assistance, please contact:\nEmail: accessibility@crwcd.org\n",

    "document": "Drought in the Colorado River Basin\nInsights using open data\nSince 2000, the Colorado River Basin (Basin) has been experiencing a historic, extended drought that has impacted regional water supply and other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and ecologic services. During this time, the Basin has experienced its lowest 16-year period of inflow in over 100 years of record keeping, and reservoir storage in the Colorado River system has declined from nearly full to about half of capacity. \nThis application was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation in support of the Department of the Interior\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Open Water Data Initiative (OWDI). This visualization is part of a multi-agency effort to showcase the usefulness of open data (i.e., data provided in a discoverable, sharable, and machine-readable format) by exploring the current 16-year drought and its effects on the Colorado River Basin. \nConcern is growing about the impacts of the ongoing drought and declining reservoir levels, such as decreasing water supply and the possibility of a first-ever shortage condition of drinking water for the Lower Basin; decreasing hydropower capacities at Lake Powell and Lake Mead; the potential for loss of hydroelectric generation at Lake Powell; reduced recreational opportunities; and changes to in-stream flows that support ecosystems.\nIn response to drought conditions, Federal agencies and stakeholders throughout the Basin have been working together to find creative ways to reduce the effects of the drought on the people and resources that rely on water from the Colorado River.\nScroll down to learn more about the importance of the Colorado River, the impacts of the current drought, and the ways in which the drought is being managed in the Basin.\nRead More >>\nThe Colorado River is a lifeline.\nWater from the Colorado River is essential for life in parts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. According to the Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study (2012), the Colorado River and its tributaries:\n Bureau of Reclamation, 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.   \nOne river, two parts.\nApproximately 1,400 miles long and flowing through seven U.S. States and into Mexico, the Colorado River drains roughly one-twelfth of the land area of the contiguous United States. The Colorado River Basin is divided into the Upper and Lower Basins at the Lee Ferry Colorado River Compact Point (Compact Point) located in northern Arizona. The Upper Basin spans portions of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and northern Arizona. The Lower Basin covers parts of Nevada, Arizona, California, southwestern Utah, and western New Mexico. The Colorado River also supplies water to parts of the states of Baja California and Sonora in northwestern Mexico.\n The Upper Colorado River Basin supplies approximately 90 percent of the water for the entire Basin. This water originates as precipitation and snowmelt in the Rocky and Wasatch Mountains. About 50 percent of streamflow comes from baseflow, which is surface water that percolates into groundwater aquifers and then resurfaces as streamflow (Rumsey et al., 2015). The Lower Basin is arid, with little tributary runoff reaching the mainstream of the Colorado River except during occasional rain events.  \n The Lower Basin depends upon managed use of the Colorado River system to make its surrounding land habitable and productive. Colorado River water is also delivered to areas that lie outside the Basin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hydrologic boundary, including parts of southern California, the east side of the Front Range in Colorado, and the west side of the Wasatch Range in Utah. In addition, federally recognized Tribes hold a substantial amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries (approximately 2.9 million acre-feet of annual diversion rights).\nResources and facilities, such as dams and power plants, in the Colorado River Basin are managed to accomplish their project goals in a manner fully consistent with applicable provisions of Federal law including the Law of the River and other project-specific operational guidelines. The Law of the River includes operating criteria, regulations, administrative decisions, Federal statutes, interstate compacts, court decisions and decrees, an international treaty, and contracts with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior (Secretary), and defines the responsibilities of the Secretary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s water master role in the Lower Basin.\nRead More >>\nRumsey, C.A., et al. 2015. \"Regional scale estimates of baseflow and factors influencing baseflow in the Upper Colorado River Basin.\" Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 4: 91-107. \nLearn about the Colorado River Basin's network of reservoirs, water delivery infrastructure, and water delivery service areas.\nThe Colorado River is managed with a series of dams and canals that provide flood control, water conservation, and hydropower benefits.\nThe dams and canals in the Colorado River system provide storage for regional water supply, facilitate water deliveries, provide flood control benefits, improve navigation, and generate hydroelectric power. These facilities are operated in coordination with adjacent or nearby water delivery systems that also provide a variety of other economic, cultural, and ecologic benefits.\nIn the Lower Basin, Hoover Dam was constructed to control floods, improve navigation and regulate the river's flow, provide water storage and delivery, and generate electric energy. Davis Dam and Parker Dam were constructed to regulate water released from Hoover Dam. Near the southern end of the system, Imperial Dam serves as the last diversion dam on the Colorado River for the United States, with Morelos Dam diverting Colorado River water into Mexico.  \nWater is released from these facilities to satisfy delivery commitments to users in Nevada, California, Arizona and Mexico, and to generate hydropower with these water releases. Pumping facilities located on Lake Havasu behind Parker Dam divert water to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and Central Arizona Project.  From Imperial Dam's headworks, water is diverted into the All-American Canal on the California side of the dam and into the Gila Gravity Main Canal on the Arizona side of the dam. These diversions provide water to the Gila Project, the Yuma Project, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the City of Yuma, and to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB) for diversion at Morelos Dam into Mexico. \nRead More >>\nThe diagram above depicts the major dams, reservoirs, and control structures of the Lower Colorado River.\nView real-time data and take a journey through major dams on the Lower Colorado River.\nWater supply varies over time.\nDue to year-to-year differences in precipitation and snowmelt, the natural water supply of the Basin is highly variable. Long-term drought like the Basin has experienced since 2000 reflects natural climate variability coupled with the likely impacts from changing climate. Since most of the Basin's water supply comes from the Upper Basin, drought conditions in the Upper Basin impact water supply and resources in both the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gage at Lees Ferry, Arizona, is the lowermost mainstream gage in the Upper Basin, located about 12 miles downstream of Glen Canyon Dam and about 1 mile upstream of the Compact Point between the Upper and Lower Basins. Natural flow at this stream gage location is used as a proxy for the hydrologic conditions in the Upper Basin and the overall hydrologic health of the Basin. Natural flow is defined as the streamflow that would have otherwise occurred without the effects of human activities such as reservoir regulation and river diversions.\nIn the graphic above, the 10-year average natural flow at Lees Ferry shows periods of below and above average annual flow (approximately 14.8 million acre-feet [maf]). The most recent drought for the 2000-2015 period (indicated by the brown shaded area) was the driest 16-year period in the past 100 years and one of the driest 16-year periods in the past 1,200 years. The graphic also depicts how the early part of the 1900s, which corresponds to the period of reference used to set the apportionments for the Upper and Lower Basins in the 1922 Colorado River Compact, was an unusually wet period (indicated by the green shaded area). At the time the 1922 Colorado River Compact was signed, the average annual inflow at Lees Ferry during the pre-Compact period (1906-1921) was approximately 18.0 maf.\nUSGS observations of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry (USGS site 09380000) have been recorded since 1895. For more information and data on this site, visit the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Information System Lees Ferry stream gage website. Real-time gage height, discharge, water temperature, sediment, and water-quality properties can be accessed from the U.S. Geological Survey Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center website.\nThe Lees Ferry gage is distinct from the Lee Ferry Compact Point: Lees Ferry refers to the USGS-operated stream gage located near the town of Lees Ferry, Arizona; whereas Lee Ferry refers to the Colorado River Compact Point, as referenced in the 1922 Colorado River Compact. The Lee Ferry Compact Point is located 1 mile downstream of the Lees Ferry gage. \nHistorical observations are extended by a tree-ring reconstruction of streamflow going back approximately 1,200 years, as estimated by Meko et al. (2007a). Because trees grow less during dry years and more during wet years, tree-ring cores can be used to estimate historical streamflow conditions going back many centuries. Tree-ring core samples were collected from locations throughout the Upper Basin to estimate historical natural flow. These estimates were validated using the observed natural flow record developed by the Bureau of Reclamation. \nExplore more about reconstructed natural flow based on tree-ring data.\n 1922 Colorado River Compact.\nBureau of Reclamation. 1922.

This period also ranks as the fifth driest 16-year period in the last 1,200 years (Meko et al., 2007a and 2007b).   \nWhile the current drought is severe and historic, the most extreme drought in the Colorado River Basin occurred in the mid-1100s (Meko et al. 2007a). The 1100s drought was characterized by a 25-year period of flows that were 15% lower than the long-term average of 14.8 maf and no higher-flow years (greater than 125% of average) for six decades. By comparison, the current drought is characterized by flows that are 16% lower than the long-term average with one year of higher flows (135% percent of average in 2011).\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor shows the extent and intensity of drought conditions in the Western U.S. from 2000 to 2015. The Esri  Drought Tracker provides a means to view drought conditions in the U.S. over time, using data from the U.S. Drought Monitor.\n\nView more information about drought in the U.S. and Colorado River Basin. \nBureau of Reclamation, 2015.

Medieval drought in the upper Colorado River Basin. Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 34, L10705.\nThe Colorado River Basin's abundant water storage capacity has made the Southwest more resilient to drought.\nThe basin-wide storage capacity of the Colorado River totals about 60 million acre-feet (maf), approximately four times the average annual inflow in the Upper Basin (14.8 maf). The Basin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead hold about 50 maf combined, which is approximately 83 percent of the total system storage capacity. This large storage capacity creates a buffer against year-to-year hydrologic variability and longer-term drought periods by allowing excess water to be stored during wet years and used during dry years. \nIt is this large amount of basin-wide storage capacity that has allowed the Bureau of Reclamation to continue to meet water delivery requirements during the current drought period. It should be noted, however, that headwater reaches in the Upper Basin can experience localized shortages due to insufficient in-stream flows during dry years.\nThe volume of water that can be stored in the Colorado River system reservoirs (60 million acre-feet) is enough to cover the State of Utah in about 1 foot of water. Dimensions shown above are not to scale.\n Bureau of Reclamation. Colorado River Basin Supply and Demand Study, 2012. \nDevelopment in the West continues, leading to increased water demand in the Colorado River Basin.\nSince the early 1900s, water demand in the Colorado River Basin has increased while water supply has, on average, decreased. For the 16-year period preceding the signing of the 1922 Colorado River Compact, when the beneficial consumptive use of 7.5 million acre-feet (maf) per year was apportioned to both the Upper and Lower Basins, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 18.0 maf (1906-1921). When the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty was executed, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 16.3 maf (1906-1944). The current average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin is about 14.8 maf (1906-2015).  \nAs the average annual natural flow has decreased, the difference between water supply and water demand has narrowed and the Colorado River system has been operating on increasingly close margins. As a result of this decrease in natural flows and an increase in water use basin-wide, it now appears that the Colorado River system is over-allocated (Bureau of Reclamation, 2012).\nClimate projections indicate more extreme conditions are possible, with longer, more severe wet and dry periods. Cooperation and collaboration are key to finding sustainable solutions and addressing current and future water resources management challenges.\nRead More >>\nTrends in water supply and water use in the Colorado River Basin are shown above. When water use (red line) exceeds water supply (blue line) in a given year, the amount of water stored is reduced. During the past 20 years, average water supply and average water use have been about equal. Under these conditions, reservoirs are replenished more slowly. Water-supply and water-use data shown in the graphic above are estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation using water accounting information, U.S. Geological Survey stream gage data, and other sources.\nIn this graphic, water use is shown as \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsumptive use\u00e2\u0080\u009d (surface-water diversions and groundwater pumping minus measured and unmeasured return flows) as estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation in its annual water accounting reports. Other estimates of water use that account for withdrawals of surface and groundwater and incorporate water that is used and returned to the stream, are made by the USGS.\nBureau of Reclamation. 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.\nAccess current reservoir conditions in the Upper Basin and Lower Basin.\nBecause of reduced water supply during the current drought, the elevations of Lakes Mead and Powell have declined.\nAs the reservoir levels of Lake Mead and Lake Powell decline, other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and water quality, are also affected.\nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Powell can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps are based on U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite surface reflectance-corrected images acquired in the month of June in 1999 and 2014. Landsat images acquired within 16 days of each other have been merged together to generate cloud-free composite satellite images suitable for measurement and change comparison.\n\t\t \nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Mead can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps were prepared using the U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite data as described in the Lake Powell caption above.   \nBetween 2001 and 2015, Lake Mead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elevation dropped from 1,196 to 1,075 feet, a decline of 121 feet. Move the slider on the upper photo to see the decline in the reservoir elevation during this time. The decline in water elevation has exposed a white band of mineralized rock around the shoreline. The declining reservoir level has also exposed portions of Hoover Dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s four intake towers, two on the right side and two on the left side. These intake towers channel water from Lake Mead into penstocks that serve Hoover Dam's 17 hydroelectric generators. Water moves through the generators, creating electricity on the way, and is released back into the Colorado River below the dam. \nThe lower photos show the conditions of Lake Mead and the upstream face of Hoover Dam in 2001 at an elevation of 1,196 feet (left photo) and the conditions in June 2015 at an elevation of 1,075 feet (right photo). The lower photos also show the Nevada spillway in the bottom right corner of the photos. \nThe Bureau of Reclamation estimates that every 1-foot drop in the elevation of Lake Mead reduces Hoover Dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powerplant capacity by approximately 5.7 megawatts. Since Lake Mead was last full in 2000, Hoover Dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powerplant capacity has fallen from 2,074 to 1,563 megawatts (as of August 2015). The Bureau of Reclamation has mitigated some of this impact by replacing traditional turbines with \u00e2\u0080\u009cwide-head\u00e2\u0080\u009d turbines, which are capable of generating more efficiently at lower reservoir levels, and making significant efficiency improvements to the powerplant. \nAt Lake Powell, the generating capacity of the Glen Canyon Dam powerplant is put at risk by declining reservoir levels. Below an elevation of 3,490 feet, Glen Canyon Dam cannot generate power. Based on a Bureau of Reclamation analysis conducted in August 2015, the earliest that this elevation is projected to occur would be 2019 (there is about a 5 percent chance of this occurring). Since Lake Powell finished filling in 1980, its water-surface elevation declined to a maximum low elevation of 3,555 feet (33 percent of capacity) in April 2005, which was approximately 65 feet above the minimum power pool.\nRead More >>\nThe photo slider above shows Hemenway Harbor, located in the southwestern portion of Lake Mead, and the location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,152 feet in January 2003, and the new location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,078 feet in May 2015. The photos also depict the increased exposure of Lake Mead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoreline and the emergence of the Boulder Islands, located on the right side of the photo, as the reservoir elevation has declined.\nLake Mead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s declining reservoir elevation has affected marinas and boat launching facilities at Lake Mead National Recreation Area, requiring the relocation of marinas and the extension of boat ramps to keep recreational facilities open. To continue to provide boat access as reservoir levels have declined, the National Park Service, responsible for the Recreation Area, has been extending boat ramps since 2002 and was expected to about spend $5 million extending ramps in 2015. In 2007, the Overton Beach Marina became inaccessible by water, and facilities from Overton Beach had to be moved to two other marinas, Callville Bay and Temple Bar. In 2008, Lake Mead Marina was moved from the location it had occupied since the 1960s to its current location in Hemenway Harbor.\nIn addition to impacting water supply, changing reservoir levels also influence the aquatic ecosystem. Water-level changes and natural disturbances, such as storm events and resulting local runoff, can re-suspend sediments. Because some Lake Mead sediments contain contaminants, re-suspension of sediment may be of concern to ecological health (Rosen et al., 2012).\nRead More >>\nIllia, T. 2010.

Monthly projections made by the Bureau of Reclamation through an operational model called the \"24-Month Study\" are used to set the operational conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell.\nContinue with the visualization to learn more about Lake Mead's operational conditions, how operational conditions are determined, and the potential impacts of drought on water deliveries in the Lower Basin.\nThe graphic above shows Lake Mead's historical elevations (on a monthly basis) since 2000, projected elevations for 2016 and 2017, and annual operating conditions. \nAs Lake Mead's elevation declines, the Lower Basin comes closer to its first-ever shortage condition. Since the drought began in 2000, Lake Mead's elevation has dropped by nearly 140 feet, declining every year except in 2005 and 2011. The Bureau of Reclamation makes projections of Lake Mead elevations and summarizes them in the Colorado River Basin 24-Month Study reports. The 24-Month Study model simulates operations of 12 major reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin. The projections are used to support annual and monthly decisions about how to operate the system looking out 1 to 2 years. The annual operating conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell in the upcoming year are based on projected January 1 reservoir elevations from the August 24-Month Study consistent with the 2007 Record of Decision on Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead (2007 Interim Guidelines  ). \nThe 24-Month Study utilizes forecasted Upper Basin inflow hydrology (provided by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center), projected reservoir operations, projected diversion and consumptive use schedules, and other factors, to generate a single scenario of potential reservoir conditions.\nThe 2007 Interim Guidelines, adopted in December 2007 and in effect through 2026, provide the approved procedure to determine operating conditions and annual releases from Lake Powell and Lake Mead throughout the full range of reservoir operations. The 2007 Interim Guidelines include criteria for implementing shortage and surplus conditions in the Lower Colorado River Basin. The January 1 projections and resulting annual operation for Lake Mead and Lake Powell are reported in the Annual Operating Plan for Colorado River Reservoirs (AOP) for the upcoming year. Current and previous years' AOPs can be found on the Bureau of Reclamation's website.\n\nRead More >>\nLake Mead\nThe Colorado River is one of the primary sources of water for irrigation and domestic use in Arizona, southern California, southern Nevada, and portions of northwestern Mexico.\nThe Bureau of Reclamation's Lower Colorado Region keeps records of diversions, return flows, and consumptive use of water delivered from the mainstream of the Colorado River below Lees Ferry to entitlement holders within the Lower Colorado River Basin. \nThe pictogram above depicts average consumptive use by select Lower Colorado River water entitlement holders for the 5-year period from 2010-2014. Each blue block represents a volume of 100,000 acre-feet and partially shaded blue blocks represent volumes less than 100,000 acre-feet. Hover over the bars to see the average consumptive use (2010-2014) by select Lower Colorado River entitlement holders (highlighted in green). \nThe pictogram above depicts the elevation range (from approximately 1,200 to 1,229 feet) and annual water deliveries in the Lower Basin when Lake Mead is operating in a Flood Control Surplus Condition. When in flood control, Lake Mead's operations are coordinated with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, according to the 1984 Field Working Agreement between the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Per the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty, when Lake Mead is operating in flood control, an additional 200,000 acre-feet of water will be delivered to Mexico for a total annual delivery of 1.7 million acre-feet. Hover over the blue squares and states to see detailed delivery information. \nA Quantified Surplus Condition or Domestic Surplus Condition exists when Lake Mead's January 1 elevation for the upcoming year is projected to be between 1,145 feet and approximately 1,200 feet. In a surplus condition, entitlement holders  in the Lower Basin may take delivery of additional water, as allowed within their entitlements.  As agreed to under Minute 319 to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty, Mexico may also take delivery of additional water within this elevation range. Hover over the blue squares and states to see detailed delivery information.  \nPlease visit the International Boundary and Water Commission website to learn more about the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty and Minute 319 (in effect through 2017).\nRead More >>\nA Normal Condition or Intentionally Created Surplus (ICS) Surplus Condition exists when Lake Mead's January 1 elevation for the upcoming year is projected to be between 1,075 and 1,145 feet.

Activities related to drought response include a system conservation program and drought contingency planning efforts in both the Upper and Lower Basins. Additional ongoing activities are being conducted with stakeholders through the Basin Study Moving Forward process and with Native American Tribes through the Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study. Lastly, the implementation of Minute 319 and related binational discussions also underscore the importance of the partnership and continued collaboration between the United States and Mexico. \nPilot System Conservation Program\n In 2014, an $11 million funding agreement for a  Pilot System Conservation Program (PSCP) was executed among the Bureau of Reclamation, Central Arizona Water Conservation District (CAWCD), The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), Denver Water (DW), and the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) (the Funding Partners). The PSCP establishes a mechanism for funding the creation of Colorado River system water through voluntary water conservation actions and reductions in water use beginning in 2015 and continuing through at least 2016. The purpose of the PSCP is to explore the effectiveness of voluntary measures that could be used, when needed, to help maintain water levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead above critical levels. All water conserved as a result of the pilot program would be considered Colorado River system water. Proposals under the PSCP have been received from potential program participants in both the Upper and Lower Basins, where execution of implementation agreements began in 2015 and is ongoing.\nDrought Contingency Planning\nThe Bureau of Reclamation also works with Arizona, California, and Nevada to identify proactive steps to lower the risk of reaching critical elevations at Lake Mead. A step forward was a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for a Pilot Drought Response Actions signed by the Bureau of Reclamation and several water agencies in the Lower Basin States in December 2014. The MOU outlines a commitment by the parties to use best efforts to generate between 1.5 and 3.0 million acre-feet (maf) of additional water in Lake Mead through 2019. The Bureau of Reclamation, MWD, SNWA, and CAWCD have agreed to take first steps to generate 0.740 maf of the additional water by the end of 2017. The MOU is an important first step forward and collaboration continues on potential longer term options.\nIn the Upper Basin, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming are pursuing a plan with three major components: 1) extended operations of the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) reservoirs, 2) voluntary demand management (e.g., fallowing or deficit irrigation), and 3) augmentation (primarily weather modification, such as cloud seeding). The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the Upper Basin States, has conducted modeling that indicates extended operations of the Upper Basin CRSP reservoirs to move water to Lake Powell can significantly reduce the probability of Lake Powell falling below critical elevations. The Bureau of Reclamation and the Upper Basin States are developing an extended operations plan and implementation agreement. It is anticipated that these will be completed by the end of 2016.\nIn addition to the previously mentioned activities, Congress has authorized additional funding through the Bureau of Reclamation for drought-related activities to increase Colorado River system water in Lake Mead, Lake Powell, and other Colorado River system reservoirs for the benefit of the system. This authorization requires that a report evaluating the effectiveness of the water conservation pilot projects be submitted to Congress in 2018, including a recommendation on whether the activities undertaken by the pilot projects should be continued. \nThe Moving Forward Effort\nIn May 2013, the Bureau of Reclamation and Basin stakeholders initiated the Moving Forward effort to build on future considerations and next steps identified in the Colorado River Basin Study. The Moving Forward effort enhances the broad, inclusive stakeholder process demonstrated in the Basin Study with an ultimate goal of identifying actionable steps to address projected water supply and demand imbalances that have broad-based support and provide a wide range of benefits. The Moving Forward effort is being conducted in a phased approach. Phase 1 began with the formation of a Coordination Team and three multi-stakeholder workgroups that focus on water conservation, reuse and environmental and recreational flows. In May, 2015 the Phase 1 Report was published, which documents the activities and outcomes of the workgroups during this phase and includes opportunities for potential future action.  \nTribal Water Study\nBegun in late 2013, the Colorado River Basin Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study is a cooperative effort with the Ten Tribes Partnership, whose members hold a significant amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries. The study builds on the technical foundation of the Colorado River Basin Study by further assessing water supplies and demands for these Tribes and identifies tribal opportunities and challenges associated with the development of tribal water. This study is anticipated to be completed in 2016.\nBinational Partnership\nIn November 2012, the United States and Mexico reached agreement on Minute 319 to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty. Minute 319 is a 5-year agreement (2013-2017) that provides for a series of joint cooperative actions between the United States and Mexico, including surplus sharing during higher Lake Mead conditions, reduced water deliveries during lower Lake Mead conditions, flexibility with the Intentionally Created Mexican Apportionment mechanism, opportunities for improved and more efficient infrastructure, and water for the environment. In 2014, a pulse flow of approximately 105,000 acre-feet was delivered to Mexico from March 23 through May 18 to benefit the riparian ecosystem in the Colorado River Delta. Implementation of the pulse flow also involved a monitoring component conducted by scientists and experts from the United States and Mexico to determine the environmental benefits of the pulse flow and the overall performance of the pilot project. With the success of the binational implementation of this project, the United States and Mexico hope to develop a new binational agreement in the spirit of continued collaboration to meet future water resources management challenges ahead. \nRead More >>\nBureau of Reclamation System Conservation Pilot Program.

See Guide to this Report for more on\nassessments of likelihood and confidence.\n6.0: Introduction\nTemperature is among the most important climatic elements used in\ndecision-making. For example, builders and insurers use temperature\ndata for planning and risk management while energy companies and\nregulators use temperature data to predict demand and set utility\nrates. Temperature is also a key indicator of climate change: recent\nincreases are apparent over the land, ocean, and troposphere, and\nsubstantial changes are expected for this century. This chapter\nsummarizes the major observed and projected changes in near-surface\nair temperature over the United States, emphasizing new data sets\nand model projections since the Third National Climate Assessment\n(NCA3). Changes are depicted using a spectrum of observations,\nincluding surface weather stations, moored ocean buoys, polar-orbiting\nsatellites, and temperature-sensitive proxies. Projections are based\non global models and downscaled products from CMIP5 (Coupled Model\nIntercomparison Project Phase 5) using a suite of Representative\nConcentration Pathways (RCPs; see Ch. 4: Projections for more on\nRCPs and future scenarios).\n6.1: Historical Changes\n6.1.1 Average Temperatures\nChanges in average temperature are described using a suite of\nobservational datasets. As in NCA3, changes in land temperature are\nassessed using the nClimGrid dataset.1\n,2\nAlong U.S. coastlines,\nchanges in sea surface temperatures are quantified using a new\nreconstruction3\nthat forms the ocean component of the NOAA Global Temperature\ndataset.4\nChanges in middle tropospheric temperature are examined using updated\nversions of multiple satellite datasets.5\n,6\n,7\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States has\nrisen since the start of the 20th century. In general, temperature\nincreased until about 1940, decreased until about 1970, and increased\nrapidly through 2016. Because the increase was not constant over\ntime, multiple methods were evaluated in this report (as in NCA3)\nto quantify the trend. All methods yielded rates of warming that\nwere significant at the 95% level. The lowest estimate of 1.2\u00b0F\n(0.7\u00b0C) was obtained by computing the difference between the average\nfor 1986\u20132016 (i.e., present-day) and the average for 1901\u20131960\n(i.e., the first half of the last century). The highest estimate\nof 1.8\u00b0F (1.0\u00b0C) was obtained by fitting a linear (least-squares)\nregression line through the period 1895\u20132016. Thus, the temperature\nincrease cited in this assessment is 1.2\u00b0\u20131.8\u00b0F (0.7\u00b0\u20131.0\u00b0C).\nThis increase is about 0.1\u00b0F (0.06\u00b0C) less than presented in NCA3,\nand it results from the use of slightly different periods in each\nreport. In particular, the decline in the lower bound stems from\nthe use of different time periods to represent present-day climate\n(NCA3 used 1991\u20132012, which was slightly warmer than the 1986\u20132016\nperiod used here). The decline in the upper bound stems mainly from\ntemperature differences late in the record (e.g., the last year of\ndata available for NCA3 was 2012, which was the warmest year on\nrecord for the contiguous United States).\nEach NCA region experienced a net warming through 2016 (Table 6.1).\nThe largest changes were in the western United States, where average\ntemperature increased by more than 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) in Alaska, the\nNorthwest, the Southwest, and also in the Northern Great Plains.\nAs noted in NCA3, the Southeast had the least warming, driven by a\ncombination of natural variations and human influences.8\nIn most regions, average\nminimum temperature increased at a slightly higher rate than average\nmaximum temperature, with the Midwest having the largest discrepancy,\nand the Southwest and Northwest having the smallest. This differential\nrate of warming resulted in a continuing decrease in the diurnal\ntemperature range that is consistent with other parts of the globe.9\nAnnual average\nsea surface temperature also increased along all regional coastlines\n(see Figure 1.3), though changes were generally smaller than over\nland owing to the higher heat capacity of water. Increases were\nlargest in Alaska (greater than 1.0\u00b0F [0.6\u00b0C]) while increases\nwere smallest (less than 0.5\u00b0F [0.3\u00b0C]) in coastal areas of the\nSoutheast.\nMore than 95% of the land surface of the contiguous United States\nhad an increase in annual average temperature (Figure 6.1). In\ncontrast, only small (and somewhat dispersed) parts of the Southeast\nand Southern Great Plains experienced cooling. From a seasonal\nperspective, warming was greatest and most widespread in winter,\nwith increases of over 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) in most areas. In summer,\nwarming was less extensive (mainly along the East Coast and in the\nwestern third of the Nation), while cooling was evident in parts\nof the Southeast, Midwest, and Great Plains.\nFigure 6.1\nObserved changes in annual, winter, and summer temperature (\u00b0F). Changes are the difference\nbetween the average for present-day (1986\u20132016) and the average for the first half of\nthe last century (1901\u20131960 for the contiguous United States, 1925\u20131960 for Alaska and Hawai\u2018i).\nEstimates are derived from the nClimDiv dataset.\n1\n,2\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nThere has been a rapid increase in the average temperature of the\ncontiguous United States over the past several decades. There is\ngeneral consistency on this point between the surface thermometer\nrecord from NOAA1\nand the middle tropospheric satellite records from Remote Sensing\nSystems (RSS),5\nNOAA\u2019s Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR),7\nand the University\nof Alabama in Huntsville (UAH).6\nIn particular, for the\nperiod 1979\u20132016, the rate of warming in the surface record was\n0.512\u00b0F (0.284\u00b0C) per decade, versus trends of 0.455\u00b0F (0.253\u00b0C),\n0.421\u00b0F (0.234\u00b0C), and 0.289\u00b0F (0.160 \u00b0C) per decade for RSS version\n4, STAR version 3, and UAH version 6, respectively (after accounting\nfor stratospheric influences). All trends are statistically significant\nat the 95% level. For the contiguous United States, the year 2016\nwas the second-warmest on record at the surface and in the middle\ntroposphere (2012 was the warmest year at the surface, and 2015 was\nthe warmest in the middle troposphere). Generally speaking, surface\nand satellite records do not have identical trends because they do\nnot represent the same physical quantity; surface measurements are\nmade using thermometers in shelters about 1.5 meters above the\nground whereas satellite measurements are mass-weighted averages\nof microwave emissions from deep atmospheric layers. The UAH record\nlikely has a lower trend because it differs from the other satellite\nproducts in the treatment of target temperatures from the NOAA-9\nsatellite as well as in the correction for diurnal drift.10\nRecent paleo-temperature evidence confirms the unusual character\nof wide-scale warming during the past few decades as determined\nfrom the instrumental record. The most important new paleoclimate\nstudy since NCA3 showed that for each of the seven continental\nregions, the reconstructed area-weighted average temperature for\n1971\u20132000 was higher than for any other time in nearly 1,400 years,11\nalthough with\nsignificant uncertainty around the central estimate that leads to\nthis conclusion. Recent (up to 2006) 30-year smoothed temperatures\nacross temperate North America (including most of the continental\nUnited States) are similarly reconstructed as the warmest over the\npast 1,500 years12\n(Figure 6.2). Unlike the PAGES 2k seven-continent result mentioned\nabove, this conclusion for North America is robust in relation to\nthe estimated uncertainty range. Reconstruction data since 1500 for\nwestern temperate North America show the same conclusion at the\nannual time scale for 1986\u20132005. This time period and the running\n20-year periods thereafter are warmer than all possible continuous\n20-year sequences in a 1,000-member statistical reconstruction\nensemble.13\n6.1.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.2\nPollen-based temperature reconstruction for temperate North America.\nThe blue curve depicts the pollen-based reconstruction of 30-year\naverages (as anomalies from 1904 to 1980) for the temperate region\n(30\u00b0\u201355\u00b0N, 75\u00b0\u2013130\u00b0W). The red curve shows the corresponding tree\nring-based decadal average reconstruction, which was smoothed and\nused to calibrate the lower-frequency pollen-based estimate. Light\n(medium) blue zones indicate 2 standard error (1 standard error)\nuncertainty estimations associated with each 30-year value. The\nblack curve shows comparably smoothed instrumental temperature\nvalues up to 1980. The dashed black line represents the average\ntemperature anomaly of comparably smoothed instrumental data for\nthe period 2000\u20132006. (Figure source: NOAA NCEI).\nShifts in temperature extremes are examined using a suite of\nsocietally relevant climate change indices14\n,15\nderived from long-term\nobservations of daily surface temperature.16\nThe coldest and warmest\ntemperatures of the year are of particular relevance given their\nwidespread use in engineering, agricultural, and other sectoral\napplications (for example, extreme annual design conditions by the\nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning;\nplant hardiness zones by the U.S. Department of Agriculture). Cold\nwaves and heat waves (that is, extended periods of below or above\nnormal temperature) are likewise of great importance because of\ntheir numerous societal and environmental impacts, which span from\nhuman health to plant and animal phenology. Changes are considered\nfor a spectrum of event frequencies and intensities, ranging from\nthe typical annual extreme to the 1-in-10 year event (an extreme\nthat only has a 10% chance of occurrence in any given year). The\ndiscussion focuses on the contiguous United States; Alaska, Hawai\u2018i,\nand the Caribbean do not have a sufficient number of long-term\nstations for a century-scale analysis.\nCold extremes have become less severe over the past century. For\nexample, the coldest daily temperature of the year has increased\nat most locations in the contiguous United States (Figure 6.3). All\nregions experienced net increases (Table 6.2), with the largest\nrises in the Northern Great Plains and the Northwest (roughly 4.5\u00b0F\n[2.5\u00b0C]), and the smallest in the Southeast (about 1.0\u00b0F [0.6\u00b0C]).\nIn general, there were increases throughout the record, with a\nslight acceleration in recent decades (Figure 6.3). The temperature\nof extremely cold days (1-in-10 year events) generally exhibited\nthe same pattern of increases as the coldest daily temperature of\nthe year. Consistent with these increases, the number of cool nights\nper year (those with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile\nfor 1961\u20131990) declined in all regions, with much of the West having\ndecreases of roughly two weeks. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile for\n1961\u20131990) has fallen over the past century (Figure 6.4). The\nfrequency of intense cold waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) peaked\nin the 1980s and then reached record-low levels in the 2000s.17\nFigure 6.3\nObserved changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures (\u00b0F) of the year in the contiguous United States.\nMaps (top) depict changes at stations; changes are the difference between the average for present-day (1986\u20132016)\nand the average for the first half of the last century (1901\u20131960). Time series (bottom) depict the area-weighted\naverage for the contiguous United States. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with minimal missing data\nin the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily dataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nFigure 6.4\nObserved changes in cold and heat waves in the contiguous United States. The top panel depicts changes\nin the frequency of cold waves; the middle panel depicts changes in the frequency of heat waves; and the\nbottom panel depicts changes in the intensity of heat waves. Cold and heat wave frequency indices are\ndefined in Zhang et al.,15\nand the heat wave\nintensity index is defined in Russo et al.14\nEstimates are\nderived from long-term stations with minimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in warm extremes are more nuanced than changes in cold\nextremes. For instance, the warmest daily temperature of the year\nincreased in some parts of the West over the past century (Figure\n6.3), but there were decreases in almost all locations east of the\nRocky Mountains. In fact, all eastern regions experienced a net\ndecrease (Table 6.2), most notably the Midwest (about 2.2\u00b0F [1.2\u00b0C])\nand the Southeast (roughly 1.5\u00b0F [0.8\u00b0C]). The decreases in the\neastern half of Nation, particularly in the Great Plains, are mainly\ntied to the unprecedented summer heat of the 1930s Dust Bowl era,\nwhich was exacerbated by land-surface feedbacks driven by springtime\nprecipitation deficits and land mismanagement.18\nHowever, anthropogenic\naerosol forcing may also have reduced summer temperatures in the\nNortheast and Southeast from the early 1950s to the mid-1970s,19\nand agricultural\nintensification may have suppressed the hottest extremes in the\nMidwest.20\nSince the mid-1960s, there has been only a very slight increase in\nthe warmest daily temperature of the year (amidst large interannual\nvariability). Heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile for 1961\u20131990) increased in frequency\nuntil the mid-1930s, became considerably less common through the\nmid-1960s, and increased in frequency again thereafter (Figure 6.4).\nAs with warm daily temperatures, heat wave magnitude reached a\nmaximum in the 1930s. The frequency of intense heat waves (4-day,\n1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most\nregions except the Midwest and the Great Plains.17\n,21\nSince the early 1980s\n(Figure 6.4), there is suggestive evidence of a slight increase in\nthe intensity of heat waves nationwide14\nas well as an increase\nin the concurrence of droughts and heat waves.22\nFigure 6.5\nObserved changes in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures\nin the contiguous United States. Red bars indicate a year with more\ndaily record highs than daily record lows, while blue bars indicate\na year with more record lows than highs. The height of the bar\nindicates the ratio of record highs to lows (red) or of record lows\nto highs (blue). For example, a ratio of 2:1 for a blue bar means\nthat there were twice as many record daily lows as daily record\nhighs that year. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with\nminimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures are\nalso apparent. Very generally, the number of record lows has been\ndeclining since the late-1970s while the number of record highs has\nbeen rising.23\nBy extension, there has been an increase in the ratio of the\nnumber of record highs to record lows (Figure 6.5). Over the past\ntwo decades, the average of this ratio exceeds two (meaning that\ntwice as many high-temperature records have been set as low-temperature\nrecords). The number of new highs has surpassed the number of new\nlows in 15 of the last 20 years, with 2012 and 2016 being particularly\nextreme (ratios of seven and five, respectively).\n6.2: Detection and Attribution\n6.2.1\nAverage Temperatures\nWhile a confident attribution of global temperature increases to\nanthropogenic forcing has been made,24\ndetection and attribution\nassessment statements for smaller regions are generally much weaker.\nNevertheless, some detectable anthropogenic influences on average\ntemperature have been reported for North America and parts of the\nUnited States (e.g., Christidis et al. 2010;25\nBonfils et al. 2008;26\nPierce et al.\n200927\n).\nFigure 6.6 shows an example for linear trends for 1901\u20132015,\nindicating a detectable anthropogenic warming since 1901 over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States for\nthe CMIP5 multimodel ensemble\u2014a condition that was also met for\nmost of the individual models.28\nThe Southeast stands out\nas the only region with no \u201cdetectable\u201d warming since 1901; observed\ntrends there were inconsistent with CMIP5 All Forcing historical\nruns.28\nThe\ncause of this \u201cwarming hole,\u201d or lack of a long-term warming trend,\nremains uncertain, though it is likely a combination of natural and\nhuman causes. Some studies conclude that changes in anthropogenic\naerosols have played a crucial role (e.g., Leibensperger et al.\n2012a,b;29\n,30\nYu et al. 201431\n), whereas other studies infer a possible large role for atmospheric\ncirculation,32\ninternal climate variability (e.g., Meehl et al. 2012;8\nKnutson et al.\n2013a28\n), and\nchanges in land use (e.g., Goldstein et al. 2009;33\nXu et al. 201534\n). Notably, the\nSoutheast has been warming rapidly since the early 1960s.35\n,36\nIn summary, there\nis medium confidence for detectable anthropogenic warming over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States.\nFigure 6.6\nDetection and attribution assessment of trends in annual average\ntemperature (\u00b0F). Grid-box values indicate whether linear trends\nfor 1901\u20132015 are detectable (that is, distinct from natural\nvariability) and/or consistent with CMIP5 historical All-Forcing\nruns. If the grid-box trend is found to be both detectable and\neither consistent with or greater than the warming in the All-Forcing\nruns, then the grid box is assessed as having a detectable anthropogenic\ncontribution to warming over the period. Gray regions represent\ngrid boxes with data that are too sparse for detection and attribution.\n(Figure source: updated from Knutson et al. 2013;28\n\u00a9 American Meteorological\nSociety. Used with permission.)\n6.2.2\nTemperature Extremes\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC\u2019s) Fifth\nAssessment Report (AR5)24\nconcluded that it is very likely that human influence has\ncontributed to the observed changes in frequency and intensity of\ntemperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century.\nThe combined influence of anthropogenic and natural forcings was\nalso detectable (medium confidence) over large subregions of North\nAmerica (e.g., Zwiers et al. 2011;37\nMin et al. 201338\n). In general,\nhowever, results for the contiguous United States are not as\ncompelling as for global land areas, in part because detection of\nchanges in U.S. regional temperature extremes is affected by extreme\ntemperature in the 1930s.17\nTable 6.3 summarizes\navailable attribution statements for recent extreme U.S. temperature\nevents. As an example, the recent record or near-record high March\u2013May\naverage temperatures occurring in 2012 over the eastern United\nStates were attributed in part to external (natural plus anthropogenic)\nforcing;39\nthe century-scale trend response of temperature to external forcing\nis typically a close approximation to the anthropogenic forcing\nresponse alone. Another study found that although the extreme March\n2012 warm anomalies over the United States were mostly due to natural\nvariability, anthropogenic warming contributed to the severity.40\nSuch statements\nreveal that both natural and anthropogenic factors influence the\nseverity of extreme temperature events. Nearly every modern analysis\nof current extreme hot and cold events reveals some degree of\nattributable human influence.\n6.3: Projected Changes\n6.3.1 Average Temperatures\nTemperature projections are based on global model results and\nassociated downscaled products from CMIP5 using a suite of\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). In contrast to NCA3,\nmodel weighting is employed to refine projections of temperature\nfor each RCP (Ch. 4: Projections; Appendix B: Model Weighting).\nWeighting parameters are based on model independence and skill over\nNorth America for seasonal temperature and annual extremes. Unless\nstated otherwise, all changes presented here represent the weighted\nmultimodel mean. The weighting scheme helps refine confidence and\nlikelihood statements, but projections of U.S. surface air temperature\nremain very similar to those in NCA3. Generally speaking, extreme\ntemperatures are projected to increase even more than average\ntemperatures.41\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States is\nprojected to rise throughout the century. Increases for the period\n2021\u20132050 relative to 1976\u20132005 are projected to be about 2.5\u00b0F\n(1.4\u00b0C) for a lower scenario (RCP4.5) and 2.9\u00b0F (1.6\u00b0C) for the\nhigher scenario (RCP8.5); the similarity in warming reflects the\nsimilarity in greenhouse gas concentrations during this period\n(Figure 4.1). Notably, a 2.5\u00b0F (1.4\u00b0C) increase makes the near-term\naverage comparable to the hottest year in the historical record\n(2012). In other words, recent record-breaking years may be \u201ccommon\u201d\nin the next few decades. By late-century (2071\u20132100), the RCPs\ndiverge significantly, leading to different rates of warming:\napproximately 5.0\u00b0F (2.8\u00b0C) for RCP4.5 and 8.7\u00b0F (4.8\u00b0C) for RCP8.5.\nLikewise, there are different ranges of warming for each scenario:\n2.8\u00b0\u20137.3\u00b0F (1.6\u00b0\u20134.1\u00b0C) for RCP4.5 and 5.8\u00b0\u201311.9\u00b0F (3.2\u00b0\u20136.6\u00b0C) for\nRCP8.5. (The range is defined here as the difference between the\naverage increase in the three coolest models and the average increase\nin the three warmest models.) For both RCPs, slightly greater\nincreases are projected in summer than winter (except for Alaska),\nand average maximums will rise slightly faster than average minimums\n(except in the Southeast and Southern Great Plains).\nFigure 6.7\nProjected changes in annual average temperatures (\u00b0F). Changes are\nthe difference between the average for mid-century (2036\u20132065; top)\nor late-century (2070-2099, bottom) and the average for near-present\n(1976\u20132005). Each map depicts the weighted multimodel mean. Increases\nare statistically significant in all areas (that is, more than 50%\nof the models show a statistically significant change, and more\nthan 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nStatistically significant warming is projected for all parts of the\nUnited States throughout the century (Figure 6.7). Consistent with\npolar amplification, warming rates (and spatial gradients) are\ngreater at higher latitudes. For example, warming is largest in\nAlaska (more than 12.0\u00b0F [6.7\u00b0C] in the northern half of the state\nby late-century under RCP8.5), driven in part by a decrease in snow\ncover and thus surface albedo. Similarly, northern regions of the\ncontiguous United States have slightly more warming than other\nregions (roughly 9.0\u00b0F [5.5\u00b0C] in the Northeast, Midwest, and\nNorthern Great Plains by late-century under RCP8.5; Table 6.4). The\nSoutheast has slightly less warming because of latent heat release\nfrom increases in evapotranspiration (as is already evident in the\nobserved record). Warming is smallest in Hawai\u2018i and the Caribbean\n(roughly 4.0\u00b0\u20136.0\u00b0F [2.2\u00b0\u20133.3\u00b0C] by late century under RCP8.5)\ndue to the moderating effects of surrounding oceans. From a\nsub-regional perspective, less warming is projected along the coasts\nof the contiguous United States, again due to maritime influences,\nalthough increases are still substantial. Warming at higher elevations\nmay be underestimated because the resolution of the CMIP5 models\ndoes not capture orography in detail.\nRCP4.5\nMid-Century\n(2036\u20132065)\nRCP8.5\nMid-Century\n(2036\u20132065)\nRCP4.5\nLate-Century\n(2071\u20132100)\nRCP8.5\nLate-Century\n(2071\u20132100)\n6.3.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.8\nProjected changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures\n(\u00b0F) of the year in the contiguous United States. Changes are the\ndifference between the average for mid-century (2036\u20132065) and the\naverage for near-present (1976\u20132005) under the higher scenario\n(RCP8.5). Maps in the top row depict the weighted multimodel mean\nwhereas maps on the bottom row depict the mean of the three warmest\nmodels (that is, the models with the largest temperature increase).\nMaps are derived from 32 climate model projections that were\nstatistically downscaled using the Localized Constructed Analogs\ntechnique.51\nIncreases are\nstatistically significant in all areas (that is\u00ad\u00ad,\nmore than 50% of the models show a statistically significant change,\nand more than 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nDaily extreme temperatures are projected to increase substantially\nin the contiguous United States, particularly under the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5). For instance, the coldest and warmest daily\ntemperatures of the year are expected to increase at least 5\u00b0F\n(2.8\u00b0C) in most areas by mid-century,42\nrising to 10\u00b0F (5.5\u00b0C)\nor more by late-century.43\nIn general, there will\nbe larger increases in the coldest temperatures of the year,\nespecially in the northern half of the Nation, whereas the warmest\ntemperatures will exhibit somewhat more uniform changes geographically\n(Figure 6.8). By mid-century, the upper bound for projected changes\n(i.e., the average of the three warmest models) is about 2\u00b0F (1.1\u00b0C)\ngreater than the weighted multimodel mean. On a regional basis,\nannual extremes (Table 6.5) are consistently projected to rise\nfaster than annual averages (Table 6.4). Future changes in \u201cvery\nrare\u201d extremes are also striking; by late century, current 1-in-20\nyear maximums are projected to occur every year, while current\n1-in-20 year minimums are not expected to occur at all.44\nThe frequency and intensity of cold waves is projected to decrease\nwhile the frequency and intensity of heat waves is projected to\nincrease throughout the century. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile) will\ndecrease the most in Alaska and the least in the Northeast while\nthe frequency of heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile) will increase in all regions, particularly\nthe Southeast, Southwest, and Alaska. By mid-century, decreases in\nthe frequency of cold waves are similar across RCPs whereas increases\nin the frequency of heat waves are about 50% greater in the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5) than the lower scenario (RCP4.5).45\nThe intensity of cold\nwaves is projected to decrease while the intensity of heat waves\nis projected to increase, dramatically so under RCP8.5. By mid-century,\nboth extreme cold waves and extreme heat waves (5-day, 1-in-10 year\nevents) are projected to have temperature increases of at least\n11.0\u00b0F (6.1\u00b0C) nationwide, with larger increases in northern regions\n(the Northeast, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, and Northwest; Table\n6.5).\nFigure 6.9\nProjected changes in the number of days per year with a maximum\ntemperature above 90\u00b0F and a minimum temperature below 32\u00b0F in the\ncontiguous United States. Changes are the difference between the\naverage for mid-century (2036\u20132065) and the average for near-present\n(1976\u20132005) under the higher scenario (RCP8.5). Maps in the top row\ndepict the weighted multimodel mean whereas maps on the bottom row\ndepict the mean of the three warmest models (that is, the models\nwith the largest temperature increase). Maps are derived from 32\nclimate model projections that were statistically downscaled using\nthe Localized Constructed Analogs technique.51\nChanges are statistically\nsignificant in all areas (that is, more than 50% of the models show\na statistically significant change, and more than 67% agree on the\nsign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC and NOAA NCEI).\nThere are large projected changes in the number of days exceeding\nkey temperature thresholds throughout the contiguous United States.\nFor instance, there are about 20\u201330 more days per year with a maximum\nover 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) in most areas by mid-century under RCP8.5, with\nincreases of 40\u201350 days in much of the Southeast (Figure 6.9). The\nupper bound for projected changes is very roughly 10 days greater\nthan the weighted multimodel mean. Consistent with widespread\nwarming, there are 20\u201330 fewer days per year with a minimum temperature\nbelow freezing in the northern and eastern parts of the nation,\nwith decreases of more than 40\u201350 days in much the West. The upper\nbound for projected changes in freezing events is very roughly 10\u201320\ndays fewer than the weighted multimodel mean in many areas.\nReferences\nModal\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n1800 G Street, NW, Suite 9100, Washington, DC 20006 USA\nTel: +1 202.223.6262 | Fax: +1 202.223.3065\nContact Us \u2022\nCredits \u2022\nPrivacy Policy \u2022\nSite Map\nSome figures and images are copyright protected.\nPermission of the copyright owner must be obtained\nbefore making use of copyrighted material.",

    "document": "Effects of Climate Change on Water Resources\nGlobal Climate Change And Precipitation\nModels of climate change (GCMs) predict U.S. annual-mean temperatures to generally rise by 2\u00b0 C to 3\u00b0 C over the next 100 years, with greater increases in northern regions (5\u00b0 C), and northern Alaska (10\u00b0 C). Numerous other climatic effects are also expected. For example, U.S. precipitation, which increased by 5 to 10% over the 20th century, is predicted to continue to increase overall. More specifically, an ensemble of GCMs predicts a 20% increase for northern North America, a 15% increase in winter precipitation for northwestern regions, and a general increase in winter precipitation for central and eastern regions. Despite predictions of increased precipitation in most regions, net decreases in water availability are expected in those areas, due to offsetting increases in evaporation. A 20% decrease in summer precipitation, for example, is projected for southwestern regions, and a general decrease in summer precipitation is projected for southern areas. Although projected regional impacts of climate change are highly variable between models, the above impacts are consistent across models. \nGlobal Climate Change And Water Resources\nAdditional effects of global climate change that have important implications for water resources include increased evaporation rates, a higher proportion of precipitation received as rain, rather than snow, earlier and shorter runoff seasons, increased water temperatures, and decreased water quality in both inland and coastal areas. The physical and economic consequences of each of these effects are discussed below. \nIncreased evaporation rates are expected to reduce water supplies in many regions. The greatest deficits are expected to occur in the summer, leading to decreased soil moisture levels and more frequent and severe agricultural drought. More frequent and severe droughts arising from climate change will have serious management implications for water resource users. Agricultural producers and urban areas are particularly vulnerable, as evidenced by recent prolonged droughts in the western and southern United States, which are estimated to have caused over $6  billion in damages to the agricultural and municipal sectors. Such droughts also impose costs in terms of wildfires, both in terms of control costs and lost timber and related resources.\nWater users will eventually adapt to more frequent and severe droughts, in part by shifting limited water supplies towards higher-value uses. Such shifts could be from low- to high-value crops, or from agricultural and industrial to environmental and municipal uses. A period of delay is likely, however, because gradual changes in the frequency and severity of drought will be difficult to distinguish from normal inter-annual variations in precipitation. Economic losses will be larger during this period of delay, as compared to a world with instantaneous adjustment, but preemptive adaptation could also be costly given the uncertainty surrounding future climate. \nRising surface temperatures are expected to increase the proportion of winter precipitation received as rain, with a declining proportion arriving in the form of snow. Snow pack levels are also expected to form later in the winter, accumulate in smaller quantities, and melt earlier in the season, leading to reduced summer flows. Such shifts in the form and timing of precipitation and runoff, specifically in snow-fed basins, are likely to cause more frequent summer droughts. Research shows that these changes are already taking place in the western United States. Changes in snow pack and runoff are of concern to water managers in a number of settings, including hydropower generation, irrigated agriculture, urban water supply, flood protection and commercial and recreational fishing. Timing of runoff will affect the value of hydropower potential in some basins if peak water run-off occurs during nonpeak electricity demand. Energy shortages and resulting energy price increases will provide incentives to expand reservoir capacities or develop alternative energy sources. \nIf the runoff season occurs primarily in winter and early spring, rather than late spring and summer, water availability for summer-irrigated crops will decline, and water shortages  will occur earlier in the growing season, particularly in watersheds that lack large reservoirs. Agricultural producers, in response to reduced water supplies and crop yields, will adjust their crop mix. Producers in irrigated regions might reduce total planted acreage, or deficit-irrigate more acres, to concentrate limited water supplies on their most valuable crops (e.g. onions and potatoes, rather than wheat and alfalfa). Producers in rain-fed regions might shift to crop species and varieties with shorter growing season requirements or greater drought tolerance, such as winter grains. \nCropping practices are likely to shift as well, perhaps towards reduced- or no-till technologies, which enhance water infiltration and conserve soil moisture, or towards irrigation technologies that are more efficient at the farm level (although not necessarily at the basin level). Producers may begin to supplement dwindling surface water supplies with groundwater resources, a response that has already been observed in many drought-stricken areas. These adjustments will mitigate a portion of private economic losses. They will also affect environmental quality, although the expected direction is more difficult to predict. \nA shift in stream hydrographs to more winter flow may also disrupt the life cycle of cold water fish species, such as salmon, which depend on late spring flows to \u0093flush\u0094 young salmon to the ocean, and on summer flows to moderate water temperatures. Unless winter runoff is captured and stored for late spring or summer use, fewer salmon smolt will survive migration and more frequent fish kills will occur from lethal stream water temperatures. Such environmental impacts will intensify debates about consumptive versus instream water uses, such as those ongoing in the Klamath and Platte River Basins. \nClimate change is expected to affect water quality in both inland and coastal areas. Specifically, precipitation is expected to occur more frequently via high-intensity rainfall events, causing increased runoff and erosion. More sediments and chemical runoff will therefore be transported into streams and groundwater systems, impairing water quality. Water quality may be further impaired if decreases in water supply cause nutrients and contaminants to become more concentrated.  Rising air and water temperatures will also impact water quality by increasing primary production, organic matter decomposition, and nutrient cycling rates in lakes and streams, resulting in lower dissolved oxygen levels.  Lakes and wetlands associated with return flows from irrigated agriculture are of particular concern. This suite of water quality effects will increase the number of water bodies in violation of today\u0092s water quality standards, worsen the quality of water bodies that are currently in violation, and ultimately increase the cost of meeting current water quality goals for both consumptive and environmental purposes.  \nRising sea levels could also reduce water quality and availability in coastal areas. Recent projections of sea-level rise by the end of the 21st century range from 19 to 58 cm. A more dramatic increase in sea-level, on the order of meters rather than centimeters, is possible, but most scientists consider it a low probability risk. For example, complete melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet or West Antarctic Ice Sheet would trigger such a large rise. Rising sea levels could affect groundwater quality directly via saltwater intrusion. Radical changes to the freshwater hydrology of coastal areas, caused by saltwater intrusion, would threaten many coastal regions\u0092 freshwater supplies. \nRising sea levels could also affect water availability in coastal areas indirectly by causing water tables in groundwater aquifers to rise, which could increase surface runoff at the expense of aquifer recharge. Water shortages will cause the price of water to rise, through monthly water bills or one-time connection fees for new homes and businesses. A sufficiently large price increase could affect the extent and pattern of urban growth throughout the United States. Costly water supply projects, such as desalination plants, pipelines, and dams will also become more economically attractive. \nOne final and important effect of the water resource impacts discussed above is the potential for more frequent and intense interstate and international water allocation conflicts. Water markets have the potential to prevent or diffuse such conflicts; however, the assignment of water rights to establish the market can create more conflict than it diffuses.\nCoping With Changing Water Resources\nAlthough subject to uncertainty, forecasts of climatic change offer a glimpse into possible future water resource impacts and challenges. Predicted impacts vary by region, but include increased temperatures and evaporation rates; higher proportions of winter precipitation arriving as rain, not snow; earlier and more severe summer drought, and decreased water quality. Water shortages, which currently result in substantial economics losses, will be more common in many regions because of these impacts. Such economic losses, which occur across a range of sectors, from agriculture to energy and recreation, have profound effects on local communities. More frequent shortages imply increased costs to society, although adaptation by water users will mitigate some portion of these costs. \nWater resource users can reduce the negative effects of water shortages through a number of strategies. These include revising water storage and release programs for reservoirs, adopting crops and cropping practices that are robust over a wider spectrum of water availability, expanding and adjusting crop insurance programs (such as the Multi-Peril Crop Insurance program\u0092s Prevented Planting Provision), adjusting water prices to encourage conservation and the expansion of water supply infrastructure, and supporting water transfer opportunities. Damage from drought-induced wildfires can be minimized by using long range soil moisture forecasts to pre-position fire suppression resources and in the longer term, by changing land-use regulations to restrict development in areas facing increased fire risk.\nThe ability to anticipate and efficiently prepare for future water resource management challenges is currently limited, in part, by imprecise regional climate change models and long-term weather forecasts. Uncertainty about future climate conditions makes it more difficult to optimally prepare for and adapt to associated changes in water resource availability and quality. Imagine, for example, trying to prepare optimally for a water shortage when you are uncertain of when it will occur, how severe it will be, or how long it will persist. It may be tempting to make management plans based on the worst-case scenario; however, the opportunity cost of this \u0093safety-first\u0094 approach can be high if the worst-case does not occur. Imperfect information ultimately increases the magnitude of economic losses (or reduce the magnitude of any potential economic gains) attributable to water resource changes. \nImprovements in climate projections and long-term weather forecasts, such as forecasts based on the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO), offer potential for reducing economic losses (or increasing economic gains) associated with climate change. More specifically, improvements in the ability to detect water shortages farther in advance, to more precisely forecast their location, intensity, and duration, and to use such forecasts to inform management strategies would enhance water users\u0092 confidence in regional forecasts, and their ability to efficiently prepare for and adapt to future water resource management challenges.\nFor More Information\nAdams, R.M  and D.

    "document": "Phoenix and Maricopa County on track to count fewer heat deaths for first time in a decade\nMaricopa County's medical examiner isn't quite done counting heat-related deaths for 2024, but the Department of Public Health told The Arizona Republic this week the totals are likely to come in under that for 2023. It would be the first year in a decade when the number has not increased.\nIn 2023, 645 people died from factors related to environmental heat in Arizona's most populous county, with a majority of those cases determined to have been directly caused by heat. That staggering death toll, which drew international attention to metro Phoenix's record-breaking temperatures due to climate change and urban development, was a 52% increase over the previous year, which was a 25% jump compared to the year before that.\nLast year's heat mortality count was also nearly an eightfold increase over the 84 heat-related deaths in 2015.\n\"This is not yet absolute by any means, but about 75% of the cases that are under investigation are what we estimate will likely be confirmed,\" Dr. Nick Staab, a medical epidemiologist and assistant medical director for the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, told The Republic Tuesday. \"With our update today, that would be around 609 cases, which would be less than the 645 from last year.\"\nThe medical examiner's office changed protocols for flagging deaths under investigation as potentially heat-related in 2023 to address process oversights that may have resulted in undercounts for previous years. But \"nothing has changed for counts of confirmed heat-related deaths,\" chief medical examiner Dr. Jeff Johnston told The Republic on Wednesday, adding that \"comparisons of annual counts of heat-related deaths are reliable and should be comparable to other jurisdictions who are medically investigating such deaths.\"\nThe protocol change reflects a growing awareness nationwide of the deadly consequences of worsening extreme heat. In 2017, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a guidance toolkit for disaster-related medical death investigations that included a form and checklist for heat wave disasters. As some of the hottest urban areas in the country, Maricopa and Pima Counties were already ahead of the curve on these efforts at that point, Johnston said.\nThe CDC still \"does not have any real-time surveillance protocols that we are aware of for such investigations,\" he said, but the agency has praised Maricopa County's heat surveillance efforts, which have helped guide practices in other regions dealing with dangerously rising temperatures, including Miami-Dade County, FL; Harris County, TX; King County, WA; the state of Louisiana; and most recently Los Angeles County.\nMore:In Arizona, a generation fears uncertainties in abortion access and climate action\nThe fact that an increased focus on considering environmental temperatures in death investigations may be offset by fewer heat-caused cases this year also suggests that local programs aimed at stemming health impacts to Arizonans from extreme heat might be working. If the 2024 heat death total bends the skyrocketing trend from recent years downward, as Staab expects, even with changes that might result in more deaths being attributed to heat over the past two years than in previous assessments, it will signify a needed shift many years in the making.\n\u201cThere has been some reporting that maybe we were ahead of last year\u2019s numbers and really we think we will end up very close to last year\u2019s numbers, and maybe just under,\" Staab said. \"We\u2019re at a point where we feel like what we\u2019re doing in public health is working because we\u2019ve all seen in the last couple of years this kind of persistent climb upwards. We really want to see that number significantly lower because, as we have always said, we do believe all these deaths are preventable.\"\nPhoenix cites 20% fewer heat-related illness emergency calls in 2024\nThough Phoenix officials also do not yet have a confirmed 2024 heat-related death count, they, too, cited measurable progress this week on addressing the human toll of extreme heat.\n\"When we look at the number of heat-related emergencies that our firefighters are dealing with, we saw a 20% reduction when compared to the same period last year,\" Phoenix's executive assistant fire chief Tim Kreis told reporters at a news briefing Thursday.\nEven with that decrease, firefighters still responded to 1,416 heat-related calls for service between May 1 and October 1, during which time fire and emergency management staff used ice-filled cooling bags to quickly reduce dangerously high body temperatures of patients more than 300 times.\nSo far in 2024, the county medical examiner has determined that 240 people died from heat-related causes within Phoenix city limits, 83% of whom were exposed to dangerous temperatures outdoors. In 2023, a total of 340 people succumbed to heat in Phoenix, with 79% of cases originating in outdoor settings.\nThe slight drop in likely totals for 2024 and shift to outdoor risks highlights both Phoenix's challenges with keeping its large unhoused population safe from extreme heat and its successes in making some headway indoors. Access to cooled spaces for unhoused people and programs to check on indoor residents who may be at risk of heat impacts, like elderly and low-income families who may not have or use air conditioning at home, seem to be helping.\nDave Hondula, who directs Phoenix\u2019s Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, told The Republic last year that he makes many of the calls to check on vulnerable residents signed up with the city's \"Cool Callers\" program during heat waves himself. He attributed this year's incremental gains to improved coordination between members of the county's regional Heat Relief Network. One stat he shared Thursday was that his office had distributed one million water bottles to network partners this summer to facilitate regional cooling hydration.\n\u201cAlthough we had a record number of heat records this summer, I\u2019m very confident there\u2019s been a significant and positive public health impact from this heat relief work,\" Hondula said Thursday. \"Lives were saved and lives were changed.\u201d\u00a0\nMore:In a heat wave, some people wait too long to turn on the AC. Smart data use could help\nMayor Kate Gallego also attributed progress on heat initiatives to collaborative action between Hondula's team and the city's Offices of Homeless Solutions, Public Health, Emergency Management and the Fire Department.\nThis year, these efforts included: expanding a network of more than sixty cooling centers and hydration stations; extending hours at certain respite centers to include overnight access; providing transitional shelter space cooled using solar-generated power; the phased opening of the new \"Phoenix Navigation Center\" homeless shelter that was controversial with nearby residents; and managing the \"Safe Outdoor Space\" campground with basic services.\nIn March, the Phoenix City Council passed an ordinance to shield city-contracted workers from extreme heat, in contrast with delayed action on worker protections by the state and nationwide. Throughout the summer, the city also distributed heat relief supplies and grant funding originating from $1.8 million in federal funds from the American Rescue Plan Act, $500,000 from the state and $1.6 million from the county, Gallego said on Thursday.\nMore:Arizona workers one step closer to extreme heat protections with proposed Biden rules\n'The weather is not working in our favor'\nAmid these indications of progress, speakers at Thursday's city news briefing and at the Maricopa County Department of Public Health underscored that more must be done to address the hundreds of preventable heat deaths that occur locally each year.\n\u201cAcross our state, we have to treat extreme heat as a public health hazard, just like other states and communities have to prepare for harsh weather such as blizzards, hurricanes, and flooding,\u201d Gallego said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we need other levels of government to provide additional resources and support to this cause. Our summers are only growing hotter and more intense, and it\u2019s past due that we treat heat like the emergency it is.\u201d \u00a0\nOne way this must happen, scientists say, is through action to address the warming influences of climate change. Burning fossil fuels for energy releases molecules into the air known as greenhouse gases, the most common of which is carbon dioxide. There, they absorb heat from the sun and alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere, which scientists have consistently concluded leads directly to more chaotic and extreme storms, drought and heat waves.\nThe destruction wrought by the most major of these \"not-so-natural\" disasters has already cost the American economy more than $61 billion in 2024, a figure that doesn't include extreme heat events and may triple after the price tags of supercharged Hurricanes Helene and Milton are confirmed. Grocery bills are also spiking in response to crop losses caused by drought and rising temperatures.\nA climate action progress report recently published by Gallego's team tracks Phoenix's recent efforts to address this root cause. But the global problem is exacerbated by other leaders, like members of the Arizona Legislature who have not engaged with climate-based solutions to heat illness and inflation. The most obvious of those solutions, experts say, is to shift energy use to clean and renewable sources. In the past two years, Arizona's solar, battery storage and electric vehicle industries have leveraged nearly $12 billion in investments and more than 18,000 jobs facilitated by President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act toward this goal, though increases in energy demand threaten overall progress.\nMore:In its first climate plan report card, Phoenix claims some progress, with work still to do\nPolitics could also play a role in how Maricopa County's scientists are able to track and study the environmental causes of local heat-related deaths. Staab of the County's Public Health Department told The Republic that insight into heat health impacts has benefitted from the use of publicly available data from the National Weather Service.\n\u201cWith data sources expanding so much, our (epidemiologists) are looking at National Weather Service data and all sorts of stuff to bring into our analysis and that power communicating it out,\" Staab said.\nThat data source has been targeted by the Project 2025 agenda for a second Donald Trump administration. While Trump has distanced himself from this 900-page plan to dismantle many federal and scientific agencies and environmental protections, its creation by members of his prior administration leads many to believe he would enact many of its suggestions, complicating Arizona's efforts to study and address heat-caused deaths.\n\u201cThere is an obvious benefit to having a public, reliable National Weather Service that is funded collectively by taxpayer dollars,\" David Kieve, president of Environmental Defense Fund Action, told The Republic in August. \"The idea that you\u2019re going to privatize that and it will run better as a private business, that\u2019s not going to work. And it\u2019s not going to work for Arizonans at a time when we\u2019re seeing a rising number of extraordinarily hot days.\"\nMore:Climate was barely mentioned in the debate, but Harris and Trump showed wide differences\nRising average temperatures and increasingly frequent extreme heat waves are, Staab also noted, not the only contributors to deaths coded by the medical examiner as heat-related. Drug use, particularly meth, is a growing problem in Phoenix and can \"shut down the body's heat defense system,\" according to reporting by The Republic this summer.\n\u201cWe continue to see a lot of our heat-related deaths amongst those who are unsheltered and those who are using substances, whether that\u2019s drugs or alcohol,\" Staab said. \"As we move forward in our efforts to reach these individuals, we need to focus on partnering with community-based organizations working with those high-risk communities.\"\nAt Thursday's heat relief briefing, Rachel Milne, director of Phoenix's Office of Homeless Solutions, highlighted efforts the city has made to \"help individuals connect with resources beyond heat relief, like housing or shelter.\" Data from the Heat Relief Network showed that 92% of more than 35,000 visitors to cooling centers during summer 2024 reported they were experiencing homelessness. More than 1,000 of them then received direct onsite assistance from Community Bridges Inc, a partner organization working with Milne.\nRead our climate series:The latest from Joan Meiners at azcentral on climate change\nBut while the progress made in 2024 to reduce preventable heat deaths \u2014 through the smart use of data sources, the application of federal, state and county funding, the body bags of ice, the heat-aware changes to medical examining protocols and more \u2014 is promising and inspiring and likely saved lives, innumerable more water bottles, cooling centers and heat ordinances may be needed if climate change is not brought under control.\n\u201cThe weather is not working in our favor,\u201d Staab said.\nJoan Meiners is the climate news and storytelling reporter at The Arizona Republic and\u00a0azcentral.com.

See Guide to this Report for more on\nassessments of likelihood and confidence.\n6.0: Introduction\nTemperature is among the most important climatic elements used in\ndecision-making. For example, builders and insurers use temperature\ndata for planning and risk management while energy companies and\nregulators use temperature data to predict demand and set utility\nrates. Temperature is also a key indicator of climate change: recent\nincreases are apparent over the land, ocean, and troposphere, and\nsubstantial changes are expected for this century. This chapter\nsummarizes the major observed and projected changes in near-surface\nair temperature over the United States, emphasizing new data sets\nand model projections since the Third National Climate Assessment\n(NCA3). Changes are depicted using a spectrum of observations,\nincluding surface weather stations, moored ocean buoys, polar-orbiting\nsatellites, and temperature-sensitive proxies. Projections are based\non global models and downscaled products from CMIP5 (Coupled Model\nIntercomparison Project Phase 5) using a suite of Representative\nConcentration Pathways (RCPs; see Ch. 4: Projections for more on\nRCPs and future scenarios).\n6.1: Historical Changes\n6.1.1 Average Temperatures\nChanges in average temperature are described using a suite of\nobservational datasets. As in NCA3, changes in land temperature are\nassessed using the nClimGrid dataset.1\n,2\nAlong U.S. coastlines,\nchanges in sea surface temperatures are quantified using a new\nreconstruction3\nthat forms the ocean component of the NOAA Global Temperature\ndataset.4\nChanges in middle tropospheric temperature are examined using updated\nversions of multiple satellite datasets.5\n,6\n,7\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States has\nrisen since the start of the 20th century. In general, temperature\nincreased until about 1940, decreased until about 1970, and increased\nrapidly through 2016. Because the increase was not constant over\ntime, multiple methods were evaluated in this report (as in NCA3)\nto quantify the trend. All methods yielded rates of warming that\nwere significant at the 95% level. The lowest estimate of 1.2\u00b0F\n(0.7\u00b0C) was obtained by computing the difference between the average\nfor 1986\u20132016 (i.e., present-day) and the average for 1901\u20131960\n(i.e., the first half of the last century). The highest estimate\nof 1.8\u00b0F (1.0\u00b0C) was obtained by fitting a linear (least-squares)\nregression line through the period 1895\u20132016. Thus, the temperature\nincrease cited in this assessment is 1.2\u00b0\u20131.8\u00b0F (0.7\u00b0\u20131.0\u00b0C).\nThis increase is about 0.1\u00b0F (0.06\u00b0C) less than presented in NCA3,\nand it results from the use of slightly different periods in each\nreport. In particular, the decline in the lower bound stems from\nthe use of different time periods to represent present-day climate\n(NCA3 used 1991\u20132012, which was slightly warmer than the 1986\u20132016\nperiod used here). The decline in the upper bound stems mainly from\ntemperature differences late in the record (e.g., the last year of\ndata available for NCA3 was 2012, which was the warmest year on\nrecord for the contiguous United States).\nEach NCA region experienced a net warming through 2016 (Table 6.1).\nThe largest changes were in the western United States, where average\ntemperature increased by more than 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) in Alaska, the\nNorthwest, the Southwest, and also in the Northern Great Plains.\nAs noted in NCA3, the Southeast had the least warming, driven by a\ncombination of natural variations and human influences.8\nIn most regions, average\nminimum temperature increased at a slightly higher rate than average\nmaximum temperature, with the Midwest having the largest discrepancy,\nand the Southwest and Northwest having the smallest. This differential\nrate of warming resulted in a continuing decrease in the diurnal\ntemperature range that is consistent with other parts of the globe.9\nAnnual average\nsea surface temperature also increased along all regional coastlines\n(see Figure 1.3), though changes were generally smaller than over\nland owing to the higher heat capacity of water. Increases were\nlargest in Alaska (greater than 1.0\u00b0F [0.6\u00b0C]) while increases\nwere smallest (less than 0.5\u00b0F [0.3\u00b0C]) in coastal areas of the\nSoutheast.\nMore than 95% of the land surface of the contiguous United States\nhad an increase in annual average temperature (Figure 6.1). In\ncontrast, only small (and somewhat dispersed) parts of the Southeast\nand Southern Great Plains experienced cooling. From a seasonal\nperspective, warming was greatest and most widespread in winter,\nwith increases of over 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) in most areas. In summer,\nwarming was less extensive (mainly along the East Coast and in the\nwestern third of the Nation), while cooling was evident in parts\nof the Southeast, Midwest, and Great Plains.\nFigure 6.1\nObserved changes in annual, winter, and summer temperature (\u00b0F). Changes are the difference\nbetween the average for present-day (1986\u20132016) and the average for the first half of\nthe last century (1901\u20131960 for the contiguous United States, 1925\u20131960 for Alaska and Hawai\u2018i).\nEstimates are derived from the nClimDiv dataset.\n1\n,2\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nThere has been a rapid increase in the average temperature of the\ncontiguous United States over the past several decades. There is\ngeneral consistency on this point between the surface thermometer\nrecord from NOAA1\nand the middle tropospheric satellite records from Remote Sensing\nSystems (RSS),5\nNOAA\u2019s Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR),7\nand the University\nof Alabama in Huntsville (UAH).6\nIn particular, for the\nperiod 1979\u20132016, the rate of warming in the surface record was\n0.512\u00b0F (0.284\u00b0C) per decade, versus trends of 0.455\u00b0F (0.253\u00b0C),\n0.421\u00b0F (0.234\u00b0C), and 0.289\u00b0F (0.160 \u00b0C) per decade for RSS version\n4, STAR version 3, and UAH version 6, respectively (after accounting\nfor stratospheric influences). All trends are statistically significant\nat the 95% level. For the contiguous United States, the year 2016\nwas the second-warmest on record at the surface and in the middle\ntroposphere (2012 was the warmest year at the surface, and 2015 was\nthe warmest in the middle troposphere). Generally speaking, surface\nand satellite records do not have identical trends because they do\nnot represent the same physical quantity; surface measurements are\nmade using thermometers in shelters about 1.5 meters above the\nground whereas satellite measurements are mass-weighted averages\nof microwave emissions from deep atmospheric layers. The UAH record\nlikely has a lower trend because it differs from the other satellite\nproducts in the treatment of target temperatures from the NOAA-9\nsatellite as well as in the correction for diurnal drift.10\nRecent paleo-temperature evidence confirms the unusual character\nof wide-scale warming during the past few decades as determined\nfrom the instrumental record. The most important new paleoclimate\nstudy since NCA3 showed that for each of the seven continental\nregions, the reconstructed area-weighted average temperature for\n1971\u20132000 was higher than for any other time in nearly 1,400 years,11\nalthough with\nsignificant uncertainty around the central estimate that leads to\nthis conclusion. Recent (up to 2006) 30-year smoothed temperatures\nacross temperate North America (including most of the continental\nUnited States) are similarly reconstructed as the warmest over the\npast 1,500 years12\n(Figure 6.2). Unlike the PAGES 2k seven-continent result mentioned\nabove, this conclusion for North America is robust in relation to\nthe estimated uncertainty range. Reconstruction data since 1500 for\nwestern temperate North America show the same conclusion at the\nannual time scale for 1986\u20132005. This time period and the running\n20-year periods thereafter are warmer than all possible continuous\n20-year sequences in a 1,000-member statistical reconstruction\nensemble.13\n6.1.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.2\nPollen-based temperature reconstruction for temperate North America.\nThe blue curve depicts the pollen-based reconstruction of 30-year\naverages (as anomalies from 1904 to 1980) for the temperate region\n(30\u00b0\u201355\u00b0N, 75\u00b0\u2013130\u00b0W). The red curve shows the corresponding tree\nring-based decadal average reconstruction, which was smoothed and\nused to calibrate the lower-frequency pollen-based estimate. Light\n(medium) blue zones indicate 2 standard error (1 standard error)\nuncertainty estimations associated with each 30-year value. The\nblack curve shows comparably smoothed instrumental temperature\nvalues up to 1980. The dashed black line represents the average\ntemperature anomaly of comparably smoothed instrumental data for\nthe period 2000\u20132006. (Figure source: NOAA NCEI).\nShifts in temperature extremes are examined using a suite of\nsocietally relevant climate change indices14\n,15\nderived from long-term\nobservations of daily surface temperature.16\nThe coldest and warmest\ntemperatures of the year are of particular relevance given their\nwidespread use in engineering, agricultural, and other sectoral\napplications (for example, extreme annual design conditions by the\nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning;\nplant hardiness zones by the U.S. Department of Agriculture). Cold\nwaves and heat waves (that is, extended periods of below or above\nnormal temperature) are likewise of great importance because of\ntheir numerous societal and environmental impacts, which span from\nhuman health to plant and animal phenology. Changes are considered\nfor a spectrum of event frequencies and intensities, ranging from\nthe typical annual extreme to the 1-in-10 year event (an extreme\nthat only has a 10% chance of occurrence in any given year). The\ndiscussion focuses on the contiguous United States; Alaska, Hawai\u2018i,\nand the Caribbean do not have a sufficient number of long-term\nstations for a century-scale analysis.\nCold extremes have become less severe over the past century. For\nexample, the coldest daily temperature of the year has increased\nat most locations in the contiguous United States (Figure 6.3). All\nregions experienced net increases (Table 6.2), with the largest\nrises in the Northern Great Plains and the Northwest (roughly 4.5\u00b0F\n[2.5\u00b0C]), and the smallest in the Southeast (about 1.0\u00b0F [0.6\u00b0C]).\nIn general, there were increases throughout the record, with a\nslight acceleration in recent decades (Figure 6.3). The temperature\nof extremely cold days (1-in-10 year events) generally exhibited\nthe same pattern of increases as the coldest daily temperature of\nthe year. Consistent with these increases, the number of cool nights\nper year (those with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile\nfor 1961\u20131990) declined in all regions, with much of the West having\ndecreases of roughly two weeks. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile for\n1961\u20131990) has fallen over the past century (Figure 6.4). The\nfrequency of intense cold waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) peaked\nin the 1980s and then reached record-low levels in the 2000s.17\nFigure 6.3\nObserved changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures (\u00b0F) of the year in the contiguous United States.\nMaps (top) depict changes at stations; changes are the difference between the average for present-day (1986\u20132016)\nand the average for the first half of the last century (1901\u20131960). Time series (bottom) depict the area-weighted\naverage for the contiguous United States. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with minimal missing data\nin the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily dataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nFigure 6.4\nObserved changes in cold and heat waves in the contiguous United States. The top panel depicts changes\nin the frequency of cold waves; the middle panel depicts changes in the frequency of heat waves; and the\nbottom panel depicts changes in the intensity of heat waves. Cold and heat wave frequency indices are\ndefined in Zhang et al.,15\nand the heat wave\nintensity index is defined in Russo et al.14\nEstimates are\nderived from long-term stations with minimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in warm extremes are more nuanced than changes in cold\nextremes. For instance, the warmest daily temperature of the year\nincreased in some parts of the West over the past century (Figure\n6.3), but there were decreases in almost all locations east of the\nRocky Mountains. In fact, all eastern regions experienced a net\ndecrease (Table 6.2), most notably the Midwest (about 2.2\u00b0F [1.2\u00b0C])\nand the Southeast (roughly 1.5\u00b0F [0.8\u00b0C]). The decreases in the\neastern half of Nation, particularly in the Great Plains, are mainly\ntied to the unprecedented summer heat of the 1930s Dust Bowl era,\nwhich was exacerbated by land-surface feedbacks driven by springtime\nprecipitation deficits and land mismanagement.18\nHowever, anthropogenic\naerosol forcing may also have reduced summer temperatures in the\nNortheast and Southeast from the early 1950s to the mid-1970s,19\nand agricultural\nintensification may have suppressed the hottest extremes in the\nMidwest.20\nSince the mid-1960s, there has been only a very slight increase in\nthe warmest daily temperature of the year (amidst large interannual\nvariability). Heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile for 1961\u20131990) increased in frequency\nuntil the mid-1930s, became considerably less common through the\nmid-1960s, and increased in frequency again thereafter (Figure 6.4).\nAs with warm daily temperatures, heat wave magnitude reached a\nmaximum in the 1930s. The frequency of intense heat waves (4-day,\n1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most\nregions except the Midwest and the Great Plains.17\n,21\nSince the early 1980s\n(Figure 6.4), there is suggestive evidence of a slight increase in\nthe intensity of heat waves nationwide14\nas well as an increase\nin the concurrence of droughts and heat waves.22\nFigure 6.5\nObserved changes in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures\nin the contiguous United States. Red bars indicate a year with more\ndaily record highs than daily record lows, while blue bars indicate\na year with more record lows than highs. The height of the bar\nindicates the ratio of record highs to lows (red) or of record lows\nto highs (blue). For example, a ratio of 2:1 for a blue bar means\nthat there were twice as many record daily lows as daily record\nhighs that year. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with\nminimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures are\nalso apparent. Very generally, the number of record lows has been\ndeclining since the late-1970s while the number of record highs has\nbeen rising.23\nBy extension, there has been an increase in the ratio of the\nnumber of record highs to record lows (Figure 6.5). Over the past\ntwo decades, the average of this ratio exceeds two (meaning that\ntwice as many high-temperature records have been set as low-temperature\nrecords). The number of new highs has surpassed the number of new\nlows in 15 of the last 20 years, with 2012 and 2016 being particularly\nextreme (ratios of seven and five, respectively).\n6.2: Detection and Attribution\n6.2.1\nAverage Temperatures\nWhile a confident attribution of global temperature increases to\nanthropogenic forcing has been made,24\ndetection and attribution\nassessment statements for smaller regions are generally much weaker.\nNevertheless, some detectable anthropogenic influences on average\ntemperature have been reported for North America and parts of the\nUnited States (e.g., Christidis et al. 2010;25\nBonfils et al. 2008;26\nPierce et al.\n200927\n).\nFigure 6.6 shows an example for linear trends for 1901\u20132015,\nindicating a detectable anthropogenic warming since 1901 over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States for\nthe CMIP5 multimodel ensemble\u2014a condition that was also met for\nmost of the individual models.28\nThe Southeast stands out\nas the only region with no \u201cdetectable\u201d warming since 1901; observed\ntrends there were inconsistent with CMIP5 All Forcing historical\nruns.28\nThe\ncause of this \u201cwarming hole,\u201d or lack of a long-term warming trend,\nremains uncertain, though it is likely a combination of natural and\nhuman causes. Some studies conclude that changes in anthropogenic\naerosols have played a crucial role (e.g., Leibensperger et al.\n2012a,b;29\n,30\nYu et al. 201431\n), whereas other studies infer a possible large role for atmospheric\ncirculation,32\ninternal climate variability (e.g., Meehl et al. 2012;8\nKnutson et al.\n2013a28\n), and\nchanges in land use (e.g., Goldstein et al. 2009;33\nXu et al. 201534\n). Notably, the\nSoutheast has been warming rapidly since the early 1960s.35\n,36\nIn summary, there\nis medium confidence for detectable anthropogenic warming over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States.\nFigure 6.6\nDetection and attribution assessment of trends in annual average\ntemperature (\u00b0F). Grid-box values indicate whether linear trends\nfor 1901\u20132015 are detectable (that is, distinct from natural\nvariability) and/or consistent with CMIP5 historical All-Forcing\nruns. If the grid-box trend is found to be both detectable and\neither consistent with or greater than the warming in the All-Forcing\nruns, then the grid box is assessed as having a detectable anthropogenic\ncontribution to warming over the period. Gray regions represent\ngrid boxes with data that are too sparse for detection and attribution.\n(Figure source: updated from Knutson et al. 2013;28\n\u00a9 American Meteorological\nSociety. Used with permission.)\n6.2.2\nTemperature Extremes\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC\u2019s) Fifth\nAssessment Report (AR5)24\nconcluded that it is very likely that human influence has\ncontributed to the observed changes in frequency and intensity of\ntemperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century.\nThe combined influence of anthropogenic and natural forcings was\nalso detectable (medium confidence) over large subregions of North\nAmerica (e.g., Zwiers et al. 2011;37\nMin et al. 201338\n). In general,\nhowever, results for the contiguous United States are not as\ncompelling as for global land areas, in part because detection of\nchanges in U.S. regional temperature extremes is affected by extreme\ntemperature in the 1930s.17\nTable 6.3 summarizes\navailable attribution statements for recent extreme U.S. temperature\nevents. As an example, the recent record or near-record high March\u2013May\naverage temperatures occurring in 2012 over the eastern United\nStates were attributed in part to external (natural plus anthropogenic)\nforcing;39\nthe century-scale trend response of temperature to external forcing\nis typically a close approximation to the anthropogenic forcing\nresponse alone. Another study found that although the extreme March\n2012 warm anomalies over the United States were mostly due to natural\nvariability, anthropogenic warming contributed to the severity.40\nSuch statements\nreveal that both natural and anthropogenic factors influence the\nseverity of extreme temperature events. Nearly every modern analysis\nof current extreme hot and cold events reveals some degree of\nattributable human influence.\n6.3: Projected Changes\n6.3.1 Average Temperatures\nTemperature projections are based on global model results and\nassociated downscaled products from CMIP5 using a suite of\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). In contrast to NCA3,\nmodel weighting is employed to refine projections of temperature\nfor each RCP (Ch. 4: Projections; Appendix B: Model Weighting).\nWeighting parameters are based on model independence and skill over\nNorth America for seasonal temperature and annual extremes. Unless\nstated otherwise, all changes presented here represent the weighted\nmultimodel mean. The weighting scheme helps refine confidence and\nlikelihood statements, but projections of U.S. surface air temperature\nremain very similar to those in NCA3. Generally speaking, extreme\ntemperatures are projected to increase even more than average\ntemperatures.41\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States is\nprojected to rise throughout the century. Increases for the period\n2021\u20132050 relative to 1976\u20132005 are projected to be about 2.5\u00b0F\n(1.4\u00b0C) for a lower scenario (RCP4.5) and 2.9\u00b0F (1.6\u00b0C) for the\nhigher scenario (RCP8.5); the similarity in warming reflects the\nsimilarity in greenhouse gas concentrations during this period\n(Figure 4.1). Notably, a 2.5\u00b0F (1.4\u00b0C) increase makes the near-term\naverage comparable to the hottest year in the historical record\n(2012). In other words, recent record-breaking years may be \u201ccommon\u201d\nin the next few decades. By late-century (2071\u20132100), the RCPs\ndiverge significantly, leading to different rates of warming:\napproximately 5.0\u00b0F (2.8\u00b0C) for RCP4.5 and 8.7\u00b0F (4.8\u00b0C) for RCP8.5.\nLikewise, there are different ranges of warming for each scenario:\n2.8\u00b0\u20137.3\u00b0F (1.6\u00b0\u20134.1\u00b0C) for RCP4.5 and 5.8\u00b0\u201311.9\u00b0F (3.2\u00b0\u20136.6\u00b0C) for\nRCP8.5. (The range is defined here as the difference between the\naverage increase in the three coolest models and the average increase\nin the three warmest models.) For both RCPs, slightly greater\nincreases are projected in summer than winter (except for Alaska),\nand average maximums will rise slightly faster than average minimums\n(except in the Southeast and Southern Great Plains).\nFigure 6.7\nProjected changes in annual average temperatures (\u00b0F). Changes are\nthe difference between the average for mid-century (2036\u20132065; top)\nor late-century (2070-2099, bottom) and the average for near-present\n(1976\u20132005). Each map depicts the weighted multimodel mean. Increases\nare statistically significant in all areas (that is, more than 50%\nof the models show a statistically significant change, and more\nthan 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nStatistically significant warming is projected for all parts of the\nUnited States throughout the century (Figure 6.7). Consistent with\npolar amplification, warming rates (and spatial gradients) are\ngreater at higher latitudes. For example, warming is largest in\nAlaska (more than 12.0\u00b0F [6.7\u00b0C] in the northern half of the state\nby late-century under RCP8.5), driven in part by a decrease in snow\ncover and thus surface albedo. Similarly, northern regions of the\ncontiguous United States have slightly more warming than other\nregions (roughly 9.0\u00b0F [5.5\u00b0C] in the Northeast, Midwest, and\nNorthern Great Plains by late-century under RCP8.5; Table 6.4). The\nSoutheast has slightly less warming because of latent heat release\nfrom increases in evapotranspiration (as is already evident in the\nobserved record). Warming is smallest in Hawai\u2018i and the Caribbean\n(roughly 4.0\u00b0\u20136.0\u00b0F [2.2\u00b0\u20133.3\u00b0C] by late century under RCP8.5)\ndue to the moderating effects of surrounding oceans. From a\nsub-regional perspective, less warming is projected along the coasts\nof the contiguous United States, again due to maritime influences,\nalthough increases are still substantial. Warming at higher elevations\nmay be underestimated because the resolution of the CMIP5 models\ndoes not capture orography in detail.\nRCP4.5\nMid-Century\n(2036\u20132065)\nRCP8.5\nMid-Century\n(2036\u20132065)\nRCP4.5\nLate-Century\n(2071\u20132100)\nRCP8.5\nLate-Century\n(2071\u20132100)\n6.3.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.8\nProjected changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures\n(\u00b0F) of the year in the contiguous United States. Changes are the\ndifference between the average for mid-century (2036\u20132065) and the\naverage for near-present (1976\u20132005) under the higher scenario\n(RCP8.5). Maps in the top row depict the weighted multimodel mean\nwhereas maps on the bottom row depict the mean of the three warmest\nmodels (that is, the models with the largest temperature increase).\nMaps are derived from 32 climate model projections that were\nstatistically downscaled using the Localized Constructed Analogs\ntechnique.51\nIncreases are\nstatistically significant in all areas (that is\u00ad\u00ad,\nmore than 50% of the models show a statistically significant change,\nand more than 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nDaily extreme temperatures are projected to increase substantially\nin the contiguous United States, particularly under the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5). For instance, the coldest and warmest daily\ntemperatures of the year are expected to increase at least 5\u00b0F\n(2.8\u00b0C) in most areas by mid-century,42\nrising to 10\u00b0F (5.5\u00b0C)\nor more by late-century.43\nIn general, there will\nbe larger increases in the coldest temperatures of the year,\nespecially in the northern half of the Nation, whereas the warmest\ntemperatures will exhibit somewhat more uniform changes geographically\n(Figure 6.8). By mid-century, the upper bound for projected changes\n(i.e., the average of the three warmest models) is about 2\u00b0F (1.1\u00b0C)\ngreater than the weighted multimodel mean. On a regional basis,\nannual extremes (Table 6.5) are consistently projected to rise\nfaster than annual averages (Table 6.4). Future changes in \u201cvery\nrare\u201d extremes are also striking; by late century, current 1-in-20\nyear maximums are projected to occur every year, while current\n1-in-20 year minimums are not expected to occur at all.44\nThe frequency and intensity of cold waves is projected to decrease\nwhile the frequency and intensity of heat waves is projected to\nincrease throughout the century. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile) will\ndecrease the most in Alaska and the least in the Northeast while\nthe frequency of heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile) will increase in all regions, particularly\nthe Southeast, Southwest, and Alaska. By mid-century, decreases in\nthe frequency of cold waves are similar across RCPs whereas increases\nin the frequency of heat waves are about 50% greater in the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5) than the lower scenario (RCP4.5).45\nThe intensity of cold\nwaves is projected to decrease while the intensity of heat waves\nis projected to increase, dramatically so under RCP8.5. By mid-century,\nboth extreme cold waves and extreme heat waves (5-day, 1-in-10 year\nevents) are projected to have temperature increases of at least\n11.0\u00b0F (6.1\u00b0C) nationwide, with larger increases in northern regions\n(the Northeast, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, and Northwest; Table\n6.5).\nFigure 6.9\nProjected changes in the number of days per year with a maximum\ntemperature above 90\u00b0F and a minimum temperature below 32\u00b0F in the\ncontiguous United States. Changes are the difference between the\naverage for mid-century (2036\u20132065) and the average for near-present\n(1976\u20132005) under the higher scenario (RCP8.5). Maps in the top row\ndepict the weighted multimodel mean whereas maps on the bottom row\ndepict the mean of the three warmest models (that is, the models\nwith the largest temperature increase). Maps are derived from 32\nclimate model projections that were statistically downscaled using\nthe Localized Constructed Analogs technique.51\nChanges are statistically\nsignificant in all areas (that is, more than 50% of the models show\na statistically significant change, and more than 67% agree on the\nsign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC and NOAA NCEI).\nThere are large projected changes in the number of days exceeding\nkey temperature thresholds throughout the contiguous United States.\nFor instance, there are about 20\u201330 more days per year with a maximum\nover 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) in most areas by mid-century under RCP8.5, with\nincreases of 40\u201350 days in much of the Southeast (Figure 6.9). The\nupper bound for projected changes is very roughly 10 days greater\nthan the weighted multimodel mean. Consistent with widespread\nwarming, there are 20\u201330 fewer days per year with a minimum temperature\nbelow freezing in the northern and eastern parts of the nation,\nwith decreases of more than 40\u201350 days in much the West. The upper\nbound for projected changes in freezing events is very roughly 10\u201320\ndays fewer than the weighted multimodel mean in many areas.\nReferences\nModal\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n1800 G Street, NW, Suite 9100, Washington, DC 20006 USA\nTel: +1 202.223.6262 | Fax: +1 202.223.3065\nContact Us \u2022\nCredits \u2022\nPrivacy Policy \u2022\nSite Map\nSome figures and images are copyright protected.\nPermission of the copyright owner must be obtained\nbefore making use of copyrighted material.",

No major rise in deaths has been reported.\nScientists outside of China have attempted to assess the patterns of illness independently. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the U.K.'s University of East Anglia, told the Science Media Centre on November 22 that the illness in children was a fever with no cough or other symptoms although, in some cases, pulmonary nodules had been seen on chest x-rays.\n\"Whilst we can't make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause,\" Hunter said.\n\"Pulmonary nodules in children are seen in pneumococcal pneumonia and cough may be absent. Influenza can catch patchy changes on chest X-ray, often due to secondary bacterial infections so [that] could also be in the frame.\n\"Whilst we can't make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause.\"\nHunter added that it did not sound like an epidemic due to a novel virus, adding that he would \"expect to see many more infections in adults\" in that case.\nNonetheless, some concerns have grown that older Chinese residents may come into contact with pathogens during family gatherings later in the year.\nThe pattern of China's outbreak suggests it began several months ago, Chinese health experts told various state media publications this week. They expect cases to peak in the next 2-3 weeks, but infections could last through next spring.\nHealth officials have urged the public to get vaccinated for relevant diseases.\nHow Many People Have Been Affected and Where?\nWhile there have been localized reports from hospitals across China, the total number of patients across the country isn't clear.\nChinese state media has reported that in Taizhou in East China's Zhejiang province, as of Friday, November 24, the positive rate of influenza virus in outpatient cases in the city had increased to 50 percent.\nThe Tianjin Children's Hospital, located in a major port city near the capital Beijing, reported on November 18 a single-day record of 13,171 young patients across its outpatient and emergency departments, according to a local newspaper. The geographical spread of cases, spanning over 400 miles from Beijing to Liaoning, suggested a wider outbreak that began in northern China.\nLast week, state-run CCTV news reported that in the capital of Beijing, hospitals had been operating at full capacity for over a month in response to this spike in infection. Beijing Children's Hospital revealed that its internal medicine department had seen more than 7,000 cases daily. Beijing Jingdu Children's Hospital highlighted a significant rise in mycoplasma pneumonia infections, placing immense pressure on medical resources, with 90 percent of the hospital's 300 beds occupied and long queues forming outside.\nOn November 21, Chinese media and ProMed, the alert system known for its role in bringing attention to the coronavirus outbreak in 2019, reported that there had been clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia among children in northern China, although it was unclear if this was related to the reported respiratory outbreaks.\nProMed first reported numerous children being admitted to hospitals with high fevers but without typical pneumonia symptoms.\nIn northern China, which appears to be experiencing the worst of the outbreak, respiratory infections have surged for five consecutive weeks, accounting for 6.2 percent of outpatient and emergency visits, at a rate 2.5 times the average of the past three years, Lo Yi-chun, the deputy director of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Sunday, citing World Health Organization (WHO) data.\nHealth authorities such as the WHO have repeatedly asked China for further epidemiological data.\nDr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting director of the WHO's Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention, said on Thursday: \"We are following up with the situation in China and again, they have seen overall an increase in acute respiratory infections due to a number of different pathogens, including influenza, which is on the rise.\"\nShe continued, \"Mycoplasma pneumonia was on the rise for the last couple of months and now seems to be a little bit on the decline. We are following up through our clinical networks and working clinicians in China to better understand resistance to antibiotics which is a problem across the world.\"\nWhat's the Relative Risk to Other Parts of the World?\nThe Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Saturday that the island's ports and airports were all put on \"high alert.\" Notices were placed at these locations urging travelers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to seek medical attention if symptomatic, and disclose their travel history to healthcare providers.\nFang Chi-Tai, a professor at the Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at National Taiwan University, told Newsweek on Monday that Taiwan had heightened disease surveillance and recommends preventive measures such as mask-wearing as well as maintaining personal hygiene upon arrival in China.\nTaiwan's public health authority said individuals planning trips to China should consider receiving vaccines for COVID and influenza at the earliest opportunity.\nNearby nations such as India and Vietnam have said that while they are not seeing an uptick in cases, their health systems are preparing and have reached out to health authorities such as the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for advice.\nHowever, the relative risk according to experts appears to be low. Speaking to healthcare publication STAT, the WHO's Van Kerkhove reiterated the view that the spike in cases was due to an immunity gap in China, following the lifting of COVID restrictions, and was something most other countries had already dealt with.\n\"This is not an indication of a novel pathogen. This is expected,\" Kerkhove said.\n\"This is what most countries dealt with a year or two ago.\n\"We asked about comparisons prior to the pandemic. And the waves that they're seeing now, the peak is not as high as what they saw in 2018-2019.\"\nSpeaking to CNN, Dr. Leana Wen, former Baltimore Health Commissioner and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said the cases should not cause global concern.\n\"The spikes are \"not unexpected given the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, as similarly experienced in other countries,\" according to WHO, she said.\n\"Importantly, no new pathogen has been detected. There has also been no unusual clinical presentation with children appearing much sicker than normal.\"\n\nTop stories\n\nSeth Moulton Faces Protest in Hometown After Controversial Trans Remarks\n\nFox News Host Confronts Mike Johnson With GOP Demand for Matt Gaetz Report\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nWhat Will Trump's New Term Mean for A.I.?\nAbout the writer\n\n\n\nThe Debate\n\nTrump's War on the D.C.

From the impressive 92,869 kWh per year back in 2014 to the relatively modest 6,817 kWh per month in 2003, it's clear that the Lone Star state knows how to keep things interesting when it comes to energy usage. Whether they're turning up the AC in the scorching Texas heat or keeping the lights on late into the night, one thing's for sure: Everything is bigger in Texas, including their electricity bills!\nResidential Electricity Usage\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in Texas, the only thing consuming more energy than the residents is the record of their electricity usage statistics! With a rollercoaster of numbers over the years, it's clear that Texans have a knack for keeping the lights on. Whether it's BBQ grills sizzling or AC units chilling, the Lone Star State sure knows how to power up. Maybe it's time to consider 'Switch Off Saturdays' or 'Watt Watching Wednesdays' to keep those numbers in check, but hey, at least they're consistent in one thing - consistently electrifying!\nTexas Electricity Consumption\nInterpretation\nIn a state where everything is bigger, it seems even our energy consumption doesn't hold back. With an average electricity usage of 12,216 kWh per capita in 2006, Texans prove that when it comes to power consumption, we don't just talk the talk, we kilowatt the kilowatt. So, if you ever thought everything was grand in Texas, just take a look at our electric bills for a shocking reality check.\nReferences\neia.gov\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

The average temperature for October 2024 was recorded at around 11 degrees Celsius, compared to 11.9 degrees a year before. In the broader context of climate change, average monthly temperatures are indicative of where the national climate is headed and whether attempts to control global warming are successful.\u00a0\nSummer and winter\nAverage summer temperature in Germany fluctuated in recent years, generally between 18 to 19 degrees Celsius. The seasons remain generally warm, and while there may not be as many hot and sunny days as in other parts of Europe, heat waves have occurred. In fact, 2023 saw 11.5 days with a temperature of at least 30 degrees, though this was a decrease compared to the year before. Meanwhile, average winter temperatures also fluctuated, but were higher in recent years, rising over four degrees on average in 2024. Figures remained in the above zero range since 2011. Numbers therefore suggest that German winters are becoming warmer, even if individual regions experiencing colder sub-zero snaps or even more snowfall may disagree.\u00a0\nRain, rain, go away\nAverage monthly precipitation varied depending on the season, though sometimes figures from different times of the year were comparable. In 2024, the average monthly precipitation was highest in May and September, although rainfalls might increase in October and November with the beginning of the cold season. In the past, torrential rains have led to catastrophic flooding in Germany, with one of the most devastating being the flood of July 2021. Germany is not immune to the weather changing between two extremes, e.g. very warm spring months mostly without rain, when rain might be wished for, and then increased precipitation in other months where dry weather might be better, for example during planting and harvest seasons. Climate change remains on the agenda in all its far-reaching ways.\u00a0\n\n                        Average monthly temperature in Germany from October 2023 to October 2024 \n                    \n                            (in Celsius)\n                        \n\n                                    Additional Information\n                                \n\n                                Show sources information\n                            \n                                Show publisher information\n                            \n                                Use Ask Statista Research Service\n                            \nOctober 2024\nGermany\nOctober 2023 to October 2024\nFigures for the months preceding October 2024 were retrieved from previous report editions of the German Meteorological Service.According to the source, figures are preliminary.

    "document": "First half of 2024: Renewable electricity generation continues to rise significantly  | Umweltbundesamt\nFirst half of 2024: Renewable electricity generation continues to rise significantly \nHeating and transport sectors remain almost unchanged \nCurrent figures from the German Environment Agency (UBA) for the first half of 2024 show that electricity generation from renewable energies increased by nine per cent compared to the same period last year. However, capacity expansion must be further accelerated to meet climate and energy targets. In the heating sector, mild weather led to lower demand for heating. In the mobility sector, the use of renewable electricity in transport increased slightly.\n\"It is a success that the renewable share of electricity continues to grow. At the same time, the growth figures make it clear that considerable efforts are still required. In the photovoltaic sector alone, we need an increase of around 50 per cent in order to meet the targets of the Renewable Energy Sources Act,\u201d says Dirk Messner, President of the German Environment Agency. \u201cPlanning reliability and careful further development of the subsidy mechanisms are important for success. In addition, distribution grid areas in which a particularly large number of renewable energy systems are connected should not be burdened further by rising grid fees.\u201d\nRenewables account for around 57 per cent of gross electricity econsumption\u2060 \u00a0 \nApproximately 147 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity were generated from renewable sources, representing an increase of about nine percent compared to the same period in the previous year (135 TWh). Two factors played a decisive role in this. Firstly, windy winter months and the addition of new plants led to a 10 per cent increase in wind power generation. In addition, the large increase in output in the photovoltaic (PV) sector led to an increase of 13 per cent compared to the same period of the previous year, despite the lack of sunshine. In the hydropower sector, rainy \u2060weather\u2060 led to an increase of 12 per cent. Over the entire first half of 2024, wind power generation accounted for the largest share of renewable electricity generation at around 51 per cent. Photovoltaics followed with 24 per cent, electricity generation from\u2060 biomass with around 15 per cent and hydropower with around 8 per cent of renewable electricity. As demand for electricity in the current year was roughly the same as in the previous year, the share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption rose significantly in the first half of 2024. According to calculations by the Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics (AGEE-Stat), the share was already around 57 per cent. A projection for the entirety of 2024 is not possible at this stage, as renewable electricity generation depends on weather conditions and the development of electricity consumption throughout the rest of the year. The increase in output in the first half of 2024 was once again heavily dominated by the expansion of PV. \u00a0For example, net additions in the first two quarters totalled 7.5 gigawatts (GW), while the addition of onshore wind energy systems only reached 0.9 GW. Around 0.4 GW of net new capacity was added to the installed capacity of offshore wind energy plants in the second quarter. With total installed capacity exceeding 88 GW, the 2024 expansion target for PV of 84 GW, as set by the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), has been achieved six months ahead of schedule. The installed capacity of onshore wind turbines currently stands at just under 62 GW, which means that the target of 69 GW set by the EEG in 2024 is unlikely to be reached\nDecline in renewable heat production \nTotal heat production from renewable sources amounted to 111 TWh in the first half of 2024. Compared to the first half of 2023, the heat provided from renewable sources fell by seven per cent overall. The main reason for this was warmer weather than in the same period of the previous year, which reduced the overall demand for heat. This decline was mitigated by an increase in the number of heat pumps. As a result of this dynamic growth in heat pumps, particularly as a result of installations in the second half of 2023, around 3.5 per cent more heat was generated from near-surface geothermal energy and environmental heat compared to the same period last year.\nHowever according to the latest reports from industry associations, sales of heat pumps have fallen sharply by around 50 per cent compared to the previous year. In order to achieve the German government\u2019s target of 500,000 installed heat pumps per year, this trend needs to be reversed. Three quarters of renewable heat still comes from biomass, around 6 per cent from biogenic waste and around 4 per cent from solar thermal systems.\nSlight increase in the transport sector \nIn the first half of the year, around 21.9 TWh from renewable sources was used in the transport sector. This is an increase of 3 per cent compared to the first half of 2023. Based on current information, the total amount of biofuels used was at the same level as in the first half of the previous year. In contrast, the use of renewable electricity in the transport sector increased by 16 per cent, as not only did the renewable share in the electricity sector grow, but so did the number of electrically powered vehicles. The amount of renewable electricity used in the transport sector corresponds to just under three per cent of the green electricity used in Germany. Around 70 per cent of this is used in rail transport and today around 30 per cent in road transport.\nFurther information: \nThe Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics (AGEE-Stat) analyses the use of renewable energies on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and\u2060 Climate Action\u2060 (BMWK) and continuously compiles reports on the development of renewable energies on the basis of currently available data. In addition to annual publications, AGEE-Stat also regularly publishes monthly and quarterly reports. In the current quarterly report, you will find further graphics on the current development of renewable energies in 2024.

    "document": "Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of March 2024 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $16.2 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 593 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $11.1 billion has been announced for transportation \u2013 to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports \u2013 and roughly $995 million has been announced for clean water and water infrastructure. Florida received $2.1 billion to connect everyone in the state to reliable high-speed internet and, as of today, more than 1,708,000 Florida households are already saving on their monthly internet bill due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida \u2013 including rural communities and historically underserved populations \u2013 the law makes critical investments that will improve the lives of Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $8.5 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $7.7 billion in highway formula funding and $158 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges to date. o $117.1 million through the RAISE program to date. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $207 million through the INFRA program to date. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet over 272,962 homes and small businesses in Florida do not have access to high-speed internet infrastructure. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to everyone in America. The Biden-Harris Administration worked with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. Now, the Biden-Harris Administration is calling on Congress to extend this program through 2024. Without action from Congress, millions of Americans will lose their internet connection and the economic opportunities that come with it. See ACP enrollment for every state and territory here. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received $2.1 billion for high-speed internet. Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program to provide access to high-speed internet to everyone in Florida. Florida also received $2.8 million in funding to expand middle-mile infrastructure in the state. In addition, about 1,708,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in water infrastructure in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $995 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $995 million available to date to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $229.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation and 19% of transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $1.3 billion to improve public transportation options across the state. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Announced funding to date will double the number of clean transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Schools in Florida have been awarded $45 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. Communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $113.7 million has been announced in Florida to date to build out a network of EV chargers in the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy about $150 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $392.4 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power. This includes: o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; o $162.8 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received approximately $1 billion for airports. Ports and Waterways: Our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received roughly $128.3 million for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $24.9 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $1.5 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience, including $51.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $123 million has been allocated to cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites. Approximately $25 million has been allocated to Florida for capping orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaiming abandoned mine lands.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nSeptember 2024 Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks\n\nNOAA and its partners have released the latest Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks, which recap summer conditions and provide insight into what might be expected this fall.\nSummer Temperature Recap\nThe meteorological summer (June\u2013August) average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 73.8\u00b0F, 2.5\u00b0F above average, which is the fourth-warmest summer in the 130-year record. Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.The Alaska summer temperature was 51.7\u00b0F, 1.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.For the January\u2013August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9\u00b0F, 3.0\u00b0F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January\u2013August period on record.\nThe Alaska January\u2013August temperature was 31.2\u00b0F, 2.4\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June\u2013August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.For summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.The January\u2013August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January\u2013August period.The January\u2013August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month\u2019s consolidation.\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October. Precipitation consolidation guidance has trended wetter across the northern tier of the CONUS, resulting in an expansion of elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the northern High Plains and Great Lakes relative to last month. Above-normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska.\u00a0\n\n\nImpacts and Outlooks for Your Region\nMap of the United States depicting the Seasonal Precipitation Outlook for October\u2013December 2024.\u00a0\nCreating These Quarterly Summaries\u00a0\nNOAA\u2019s Regional Climate Services lead the production of these quarterly summaries of climate impacts and outlooks for various regions of the United States as well as parts of Canada along the border.

To date, $10.5 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 359 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $6.9 billion has been announced for transportation \u2013 to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports \u2013 and roughly $800 million has been announced for clean water. As of today, more than 1,389,000 households across the state are receiving affordable high-speed internet due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. To date, Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) to help provide access to high-speed internet across the state. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida \u2013 including rural communities and historically underserved populations \u2013 the law makes critical investments that will improve lives for Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, $5.4 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $5.1 billion in highway formula funding and $105.3 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges in 2022 and 2023. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 o $117.1 million through the RAISE program and $27 million through the INFRA program in 2022 and 2023. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet nearly 22% of Floridians do not have an internet subscription. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to every American. Additionally, experts estimate that as many as 3,283,000 households in Florida are eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which cuts internet bills by up to $30 per month, or $75 for households on Tribal lands, and provides a one-time $100 discount off a connected device. The Biden-Harris Administration is providing further cost savings by working with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. \u25cf Progress to date: To date, Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) to help provide access to high-speed internet across the state. In addition, about 1,389,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program, with more signing up every day. Households can check their eligibility, sign up, and find fully covered internet plans at GetInternet.gov. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, $800 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $800 million available in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $146.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 more likely to commute via public transportation and 20% transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has been allocated $529.4 million to improve public transportation options across the state in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This year alone, funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help double the number of clean public transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, schools in Florida have been awarded $11.8 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. In addition, communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $71.5 million in 2022 and 2023 to build out a network of EV chargers across the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy more than $70 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $168.5 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power in 2022 and 2023. This includes: Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; and o $31.5 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Additional grid funding will be made available in the coming months. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received approximately $658.6 million in 2022 and 2023 for airports. Ports and Waterways: Like airports, our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received roughly $143.6 million in 2022 and 2023 for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $43.2 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $1.4 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience in 2022 and 2023 including $32.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $120.4 million has been allocated to cleaning up brownfield sites in Florida.

Florida Project Spotlights Low- and No-Emission Project Spotlight City Of Tallahassee The Department of Transportation awarded $20.3 million to the City of Tallahassee's StarMetro system to buy battery-electric buses and support charging infrastructure. This funding will also develop a workforce training program for the city's mechanics and operators to maintain the fleet. The project will help reduce emissions and improve service and reliability for riders in and around Tallahassee. See here for a full list of FY23 Bus and Low- and No-Emission Grant projects. Middle Mile Project Spotlight WANRack-mm-FL2 The Department of Commerce awarded $2.8 million to WANRack to build 44.8 miles of open access middle mile infrastructure from north of Lakeland, FL going through Pasco and Zephyrhills/Dade City and then continuing north on Route 98 into Hernando County. The Middle Mile Grant Program plays a critical role in providing quality, affordable high-speed Internet and connecting unserved regions to the Internet backbone. See here for more information about Enabling Middle Mile Broadband Infrastructure Program award recipients. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 Brownfields Cleanup Project Spotlight South Florida Regional Planning Council The Environmental Protection Agency awarded the South Florida Regional Planning Council $1 million to accelerate cleanup efforts at contaminated sites in Central Miami. Until 1985, Central Miami was physically separated from the predominantly white area east of 12th Avenue by an 8-foot-high concrete wall, and was nearly destroyed by a fire after riots broke out in 1979. Priority sites in Central Miami include the 2-acre former Orkin Site, the 20-acre Poinciana Industrial Center assemblage property, and the 4.3-acre Northside Transit-Oriented Development property. See here for a full list of Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) recipients. PHMSA Project Spotlight City of Milton Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization Grant The Department of Transportation awarded $10 million to the City of Milton to replace 4.38 miles of cast iron natural gas lines and 7.91 miles of steel gas mains. The project will help improve public safety, protect public health, and reduce methane emissions from natural gas distribution pipes in underserved communities. See here for more information on Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) projects. Roads and Bridges Project Spotlight I-4 West Central Florida Truck Parking Facility The $15 million grant from the Department of Transportation will help build a new truck parking facility with about 120 spaces, electric charging stations, and pedestrian infrastructure to access nearby amenities. This corridor between Tampa and Orlando carries an average of 18,000 trucks daily, but currently lacks sufficient parking. The facility will be connected to Florida\u2019s Department of Transportation Truck Parking Availability System in order to help drivers identify available parking locations more quickly. By providing reliable parking capacity, the project improves safety for tired drivers and makes supply chain movement more efficient. See here for more information on awarded grants through the INFRA program. Superfund Cleanup Project Spotlight Southern Solvents, Inc. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 The Environmental Protection Agency has announced $5 million in funding for the cleanup at the Southern Solvents, Inc. site. The funds will be used to remove and treat tetrachloroethylene (also known as PCE or PERC) and trichloroethylene (TCE) contamination in the soil and groundwater. This funding will allow EPA to restore and protect a valuable drinking water resource in the Tampa, Florida area. The cleanup will restore the site and prevent the contaminants from migrating to other areas. See here for more information on EPA Superfund cleanup work. SMART Project Spotlight A MicroFreight Approach for Safer Streets The Department of Transportation has awarded over $1.9 million to the Miami-Dade County to introduce a platform of integrated data sensors, and digital infrastructures systems to enable and scale safe, zero-emission last-mile freight and goods deliveries in Miami-Dade County. See here for more information on the Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing Transportation (SMART) Grants Program. Reconnecting Communities Project Spotlight Uniting Neighborhoods and Infrastructure for Transportation Equity: Ashley Drive The City of Tampa will receive a $5.3 million Capital grant from the Department of Transportation to reconnect the Downtown Tampa area and its riverfront. The project will lower the current interchange ramp to street level, increasing mobility through new bicycle and pedestrian routes. The area will be safer and more accessible with new installation of new signals and improved active transportation facilities. See here for a full list of announced Reconnecting Communities Awards.",

Projections indicate that millions, perhaps 1/7 of the population, might face displacement as per the World Bank's estimations,\" Saber H Chowdhury, minister for environment, forest and climate change, was quoted as saying in the report.\nSea level rise is projected to lead to a 6-9 percent decline in the country's rice production. Increasingly saline waters are also projected to disrupt fisheries, which will disproportionately affect poor coastal communities, for whom fish is an important source of protein.\nSaline water can also infiltrate groundwater and surface water sources, affecting drinking water supplies and human health.\n\"Sea level around South Asia will continue to rise over the 21st century, increasing flooding in low-lying Bangladesh. This will devastate vital food crops, forcing more people to leave their homes,\" says professor AKM Saiful Islam, director of the Institute of Water and Flood Management (IWFM) of Buet and a lead author of the report.\nThe accelerating impacts of climate change in Bangladesh highlights an urgent need to scale up international action against climate change.\nBangladesh repeatedly experiences extreme climate events like heatwaves and tropical cyclones, the report adds.\nIn 2019 and 2000, the country experienced 185 extreme weather events, making it the seventh most vulnerable to climate change in the world.\nGovernment adaptation policy and local initiatives have saved many lives and, so far, averted the worst impacts of climate change, the report says.\nBangladesh is recognised as a global leader in adaptation and resilience. In 2005, Bangladesh was one of the first least developed countries to develop a national adaptation programme of action.\nBy the end of the century, even under a very low emissions scenario, Bangladesh could see a further 0.8\u00b0C of warming compared with 1981\u20132010, and heavier rainfall could increase peak river flow by 16 percent relative to 1971\u20132000.\nIn the last few decades, the number of people who have died during cyclones has fallen from six digits (300,000+ from Cyclone Bhola in 1970) to double digits (35 from Cyclone Sitrang in 2022), largely due to the success of the country's Cyclone Preparedness Programme.\nIn the last few decades, the government has invested in saline-tolerant rice varieties, floating agriculture in regions that suffer flooding, and water-saving technologies in drought-prone areas to help safeguard food security in the face of increasingly extreme weather.\nRelated News\n\nGlobal loss and damage initiative launched in Dhaka \n\nA window of opportunity to phase out fossil fuels \n\nSea-level rise in Bangladesh: Faster than global average  \n\nWhat will happen when the 'Doomsday Glacier' disintegrates? \n\nClimate loss and damage are clearly visible in southwest Bangladesh \n\u2018\u09af\u09be\u09b0\u09be \u09ac\u09bf\u09aa\u09cd\u09b2\u09ac\u09c7\u09b0 \u0995\u09a5\u09be \u09ac\u09b2\u099b\u09c7\u09a8, \u09a4\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u0989\u099a\u09bf\u09ce \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be \u09a5\u09c7\u0995\u09c7 \u09ac\u09bf\u09aa\u09cd\u09b2\u09ac\u09c0 \u09a6\u09b2 \u09a4\u09c8\u09b0\u09bf \u0995\u09b0\u09be\u2019\n\u2018\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09bf\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09be\u099a\u09a8 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be \u098f\u09ae\u09a8 \u0995\u09cb\u09a8\u09cb \u09b6\u0999\u09cd\u0995\u09be \u09a8\u09c7\u0987, \u0985\u09a8\u09c7\u0995 \u09ac\u09bf\u09b2\u09ae\u09cd\u09ac\u0993 \u0995\u09b0\u09ac\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be\u2019\n\u0985\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09c0 \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09c7\u09df\u09be\u09a6 \u09b8\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09cb\u099a\u09cd\u099a \u09ea \u09ac\u099b\u09b0 \u09b9\u09a4\u09c7 \u09aa\u09be\u09b0\u09c7 \u09ac\u09be \u09a4\u09be\u09b0\u0993 \u0995\u09ae: \u0986\u09b2\u099c\u09be\u099c\u09bf\u09b0\u09be\u0995\u09c7 \u09a1. \u0987\u0989\u09a8\u09c2\u09b8\n",

In the North Sea, fish have been comprehensively monitored throughout this period and resulting data provide a unique record of changes in distribution and abundance in response to climate change2,3. We use these data to demonstrate the remarkable power of generalized additive models (GAMs), trained on data earlier in the time series, to reliably predict trends in distribution and abundance in later years. Then, challenging process-based models that predict substantial and ongoing poleward shifts of cold-water species4,5, we find that GAMs coupled with climate projections predict future distributions of demersal (bottom-dwelling) fish species over the next 50 years will be strongly constrained by availability of habitat of suitable depth. This will lead to pronounced changes in community structure, species interactions and commercial fisheries, unless individual acclimation or population-level evolutionary adaptations enable fish to tolerate warmer conditions or move to previously uninhabitable locations.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\n        Receive 12 print issues and online access\n      \n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nShifting fish distributions in warming sub-Arctic oceans\n                                        \n\n\nFuture trends of marine fish biomass distributions from the North Sea to the Barents Sea\n                                        \n\n\nMarine fish traits follow fast-slow continuum across oceans\n                                        \n\nReferences\nSherman, K. & Hempel, G.

INTRODUCTION The dynamics of marine fish populations are typi-cally categorized as regulated primarily by top-down processes (i.e. predation) or by bottom-up processes (i.e. resource production) (Wollrab et al. 2012, Heath et al. 2014, Vinueza et al. 2014). For example, fish population dynamics in the North Sea were long thought to be driven by bottom-up processes (Lynam et al. 2017). In bottom-up regulated systems, the lowest-level driver is formed by abiotic factors (e.g.\ntemperature, salinity, etc.) and their influence on plankton biomass. The available plankton biomass in turn leads to cascades upwards through the food web (Gregory et al. 2009, Kirby & Beaugrand 2009, Olsen et al. 2011). Top-down interactions, represented by predation pressure from predators and fisheries ex -ploitation, have also been shown to have a large impact on the dynamics of several North Sea fish populations (Fauchald et al. 2011, Engelhard et al.\n2014). Furthermore, the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes in the North Sea eco-system can give rise to highly complex and non-linear dynamics in fish populations (Lynam et al.\n\u00a9 The authors 2021.

Smallegange2, Anieke van Leeuwen1 1NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, Department of Coastal Systems, and Utrecht University, 1797 SZ Texel, The Netherlands 2Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, 1012 WX Amsterdam, The Netherlands ABSTRACT: Distinct areas of seabed, called seascapes, are known to shape benthic habitats and communities, yet little is known about the extent to which they affect the dynamics of marine fish populations. We explored the relationship between seascapes and trends in the biomass density of several North Sea fish species. We divided the North Sea into 10 seascapes using standardized methods. Time series of fish biomass density were derived from the North Sea International Bottom-Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) and aggregated to the seascape level. We analysed the inter -dependencies between these time series using a causal association network and found independ-ent biomass density trends between adjacent seascapes at a time interval of 0 yr in all species as -sessed. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density occurred at time lags of 1\u22122 yr across different gradients of exchange: (1) both directions from North to South; (2) unidirectional, North\u2212South; (3) unidirectional, South\u2212North; (4) unidirectional, East\u2212West; and (5) no clear direc-tion. Our findings indicate that the separation in (a)biotic conditions between North Sea seascapes can represent relevant barriers to the processes determining the observed fish biomass density.\nWe found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat preferences best explained short-term causal dependencies. This combination is particular to the flatfish and ray species included in the present study. Contrarily, the movement of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species best explained long-term causal dependencies. Our work highlights how causal association networks can be used to study the temporal dependencies between spatial time series in ecology.\nKEY WORDS: IBTS \u00b7 International Bottom-Trawl Survey \u00b7 PCMCI \u00b7 Seascapes \u00b7 Spatiotemporal analysis \u00b7 Time series \u00b7 Bottom-trawl OPEN PEN ACCESS CCESS Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 2017). To attain a better understanding of the com-plexity emerging from such interactions, it is impor-tant to have a complete overview of the bottom-up and top-down processes acting upon fish populations in the North Sea.\nOne potentially important bottom-up process that is often overlooked in regulating fish populations is seabed morphology. Physically distinct areas of sea -bed, also called seascapes, can act as a bottom-up controlling mechanism by shaping abiotic conditions, leading to the formation of different types of benthic habitat and associated species assemblages (Harris & Baker 2012). Due to the strong link between seabed morphology and community structure of benthic in -vertebrates (Beaman et al. 2005, Kaskela et al. 2017), seascapes are often used as a proxy for mapping marine benthic habitats (Kostylev et al. 2001, Brown & Collier 2008). Yet, we know little about the extent to which seascapes affect the dynamics of fish popu-lations, despite the fact that the few case studies available show it could help explain the spatial dis-tribution of fish resources (Pittman & Brown 2011, Getsiv-Clemons et al. 2012). Recent research revealed that the central and lower part of the North Sea com-prises 8 distinct seascapes excluding the coastal zone (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018), and that these were selectively targeted by commercial fishing vessels.\nAlthough this preferential selection provides some indirect link to the availability and distribution of fish resources, a more complete study exploring the rela-tionship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish is missing. If seascapes are important, this changes the commonly held perspec-tive on the types of bottom-up processes affecting North Sea fish populations.\nTo understand the relationship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish, we in -vestigated the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes. We hypothesized that if seascapes are not related to trends in fish pop-ulations in the North Sea, biomass densities in sepa-rate seascapes will be directly dependent on each other. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the \u2018borders\u2019 between separate seascapes being dif-fuse, i.e. not relevant, to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed. In contrast, if seascapes define distinct abiotic environments that are important for the distribution of fish populations, we expect biomass densities in different seascapes to be unrelated to each other, although they can still be related across longer time lags. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the separation in conditions between seascapes representing relevant barriers to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed.\nTo examine the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes, we used a re cently developed causal association network ap -proach (Runge et al. 2019a). The advantage of this data-driven method is that it learns causal associa-tions at various time lags directly from aggregated sets of time series, rather than establishing causality through computer simulation experiments on correl-ative relationships found in observational data (Runge et al. 2019b). As such, our study also tests a new ap -proach to examine intraspecific dependencies in the biomass trends of North Sea fish.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study area The North Sea is a semi-enclosed shelf extending from 4\u00b0 W and 62\u00b0 N (Fig. 1a) (Daan et al. 2005). In this study, we focussed on the region that includes International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) statistical rectangles 4a, b and c. We excluded the Norwegian trench, the Skagerrak and the waters south of the English Channel, as their distinctiveness is well recognized (Bergstad 1990, ICES 2018). Ex -tending the method of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018), we derived 10 separate seascapes (Fig. 1b). These seascapes were identified based on the weighted sum of 5 bathymetry positioning indices (BPIs), which express the depth of a pixel relative to the depth of its surroundings. The specific weighted-sum BPI used (Eq. 1) highlights large-scale patterns in seabed mor-phology and is strongly linked to benthic communities (Reiss et al. 2010). A full description of the weighted BPI can be found in van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018).\nBPI 75 km + (0.9 \u00d7 BPI 50 km) + (0.8 \u00d7 BPI 30 km) + (0.7 \u00d7 BPI 10 km) + (0.6 \u00d7 BPI 5 km) (1) 2.2. Data preparation We extracted data on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 9 species of fish collected in the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) from 1978 to 2019 (ICES 2019) (Table 1). We chose 1978 as the starting year of the time series as all seascapes were systematically sampled within the NS-IBTS from this year onward. The 9 selected species cov-ered a variety of different life history strategies and 130 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed had sufficient positive catch data available in all sea-scapes across selected years. To minimize bias from potential variability in sampling gear and timing, we only included observations that had been sampled in the same quarter of the year and using the GOV trawl. Next, we determined in which seascape each haul was performed based on the shoot longitude and latitude. We estimated the biomass in kg for a given species for each haul by multiplying the num-ber of individuals of a given length class by their length\u2212weight relationship, as derived from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019), and summing over all length classes present in the haul. We then aggregated the data to a single time series per seascape and species, representing the average biomass in kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121.\nWe refer to this metric as biomass density.\n2.3.

Fish species, records and length to weight conversion used in the study. All length\u2212weight (L\u2212W) relationships were taken directly from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019). Slight differences in the number of filtered (unique) hauls between spe-cies originate from small differences in the raw North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey CPUE-length-per-hour datasets pulled from the ICES/DATRAS online database (ICES 2019) for each species (mean \u00b1 SD:13 667.2 \u00b1 104.9 filtered hauls, range 13 430\u221213 760 filtered hauls) Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 dependencies in fish biomass density between sea-scapes. If seascapes are not related to fish popula-tions in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities between separate seascapes are causally related to each other at the time interval of zero. Contrarily, if seascapes are related to fish populations in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities in separate seascapes are independent of each other at the time interval of zero, although they can be causally dependent across longer time scales.\nWe applied a causal association network approach recently developed by Runge et al. (2019a), to evalu-ate the underlying causal dependency structure be -tween the fish biomass density time series from dif-ferent seascapes (Fig. 2). The linear and non-linear time-lagged dependencies between sets of time series can cause inflated or spurious associations to be included when analysing their interdependence (Pearl 2009). These need to be accounted for in order to arrive at an approximation of the \u2018true\u2019 underlying dependency structure. The causal association net-work utilizes the PCMCI algorithm, as implemented in the package \u2018TIGRAMITE\u2019 in Python (Runge 2019), that arrives at a solution of the underlying depend-ency structure through iterative conditional inde-pendence testing. Internally, the PCMCI algorithm takes 2 processing steps. First, given a set of time se-ries, the PC1 algorithm constructs a graphical model in which all time series and their time-lagged compo-nents form separate nodes. For each of these nodes or time series variables, the PC1 algorithm then identi-fies all relevant conditions or \u2018preliminary parents\u2019 in the set , through iterative con-ditional independence testing. This conditional de-pendence can be interpreted as the relation between time series variables 1 and 2, after accounting for the relations existing between all time series variables within the set. The time series variables with signifi-cant relations to the focal time series after accounting for all relationships in the set form the preliminary parents of that focal time series. This first step reduces dimensionality, i.e. it identifies all relevant connections in the graph for a given time series vari-able and a first estimation of their strength, and will thereby increase the detection power for underlying causal relations. In the second step, the MCI algo-rithm addresses the false positives, i.e. spurious or inflated links found between the time series variables.\nIt does so by repeating the iterative conditional inde-pendence tests, but now conditioning on both the preliminary parents of and the time-shifted parents of (Runge et al. 2019b). Thus the graphi-cal model contains the focal time series variable, its preliminary parents and their preliminary parents.\nThis second step is therefore well suited to identifying spurious or in flated relationships originating from common drivers. Those time series variables with sig-nificant relations to the focal time series variable after this second iterative testing phase are included in the final causal association network. The final causal association network thus represents the algorithm\u2019s approximation of the underlying causal dependency structure existing between the set of time series.\nOur time series covered 42 yr, which is extensive in ecology, but relatively limited in data science. We therefore used the linear partial correlation test, a maximum time lag of 2 yr, and let the PC1 algorithm choose the optimal \u03b1 level for condition selection. As the linear partial correlation test is sensitive to out-liers, we applied a 95% winsorization to the data prior to analysis (Reifman & Keyton 2010). Confi-dence intervals were generated using bootstrapping, and inferences on the conditional dependence be -,..., 1 X X X t j t t N { } \u03b5 \u02c6 P Xt j ( ) Xt j Xt i \u2212\u03c4 132 Fig. 2.

Common drivers and in direct ef-fects can yield spurious associations that are accounted for in our approach. The dots in panel b represent observed biomass density values, the blue line is a fitted trend with 95% confidence bounds indicated in gray shading. Figure adapted from Runge et al. (2019a) Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed tween time series were made using a shuffle test with 3000 trials. We further corrected the results for the total number of pairwise tests performed by ap -plying the false discovery rate procedure of Benja -mini & Hochberg (1995). The final causal association network included those links between time series significant at an \u03b1 level of 0.05. If links occurred between 2 time series at multiple lags, the strongest link was included in the network. Rather than print-ing the full causal association network found for each species, which would result in a cluttered and un -clear overview, we report the results as follows: (1) For each species, we report the number of seascapes with biomass density trends independent of their adjacent seascapes at time lag zero. This provides a link back to our initial hypothesis that the contrasting conditions in seascapes are reflected in contrasting biomass density trends. (2) We produce a species-specific map where relationships at time lag zero are indicated by the borders between adjacent seascapes, and relationships over longer time lags between all seascapes are indicated by arrows.\n2.3.2. Post-hoc test to link life histories to causal relationships We conducted a post-hoc test to better understand the variables driving the observed dependencies in biomass density between seascapes at different time lags. More specifically, we used a random forest clas-sifier (RFC) model to predict the presence of causal relationships between seascapes based on a set of 17 variables pertaining to life history, the biomass den-sity of different life stages and environmental condi-tions (see Table S1 in the Supplement at www. int-res. com/ articles/ suppl/ m677 p129 _ supp .pdf).\n2.3.3. Variable collection We extracted 9 features related to life-history strate-gies from the marine fish trait database of Beukhof et al. (2019). Next, for every year and seascape combi-nation, we calculated the absolute dif ference in bio-mass density of small and large size classes in the juvenile and adult life stages. To do this, we first determined the length at maturation to split the IBTS data between adult and juvenile biomass density.\nNext, for each of these groups, we made an equal split between the 50% largest and 50% smallest individuals in terms of length. We then aggregated the data into a single data frame listing the biomass density of the 4 groups (small juveniles, large juve-niles, small adults, large adults) in each haul. Next, we computed the mean biomass density of each group per haul per year. Finally, we calculated the difference in mean biomass density per haul per year between different seascapes for each group. This dataframe was combined with the life-history trait dataframe to produce the final feature dataset for training. As there was a class imbalance in the label data between the number of samples with and with-out causal lag, we used a cost-sensitive learning ap -proach and weighted the classes according to their representation in the dataset (Weiss et al. 2007).\n2.3.4. Model training and performance We further optimised hyperparameters of the RFC through a grid search on the maximum depth, mini-mum samples per split, minimum samples per leaf and the number of trees. The final RFC model with causal lag zero as the label feature included 300 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits, a minimum 10 samples per leaf and split. The final RFC model with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature consisted of 500 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits and a minimum of 10 samples per leaf and 15 per split.\nBefore training, we split 50% of the data into a vali-dation set, and, during training, we used stratified K-fold cross validation with 5 splits (Refaeilzadeh et al.\n2009). We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values and a confusion matrix, from which we could calculate recall and pre-cision, to evaluate model performance. The model was run twice, once with causal lag zero as the label feature, and once with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature. The model performed well on the validation set in both runs, with an AUC of 98.0 and 98.2%, a recall of 95.2 and 97.1% and precision of 93.0 and 91.6%, respectively. This is further illustrated in the confusion matrixes in Fig. S1.\n2.3.5. Variable importance We calculated the importance of each of the 17 variables in predicting the presence of a causal de - pendency between seascapes at various time lags using the \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 function in the \u2018SHAP\u2019 pack-age (Lundberg et al. 2020). \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 is based on game theory and approximates Shapley values to compute the contribution of a target variable to the predicted output of tree-based machine learning 133 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 models (Shapley 1953, Lundberg & Lee 2017). It does so by re-running model predictions on the test data-set using all different combinations between vari-ables excluding the target variable, and then repeats this process, now including the target variable. The algorithm then computes the contribution of the tar-get variable based on the average difference in pre-dicted outcomes (Molnar 2020).\n3. RESULTS 3.1. Causal associations The final causal association networks of all 9 spe-cies indicated the existence of independent trends in fish biomass between adjacent seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr. The mean number of seascapes with bio-mass density trends that were independent of adja-cent seascapes at a time lag of zero was 4.7 \u00b1 2.4 SD.\nThis level of independence in biomass density trends at a time lag of zero was highest for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua (8 out of 10 seascapes), European plaice Pleuronectes platessa (7 out of 10 seascapes) and Atlantic herring Clupea harengus (7 out of 10 sea -scapes). It was lowest for starry ray Amblyraja radi-ata (1 out of 10 seascapes) and dragonet Callionymus lyra (2 out of 10 seascapes). This result was inter-preted as the separation between seascapes repre-senting relevant barriers to the processes determin-ing the observed biomass density of Atlantic cod, European plaice and Atlantic herring, but not to those of the starry ray and dragonet. In the remaining 4 species, independence in fish biomass density trends be tween adjacent sites at a time lag of zero ranged be tween 3 and 6 out of 10 seascapes. In these cases, only certain seascapes represented relevant borders to the processes determining the ob -served biomass density, whereas the biomass density trends were directly dependent on each other in the re -maining ad jacent seascapes. An addi-tional type of relationship observed was a temporal dependency at a time lag of zero be tween non-adjacent sea-scapes (Table 2).\nSpecies could be further subdivided based on the level of causal depend-encies in biomass density trends be -tween seascapes at longer time lags of 1\u22122 yr, and the directional gradient in these dynamics. Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting Merlangius merlangus and starry ray were characterized by time-lagged causal dependencies be tween distant seascapes in both directions along the North\u2212South gradient (Fig. 3). In grey gurnard Eu trigla gurnardus and At -lantic herring, exchanges were predominantly uni-directional from South to North (Fig. 4a,b). In drag-onet, ex changes occurred from East to West and from North to South (Fig. 4c). Finally, there was only a sin-gle time-lagged ex change in European sprat Sprat-tus sprattus (Fig. 5a), and no time-lagged ex changes in common dab Limanda limanda (Fig. 5b).\n3.2. Post-hoc test The RFC found that species with a non-fusiform body type, that are strictly demersal, with low to inter-mediate fecundity and maximum age, were most im -portant in predicting the presence of a causal relation-ship between seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr (Fig. 6a).\nThis is opposite to those variables best explaining longer-term causal dependencies at time lags of 1\u2212 2 yr (Fig. 6b). In that case, long-lived, benthopelagic species of large maximum size best predict the pres-ence of causal relationships between seascapes. Fur-thermore, the probability of long-term causal depend-encies between seascapes was positively impacted by small differences in juvenile biomass density and negatively impacted by large differences.\n4. DISCUSSION We found evidence for relationships between the spatial organisation of the seabed structure, i.e. sea-scapes, and population trends of several fish species in the North Sea.

This finding provides the insight that seascapes can function as a bottom-up driver of North Sea fish population dynamics. However, a con-siderable level of caution is warranted in interpreting 135 Fig. 3. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes for (a) Atlantic cod, (b) whiting, (c) starry ray and (d) European plaice. In all 4 species, time-lagged exchanges occur predominantly in both directions between more northern and southern seascapes. Arrow colour and width represent the type and strength of the relationship (red = positive, blue = negative, thin = weak, thick = strong) between different areas. The associated time-lag is listed on the arrow, and if a contemporaneous relationship was present, the border between the areas was removed Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 the results, as the relative standard error in estimated biomass density over time frequently exceeded 30% for species and seascape combinations (Table S2).\nWe further found both positive and negative causal dependencies between seascapes at time lags of 1\u22122 yr in most species. Species such as Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting and starry ray dis-played clear directional gradients in these longer-term dependencies along a North\u2212South gradient.\nPositive long-term dependencies can potentially be explained by both movement of adult biomass to, and recruitment of juvenile biomass in, the depend-ent seascapes. Negative long-term dependencies cannot be explained by the process of recruitment.\nHowever, they can still be explained by movement of biomass away from a dependent seascape to sur-136 Fig. 4. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. In (a) grey gurnard and (b) Atlantic herring, a few time-lagged exchanges occur from southern to northern seascapes, whereas in (c) drago -net, exchanges went from northern to southern and eastern to western seascapes. Other details as in Fig. 3 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed rounding areas following accumulation of biomass in the driving seascape. The dependent seascape could in this case be considered suboptimal, and the driv-ing seascape more optimal. This would be the in -verse process of that described by the basin model theory (McCall 1990), in which there is adult move-ment away from optimal basins, or seascapes in this case, to suboptimal surrounding basins following the buildup of biomass in the former (Bertrand et al. 2008, Hintzen et al. 2014).\nOur post-hoc test provided a deeper understanding of the ecological meaning of the observed depend-encies at different time lags. We found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat prefer-ences best explained short-term causal dependencies.\nThis combination is particular to the flatfish and ray included in the present study. This might be due to multiple factors. Flatfish such as European plaice ex -hibit more restricted movement patterns and stronger selection of small-scale variations in sediment type compared to benthopelagic species such as Atlantic cod (Gibson & Robb 2000, Hinz et al. 2006, Griffiths et al. 2018). Therefore, smaller-scale processes than those delineated by the seascapes might be more important in these species at the 0 yr time lag. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density be -tween seascapes were best explained by the adults of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species. In these species, the recruitment of juveniles is unlikely to drive the observed dynamics because differences in juvenile biomass negatively affected the probability of long-term causal dependencies.\nIn this study, we also addressed a missing link be -tween seascape-specific fisheries activities in the North Sea (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018) and the bio-mass of harvested stocks. van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018, their Fig. 3) showed fishing intensity with a beam trawl to target plaice was highest in seascapes 10 and 7, and the northern part of seascape 6, while otter-mix fishing was highest in the centre of seascape 9 and along the northern and southern borders of sea-scape 8. If these fishing activities affect the distribu-tion of fish biomass, we might have expected to see some effect of this in the post-hoc test. An example would be that short-term ex changes in (adult) bio-mass between intensively and less intensively fished adjacent seascapes are important in explaining the observed causal dependencies. However, no specific combination of seascape pairs was found to be im -portant in explaining the ob served dependencies.\nAlthough it might be tentative to place an explicit link between seascape-specific fisheries activities and exchanges in fish biomass, separate quantitative analysis, including North Sea-wide fishing intensity, 137 Fig. 5. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. (a) In European sprat, there is a single time-lagged exchange and (b) in common dab, there is no time-lagged exchange; both species therefore lack a clear gradient of exchange. Other details as in Fig. 3 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 would be required to provide more conclusive evi-dence. The study of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018) was based on Dutch fishing fleet data. Consequently, sea-scapes that are assumed to be free from high fishing pressure, based on Dutch data, might turn out to be intensively used by the fleets of other nations.\nThe methodological novelty of our study lies in the application of a causal association network for hypo -thesis testing using ecological time series. These types of data are typical of long-term monitoring programmes, and causal association networks there-fore have a potentially wide applica-bility in ecology. The advantage of this specific causality-based approach is that it explicitly accounts for in -flated or spurious correlations be -tween time series (Pearl 2009). Using a method that accounts for this con-founding effect differentiates our work from other, recent research examin-ing dependencies between time series of fish populations and the environ-ment. For example, Milligan et al.\n(2020) examined time-lagged depend-encies between resource productiv-ity and abundances in deep-sea fish using additive models in combination with cross-correlation analysis. Addi-tive models are a popular tool in ecol-ogy because they can include the effects of categorical and continuous covariates in fitting statistical trends to population time series (Zuur et al.\n2017, Pedersen et al. 2019). Cross-correlating such fitted statistical trends to extract time-lagged dependencies increases the risk of finding spurious relationships inherent to time series analysis (Yule 1926, Olden & Neff 2001, Runge et al. 2014). Although causal association networks explicitly account for this confounding effect, they are not able to include both cat-egorical and continuous covariates a priori. Additional insights can be gained indirectly through post-hoc testing as was done in the present study. However, this approach does not provide the explanatory power on the effects of environmental covariates that additive modelling provides. Therefore, a decision on which combination of methods to apply in future ecological 138 Fig. 6.

The presence of causal dependencies between seascapes was best explained by different types of life history traits at different time lags. In a qualitative comparison with previous research, we did not find a clear link be -tween seascape-specific fishery activities and bio-mass trends. Finally, the suitability of using causal association networks to model spatial time series in ecology will depend both on the types of effects a researcher wants to include and the need to model time-lagged dependencies.\nAcknowledgements.

Ocean heat waves are phenomena in which ocean temperatures increase rapidly over a period of several days to several years. The frequency of their occurrence has increased significantly over the past 100 years, and may have been a factor in the expansion of the red tide along the Pacific coast of Hokkaido in September 2021.

It influences climate and weather around the world and is home to millions of different forms of life.1 Thriving marine ecosystems provide Americans with food, medicines, jobs, and recreation. The ocean also connects people to nature and is critical to some Native cultures.\nCoral bleaching. Coral reefs are home to many sea creatures. When water is too warm or too cold, coral becomes damaged in a process called bleaching. If bleaching goes on for too long, it can kill the coral.39\nDead Zones. Harmful algal blooms (HABs), sometimes called red tides, have been linked to increasing temperatures in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Some species of HABs can produce excessive amounts of biomass that can prevent light from getting below the ocean surface. As these organisms die and decompose, oxygen levels go down, making it harder for other organisms to survive. Other species of HABs can produce toxins that are hazardous to marine life and humans.\nThreats to subsistence fishing. Salmon and other types of fish are an essential part of subsistence fishing in Alaska. Climate change is making it difficult for Indigenous people to practice fishing traditions.\nWildlife impacts. A 2014 marine heatwave caused the death of many sea lions.35 The warm water caused the fish that the sea lions eat to move elsewhere. As a result, thousands of sea lion pups starved.\nDecreases in commercial fishing harvests. America\u2019s East Coast is projected to see a 20% to 30% decrease in fish harvests by 2060.36 Climate change will drive fish further north as waters heat up.\nIncreasing emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels are causing changes in the ocean (see box). These changes can alter which species of marine life thrive best in certain areas. For example, many fish have shifted their typical range as water temperatures rise.2 However, other species are expected to decline in number or leave areas that are no longer favorable for them.3 These shifts can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems and on fishing communities.4\nMany climate change impacts will only be avoided by reducing carbon dioxide emissions.5 Climate-driven changes in the ocean are motivating people to find solutions to the new challenges. For example, new forecast tools are helping predict changes in ocean conditions that can help the fishing industry adapt. Many organizations are working together to protect coral reefs, which face hazards such as bleaching, infectious diseases, smothering from sediment, collapses in fish stocks, and other issues. Such strategies can help preserve and protect marine resources. Even with these efforts, however, it will take decades or longer for the ocean to recover.\nExplore the sections on this page to learn more about climate impacts on the ocean and marine resources:\nClimate Change Impacts on the Ocean\nHuman-caused carbon dioxide emissions are affecting the ocean in three main ways:\nTop Climate Impacts on the Ocean and Marine Resources\nClimate change affects the ocean in many ways. Three key impacts are described in this section.\n1. Changes in Ocean Ecosystems\nClimate changes to the physical and chemical makeup of the ocean have significant impacts on marine ecosystems. For example, water temperature influences which species can live in an area. Acidification affects many animals\u2019 ability to make shells or skeletons, while low oxygen levels can contribute to hypoxia, or dead zones. Warm temperatures can exacerbate the effects of both acidification and hypoxia.6\nImpacts on one species can ripple across an entire ecosystem. For example, plankton\u2014tiny organisms at the bottoms of many marine food chains\u2014are sensitive to water temperatures and oxygen concentrations. They can die off if the water gets too warm. Animals farther up the food chain, like whales, can suffer food shortages when this happens.\nClimate changes to the marine environment will come in many forms. For instance, the diversity of some temperate ecosystems is expected to increase.7 But overall, climate change is projected to disrupt marine ecosystems in ways that reduce the services they provide and their diversity of life.8\n2. More Common and Severe Extreme Marine Events\nRising water temperatures, acidification, and low oxygen levels can combine with natural ocean cycles to create extreme marine events. Marine heat waves, dead zones, and coral bleaching are just a few examples of these events, which are projected to become more common and severe.10 Extreme events can harm marine ecosystems and communities connected to these systems. For example, a large heat wave off the West Coast in 2014 shut down crab fisheries and starved baby sea lions.11\n3. Impacts on Marine Fisheries\nCommercial and recreational marine fisheries in some regions are at high risk from climate-driven changes in the size and distribution of fish populations.12 Some fish species have already altered their geographic range in response to climate change. For example, pollock and cod are moving north to colder water as local ocean temperatures rise.13\nThe movement of fish into new areas disrupts the ecosystems that they move into. It can also cause confusion about what fishing regulations apply.14 Changes in where fish live may also mean boats have to travel further from ports, potentially increasing costs.15\nClimate change is also affecting the timing of seasonal events, which can affect fisheries. For example, some species, such as striped bass, are spawning earlier in the year.16 This means that catches can peak earlier than normal. Fisheries will need to adapt to such changes or risk reduced catches and lost revenues, which can also increase prices for consumers.17\nChanges in the locations and number of fish species in the ocean can present new opportunities in some cases. For example, scientists predict that some areas, such as the Bering Sea, will see more kinds of fish as warming waters drive populations north.18 This could lead to new fishing opportunities and economic growth in that region.\nFor more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate Assessment.\nThe Marine Environment and the Economy\nMany U.S. industries depend on the ocean. The marine economy generated over $665 billion in sales in 2019, with tourism and recreation, including recreational fishing, making up more than one-third of that total.20 The marine economy also generated $397 billion in gross domestic product (GDP), which was 1.9% of the national GDP.21\nCommercial fisheries are an important contributor to the economy. In 2019, they produced 9.3 billion pounds of seafood valued at $5.5 billion.22 Other businesses, such as grocery stores, tackle shops, and restaurants, also benefit from fishery-related products and services.\nAs of 2019, almost 2.4 million Americans had jobs related to the ocean in fields including fisheries, construction, tourism, real estate, food service, and transportation.23 The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are both key trade channels for importing and exporting goods.24 The United States also extracts oil, gas, sand, and gravel from the ocean.\nThe ocean also provides many benefits that are harder to measure in economic terms. These are called ecosystem services. Carbon storage, water filtration, and shoreline protection are just a few of the many ecosystem services that the ocean provides.\nEnvironmental Justice and Equity\nHealthy oceans provide Americans with food and employment and are important to cultural traditions. Climate change leaves communities that depend on the ocean vulnerable to hardship. Many fishing communities already experience high rates of poverty.25 Unstable fish populations and market pricing can hurt fishing communities\u2019 earnings.26 This is especially true if a community depends on a single species for their livelihoods.\nOcean health is a cornerstone of many Indigenous cultures. Native American, Pacific Islander, and Alaska Native communities often practice subsistence fishing.27,28 Fluctuating fish populations can lead to food insecurity for rural Alaskan villages, where many people depend on locally caught fish for a large portion of their diet.29 For example, populations of Chinook and chum salmon hit record lows in 2021, leading to the closure of subsistence salmon fishing for much of the year.30 The number of shellfish, another important part of subsistence diets, has also been declining due to ocean acidification.31\nClimate change also affects Indigenous people culturally. Gathering and preparing food provide social, spiritual, and economic benefits for Indigenous communities.32,33 Disruptions to subsistence practices have negative health outcomes such as anxiety disorders and feelings of isolation.34\nWhat We Can Do\nWe can help reduce the impact of climate change on the marine environment in many ways, including the following:\nSee additional actions you can take, as well as steps that companies can take, on EPA\u2019s What You Can Do About Climate Change page.\nRelated Resources\nRelated Climate Indicators\nLearn more about some of the key indicators of climate change related to this sector from EPA\u2019s Climate Change Indicators in the United States:\nEndnotes\n1\u00a0National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

    "document": "How to Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity: Key Methods for Accurate Bed Utilization\nTo calculate hospital bed capacity, use the formula: (Inpatient Days of Care / Bed Days Available) x 100. This formula determines the occupancy rate, providing valuable insights into bed utilization. The occupancy rate is normally calculated for specific periods such as a month or a year.\nSecond, the bed occupancy rate (BOR) method assesses the ratio of occupied beds to available beds, expressed as a percentage. To calculate BOR, divide the number of occupied beds by the total number of beds and multiply by 100. This method effectively highlights the efficiency of bed usage within a hospital.\nThird, the turnover interval (TI) method, which measures the time between a bed becoming vacant and being filled by the next patient, helps in understanding bed availability and throughput. A shorter turnover interval indicates higher efficiency.\nFourth, the bed manager\u2019s tool (BMT) involves real-time tracking software that updates bed status and predicts future occupancy trends. This dynamic approach allows for better resource allocation and immediate response to capacity issues.\nAccurately assessing hospital bed capacity ensures optimal resource use and improved patient care.\nIn the next section, we\u2019ll explore the impact of accurate bed utilization on hospital operations and patient outcomes. Understanding these effects can guide strategic decisions in health care management.\nWhat You Will Learn?\nWhat is Hospital Bed Capacity and Why Does It Matter?\nHospital bed capacity refers to the total number of beds available for patient care within a healthcare facility. This term encompasses both general and specialized beds, including those for intensive care and other critical needs.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospital capacity is a key component in assessing healthcare system functionality and responsiveness. The WHO emphasizes the need for adequate hospital bed capacity to ensure quality patient care.\nHospital bed capacity includes several aspects, such as the physical space, staff availability, and the types of services offered. It directly affects patient wait times, treatment outcomes, and the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also notes that bed capacity is crucial for managing public health emergencies and planning healthcare resources effectively. They define it as an essential metric for healthcare quality and operational management.\nSeveral factors influence hospital bed capacity. These factors include population demographics, disease prevalence, public health initiatives, and hospital financing. Resource allocation and administrative strategies also play significant roles.\nIn the United States, as of 2022, there were approximately 920,000 hospital beds available, according to the American Hospital Association. Projections suggest that this number may not meet increasing healthcare demands in the coming years due to an aging population.\nLimited hospital bed capacity can lead to overcrowding, longer wait times, and compromised patient care. These issues can impact patient satisfaction, recovery times, and healthcare system resilience during crises.\nThe implications extend beyond health, affecting economic stability and social equity. Delays in care can lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates, straining both families and healthcare systems.\nExamples include the COVID-19 pandemic, where hospitals faced significant bed shortages, resulting in adverse health outcomes and increased strain on healthcare workers.\nTo address bed capacity issues, the WHO recommends developing flexible healthcare models and increasing investment in hospital infrastructure. Strengthening primary care can also alleviate pressure on hospitals.\nTechnologies such as telemedicine and predictive analytics can help optimize bed management. These strategies improve patient flow and promote more efficient resource utilization across healthcare systems.\nWhat Key Factors Should Be Considered When Calculating Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity involves considering several key factors that influence patient placement and care efficiency.\nThe main factors to consider when calculating hospital bed capacity include:\nPatient Demographics: Patient demographics refer to the characteristics of the population served by the hospital. This includes age, gender, and health conditions. Hospitals must assess the age distribution, as geriatric patients often require longer stays. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) indicates that older patients tend to have more complex health needs, which can impact bed utilization.\nHospital Type and Specialty: Hospital type and specialty involve the nature of services provided. General hospitals have different bed needs compared to specialized facilities like pediatric or oncology hospitals. Specialized hospitals may experience fluctuating admission patterns based on regional disease prevalence. For example, a pediatric hospital must accommodate fluctuating demand during flu season.\nBed Occupancy Rates: Bed occupancy rates measure the percentage of occupied beds at a given time. High occupancy rates can indicate a need for additional beds. According to the American Hospital Association (AHA), maintaining an occupancy rate between 85% and 90% is ideal for operational efficiency. Rates above or below this range can signal potential issues in resource allocation.\nAverage Length of Stay: Average length of stay (ALOS) represents the typical duration a patient spends in the hospital. A high ALOS can reduce bed availability and increase demand for capacity. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that ALOS varies by country and health care system, influencing capacity calculations.\nSeasonal Fluctuations: Seasonal fluctuations in patient admissions occur due to various factors, such as flu seasons or public health emergencies. Hospitals must anticipate these changes to optimize bed use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented increased hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses during winter months, affecting capacity planning.\nStaffing Levels: Staffing levels influence bed capacity since sufficient healthcare workers are necessary for proper patient care. Staffing shortages can lead to restricted bed availability, particularly in critical care units. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospitals with adequate staffing ratios can provide better care and manage capacity effectively.\nLocal Health Care Regulations: Local health care regulations can impact bed capacity and hospital operations. Regulations may dictate minimum staffing levels, licensing requirements, or limits on bed expansion. An understanding of local laws is essential for accurate capacity calculations. The Joint Commission outlines regulations that must be followed to maintain operational compliance and patient safety.\nBy considering these factors, hospitals can more accurately calculate their bed capacity and ensure they meet the needs of their communities effectively.\nWhich Types of Beds Are Included in Hospital Bed Capacity Calculations?\nHospital bed capacity calculations typically include several types of beds. The main types are as follows:1. Acute Care Beds2. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds3. Rehabilitation Beds4. Long-Term Care Beds5. Observation Beds\nAcute Care Beds: Acute care beds are essential for patients who require immediate medical treatment. These beds accommodate individuals with severe health conditions or those recovering from surgeries. According to the American Hospital Association, acute care represents the majority of inpatient services, highlighting the importance of these beds in a hospital\u2019s capacity. An example is a post-operative patient who stays overnight for monitoring.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients. These beds feature advanced medical equipment and constant monitoring. The ratio of ICU beds varies worldwide, with a study in Europe showing an average of 6.5 ICU beds per 100,000 population. For example, a patient with severe respiratory failure may require an ICU bed for specialized care.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients.

Understanding each type helps optimize resource allocation in healthcare facilities.\nHow Do Patient Admissions Impact Hospital Bed Capacity?\nPatient admissions significantly affect hospital bed capacity by determining how many patients a hospital can accommodate at any given time. Increased admissions can lead to bed shortages, impacting care delivery efficiency.\nThe relationship between patient admissions and hospital bed capacity can be understood through several key points:\nPatient Flow: High admission rates increase the turnover of beds. For example, according to a study by Lemaire et al. (2020), hospitals with improved patient flow can reduce average length of stay and turnover time, enhancing bed availability.\nBed Occupancy Rates: When admissions exceed discharges, bed occupancy rates rise. Research from the American Hospital Association found that optimal occupancy should be around 85% to allow for new admissions while avoiding overcrowding (AHA, 2018). Rates above this can lead to delays in care and may force hospitals to divert patients to other facilities.\nSeasonal Variations: Certain seasons, such as winter, see increased respiratory illnesses leading to higher admission rates. A study from the Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019) indicated a 20% spike in admissions during flu season, stressing bed capacity further.\nCrisis Situations: Events like pandemics or natural disasters drastically inflate admission numbers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that hospitals reached critical capacity levels, as shown in data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020).\nElective Procedures: Scheduling and rescheduling of elective surgeries also directly impact bed availability. A report by the National Institute of Health highlighted that postponing elective surgeries can improve bed capacity for acute admissions (NIH, 2021).\nDischarge Planning: Effective discharge planning can minimize bed delays. According to healthcare guidelines from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, timely and organized discharge processes can lower the average length of stay, facilitating quicker admissions.\nOverall, effective management of patient admissions is essential for maintaining hospital bed capacity and ensuring that patient care remains optimal.\nWhat Methods Can Be Used to Accurately Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity accurately involves using several methods that assess various aspects of bed utilization, patient flow, and facility design.\nThe main methods for calculating hospital bed capacity are as follows:\nBed Occupancy Rate (BOR):\nThe Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) is a measure that indicates the percentage of total hospital beds occupied over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the number of occupied beds by the total number of available beds and multiplying by 100. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an optimal occupancy rate is generally between 85-90%. Higher rates may indicate overcrowding, while lower rates may signal underutilization. A case study from a study by B. C. R. Chan (2020) showed that maintaining an occupancy rate above 90% in acute care hospitals can lead to increased hospital-associated infections and lower patient satisfaction.\nPatient Days Method:\nPatient Days Method:\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed. This method requires keeping detailed records of patient admissions and discharges. The American Hospital Association indicates that an average hospital bed should ideally accommodate 2.5 patient days per bed each day. For example, if a hospital has 100 beds and is operating at the recommended rate, it should aim for 250 patient days daily. This method helps in understanding bed utilization trends over time.\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.
