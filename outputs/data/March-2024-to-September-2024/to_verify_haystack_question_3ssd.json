By default, the long-term linear\r\ntrend is also shown, in red, along with its 95% confidence interval. The plotted values are relative\r\nto the most recent Mean Sea Level datum\r\nestablished by NOAA CO-OPS.\nOptions\n\n Show calculated linear trend (linear regression)\r\n \u00a0  Show linear trend 95% confidence intervals\u2020\n\r\n \u00a0  Show linear trend 95% prediction intervals\u2020\u00a0\n Show quadratic regression\r\n \u00a0  Show quadratic trend 95% confidence intervals\u2020\r\n \u00a0  Show quadratic trend 95% prediction intervals\u2020\u00a0\n Show NOAA's linear trend\r\n \u00a0  Show NOAA's linear trend 95% confidence intervals\u00a0\n Show CO2 levels\u00a0\nBoxcar smoothing: \u00a0  Enable \u00a0\r\n Width:  \u00a0 \u00a0\r\n Repeat: \u00a0\u00a0\nLine weight: thin\u00a0\r\n medium\u00a0\r\n thick \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\r\n color scheme: \u00a0\n\n\nData source:\r\nAll\u00a0\r\n NOAA\u00a0\r\nPSMSL\n\u00a0\n\n\r\n   Height:  pixels\r\n   (default 450).\r\n   Width:\u00a0  pixels\r\n   (default is determined by window width).\r\n   Or, to change graph width, resize browser window and click:\u00a0\r\n Update\n\nSource: ? months from NOAA + ? months from PSMSL.\r\n\n\n\n\nClick\r\n \nhere for a down\u00adload\u00adable, book\u00admark\u00adable image\r\n\r\n(except in Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge, use\r\nPrtScn,\r\nor see  NOAA's version, or\r\nPSMSL's version.)\r\n\nFor\r\n \r\na simple explan\u00ada\u00adtion\r\nof the mean\u00ading of the 95% con\u00adfi\u00addence & pre\u00addic\u00adtion inter\u00adval traces shown in the graph, see\r\nthis two-minute instruc\u00adtional video,\r\nby Dr. Gerard Verschuuren.\nRegressions\u2009\r\nLinear:\r\n \u00a0 y = B + M\u00b7x\r\n \u00a0 y = B + M\u00b7x mm\u2009\r\nQuadratic:\r\n \u00a0 y = B' + M\u00b7x + A\u00b7x\u00b2\r\n \u00a0 y = B + M\u00b7x + A\u00b7x\u00b2 mm\u2009\r\nwhere:\r\n \u00a0 Date range = (1935) to (2015)\r\n \u00a0 x = (date - avg(date))\u00a0 (date)\r\n \u00a0 slope = M =  \u00b1 mm/yr\r\n \u00a0 acceleration = 2\u00b7A = 2\u00d7A =  \u00b1 mm/yr\u00b2\n\nPasteable\u2009\r\n \u00a0 linear trend =  \u00b1 mm/yr\r\n \u00a0 acceleration =  \u00b1 mm/yr\u00b2\n\nTo see precise values, hover your mouse cursor over the graph traces (or touch the graph on a touch-screen).\nThe JSON data file containing all data used to produce this page may be downloaded here\r\n(see documentation). To download the seasonally-adjusted monthly MSL data from NOAA in CSV format\r\n click here,\r\n\r\nor for unadjusted (\"raw\") data\r\nclick here.\nWe also have a graph of just carbon dioxide (CO2) levels,\r\nand a combined graph of CO2 and CH4.\n\u2020Calculation of Confidence Intervals and Prediction Intervals\r\nfor monthly Mean Sea-Level (MSL) is complicated by the fact that MSL measurement data is serially autocorrelated. That means\r\neach month's MSL measurement is correlated, to an extent which varies by location, with the MSL measurements of the previous\r\nand next months. That means there are effectively fewer independent measurements, which would cause a naive confidence interval\r\ncalculation to underestimate the breadth of the intervals. The code here follows the method of Zervas 2009, \u201cSea Level\r\nVariations of the United States 1854-2006,\u201d\nNOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 053 (or here), p. 15-24, to\r\naccount for autocorrelation, when calculating confidence intervals and prediction intervals. That isn't the only way to do it,\r\nthough, and one of the items on my to-do list is to examine alternative approaches.\r\n\n\u2021Some data is excluded from regression calculations\n\nReferences\u00a0\u2191I am grateful to the following data providers:\n1.

      "Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\nMain navigation\nHeader Buttons\nBreadcrumb\nWhere Does the Budget Stand Compared to Historical Averages?\n\nRecently, there has been a lot of discussion over whether the country has a revenue problem or a spending problem. While there is no way to definitively answer that question \u2013 by definition, our fiscal problems are due to the disconnect between spending and revenue \u2013 one way to evaluate our situation would be to put spending and revenue in a historical context as a share of economic output. From that perspective, it is clear the answer is \"both.\"\nIncorporating the effects of the recent budget deal, federal spending is expected to total 21.1 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, while revenue is expected to total about 16.6 percent of GDP. With 50-year historical averages for spending and revenue at 20.3 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively, that means spending will be higher and revenue will be lower than their historical\u00a0averages by about the same amount:\u00a00.8 percent of GDP.\nThis wasn't always so. As recently as 2017, revenue was close to its historical average, and as recently as 2018, spending was as well. But thanks in large part to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, both have departed from these averages.\nDue to the rising costs of health, retirement, and interest spending, spending is projected to diverge from its average even further. We estimate that over the next decade, spending will rise to 23.1\u00a0percent of GDP by 2029, which is 2.8 percentage points\u00a0above the historical average. Revenue will rise above its historical average but largely because the net revenue-losing portions of the TCJA are scheduled to expire, mostly after 2025. If those and other tax cuts were continued as the Congressional Budget Office presents in its Alternative Fiscal Scenario (AFS), revenue would remain below its historical average at least through the next decade, with revenue 0.4 percentage points below that average in 2029.\u00a0\nThe fact that spending and revenue are above and below their historical averages, respectively, is troubling, especially since even at these\u00a0averages debt has risen by about 50 percent of GDP over the past half century to its highest level since just after World War II.\nIn the past when the economy was strong and unemployment was low, revenue usually rose above average levels as a share of GDP while spending fell below. This time, policymakers have continued to cut taxes and increase spending regardless of the fiscal consequences.\nTrending\n$700 Billion of Easy Deficit Reduction\nWith the national debt approaching record levels and interest costs exploding, lawmakers will need to consider substantial spending cuts and revenue increases to put the national debt on a more...\nAs the Fed Cuts Rates, Treasury Yields Are Rising\nWith last week\u2019s rate decision, the Federal Reserve has now cut the federal funds rate by 75 basis points over the past eight weeks.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

Power\nTroy, Mich.\u2014While customer satisfaction with the dealer service experience has rebounded this year, dealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments, according to the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) Study. Overall customer service satisfaction improves five points to 851 (on a 1,000-point scale).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an improvement in service satisfaction but, unfortunately, the capacity and wait time issues have gotten progressively worse since the pandemic and show no immediate signs of easing up,\u201d said\u00a0Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power. \u201cExcluding Tesla owners, the service experience for BEV owners is underwhelming. As sales of BEVs continue to grow and the industry moves out of the early-adopter phase, the typical owner will not be as willing to tolerate a less-than-stellar service and ownership experience.\n\n\u201cOn the manufacturer side, a higher rate of BEV recalls is also contributing to an inconsistent experience. This is an area that automakers and dealers need to address now to help make the transition to electrification as pain-free as possible for owners in the future.\u201d\nContributing to the poor service experience of non-Tesla BEV owners is a notable lack of trust with servicing dealers to perform complex repairs and provide useful guidance. Overall dealer trust among non-Tesla BEV owners is 5.62 (on a 7-point scale) but jumps to 6.00 among owners of gas-powered vehicles owners and 5.74 among plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners.\n\nThe study, now in its 44th\u00a0year, has grown to include emerging features such as valet service, mobile vehicle servicing and online/smartphone app payment options to gauge the effect these processes have on the service experience. The study measures satisfaction with service at franchised dealer or aftermarket service facilities for maintenance or repair work among owners and lessees of one- to three-year-old vehicles.\nIt also provides a numerical index ranking of the highest-performing automotive brands sold in the United States, which is based on the combined scores of five measures that comprise the vehicle owner service experience. These measures are (in order of importance): service quality; service advisor; vehicle pick-up; service facility; and service initiation. In 2023, model segment rankings were added to the study to differentiate between the service needs of cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans.\nFollowing are key findings of the 2024 study:\nHighest-Ranking Brands and Segments\n\u2022 Lexus\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among premium brands for a third consecutive year, with a score of 897.\u00a0Porsche\u00a0(894) ranks second and\u00a0Cadillac\u00a0(883) ranks third.\n\u2022 Buick\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among mass market brands with a score of 887.\u00a0MINI\u00a0(884) ranks second and\u00a0Subaru\u00a0(877) ranks third.\n\u2022 MINI (877) ranks highest in the mass market car segment, followed by Subaru (874) and\u00a0Mazda\u00a0(867).\n\u2022 Buick ranks highest among mass market SUVs/minivans with a score of 887.\u00a0Mitsubishi\u00a0(877) and Subaru (877) each rank second in a tie.\n\u2022 Porsche (902) ranks highest in the premium car segment, followed by\u00a0Infiniti\u00a0(900) and Lexus (892).\n\u2022 Lexus ranks highest in the premium SUV segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 898. Porsche (889) ranks second and Cadillac (882) ranks third.Nissan\u00a0ranks highest in the truck segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 873.\u00a0Chevrolet\u00a0(856) ranks second and\u00a0Toyota\u00a0(855) ranks third.\n\n\n\n\nNo results found.\nGet The Newsletter\ncontact a sales person\nSupport Center\nMOTOR Magazine\n\u00a9 2024 Hearst Business Publishing, Inc. | \r\n                         Privacy policy | \r\n                         MEDIA | \r\n                         Black Book\n"

      "MOTOR\nResults for {phrase}\n\nAutomotive Data since 1903\n\nDealer Service Satisfaction Improves but Appointment Wait Times Continue to Grow\nDealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments\nBy J.D. Power\nTroy, Mich.\u2014While customer satisfaction with the dealer service experience has rebounded this year, dealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments, according to the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) Study. Overall customer service satisfaction improves five points to 851 (on a 1,000-point scale).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an improvement in service satisfaction but, unfortunately, the capacity and wait time issues have gotten progressively worse since the pandemic and show no immediate signs of easing up,\u201d said\u00a0Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power. \u201cExcluding Tesla owners, the service experience for BEV owners is underwhelming. As sales of BEVs continue to grow and the industry moves out of the early-adopter phase, the typical owner will not be as willing to tolerate a less-than-stellar service and ownership experience.\n\n\u201cOn the manufacturer side, a higher rate of BEV recalls is also contributing to an inconsistent experience. This is an area that automakers and dealers need to address now to help make the transition to electrification as pain-free as possible for owners in the future.\u201d\nContributing to the poor service experience of non-Tesla BEV owners is a notable lack of trust with servicing dealers to perform complex repairs and provide useful guidance. Overall dealer trust among non-Tesla BEV owners is 5.62 (on a 7-point scale) but jumps to 6.00 among owners of gas-powered vehicles owners and 5.74 among plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners.\n\nThe study, now in its 44th\u00a0year, has grown to include emerging features such as valet service, mobile vehicle servicing and online/smartphone app payment options to gauge the effect these processes have on the service experience. The study measures satisfaction with service at franchised dealer or aftermarket service facilities for maintenance or repair work among owners and lessees of one- to three-year-old vehicles.\nIt also provides a numerical index ranking of the highest-performing automotive brands sold in the United States, which is based on the combined scores of five measures that comprise the vehicle owner service experience. These measures are (in order of importance): service quality; service advisor; vehicle pick-up; service facility; and service initiation. In 2023, model segment rankings were added to the study to differentiate between the service needs of cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans.\nFollowing are key findings of the 2024 study:\nHighest-Ranking Brands and Segments\n\u2022 Lexus\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among premium brands for a third consecutive year, with a score of 897.\u00a0Porsche\u00a0(894) ranks second and\u00a0Cadillac\u00a0(883) ranks third.\n\u2022 Buick\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among mass market brands with a score of 887.\u00a0MINI\u00a0(884) ranks second and\u00a0Subaru\u00a0(877) ranks third.\n\u2022 MINI (877) ranks highest in the mass market car segment, followed by Subaru (874) and\u00a0Mazda\u00a0(867).\n\u2022 Buick ranks highest among mass market SUVs/minivans with a score of 887.\u00a0Mitsubishi\u00a0(877) and Subaru (877) each rank second in a tie.\n\u2022 Porsche (902) ranks highest in the premium car segment, followed by\u00a0Infiniti\u00a0(900) and Lexus (892).\n\u2022 Lexus ranks highest in the premium SUV segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 898. Porsche (889) ranks second and Cadillac (882) ranks third.Nissan\u00a0ranks highest in the truck segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 873.\u00a0Chevrolet\u00a0(856) ranks second and\u00a0Toyota\u00a0(855) ranks third.\n\n\n\n\nNo results found.\nGet The Newsletter\ncontact a sales person\nSupport Center\nMOTOR Magazine\n\u00a9 2024 Hearst Business Publishing, Inc. | \r\n                         Privacy policy | \r\n                         MEDIA | \r\n                         Black Book\n"
