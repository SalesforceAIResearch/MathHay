Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.

It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nKenneth Dorell\ninvestor@meta.com\u00a0/ investor.fb.com\nPress:\nRyan Moore\npress@meta.com\u00a0/ about.fb.com/news/\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

    "document": "Knowledge\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Top 5 Trends for Defence in 2024\r\n\t\t\t\nGreat challenges will bring huge opportunities in 2024, as the defence and aerospace industry seeks to rise to a diverse range of hurdles. Amid these headwinds, Defence Engage looks at the trends which could come to characterise 2024, from battling skills shortages to pivotal digitalisation efforts.\nMarked by ongoing conflicts in Israel-Palestine and Ukraine, 2024 will see ongoing tensions with China and Iran which pose significant threats to the international order. Geopolitical concerns aside, the industry grapples with supply chain issues, talent shortages, operational risks, and rising costs amid inflation. In the biggest global election year in history we could see significant strategic changes from key players such as the USA, UK, India, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Russia. Here are the five key trends likely to dominate 2024\u2026\n\u00a0\n#1 AI and digitalisation efforts to bring security and efficiencies\nThe defence industry faces challenges in rapidly adopting new defensive systems and procedures to keep up with adversaries' technological innovations. From upgrading aging software to mitigate cyber threats, to expanding access to, and the adoption of, key cyber credentials, keeping up with digital trends remains pivotal. Meanwhile, governments are prioritising bringing AI to maturity while ensuring its development is safe and responsible. The rapid adoption of AI, spurred by recent advancements like Chat-GPT, is underway in industry, and indeed OpenAI has already started the year by easing its stance on the use of ChatGPT for military purposes.\nThe impact of AI for defence is forecast to be significant, from helping front-line users detect threats to activating cyber defences faster and with greater agility. Additionally, the integration of AI into defence supply chains could improve platform and parts delivery efficiency, reducing delays and costs, whilst improving security. Meanwhile, digital twins, coupled with machine learning, can enhance visibility of supply chain problems or complexities. According to a BAE report, 86% of defence and aerospace decision makers say their nation has adopted AI for defence applications, so the technology is set to become increasingly mature in 2024.\n\u00a0\n#2 Decarbonisation initiatives continue\nFollowing recent data which indicates that 2023 was the hottest year ever, the impetus behind decarbonisation efforts sees renewed urgency. The contribution of the global defence industry to carbon emissions has come under a microscope, with some having suggested that the sector had been overlooked, but there have been some major decarbonisation initiatives, including the establishment of NATO\u2019s Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and the UK\u2019s Sustainable Support Strategy.\nThe impact of climate change upon defence goes beyond the weight of its own contributions, with both the UN and NATO describing climate change as a \u2018threat multiplier\u2019, alluding to the destabilising impact climate can have on societies and economies. Industry is rising to meet the challenge, with innovations such as new power solutions or increased circularity in manufacturing. \u00a0Last year the EU signalled its intention for defence supply chains to become more sustainable, alongside developing more localised energy in a drive for logistical resilience. Individual initiatives such as the Royal Air Force\u2019s first use of sustainable aviation fuel in a fighter aircraft are lighting the way towards a greener, more sustainable, military.\n\u00a0\n#3 Recruitment challenges to persist\nDefence is facing significant challenges when it comes to acquiring talent, skills and retention, from front-line military roles to cyber, quantum and manufacturing. In recent weeks the UK\u2019s Royal Navy has seen significant problems with hiring, at a critical time for the force, with ships being deployed to the Red Sea to counter Houthi Rebels. Last month, the Times reported that Armed forces and defence companies are locked in \u2018a war for talent\u2019.\nDwindling forces are due to the lack of recruits for basic training, a lack of digital skills, and the pull of incentives given by neighbouring sectors. The EU and US have recently signalled their plans to try and combat personnel shortages in key areas. The US\u2019 new Defence Industrial Strategy, cites \u2018workforce readiness\u2019 as a key strategic focus, with a desire to develop a \u2018sufficiently skilled and staffed workforce\u2019. Meanwhile, the European Commission expects skills shortages to increase into the future, with defence urgently requiring skills and talent acquisition, as procurement organisations seek to develop and manage emerging disruptive technologies.\n\u00a0\n#4 Agile supply chains to be prioritised\nThe scramble to arm Ukraine and Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China have highlighted US and allied supply chain vulnerabilities. The last couple of years have seen efforts to build a more resilient supply chain. The US CHIPS act and the EU CHIPS Act designed to securitise semiconductor supply, the European Defence Agency has set out to ensure \u2018security of supply\u2019 across the EU, and at the start of 2024, the US\u2019 Defence Industrial Strategy took aim at supply chain fragility, seeking to make it more sustainable alongside more flexible acquisition processes.\n2024 will see more emphasis on agile supply chains: increasing pressure to move away from lengthy procurement processes that cannot react quickly enough or where the end product could be outdated by the time it comes into service. There will be a race to secure and effect easy access to increasingly scarce resources such as minerals driven by the appetite for batteries and the move away from fossil fuels. The surge of additive manufacturing creates a \u2018just in time\u2019 supply option, while new military tactics such as the use of drones and increasing need for cyber security will continue to push military to commercial and more readily available solutions.\n\u00a0\n#5 Alliances and collaboration lead development and procurement\nCollaborative development programmes such as the sixth-generation fighter efforts: Tempest (by Italy, Japan and the UK) and FCAS (by France, Germany and Spain), are key initiatives designed to combine the best of each nation\u2019s domestic capabilities and combat declining resources. Meanwhile, the AUKUS programme demonstrates how two established nuclear navies (UK and US) are aiding Australia in bolstering Indo-Pacific security. Furthermore, NATO\u2019s Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA), which opened its doors with three innovation challenges in 2023, has established test centres and accelerator units across Europe and North America. The collaboration of NATO members is nothing new, but this more centralised effort to progress on emerging disruptive technologies is hoped to go from strength to strength in 2024.\nGroup-purchases have become increasingly common amongst NATO allies in recent years, with a marked increase since the war in Ukraine began. Just two weeks ago, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain agreed to jointly purchase $5.5 billion worth of Patriot missiles following their effective use observed in Ukraine. Additionally, the research opportunities posed by the war in Ukraine have seen allies and industry testing experimental tech in partnership with Ukrainian soldiers, helping speed up development initiatives, particularly for drones. Following on from the big trend of multi-domain integration, Defence Engage expects multi-national development, purchases and bids to strengthen regional military power and aid embattled allies such as Israel and Ukraine, to continue in 2024 amid ongoing geopolitical upheaval.\n\u00a0\nKeep ahead of the trends\nDefence Engage connects suppliers and buyers to help make defence accessible, follow us on LinkedIn or register for our weekly Defence Contracts Digest to stay apprised of new solutions and collaboration opportunities this year.\nWant to discover more about how Defence Engage can enhance your lead-gen efforts and boost your discoverability in Defence?

Why has the society not made faster progress on cancer front? Why do discoveries in biotechnology sector occur in fits and spurts? We claim that this slow and sporadic progress has a lot to do with the vagaries of capital markets. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s begin with a success story. There is little doubt that BioNTech (Pfizer), Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines had a profound impact on the developed world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Without them, countless more lives and trillions of dollars of economic value would have been further lost. The stock prices of these companies reached dramatic peaks after the world learned about their success. However, as of this week, they have already shed 50% of their peak market values, while we are still in the midst of the pandemic. This rapid rise and fall of these biotechnology stocks is not just about the Covid-vaccine stocks but also about the fortunes of the biotechnology sector as a whole. We describe this roller-coaster phenomenon in this post and claim that this phenomenon is not healthy for the society, particularly given the aging population and increasing need for new healthcare solutions.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best.

(Vol. 60/4) 2018.\nContrary to popular beliefs, most of the new drugs or vaccines are not discovered by big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer or Merck. The development chain of a new life-science product can be divided into several phases: synthesis (discovery of a molecule or formulation), initial research (preclinical tests in lab and trials on animals), and development (human trials). The initial steps are typically taken by individual scientists, biotechnology start-ups, and research labs of universities. Those early-stage discoveries, their patents, or the discovering companies themselves, are then bought by the big pharmaceutical companies. The later steps in the development chain require numerous approvals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is numerous long and costly processes, that can only be done by big pharma. The next steps after FDA approval can also be undertaken only by big pharma: creation of brands through massive advertising campaigns, putting and scaling up manufacturing capabilities, and distribution of drugs using extensive vendor network. Small companies can try, but the likelihood of success is low given their lack of experience and capabilities in these areas. For example, Novavax is yet to be launched in the US, despite a claim that is it a better vaccine than the currently available ones.\nConsider two of Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest drugs from before Covid period: Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Palbociclib (Ibrance). They were discovered by Northwestern University and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blockbuster product, infliximab (Remicade), was synthesized at New York University in collaboration with a small biotechnology company Centocor. More recently, BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s synthesized the Covid Vaccine. It then entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to \u00e2\u0080\u009cleverage Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broad expertise in vaccine research and development, regulatory capabilities, and global manufacturing and distribution network.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biohaven, a small biotech company, relied on Pfizer for the commercialization of its migraine drug Rimegepant.\nIt must be clear from the above discussion that small biotech firms or research labs play the foundational role in innovation of drugs and vaccines. That innovation must benefit the society, evident from the progress in healthcare, physical well being, and increasing longevity of human beings over the last century. Yet, synthesis and discovery are not straightforward activities. Behind each successful product lie millions of research hours and thousands of synthesized products that never see the light of the day. Out of thousands of synthesized molecules, only few reach what is called Phase 1 success, and just 10% of those receive FDA approval. Even after FDA approval, only a few products are launched in the market, because a launching firm must reassess market potential before spending additional billions of dollars in creating manufacturing, branding, and distribution network. So, only a few start-ups, even among those that successfully synthesized products, are finally rewarded by big pharma. Why would a small company, or a group of scientists and doctors, devote their precious time, give up their careers, and spend their meager resources to develop something that has less than a lottery like chance to succeed? The answer is lottery like payoffs.\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider a few examples. From market value of just $5 billion at the end of 2018, Moderna reached a valuation of $181 billion dollars in Sept 2021.\u00c2\u00a0 BioNTech, which got listed in October 2019, reached a peak value of $108 billion in Aug 2021. This phenomenon is not just about Covid vaccines. Axsome Therapeutics, which traded for just $2 per share by the end of 2018, reached $108 dollars by the end of 2019. More important, big pharma pays large premiums to acquire listed companies and unlisted start-ups. For example, in 2017, Gilead acquired a small biotech Kite Pharma, for $11.9 billion, and in 2020, Bayer acquired Asklepios, a gene-therapy startup, for a total cost of $4 billion. Acquisition by Big Pharma is typically the endgame for most biotech start-ups.\nBut the efforts and cost spent on drug development, after adjusting for inflation, keep doubling every nine years. This phenomenon is described in Eroom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law. (For curious people, Eroom is opposite of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law, which describes the decreasing costs of discovering new products in electronics.) Given the rising costs, only rising lottery payoffs can keep up the incentives for small biotechnology start-ups to bet it all on their ventures. Indeed, announcement of each new multibillion dollar acquisition lifts both valuations and innovation efforts across the industry.\nHowever, the purpose of this post is not to describe that small, biotechnology firms have lottery like payoffs, but to emphasize that any drop in lottery type payoffs could have an opposite impact on the society. The valuations of biotechnology companies have recently declined rather rapidly. Moderna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $64 billion and BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $38 billion, both more than 50% off their recent peaks. And it is not just about a few, isolated stocks. Diversified funds, that invest in hundreds of biotechnology stocks, are also off their recent peaks. For example, XBI, an S&P Exchange Traded Fund investing in biotechnology companies, is down 50% of its peak in less than twelve months. Neither the tech-heavy Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 index have declined by that much over the past one year, on the contrary, both have increased.\nWhy should one worry about sudden decline in valuations of biotechnology firms, or the vagaries in their fortunes? Well, they have a real impact on the society because an elaborate system of multi-stage and risky financing drives new drug discovery. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider this chain of thought. Now big pharma would pay a lower price for successful innovation, and a successful biotech firm now has a lower chance of doing the initial public offering or being acquired at an astounding price. Lowering of lottery like payoffs, in conjunction with the rising costs of discoveries, means that venture capitalists would pull out investments from risky biotech projects and doctors and researchers will spend less hours in synthesizing new drugs. Importantly, some promising research would not progress further, and their discoveries would be prematurely lost. Thus, the roller coaster in the fortunes of biotechnology sector now means lower chance of developing new drugs and vaccines, as well as loss of promising research effort. This is not just like putting off another steel plant, which can increase the steel prices, and increase the costs of automobiles. Not discovering a drug or a vaccine means prolonged illness, pain, or even more deaths. It may sound macabre, but fluctuating stock market fortunes of biotech firms would impact the health and wellbeing of citizens, something that personally touches us all, even if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invest in stock markets.\nIn sum, the rapid rise and fall of biotechnology sector adversely impact society. How to solve this problem? One proposed solution by MIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Andrew Lo, is to pool the risks of multiple cancer projects and fund it using a superfund. We strongly endorse this idea. However, it is unclear how a superfund can better allocate seed capital to individual small projects than can capital markets or venture funds which are known for their speed and efficiency. Another idea is that such important research should not be left to private ventures but should instead be done by government sponsored and not-for-profit research institutions. Indeed, health-sector research is the largest avenue for government R&D funding, sponsored through National Institute of Health. Recall that government research funding was instrumental in development of Covid vaccines. Furthermore, the benefits from public R&D spill over to many more public and private projects that do benefit from private R&D. This point is enforced by President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent announcement on cancer research.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe key takeaway from this post is that there is a need for a new model to fund grassroot research in biotechnology sector. On one hand, the current model, based on venture funding, unleashes entrepreneurial energies and efforts, and attracts the best talent to biotechnology sector. On the other hand, the vagaries of biotechnology stocks in capital markets lead to fits and starts in biotechnology discoveries and cause frequent loss of promising research. Society must find a happy balance between the two forces and find a new way to address this problem, a problem that cannot be simply left to free markets.\n\n   Volume 66, Issue 4\n   Summer 2024\n   \nTo Be or Not to Be: Will Virtual Worlds and the Metaverse Gain Lasting Traction?\nThe Metaverse Flywheel: Creating Value across Physical and Virtual Worlds\nThe Diffusion of the Metaverse: How YouTube Influencers Shape Mass Adoption\nMetaverse Management as Urban Planning: Lessons from Paradise (Nevada)\nGreen Innovation Games\nCalifornia Management Review\nBerkeley-Haas's Premier Management Journal\nPublished at Berkeley Haas for more than sixty years, California Management Review seeks to share knowledge that challenges convention and shows a better way of doing business.\nHaas School of Business\n                University of California, Berkeley\nCalifornia Management Review\n                F465 Berkeley Haas School of Business\n\t\t\t\t2220 Piedmont Ave. Berkeley, CA 94720-1900\n\t\t\t\t(510) 725-7826 |\n\t\t\t\tcmr@haas.berkeley.edu\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2024 UC Regents | UC Berkeley | Privacy Policy\n",

Results from Phase I, II and III clinical studies, and FDA or European approvals (and rejections), can send stocks soaring.\nEveryone is familiar with these monster moves. Recent examples include Amarin Corp's (AMRN) 3X move in one day, or Zosano Pharma Corporations' (ZSAN) 100% rip on recent study results. Now, a new entrant in the large neurological market, NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC), could be on the eve of their first FDA approval, and few investors are paying attention to this small company because it's so new and quiet about what they're doing.\nNevertheless, NMTC is 10% owned by the Mayo Clinic and has a stable of veteran physicians and researchers on their board and advisory board. With the possibility of two FDA clearances in 2019 for their first planned medical devices, the company could have a breakout year if they execute and move from unknown to mainstream.\nNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2019 / Small healthcare stocks are known for making heroic moves, often when their development-phase drugs or devices move closer to going commercial. Completion of Phase I, II, and III trials can all send stocks rallying, as can approvals from European and U.S. regulators.\nCase in point, Zosano Pharma's (ZSAN) recent monster 100% move recently when they announced success in a Trial of their drug for migraines. Amarin Corp (AMRN) saw their stock price triple after their drug Vascepa succeeded in a large Phase III study.\nThe largest moves tend to happen when most investors aren't paying much attention, and that could be the setup for a newer neuro company that recently made their way to the public markets. NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC) is a small developer of electrode technology that just quietly submitted their first product to the U.S. FDA for a possible clearance early in 2019. NeuroOne's technologies - sometimes known as ''neurostimulation'' devices - have been tested at the Mayo Clinic, which is also a 10% owner of the company's public stock. Now that the company is headed towards their first possible FDA clearance, and with a second possible clearance for another device right on its heels, NMTC is a healthcare company to be aware of before it gets discovered.\nNeuroOne Operates In An $8B And Growing Device Market\nThe emerging field of neurostimulation refers to technologies that electrically stimulate or monitor the nervous system to treat and diagnose disorders. Though humans have learned much about the nervous system in the last twenty years, it remains a mysterious organ and technology has only recently begun to unlock some new treatment options. These devices are now helping in a variety of difficult neurological disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, Dystonia, Epilepsy and even in the treatment of pain and some nerve damage.\nIt's an exciting time as this industry takes off. In 2019 the research firm Global Markets Insights expect this to be a $8.196 billion industry across the globe, and $6.5 billion in North America and Europe alone.\nOne of the earliest successes for neurostimulation devices was in Epilepsy and Parkinson's using Deep Brain Stimulation, or DBS and ablation. After identifying brain tissue that may be causing Epileptic seizures or movement problems as in severe Parkinson's, neurologists can selectively modulate or destroy this tissue with a DBS or ablation device, reducing or sometimes eliminating symptoms of the disorder. In fact, ablation can cure about 50% of Epileptic patients.\nThe hangup for many Parkinson's, Dystonia, or Epilepsy patients who are eligible for DBS or ablation is the traumatic surgical requirements, not only for treatment but also to diagnose and pinpoint the affecting brain tissue. It can take weeks in the hospital, sometimes with wires protruding from a patient's skull!\nHere's where NeuroOne hopes to make its mark on the industry. The company's initial devices are high-fidelity electrodes designed to enhance and possibly shorten this diagnostic/treatment process. These thin-film electrodes, used in a procedure called an EEG (electroencephalogram), may provide more accurate detection of irregular brain activity over currently available technology. In limited clinical testing so far, doctors at the Mayo Clinic have been able to document pre-seizure activity (called micro-seizures) during clinical research with their patients using NeuroOne's technology. The electrodes are being developed as strips and depth electrodes, and they've already demonstrated an improvement in inflammatory response compared to existing products when used on some brain tissue. With better diagnostic process, NeuroOne hopes that their products can shorten the diagnostic time and improve safey for Epileptics and patients suffering from movement disorders.\nCombined, this first technology addresses a demand for improved diagnostic options among neurologists, and NeuroOne is now racing to market with their first medical devices for approval.\nNMTC Quietly Made Their First FDA Clearance Application\nNeuroOne has been mostly quiet on the investor front, but in a recent SEC filing they revealed that they filed their first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) application on January 28, 2019. The application covers their cortical and strip electrodes for temporary (less than 30 day) use with recording, monitoring, and acute stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring and stimulation of electrical signals on the surface of the brain.\nIn the case of this 510(k) process, which is used when the device holds a low risk to the patient, the FDA will aim to complete its review within 90 days of receiving the notification.\nThis is the biggest gating event for NeuroOne since the company went public, and it could take them from a development stage company to commercial and their first revenue. An FDA clearance could launch the into the mainstream of healthcare companies, and investors will undoubtedly take notice of this tiny company.\nThe company also plans to file a FDA 510(k) marketing clearance for their first depth electrode during the second quarter. Following that, they're working on a unique diagnostic/ablation device that could further shorten and simplify the treatment time for patients.\nNMTC could have two value-driving events in the next 5-6 months, and the markets are barely paying attention.\nStrong Advisory Board Backs NeuroOne, And Mayo Owns 10% Of The Company\nThe breadth of expertise involved in NeuroOne is impressive. The company has strong advisors and executives, and their technology has been tested over the years by both the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the Mayo Clinic, the latter of which is also a 10% holder of NMTC's public stock.\nSince going public, NeuroOne has been building a team of experienced medical tech and neurology advisory members: Mayo Clinic's Greg Worrell MD, PhD and Gregory J. Esper, MD, MBA of Emory University both sit on the company's scientific advisory board. More recently, Dr. Kip Ludwig, former Program Director for Neural Engineering at the NIH, became chair of the company's new \"artificial intelligence\" advisory board, which will focus on deploying NeuroOne's electrode technology in artificial intelligence and bioelectronics applications. Dr. Cristin Welle of the Univ. of Colorado joined, a founder of the Neural Interfaces Program at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of Science and Engineering Labs; plus Dr. Doug Weber, a Program Manager in the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) at DARPA.\nEvaluating AI opens up some unique possible opportunities as more researchers have considered the potential for electrode/brain interfaces. The possibility for some kind of translational work in this space is intriguing.\n2019 Should Be A Big Year For NMTC Shareholders\nNeuroOne has been operating in stealth mode for the last year, but 2019 could be when investors start to pay attention. The company will likely have 2 FDA clearances in the next 6 months if the FDA signs off on their cortical and depth electrode 510(k) filings. As this stock has been mostly flat since going public, these events may be the first time that investors stand up and take notice. Additionally, NMTC plans to apply for a listing on the Nasdaq, another catalyst that could create significant value for shareholders if NMTC can qualify. With CEO Dave Rosa's successful track record building venture stage healthcare companies, multiple value creating catalysts on the horizon, and an awesome technology with blue sky potential, investors long NMTC could be handsomely rewarded for a patient long position in this relatively unknown healthcare company.\nAbout One Equity Stocks\nOne Equity Stocks is a provider of paid-for research on publicly traded emerging growth companies.

Mitigation plans involve massive engineering feats that may help in the short-term, but will eventually be overrun.\nEarth.Org takes a closer look.\n\u2014\nA major centre of finance, commerce, culture, arts and trade, Miami is a global city with a USD $345 billion GDP. Built on a broad, low-lying plain between Everglades wetlands and Biscayne Bay, its citizens are already experiencing early signs of climate change.\nWhy?\nSince 1870, global sea levels have risen by an average of 20 cm, but Southeast Florida\u2019s local levels have risen by 30 cm. By 2060, it could double or triple that.\u00a0\nThe impacts of sea level rise in Miami\nIn light of the last point, officials have decided to build a network of huge pumps that force water out of flood-prone areas and into Biscayne Bay. There are over 30 pumps today, with 90 planned in total. The estimated cost for 3 pumps, including land acquisition, is USD $ 200 million. Unfortunately, even all 90 cannot protect the larger Miami area.\u00a0\nThe city of Miami still toils away to mitigate flooding, raising roads and buildings, hoping to buy time. The world would do well to keep an eye on how Miami fares, as it may be the first major victim of climate change.\nEarth.Org has mapped severe flooding in southern Florida by the end of the century to illustrate the impending danger.\nSea Level Rise: Miami\u2019s Map\nSea level rise projections by 2100 for two scenarios with the amount of rise in meters indicated (mild = 1m; extreme = 4m). Percentage and total population displacement indicated bottom right, yellow star on the city of Miami.\nMethodology\nGlobal mean sea level is projected to rise by 2m at the end of this century. However, in order to determine local sea level rise (SLR), one has to take into account local coastal flood levels which could be 2.8m above Mean Higher-High Water (MHHW) at extreme forecasts. These local levels bring variability to the projected SLR from 1m to 6.5m (eg. Rio vs Kolkata).\nThe SLR scenarios used in this study are based on the forecasts from Climate Central \u2013 Coastal Risk Screening Tool \u00a0with the following parameters:\nSea level Projection Source:\nFrom two highly cited journals by Kopp et al., estimating SLR mainly due to ocean thermal expansion and ice melt. The mid-range scenario projected 0.5-1.2m of SLR based on different representative concentration pathways (RCP) defined by the IPCC. While the pessimistic scenario added more mechanisms of ice-sheet melting, estimating SLR at 1m-2.5m in 2100, with a projection of 10m SLR at 2300.\nCoastal Flooding\nMore frequent coastal flooding is a direct impact of sea-level rise. Based on the Global tides and surge reanalysis by Muis et al., (2016), it is estimated that the extreme coastal water level could be from 0.2 \u2013 2.8m over the mean level. While in extreme cases like China and the Netherlands it could experience 5-10m of extreme sea levels. Here, the coastal local flood level is added on top of the projected SLR.\nPollution Scenario:\nAllows choosing the RCP, the greenhouse gas concentration trajectory defined by the IPCC.\u00a0 The mild level is based on RCP4.5, of 2\u00b0C temperature rise; while the Extreme level is based on RCP 8.5, of 4\u00b0C temperature rise.\nLuck:\nApplies to the baseline SLR, defined in the \u201cSea level projection\u201d section, upon which we add flooding. \u201cMild\u201d refers to the mid-range scenario of 0.5-1.2m, and \u201cextreme\u201d to the pessimistic scenario of 1-2.5m. We used the high-end value of each scenario (mild = 1m; extreme = 2.5m).\nYou might also like: Sea Level Rise by 2100 \u2013 New York City\nA Graphical History of Atmospheric CO2 Levels Over Time\n11 Interesting Climate Change Facts\nThe Statistics of Biodiversity Loss [2020 WWF Report]\nHand-picked stories weekly or monthly.

While there is no way to definitively answer that question \u2013 by definition, our fiscal problems are due to the disconnect between spending and revenue \u2013 one way to evaluate our situation would be to put spending and revenue in a historical context as a share of economic output. From that perspective, it is clear the answer is \"both.\"\nIncorporating the effects of the recent budget deal, federal spending is expected to total 21.1 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, while revenue is expected to total about 16.6 percent of GDP. With 50-year historical averages for spending and revenue at 20.3 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively, that means spending will be higher and revenue will be lower than their historical\u00a0averages by about the same amount:\u00a00.8 percent of GDP.\nThis wasn't always so. As recently as 2017, revenue was close to its historical average, and as recently as 2018, spending was as well. But thanks in large part to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, both have departed from these averages.\nDue to the rising costs of health, retirement, and interest spending, spending is projected to diverge from its average even further. We estimate that over the next decade, spending will rise to 23.1\u00a0percent of GDP by 2029, which is 2.8 percentage points\u00a0above the historical average. Revenue will rise above its historical average but largely because the net revenue-losing portions of the TCJA are scheduled to expire, mostly after 2025. If those and other tax cuts were continued as the Congressional Budget Office presents in its Alternative Fiscal Scenario (AFS), revenue would remain below its historical average at least through the next decade, with revenue 0.4 percentage points below that average in 2029.\u00a0\nThe fact that spending and revenue are above and below their historical averages, respectively, is troubling, especially since even at these\u00a0averages debt has risen by about 50 percent of GDP over the past half century to its highest level since just after World War II.\nIn the past when the economy was strong and unemployment was low, revenue usually rose above average levels as a share of GDP while spending fell below. This time, policymakers have continued to cut taxes and increase spending regardless of the fiscal consequences.\nTrending\n$700 Billion of Easy Deficit Reduction\nWith the national debt approaching record levels and interest costs exploding, lawmakers will need to consider substantial spending cuts and revenue increases to put the national debt on a more...\nAs the Fed Cuts Rates, Treasury Yields Are Rising\nWith last week\u2019s rate decision, the Federal Reserve has now cut the federal funds rate by 75 basis points over the past eight weeks.

    "document": "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 (Week 16) using Drought Monitor Data Gregg Ibendahl April 19, 2024 Week 16 prediction1 Kansas wheat estimate for 4/19/24 Using Drought Monitor Data Yield range from 39.1 to 46.2 Predicted yield of 42.6 Abstract This paper uses data from the U.S. drought monitor website (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu2) to predict yields on a crop reporting district (CRD) level for Kansas. These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F.

St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available. In other words, the drought index only shows moisture deficit levels and not excess moisture levels.\nWhile this report currently indicates a below average wheat year, the wide confidence intervals indicate these predictions could improve with timely rains. It is still early spring after all. The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5",

    "document": "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 (Week 16) using Drought Monitor Data Gregg Ibendahl April 19, 2024 Week 16 prediction1 Kansas wheat estimate for 4/19/24 Using Drought Monitor Data Yield range from 39.1 to 46.2 Predicted yield of 42.6 Abstract This paper uses data from the U.S. drought monitor website (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu2) to predict yields on a crop reporting district (CRD) level for Kansas. These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F.

St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored.

    "document": "How Many Polar Bears Are Left?\nSeveral populations likely face grave danger from climate change\nPaul Souders / Getty Images\n The global polar bear population is thought to be between 22,000 and 31,000. These bears are divided into 19 subpopulations around the Arctic, with some containing fewer than 200 individuals and others consisting of more than 2,000.\n\n Polar bears' rapidly dwindling populations serve as a symbol of the climate crisis globally, but are they technically endangered? Their conservation status may surprise you. Learn more about polar bear populations, the threats these animals face, and what we can do to save them from extinction.\n\nDid You Know?\nPolar bears live in areas that fall under the jurisdiction of five countries: Canada (Labrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Qu\u00e9bec, Yukon); Denmark (Greenland); Norway (Svalbard, Jan Mayen); Russia (Yakutiya, Krasnoyarsk, West Siberia, North European Russia); and the U.S. (Alaska).\n  Are Polar Bears Endangered?  \nPaul Souders / Getty Images\n Polar bears are listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, a designation they first received in 1982 and that was upheld by the latest assessment in 2015. They are protected by the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, a multilateral treaty signed in 1973 by the five polar bear nations: Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the U.S. This agreement prohibits unregulated hunting of polar bears, including the use of aircraft or large motorized vehicles to hunt them. It compels member states to take appropriate actions to preserve the ecosystems that sustain polar bears.\n\n Although not technically endangered, the U.S. government has protected them under the Endangered Species Act since 2008, classifying them as threatened throughout their range. It's important to note that while these bears face potentially existential threats in some places, a few populations have rebounded in recent decades from overhunting in the last century, leading some people to argue polar bears are actually thriving.\n\n The late U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska was one of those people, saying in 2018 that \"there are now three times as many polar bears in the Arctic than there were in the 1970s,\" a claim that has periodically resurfaced since. According to the IUCN, it's not clear which way polar bear populations are swinging on the whole. World Wildlife Fund data from 2019 shows that more subpopulations are declining than are increasing. The largest subpopulations look to be stable.\n\nLaws Protecting Polar Bears\nCountries with polar bear populations have passed laws enacting various protections for the bears. In the U.S., polar bears are protected partly by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which prohibits the \"take\" of polar bears and other marine mammals without federal approval. They are also protected by the Endangered Species Act since being listed as a \"threatened\" species in 2008.\n  Limitations to the Data  \n Despite the encouraging rebound of some populations, there is little evidence to suggest polar bears are thriving overall. That's partly because there isn't enough long-term data on polar bears, especially for the northernmost regions.\n\n Those who doubt their current plight have claimed that only 5,000 polar bears were left in the 1960s, but that claim is largely contested by conservation experts.\n\n At least three polar bear populations are likely in decline, according to the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG), but nine of the 19 subpopulations have insufficient data. There is too little data to even estimate population size for the three in decline.\n\n While their specific status is more muddled than the overall outlook for climate change itself, there is significant evidence to suggest many polar bear populations are in peril.\n\n  How Is Climate Change Affecting Polar Bear Populations?  \nFloridaStock / Shutterstock\n To understand why polar bears are threatened by climate change, you have to consider what polar bears eat and how they get their food. Polar bears are apex predators and a keystone species in their Arctic habitats, and their favorite food, by far, is seals. They specifically target ringed and bearded seals due to their high-fat content.\n\n Polar bears spend about half their time hunting, typically by stalking seals from the sea ice and ambushing when they surface to breathe. They often travel long distances and wait hours or days for a single seal, and while only a fraction of their hunts succeed, it's generally worth the trouble for such a fatty meal.\n\n Polar bears are considered marine mammals, but while they are excellent swimmers, they are no match for a seal in the water. Sea ice is therefore instrumental to their hunting strategy, and it's now declining due to rising Arctic temperatures, now warming at roughly twice the rate of the planet overall.\n\nPaul Souders / Getty Images\n Arctic sea ice naturally waxes and wanes with the seasons, but its average late-summer minimum is now shrinking by 13% every decade, according to the NOAA. The oldest Arctic sea ice\u2014frozen for at least four years, making it more resilient than younger, thinner ice\u2014is now in steep decline. Whereas it comprised about 16% of the total ice pack in 1985, it now comprises less than 1%, representing a loss of 95% over just 33 years.\n\n In 2020, Arctic sea ice reached its second-lowest extent since record-keeping began. This decline is alarming for several reasons: Arctic sea ice performs key services for the planet like reflecting solar heat and influencing ocean currents. It's even more directly important for polar bears, as less sea ice means fewer chances for them to catch seals.\n\nPosnov / Getty Images\n The effects of climate change vary by location, and sea ice decline seems to be affecting some bears more than others. Western Hudson Bay had roughly 1,200 polar bears in the 1980s, for example, but that has since fallen to 842, and as Polar Bears International (PBI) notes, trends in their body condition, survival, and abundance have been linked to sea ice conditions. Bears in Southern Hudson Bay have also suffered a 17% decline since 2012, according to PBI, and their body conditions have similarly been linked to a longer ice-free period.\n\n Most other subpopulations are either considered stable or lack sufficient data, but many will likely also face dire challenges from the loss of sea ice in their habitats. Some might be able to adapt, but their options likely will be limited. Even if they can exploit new food sources on land, they could face competition or conflict with established residents like brown bears and people.\n\n Polar bears are slow to adapt due to their low reproductive rate and long time between generations. That doesn't bode well given the speed of modern climate change, already happening too quickly for many species to keep up.\n\nPolar bears can live up to about 30 years, but environmental factors (melting Arctic ice, for example) can significantly decrease their lifespans.\nPolar bears are apex predators and a keystone species in the Arctic. Without them, animals like Arctic foxes and seagulls would lose a food source. Seals, reindeer, whales, and birds that polar bears eat would become overpopulated.\nThe best way to help polar bear populations today is to fight climate change\u2014both systematically and in your own life. Drive less, reduce your energy consumption, recycle, and swap some of your meat intake with locally grown veggies. If you have the means, consider donating to a charity like Polar Bears International.\n\"Polar Bear Facts.\" World Wildlife Fund.\nWiig, \u00d8., et al.\u00a0\"Ursus maritimus.\"\u00a0The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\u00a02015: e.T22823A14871490.\u00a0Accessed on\u00a015 June 2022.\n\"Arctic Report Card.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Arctic Program. 2021.\n\"Climate Change: Arctic Sea Ice Summer Minimum.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 2020.\n\"Arctic Report Card.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Arctic Program. 2018.\n\"Arctic Sea Ice Extent.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\"Are Polar Bears Endangered?\" Polar Bears International.\nObbard, Martyn Ernest, et al. \"Estimating the abundance of the Southern Hudson Bay polar bear subpopulation with aerial surveys.\" Polar Biology. 2015.\nFollow Us\n",

In addition, approximately 300 polar bears are held in captivity. However, the world's population of polar bears is on a decline, and some scientists fear they could become extinct by 2100. To protect these majestic creatures, the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibit harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing polar bears.\nA significant portion of the polar bear population resides in Canada, where two-thirds of all polar bears live. About 16,000 polar bears are spread across 13 provinces and territories, including Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Northern Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland, and Labrador. Notably, Churchill, Manitoba, is known as the polar bear capital of the world due to its high concentration of these animals.\nIn the United States, Alaska is the only state with a polar bear population, estimated to be between 4,000 and 7,000 individuals. The polar bears in Alaska are primarily divided into two subpopulations: those in the Chukchi Sea, or Alaska-Chukotka, and the Southern Beaufort Sea.\nRussia is home to an estimated 26,000 polar bears, living on islands and the mainland coast. Wrangel Island, a UNESCO-protected nature reserve in Russia, is often referred to as a polar bear maternity ward. Additional polar bear populations in Russia are found in the Barents Sea region, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya, and the Far East Village.\nGreenland's fjords and glacial ice are also home to polar bears, though they are elusive and rarely seen. It's estimated that around 4,400 polar bears inhabit Greenland, with two protected areas, Melville Bay and Greenland National Park, supporting polar bear populations.\nThe Svalbard archipelago in Norway is another prime location for spotting polar bears, with an estimated population of around 3,000. Despite their remote habitats, polar bear encounters can sometimes be dangerous. Since the 1970s, there have been six recorded human fatalities due to polar bear attacks.\nMost polar bears in captivity are found in zoos, aquariums, and parks across Europe, North America, and Asia, contributing to conservation and education efforts about these iconic Arctic inhabitants.\n\nThe global polar bear population is estimated to be 20000-25000 individuals as of 2023, shared between all countries included in the species' range: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia, and the United States, as well as in international polar regions.\nPolar bears often roam from one country's territory into another, particularly in the winter when the polar ice reaches its broadest spread. As such, per-country population estimates are logistically challenging and can become outdated very quickly.\n\nCountry\nRegions Occupied\nCanada\nLabrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Yukon Territory\nGreenland\nGreenland\nNorway\nNorway\nRussia\nChukotka, Northern European Russia, Siberia\nUnited States\nAlaska\n\nUrsus Maritimus (Polar Bear) - IUCN Red List\n\nSources\n\u00a9 2024 World Population Review \u00a0Privacy PolicyTermsContactAbout\nCite This Page\nCite This Page",

We also recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners of the land and sea Country on which the Australian Institute of Marine Science works and as Australia\u2019s first scientists. Coral cover remains high while impacts of mass coral bleaching yet to be determined ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF CORAL REEF CONDITION 2023\u20132024 Published 7 August 2024 In Short \u2022 This report summarises the condition of coral reefs in the Northern, Central and Southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 94 reefs conducted between August 2023 and June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). \u2022 Over the past 38 years of monitoring by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), hard coral cover on reefs of the GBR has decreased and increased in response to cycles of disturbance and recovery. \u2022 Percent hard coral cover is one standard measure of reef condition recorded by scientists worldwide, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health and is used in this report. Other important data, such as diversity or composition of coral assemblages, are collected and reported by LTMP in other ways. \u2022 Changes in coral cover are qualified with respect to the margin of error, defined by 95% credible intervals (CIs). Credible intervals describe the level of uncertainty in the estimates of hard coral cover. \u2022 Above-average water temperatures (i.e. sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1\u20132.5\u00b0C) occurred on the GBR over the austral summer, peaking in March 2024 and resulting in the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016. \u2022 The mass coral bleaching on the GBR was part of a global event declared by NOAA and ICRI in April 2024. \u2022 The Central GBR was impacted by two tropical cyclones: Cyclone Jasper (Category 5 \u2013 December 2023) and Cyclone Kirrily (Category 3 \u2013 January 2024). Although Cyclone Jasper was a Category 5 in the Coral Sea, it was only Category 2 when traversing the GBR. \u2022 Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks have persisted on four Southern GBR reefs, while four reefs of the Northern GBR have low numbers of starfish. \u2022 In 2024, hard coral cover has increased across the GBR, but regional hard coral cover remains similar to that reported in 2022 and 2023. Importantly, most surveys were conducted prior to the mass coral bleaching event and passage of two cyclones, and the full impact of these events is yet to be determined. Its also important to note that bleached coral is still recorded as live coral during surveys, and the fate of these corals is not yet known. \u2022 Of the 94 reefs surveyed, only two reefs had hard coral cover <10%, 36 reefs had hard coral cover between 10% and 30%, and 35 reefs had coral cover between 30% and 50%. The remaining 21 reefs had hard coral cover between 50% and 75%. \u2022 On the Northern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs), a regional high, but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (35.8% average; 32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs). All surveys were completed prior to the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024. \u2022 On the Central GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), a regional high but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (30.7% average; 27.5% \u2013 34.0% CIs). Twenty-three of 39 reefs were surveyed before the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024, while 17 reefs were surveyed before cyclone impacts. \u2022 On the Southern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.1% (33.7% to 44.5% CIs) from 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) in 2023. Fourteen of 30 reefs were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. \u2022 The high coral cover reported this year is good news but does not mean all is fine on the GBR as it continues to face cumulative stressors. 2024 saw the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016 with the largest spatial footprint of coral bleaching yet recorded, coupled with the impact of two tropical cyclones. The impacts on coral cover from these events are partially captured in this year's report. A full assessment of changes in coral cover following these disturbances will be recorded during the next survey season. \u2022 It is important to note that recent increases in hard coral cover can be quickly undone, as many corals are susceptible to elevated heat stress, wave damage and crown-of-thorns starfish predation, all of which impacted the GBR this year. \u2022 The results presented here are our best understanding of reef condition before the impact of summer\u2019s disturbances.

Photo credit: AIMS LTMP Background: Sampling Methods and Analysis With reef surveys extending over 38 years, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring Program provides a unique and invaluable record of change in reef status by repeatedly and consistently surveying coral reef communities on representative reefs across the entire span of the Great Barrier Reef. This annual summary of the status and trends in hard coral cover is derived from manta tow surveys of coral reefs (Figure 1). These surveys are a broadscale technique that covers reef slopes of whole reef perimeters in a short amount of time. More detailed surveys of fish and coral assemblages are also conducted along permanently marked transects on 71 reefs; however, the data from these are still being analysed and undergoing quality assurance and quality checking. They will become available on the online dashboard once completed. Our Monitoring Dashboard presents a synthesis of all AIMS\u2019 coral reef monitoring data across each of the surveyed reefs and at various spatial aggregations (including Natural Resource Management regions and latitudinal sectors). For this annual summary, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Northern, Central and Southern GBR; Figure 1) that show different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time. These changes are mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances: severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. Since 2016, GBR-wide summaries are no longer displayed, as this spatial resolution oversimplifies the variability of coral cover dynamics. Presentation of patterns for the three regions separately offers an easily interpretable overview without oversimplification or getting lost in the complexity inherent at finer spatial scales (i.e. individual reefs). A total of 94 reefs were surveyed from August 2023 to June 2024 (reported as \u20182024\u2019). Online reports on the status and trends of individual reefs and reefs grouped by latitudinal sectors, including their disturbance history, are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip and quality checking of the data. Data summaries are available for download. The reefs of the GBR are dynamic, and there is considerable variation among regions in the decline and recovery cycles of hard coral cover and community composition in response to disturbances. Understanding these dynamics in the context of the disturbance regimes is critical for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). The number of reefs able to be surveyed each year is a small portion of the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs were selected to provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures multiple geographical and ecological gradients (e.g. latitude and position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continuous improvement in the analysis of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches for the type of ecological time series data used in this report. Temporal trends in hard coral cover presented in this report are analysed using Bayesian hierarchical models, and more detail of these analytical methods is presented here. Northern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cape York to Cooktown) Surveyed November 2023 to February 2024 Image 1: Photos showing the variable state of reefs in the Northern GBR in 2024. A. Low numbers of Crown-of-thorns starfish below outbreak levels were recorded on a number of reefs. B. McSweeney Reef is still in the early stages of recovery from recent disturbances. C & D. Minor bleaching was recorded on several reefs throughout the Northern GBR, such as Swinger Reef and North Direction Island. E. Outer shelf reefs such as Davie Reef have diverse fish and corals. F. Flourishing coral assemblages at Middle Banks. Note that all surveys were conducted before the peak summer heat in March 2024. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. There was substantial variation in the condition of the 25 individual reefs surveyed in the Northern GBR (Figure 1a, Image 1). Nine of 25 reefs had coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 12 reefs had >30% \u2013 50% cover and four reefs had >50% \u2013 75% cover (Figure 1a). A total of 24 of the 25 Northern GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Of these, six had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b). However, only two were outside the margin of error, and these declines were most likely due to crown-of-thorns starfish predation and coral disease. Region-wide hard coral cover was relatively stable from 1985 to 2010, then declined to the lowest recorded levels in 2017 following cumulative impacts from crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, severe tropical cyclones (STCs Ita and Nathan), and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. There was a period of strong recovery from 2017 to 2022. Hard coral cover has increased further since 2023, from 35.8% (32.1% \u2013 39.5% CIs) to 39.5% (35.0% \u2013 44.0% CIs) in 2024, the highest level since surveys began, but it remains within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 2). Surveys in 2024 found low crown-of-thorns starfish numbers at some reefs in the region (Image 1A), but all reefs were classified as either No COTS or No Outbreak (Figure 1c). Additionally, COTS feeding scars were observed on 14 reefs, indicating the presence of low numbers of starfish. Northern GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP experienced accumulated heat stress between 3.64 and 8.73 DHWs1 during peak heat accumulation in March 2024. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted from November 2023 to February 2024 before the height of summer; however, low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) (Figure 1d, Image 1C,D). No bleaching was observed on the remaining seven reefs (Figure 1d). We discuss the severity and spatial extent of the 2024 mass coral bleaching event in more detail below. Figure 2: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 25 reefs were surveyed in 2024. Note that many reefs in this region were surveyed before the peak heat stress occurred in March 2024. 1 DHWs (degree heating weeks) expresses the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHWs and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHWs. Further information available from NOAA.

More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2024. Of the 39 reefs surveyed, two reefs had <10% hard coral cover; 18 had hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, 14 reefs had hard coral cover >30% \u2013 50%, and five had hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a, Image 2). A total of 30 of the 39 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Thirteen of these reefs had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b), but only two had declines outside the margin of error. Hard coral cover was higher on 17 reefs (Figure 1b), with estimates outside the margin of error on 11 reefs. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly until 2016. From 2016, region-wide hard coral cover decreased continuously to 2019, largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown\u2010of\u2010 thorns starfish. From 2017 to 2022, hard coral cover recovered, but then declined in 2023. In 2024 it increased to 34.0% (30.3% \u2013 37.9% CIs), the highest level since surveys began, but it remained within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 3). There were no Potential, Established or Severe Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2024 (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, small numbers of COTS feeding scars were observed on 11 reefs, indicating the presence of low levels of COTS on these reefs. Cyclone Jasper crossed the Central GBR between Cooktown and Port Douglas in December 2023. No reefs in the cyclone path were surveyed after the cyclone and impacts from this event will be gauged next season. Shortly after the storm, tourism operators noted a large flood plume causing freshwater bleaching and coral mortality at inshore reefs, especially Low Isles, which will be next surveyed in 2025. Cyclone Kirrily transited the Central GBR in late January and resulted in variable impacts on the 22 reefs that were surveyed after the passage of the storm. Some reefs, such as Kelso, John Brewer, Helix and Chicken, had evidence of storm damage and declines in hard coral cover ranging from 6% to 9.9% since last being surveyed. Other reefs appear to have escaped with little impact. Central GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP were exposed to accumulated heat stress of between 3.37 and 9.31 DHWs over the summer. This resulted in low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching (Image 2C,D) on 16 of the 39 survey reefs in the Central GBR during the 2024 LTMP surveys (Figure 1d). The remaining 23 reefs had no bleaching recorded (Figure 1d, Image 2E,F); however, these reefs were all surveyed in August and September 2023, months before the heat stress occurred. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 39 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 23 of these were completed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024, and the impacts of the bleaching remains to be determined. Southern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Proserpine to Gladstone) Surveyed September 2023 to May 2024 The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 38-year survey history. Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009 reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 4). A rapid and substantial increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2017, reaching 36.7% (30.1% \u2013 44.3% CIs). However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018, and regional coral cover decreased to 29.0% (22.8% \u2013 36.2% CIs) in 2019. In 2021, coral cover had increased to 37.8% (31.6% \u2013 44.4% CIs), but it declined again to 34.0% (29.1% \u2013 38.9% CIs) by 2023 (Figure 4). In 2024, coral cover had increased to 39.1% (33.7% \u2013 44.5% CIs), but it remains within the margin of error of the past three years. The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) with nine reefs having hard coral cover >10% \u2013 30%, nine reefs with hard coral cover >30% \u201350% and 12 reefs with hard coral cover >50% \u2013 75% (Figure 1a). Of the 30 reefs surveyed in 2024, 25 reefs had been surveyed in the past two years. Hard coral cover was lower than previous surveys on five of these, with estimates outside the margin of error on one reef (Figure 1b). Twenty reefs had higher hard coral cover than previously surveyed, of which nine had estimates outside the margin of error (Figure 1b). The Southern GBR has been the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in recent years and remained so in 2024 with the focus in the Swain reefs. One of the 30 reefs was classified as having a Severe Outbreak, one reef had an Established Outbreak and one reef had a Possible Outbreak (Figure 1c; Image 3A). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on four reefs classified as No Outbreak and the remainder had No COTS, while COTS outbreaks have run their course on other reefs with low coral cover (Image 3B). In 2024, Southern GBR reefs surveyed by LTMP were exposed to the highest levels of accumulated heat stress (6.22\u201311.64 DHWs) ever recorded in this region. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted at 11 reefs during the height of thermal stress in March. Very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90% of colonies) was recorded at four of these reefs, while three had high (>30% \u2013 60%) bleaching and the remaining four reefs had medium (>10% \u2013 30% bleaching (Figure 1d; Image 3C,D)). Five reefs were surveyed in May after peak heat had occurred and all had bleaching between 1% and 30% of corals. The remaining reefs in this region were all surveyed in September and October 2023, well before the onset of heat stress, with little bleaching recorded (Image 3E,F). Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 30 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 14 of these were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. Image 3: Various disturbance events have impacted the Southern GBR in 2024, including coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. A. A severe outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish was still active at Tern Island in the Pompeys. B. Elsewhere in the Southern GBR, crown-of-thorns starfish infestations have run their course and reduced coral cover to very low levels, particularly in the Swains, such as Gannet Cay. Coral bleaching was recorded in the Southern GBR including C. Pompey Reef No. 1 and D. Reef 21-060. High coral cover is still found at many reefs in the Southern GBR, like E. Masthead Island and F. Fairfax Island in the Capricorn-Bunkers. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. Why Hard Coral Cover? What does \u2018percent hard coral cover\u2019 mean? There are many ways to measure the status of coral reefs. One of the most common is to use percent hard coral cover as an indicator of reef condition because it describes the abundance of a critical ecosystem engineer on coral reefs. This measure describes the proportion of the seafloor that is covered in live hard coral. Percent hard coral cover is widely used by scientists worldwide and is a standard measure that applies to all locations. While it does not tell us anything about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health. Percent hard coral cover can be estimated using various techniques. The technique used for this report is manta tow surveys, which are visual estimates of percent hard coral cover over the area covered by an observer during one 2-minute tow (~2000 m2). The percent hard coral cover for a reef is then estimated as the average of the estimates from all tows around a reef and reported as broad categories (e.g. 0%, >0% \u2013 10%, >10% \u2013 30%, >30% \u2013 50%, >50% \u2013 75% and >75% \u2013 100%; Image 4). A coral reef consists of more than just hard coral and contains a diverse array of other corals, sponges, algae, sand, rock and invertebrates. It is relatively rare for GBR reefs to have 75% \u2013 100% hard coral cover, and AIMS defines >30% \u2013 50% hard coral cover as a high value, based on historical surveys across the GBR. Other techniques for determining percent hard coral cover involve counting the number of points within sampling units (quadrats and photos), as used by the LTMP during fixed-site surveys, or the linear distance along a tape measure (line-intercept) that intersect live hard coral colonies. Adding up the total number of points of live hard coral cover and then expressing this as a percent of the total number of points within a sample yields the estimates of hard coral cover. Data from both the fixed-site and manta tow surveys conducted by the LTMP are highly correlated and show the same trends in hard coral cover estimates. However, manta tow estimates are commonly lower than those obtained from fixed site surveys as they encompass the entire reef, including sandy back reef habitats that generally have low coral cover. Image 4: Examples of categories of percent hard coral cover a) >0% \u2013 10%, b) >10% \u2013 30%, c) >30% \u2013 50% and d) >50% \u2013 75%. The yellow areas show non-hard coral reef surfaces, and the categorisation is based on the proportion of the substrate covered in live hard coral colonies. The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event In the austral summer of 2023\u20132024, much of the GBR was subjected to a level of accumulated heat stress that caused mass coral bleaching to occur (Figure 5). This was the fifth mass bleaching event on the GBR since 2016 and part of the fourth global mass bleaching event. In response to this event, AIMS and the Reef Authority undertook aerial surveys of 1080 reefs (Image 5) across the GBR and Torres Strait during the peak summer heat in March 2024. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, AIMS also conducted dedicated in-water bleaching surveys on 36 reefs during this time (22 February to 20 March 2024) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys were conducted from Lizard Island in the Northern GBR to Lady Musgrave Island in the Southern GBR at three depths \u2013 Shallow (2\u20135m), Mid (7\u20139m) and Deep (9\u201312m) \u2013 and consisted of assessments of the prevalence of coral bleaching (i.e. the number of colonies affected). The level of bleaching of an individual coral colony was recorded as 1. No bleaching 2. Partial bleaching (5%\u201350% of colony white) 3. Fully bleached (>50% of colony white) 4. Dead (colony recently dead and overgrown with light green algae). Data were then summarised as the percent of colonies in each category at each depth at each site. The 2024 bleaching event had the highest levels of exposure to heat stress to date, with some reefs in the Southern GBR experiencing up to 15 DHWs (Figure 5), far surpassing the level of heat accumulation they had been subjected to in previous events. 2024 also saw a record-breaking spatial footprint of coral bleaching, with 49% of reefs having high levels (>30% of corals bleached) and 32% of reefs having very high to extreme levels of coral bleaching (>60% of corals bleached; Image 6). In-water surveys conducted at the height of the event also confirmed that severe bleaching (whole colonies fully bleached white) was prevalent at 94% of reefs, and recent mortality due to intense thermal stress was present at 89% of reefs across all three regions of the GBR. The severity and prevalence of bleaching was variable among reefs, but some clear regional patterns emerged. The Northern GBR aerial survey reefs were exposed to maximum heat accumulation between 1.84 and 9.7 DHWs over the summer (Figure 5). There was variation in the levels of heat stress accumulation across the Northern GBR. Aerial surveys revealed reefs north of Lockhart River were least affected, while the inner- and mid-shelf reefs between Lizard Island and Cape Sidmouth suffered very high and extreme levels of bleaching after being subjected to accumulated heat stress between 4.9 and 9.7 DHWs. Figure 5: Accumulated heat stress (points on map) and the level of bleaching (bar charts) recorded during aerial surveys of GBR reefs surveyed in March 2024. DHW categories: Bleaching low risk = 0\u20132 DHWs, Bleaching warning = 2\u20134 DHWs, Bleaching possible = 4\u20136 DHWs, Bleaching probable = 6\u20138 DHWs and widespread bleaching with possible mortality= >8 DHWs. Source: NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Coral Reef Watch program. Coral bleaching prevalence categories: 0 = no bleaching, 1 = low bleaching (<10% of corals), 2 = medium bleaching (>10% \u2013 30%), 3 = high bleaching (>30% \u2013 60%), 4 = very high bleaching (>60% \u2013 90%), 5 = extreme bleaching (>90%). Note that these are the same categories used by LTMP manta tow surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event Levels of bleaching recorded from aerial surveys showed bleaching intensity decreased further north and at offshore reefs in the region. Throughout the Northern GBR, 27.6% of reefs had no bleaching recorded, 33% had low bleaching and 39.4% had high to extreme bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys (additional to LTMP) within Princess Charlotte Bay and around Lizard Island revealed partial to fully bleached colonies with low levels of early onset mortality at the time of survey (late February and early March 2024). In-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP were conducted just prior to the maximum period of heat stress (mid-March) and are likely to underrepresent the true extent of bleaching at the peak of the event (Figure 6). Furthermore, LTMP surveys in the Northern GBR, including around Lizard Island, were all conducted prior to March 2024, and coral cover for this region had not yet changed in response to this bleaching event. Nevertheless, early-onset low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 LTMP reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) prior to the onset of elevated heat stress. The Central GBR experienced elevated thermal stress throughout the summer, with aerial survey reefs ranging from 2.4 to 11.4 DHWs (Figure 5). Heat stress accumulation was highest around Cairns (5.1\u20139.5 DHWs), inshore reefs in the Palm Island Group around Townsville (5.2\u20139.5 DHWs) and the inner (5.8\u2013 8.95 DHWs) and outer shelf (5.2\u201311.4 DHWs) reefs of the Whitsundays (Figure 5). Levels of bleaching observed from the aerial surveys closely matched the accumulated heat stress levels. Across the Central GBR, 8.1% of aerial survey reefs were categorised as having no or low bleaching (1% \u2013 10% of corals), 15.8% as having medium bleaching (11% \u2013 30% of corals) and 76.1% having high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals; Figure 5). Around Cairns, 5% of aerial survey reefs had low bleaching, 40% had medium bleaching and 55% had high, very high or extreme bleaching. Townsville inshore aerial surveys recorded 22% of reefs with low bleaching, 18% with medium bleaching and 60% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. Aerial surveys recorded 19% of Whitsunday reefs with low bleaching, 22% with medium bleaching and 59% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, dedicated in-water bleaching surveys in the Central GBR recorded variable levels of bleaching prevalence and low levels of early onset coral mortality (Figure 6). In the Central GBR, 23 of 39 LTMP survey reefs were surveyed too early to detect the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event, but 16 reefs were surveyed between March and May 2024. These reefs all had low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% \u2013 30% of corals) coral bleaching during the 2024 LTMP surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event The Southern GBR experienced the most intense exposure of the three regions, with the highest levels of accumulated heat stress on record for the GBR, high prevalence of fully bleached corals and the highest levels of early onset mortality recorded during in-water bleaching surveys (Figures 5, 6). While there was variation in the amount of heat stress recorded among aerial survey reefs (Figure 5), the highest levels of heat stress were recorded in southern inshore reefs around the Keppel Island group (11.4\u201313.3 DHWs), and further south near Gladstone (15.3\u201315.6 DHWs \u2013 cf LTMP survey reefs). Offshore reefs of the Capricorn-Bunker (10.9\u201311.7 DHWs) and Swain sectors (7.3\u20139.9 DHWs) all had heat stress accumulation to the level where widespread bleaching and coral mortality are expected (Figure 5). Aerial surveys also revealed that all reefs around the Keppel Island group and the Capricorn-Bunkers had high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals), and while the Swain reefs were more variable, 91% of reefs had high, very high or extreme bleaching levels in shallow reef habitats. In the Southern GBR, in-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP surveys revealed a much higher proportion of fully bleached corals than either the Northern or Central GBR, and higher levels of early onset mortality at the time of in-water bleaching surveys across all three depths (Figure 6). Of the 11 reefs surveyed by the LTMP during the height of the heat stress in March 2024, 7 had high to very high bleaching (>30% \u2013 90%) and a further 4 had medium bleaching of >10% \u2013 30%. All other Southern GBR LTMP reefs were surveyed either before the onset of heat stress or in May 2024, after the heatwave had abated; these surveys recorded bleaching of between 1% and 30%. The results from both the aerial and in-water surveys have documented the greatest spatial extent of accumulated heat stress and high to extreme bleaching to impact the GBR in recorded history. High to extreme bleaching was observed across all regions of the GBR, with the highest impacts in the inshore and mid-shelf reefs in the Southern, Central and Northern GBR. Prevalence of fully bleached corals in the Southern GBR was close to 100% in some shallow-water habitats, and early-onset mortality ranged from 1% to 75%. Reefs with a higher prevalence of partially bleached and fully bleached corals are more likely to suffer adverse health impacts from this bleaching event. Bleaching-related impacts can be direct effects (partial or whole colony mortality) that reduce coral cover or indirect, chronic effects such as reduced growth and reproduction and increased susceptibility to coral disease. These results only partly tell the story. The full effects of the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event will continue to unfold over the coming months, as fully bleached corals can remain that way for several months, as late as September or October, depending on the species. Further in-water surveys at permanent locations are required to capture changes in hard coral cover following the bleaching, and these surveys will begin in September 2024 when the LTMP scientists return to the reef.

Assessing the Long-term Health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust, long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the \u2018shifting baseline\u2019 syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The past few years have revealed increases in hard coral cover across much of the GBR. In 2022, we reported the highest-recorded coral cover in the Northern and Central GBR since the LTMP began monitoring in the 1980s, after rising from the lowest-recorded cover in the preceding decade. There was little change in hard coral cover in 2023, but this year coral cover has again increased. However, 60 out of 94 reefs were surveyed before the two cyclones and the mass coral bleaching event and impacts of these events will become apparent once surveys are completed next year. The 2024 mass coral bleaching event was the most extensive in terms of accumulated heat stress and the large spatial footprint of high to extreme bleaching. Some parts of the GBR saw unprecedented levels of heat accumulation. The increased frequency and extent of bleaching events since 2016 remains highly concerning. Crown-of-thorns starfish are coral predators, and their outbreaks represent a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\u2019s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak. The program deploys targeted surveillance and culling operations to systematically suppress starfish numbers and protect coral across hundreds of priority reefs. Recent evidence from the COTS Control Program and the LTMP demonstrates that targeted control has effectively suppressed outbreaks and protected coral from COTS predation across entire reefs and sectors. The findings also suggest that the southward progression of the outbreak \u2018wave\u2019 through the GBR may have been delayed and reduced via the suppression of adult COTS. In 2024, the number of Severe Outbreaks has continued to decrease from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. LTMP surveys revealed low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish in the far northern GBR and around Lizard Island, which suggests that starfish numbers are increasing in these areas. Much of the recent hard coral cover increase was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase that rapidly increases percent hard coral cover, as documented in the 2022 and 2024 results. However, fast-growing corals are particularly susceptible to waves generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to heat stress and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. Therefore, large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be overturned by disturbances on reefs where Acropora corals predominate. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves. The consequences of climate change are evidenced by multiple mass coral bleaching events since 2016 in the three GBR regions. Such bleaching events were rare prior to the late 1990s but have become a biennial occurrence in the last decade. Simultaneously, the continuing risk of tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry, can all negatively affect recovery rates. Additionally, more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Enabling coral reefs to survive these stressful conditions requires a combination of a reduction in global greenhouse emissions to stabilise temperatures, best practice management of local pressures, and the development of interventions to help reefs adapt to and recover from the effects of climate change. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS\u2019 research and monitoring.

Coral reefs are critically important ecosystems, providing a wide range of benefits to both humans and marine life. They support extraordinary biodiversity and marine species, including fish, sea mammals, and invertebrates.\nWhile they only cover less than one percent of the ocean, coral reefs support an estimated 25% of sea life. They provide nursery, spawning, refuge, and feeding areas for various sea organisms. These include mollusks, crustaceans, and sea urchins.\nAlso, they play an essential role in water quality and coastal stability. For example, they help to filter sediments and nutrients from the water. Additionally, they act as natural breakwaters. As such, they minimize wave impacts from storms such as hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons.\nThat\u2019s not all; coral reefs form stunning ecosystems that appeal to the eyes. This makes them a powerful tourism attraction feature. In general, coral reefs provide habitat, food, income, protection, and medicine.\nHowever, various factors like water pollution threaten these beautiful sea species. And this calls for their protection. How, then, can we help protect the world\u2019s coral reefs and ensure that they continue to play an important role in the ocean ecosystem?\nTable of Contents\nHow to Conserve Coral Reefs\nIf you want to learn how to conserve coral reefs, here are superb options you can consider.\n1. Learn About the Threats Coral Reefs are Facing\nOne of the most important things you can do is to educate yourself about the threats surrounding coral reefs. You can make informed decisions that help save coral reefs when you are aware of these threats.\nSome of the main threats to coral reef survival include the following:\nPollution can come from various sources, such as agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage effluent. On the other hand, coastal development causes water runoff and sedimentation, which damage coral reefs. Also, it can disrupt coral reef habitats and lead to the introduction of non-native species.\nOverfishing can impact the populations of fish species that eat coral reef algae. This leads to the depletion of coral reef ecosystems.\nClimate change causes increased ocean temperature and oceanic acidity levels. Warmer waters increase the likelihood of coral bleaching events. And more acidic ocean waters harm coral reefs and impede their growth.\nIf we learn how to keep coral reefs healthy and reduce these threats, we can take proactive steps to protect them. In return, this helps guarantee their continued survival.\nSee Related: What is Overfishing? Examples & Solutions to Prevent\n2. Become a Reef-Safe Traveler\nIf you become a reef-safe traveler, you help protect coral reefs. Also, you help protect the beaches and ocean habitats from harm and contribute to the conservation efforts in the coastal areas.\nBut how can you become a reef-safe traveler? There are many ways to do so. First, choose accommodations with minimal environmental impacts. Choose the ones with low-flow faucets and toilets to conserve water when taking a shower or washing dishes.\nYou can also reduce your environmental impact using energy-saving or Energy Star-Certified appliances. Also, switching off lights and electronic devices while not in use or when leaving the room can help.\nWhen walking along the beach, practice responsible tourism. For example, ensure that you don\u2019t touch or step on any coral you see on the beach.\nYou can also be reef safe by using reusable water bottles and bags. Alternatively, buy locally-made eco-friendly products. Always avoid single-use plastics wherever possible.\nKeep off from souvenirs or aquariums made of living coral. And if you must purchase a souvenir, choose one made of wood or another non-coral material.\nLastly, if you have a pet, take steps to prevent it from harming the coral and surrounding environment. When you do so, you will help to conserve these valuable ecosystems for future generations to enjoy.\nSee Related: Best Solutions to Climate Change\n3. Practice Safe Snorkeling and Diving\nOne of the best ways to preserve and protect coral reefs is to practice safe snorkeling and diving. And since snorkeling is a fun activity for many people, doing it responsibly can go a long way.\nThe first step here in protecting these ecosystems is to avoid touching the reefs or anchoring your boat to them. Anchoring can damage or even kill corals. As for touching, it may damage delicate coral animals and reef fishes.\nAnother way to help protect coral reefs is to choose a dive site that is not too close to them. Also, if you see damaged coral, avoid it. Instead, report it to authorities so they can take proper measures to ensure the reef\u2019s health.\nAdditionally, ensure that the visitors on your dive trip do their part to protect the environment. We should all strive to keep coral reefs alive for future generations.\nLastly, avoid destructive actions that can damage the reef ecosystem or deprive it of vital resources for survival. For instance, avoid standing on them or crushing them.\n4. Choose a Reef-Friendly Sunscreen\nAnother common concern for reef-conscious people is the impact of the chemicals sunscreen contains. While many modern sunscreens are safe for coral, some contain dangerous chemicals that can have long-term effects on marine ecosystems.\nWhen buying sunscreen, look for mineral-based sunscreens that use a micro-sized particle or non-nano zinc oxide as their active ingredients. These are safe and effective and do not contribute to coral bleaching.\nAvoid sunscreens with oxybenzone, Parabens, Triclosan, Octocrylene, Homosalate, and Octinoxate. These ingredients are toxic to coral reefs and other marine life if washed off into the ocean.\nAlways check the sunscreens\u2019 labels to find the active ingredients and choose the ones that will be safe for corals. Finally, ensure the products are in reusable containers or bio-degradable plant-based materials.\nSee Related: Best Books on Pollution | Noise, Air and Water\n5. Dispose of Trash Properly and Recycle\nMarine debris can harm coral reefs. Therefore, reduce throwing trash around as much as possible. Use materials that support the three Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). When you reuse and recycle the trash at home and on the go, especially those made of plastic, you help conserve the environment.\nDispose of trash properly in the proper cans to avoid the probability of it getting washed away into waterways and oceans.\nWhen on the beach, leave no traces behind. That means don\u2019t throw plastic cans and cigarette butts in the sand. Also, don\u2019t leave unwanted fishing lines on the beach or in the water.\nFinally, you can organize beach or reef cleanups or volunteer at environmental organizations that do such cleanups. Pick up trash from the community and dispose of it properly. Volunteer for annual trash cleanup activities to help protect the oceans from marine debris.\n6. Reduce Stormwater Runoff\nStormwater runoff is the fastest-growing source of pollution. This water flows after the rain hits parking lots, rooftops, and roads. Thus, this untreated water contains a wide range of contaminants.\nReducing stormwater runoff helps reduce flooding, prevent water pollution, and protect our water bodies. To achieve this, homeowners can use rain barrels and gardens to collect rainwater or install water catchments. Conserving water and planting trees can also help reduce runoff into the oceans.\nAvoiding the dumping of wastewater into the ocean can help too. Ensure that it passes through treatment before it reaches the water\u2019s natural bodies, such as tributaries, lakes, rivers, and oceans.\nSee Related: Breaking Down the Best Off-Grid Water Systems\n7. Minimize the Use of Fertilizers\u00a0\u00a0\nMinimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns can help protect water quality.\nWhen you use fertilizer in gardens, the nutrients, including phosphorous and nitrogen, eventually get washed away into the waterways. Finally, they end up in the ocean, damaging sea life.\nThese fertilizers, chemicals, and pesticides pollute the water and harm coral reefs. Therefore, reducing fertilizer overuse will help save coral reefs.\nAlternatively, consider only organic or ecological fertilizers. These are less likely to contaminate lands and water.\n8. Use Environmentally-Friendly Modes of Transportation\nOpting for a cleaner means of transport reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles that use gas and fossil fuels release carbon emissions into the environment. These emissions contribute to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, which impede coral growth.\nTherefore, reduce the use of vehicles. Instead, walk, take a bike, or use public transport (like trains and buses) to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nIf you plan to purchase a vehicle, go for a fuel-efficient hybrid or electric car. This helps reduce carbon footprint. Remember, human-generated greenhouse gases are the main contributor to global warming.\n9. Marine Parks and Reserves\nThe creation of marine parks and reserves can play a role in coral reef conservation efforts. First, they can help preserve the threatened marine species or species that can no longer survive in the ocean safely.\nSecondly, the marine protected areas help limit human activity, including commercial fishing, mining, and recreational activities, which may threaten coral reefs.\nPaying a visit to marine parks can help raise awareness about the ocean ecosystem. A perfect example of marine parks in the US is the East End Marine Park, Virgin Islands. It helps protect the largest barrier reef system in the Caribbean Sea. The park comprises 60 square miles of coral reefs and shallow seas, among other ocean inhabitants.\nSee Related: Is Polyvinyl Alcohol Bad for the Environment?\n10. Spread the Word About Coral Conservation\nEducating the community around you about conserving the coral reefs is crucial. First, share this information with your friends and family.\nAdditionally, organize seminars to raise awareness about protecting water quality and conserving coral reefs. Visit local schools around you and teach about coral reef conservation.\nJoin local businesses and organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs. The Planetary Coral Reef Foundation, Coral Reef Alliance, and Reef Relief are examples of organizations working hard to stop coral reef destruction.\nFinally, find out what your local representatives are doing about the conservation efforts and support them where possible. If there has been no activity on the same, write to them and demand action.\nFAQs\nWhat are the main threats to coral reefs?\nThere are numerous threats to coral reefs. But perhaps the major ones include global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, destructive fishing practices, and disease outbreaks. Runoff water from land-based activities, sedimentation from coastal development, and bleaching also form a big part of water pollution which is also a threat to the coral reefs.\nHow can I help protect the coral reefs?\nThe first step towards protecting the coral reefs is reducing your carbon footprint. For example, switching to renewable energy sources.Minimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns and avoiding wastewater dumping into oceans and waterways will also go a long way. Lastly, you can support organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs and educating others about conservation efforts.\nWhat is ocean acidification?\nOcean acidification is a process caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It leads to increased acidity in seawater, which can be damaging to corals and other organisms living in these waters.As more carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it decreases pH levels. This, in return, leads to decreased calcification rates and makes it difficult for reef-building organisms to form their calcium carbonate skeletons.\nRelated Resources\nRead These Other Guide\nCategories Environmental Conservation\nPost navigation\nHow Does Saving Water Help Climate Change?\n9 Best Solar-Powered Computers to Buy Today\nRecent Posts\nEco-Friendly Products\nSpecies\nEco-Friendly Products\nEnergy Efficient Products\nSolar Products\nConservation\nAbout\nCopyright OurEndangedWorld | All Rights Reserved\n",

This is a sharp increase from the previous assessment, published in 2008, which found a third of corals were in danger of being lost.\nClimate change is the leading cause of the declines, with high temperatures causing corals to eject the photosynthetic algae that live in their tissues. These events, known as bleaching, are becoming more extreme and more frequent, and causing mass die-offs in reefs across the world.\nThe IUCN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Director General, Dr Grethel Aguilar, has called for strong action to limit greenhouse gas emissions as the best option to protect these vital species.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis global coral assessment vividly illustrates the severe impacts of our rapidly changing climate on life on Earth and drives home the severity of the consequences,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealthy ecosystems like coral reefs are essential for human livelihoods \u00e2\u0080\u0093 providing food, stabilising coastlines, and storing carbon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe protection of our biodiversity is not only vital for our wellbeing but crucial for our survival. Climate change remains the leading threat to reef-building corals and is devastating the natural systems we depend on. We must take bold, decisive action to cut greenhouse gas emissions if we are to secure a sustainable future for humanity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nCorals get their colour from the photosynthetic algae that live inside them, as part of a relationship which has lasted for over 380 million years. \u00c2\u00a9 Alexandre.ROSA/ Shutterstock\nHow endangered are corals, and why are they important?\nThe results of the latest Red List are the latest reminder of the dangers that reef-building corals face, with the animals having become more threatened with every reassessment of their health.\nWhile Red List assessments have changed over the past 30 years, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimated that just 13 coral species were considered Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered in the 1990s. By the time of the next assessment in 2008, this figure had risen to 231.\nIt has now risen again, by more than 100, meaning almost half of all corals are at significant risk of extinction. This makes corals proportionately more endangered than all the major animal groups on land, including amphibians, mammals and reptiles.\nIf these coral species do become extinct, their loss would cause major changes for life in the oceans. Coral reefs support around a quarter of all marine life, and so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely that coral extinctions could cause losses among fish, crustaceans and many other groups.\nThe loss of coral reefs would also remove an important nursery habitat for fish, as the hard skeletons provide a safe area for small fish to grow up in, away from large predators. Fewer nursery habitats would likely mean fewer fish, impacting both predator populations and fisheries.\nThe economic impact of coral extinctions goes much further than fishing, with reefs estimated to prevent billions of pounds worth of damage from flooding and erosion every year by breaking up waves. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also likely tourism would suffer, cutting off a vital source of income for many communities.\nThe most at-risk reefs are in the Atlantic, where half of all species are at risk of extinction and a quarter are Critically Endangered. In a separate paper, published in PLOS One, researchers have examined the threats facing these corals in particular.\nThe staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis is found in the Atlantic, and is considered Critically Endangered under the most recent Red List. \u00c2\u00a9\u00c2\u00a0Alberto Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez-Ram\u00c3\u00adrez\nWhy are Atlantic corals so threatened?\nWhile the vast majority of reefs are found in the Indian and Pacific Ocean, around 10% are found in the Atlantic. These corals are very distinct from their relatives, having been separated from other corals by the joining of North and South America over three million years ago.\nIn total, 85 shallow-water coral species live in the Atlantic, with the most important hotspots found in the Caribbean and off the coast of Brazil.\u00c2\u00a0As study co-author Dr Nadia Santodomingo explains, the limited ability of these species to respond to the threats facing them means these reefs are more vulnerable to collapse.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAtlantic corals have been hit the hardest by reef decline,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Nadia, a Curator of Fossil Cnidaria at the Natural History Museum. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re facing a perfect storm of threats, of which climate change is just one part.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese corals are being significantly impacted by overfishing, pollution and coral diseases which are more prevalent in the Atlantic than in other regions. As a result, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprised to see the results of the IUCN assessment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDisease has perhaps had the most dramatic impact on Atlantic corals, devastating not only the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corals but also the animals they depend on. An unknown illness is suspected to have killed as much as 98% of the Caribbean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-spined sea urchins in the 1980s, meaning these grazers couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent algae from dominating many reefs.\nNew diseases are continuing to emerge, with stony coral tissue loss disease first detected in 2014. The illness has spread rapidly throughout the Caribbean, killing as many as 94% of all infected corals.\nRising temperatures are also an increasing threat, with bleaching just the tip of the iceberg. Higher levels of carbon dioxide are making the ocean more acidic, making it harder for corals to grow their calcium carbonate skeletons. Climate change has also been linked with rising numbers of hurricanes in the region, which are washing away centuries-old reefs in a matter of hours.\nWhile the PLOS One study raises plenty of cause for concern, it also notes some reasons to be hopeful. After the devastating declines of the 1970s and 1980s, the researchers found that the fall in Atlantic coral cover appears to be getting smaller.\nTo support these green shoots of recovery, further research needs to be taken to understand how corals can adapt to the challenges that face them. As Dr Beth Polidoro, a co-lead author of the paper, explains, this must go hand in hand with urgent action to combat climate change and the other threats facing coral.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions alongside action to address local threats if we want to give coral reefs a chance to survive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Beth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy acting now, we can slow the pace of ocean warming and broaden the window of opportunity for corals to potentially adapt and survive in the long term.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRead more\nDiscover oceans\nFind out more about why we need to protect oceans and read about the pioneering work of our marine scientists.\nRelated posts\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCoral reefs cover more of Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface than realised, new estimates reveal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSatellite images have revealed a missing 64,000 square kilometres of coral cover, an area similar to the size of Ireland.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOver half of coral reef cover across the world has been lost since 1950\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCoral reefs have declined by over half since the 1950s as they suffer from the effects of climate change and overfishing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe resilient coral reefs surviving ocean warming\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOcean warming is threatening coral reefs but some reefs are surviving the warming waters and offer hope for these vital ecosystems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHighlighting coral reefs at risk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhat can antique corals reveal about the impact of climate change on the ocean?\nDon't miss a thing\nReceive email updates about our news, science, exhibitions, events, products, services and fundraising activities.

March temperatures were above average across much of the contiguous U.S., while below-average temperatures were observed in small pockets of the West and Southwest.\nThe Alaska statewide March temperature was 14.1\u00b0F, 3.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the 100-year period of record for the state. Above-average temperatures were observed across much of the state with near-normal temperatures in parts of the North Slope, Interior, Southwest and parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\n\n\nFor January\u2013March, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 39.4\u00b0F, 4.2\u00b0F above average, ranking fifth warmest on record for this period. Temperatures were above average across most of the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast. Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine each ranked second warmest for the January\u2013March period.\nThe Alaska January\u2013March temperature was 9.4\u00b0F, 3.5\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Much of the state was above normal for the three-month period while temperatures were near average across the eastern portions of the state and in parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\nPrecipitation\n\n\nMarch precipitation for the contiguous U.S. was 2.85 inches, 0.34 inch above average, ranking in the wettest third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average across much of the West, in the Great Lakes and along the Gulf and East coasts and in parts of the northern Plains. Conversely, precipitation was below normal across much of the Ohio Valley, the Plains, and in parts of the Northwest and Florida. Maine and Rhode Island each had their second-wettest March on record.\nAlaska\u2019s average monthly precipitation ranked in the middle third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior, south-central Alaska and in parts of the Panhandle during the month.\n\n\nThe January\u2013March precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 8.15 inches, 1.19 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across much of the contiguous U.S., with Rhode Island having its second-wettest year-to-date period on record. Conversely, precipitation was below average across much of the northern Plains and in small parts of the Northwest, central and southern Plains, Ohio Valley and Southeast during the January\u2013March period.\nThe January\u2013March precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record, with above-average precipitation observed in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior and south-central Alaska, as well as southern portions of the Panhandle during this period.\nBillion-Dollar Disasters\nOne new billion-dollar weather and climate disaster was confirmed in March 2024 after a severe weather event impacted the central and southern U.S. during mid-March, with the most severe weather occurring on March 13\u201315.\u00a0The U.S. has sustained 378 separate weather and climate disasters since 1980 where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (including CPI adjustment to 2024). The total cost of these 378 events exceeds $2.675 trillion.\nOther Notable Events\nFive wildfires, including the Smokehouse Creek wildfire, were finally contained in the Texas Panhandle, the largest cattle-producing region in the world. The wildfires resulted in approximately 1.1 million acres scorched, hundreds of destroyed structures, hundreds of miles of ruined fencing and more than 7,000 dead cattle.Winter did not bring heavy snowfall to Wisconsin nor the temperatures necessary to maintain the snow, allowing fires to begin early and in high numbers. Between January\u2013March 2024, there have been more than 220 fires across Wisconsin.A 5.25-inch diameter hail stone fell in Ada, Oklahoma on March 14, which is the largest stone reported in Pontotoc County since 1950, as well as the largest to fall in the state in nearly 13 years.\nA state of emergency was declared for Ohio as several tornadoes struck the state, resulting in 3 fatalities on March 14 when an EF-3 tornado crossed Auglaize and Logan Counties.\nDrought\nAccording to the April 2 U.S. Drought Monitor report, about 18% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought, down about 3.6% from the end of February. Drought conditions expanded or intensified in portions of the Plains and in parts of the Northwest, central Mississippi Valley, northern Great Lakes and Hawaii this month. Drought contracted or was reduced in intensity across much of the Mississippi Valley, Puerto Rico and the West, and in parts of the Plains, Great Lakes and Carolinas.\nMonthly Outlook\nAbove-average temperatures are favored to impact much of the central U.S., Northwest and Northeast in April while above-average precipitation is likely from much of the Plains to parts of the East Coast and in much of the Southwest. Drought is likely to persist along portions of the Northern Tier, the Southwest, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Visit the Climate Prediction Center\u2019s Official 30-Day Forecasts and U.S. Monthly Drought Outlook website for more details.\nSignificant wildland fire potential for April is above normal across much of the Upper Midwest and in parts of the central and southern Plains. For additional information on wildland fire potential, visit the National Interagency Fire Center\u2019s One-Month Wildland Fire Outlook.\nThis monthly summary from NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making.

Therefore, the cost figures have value only from a historical point of view.\nAlthough the figures obtained at the end of the production process may have a definite value in correcting past practices if they are carefully analyzed, a key limitation is that inefficiencies and errors in production are not identified until after the damage is done.\nCost analysis requires the use of predetermined cost estimates, which are made on a more or less scientific basis, to generate standard costs.\nThese costs are prepared in advance of production or supply, and they are based on a correlation of the technical specification of materials and labor to the prices and wage rates estimated for a selected period of time.\nThe following differences exist between historical costing and standard costing:\n1. Costs used: Standard costing includes cost figures that are predetermined based on past experience and expert advice. In historical costing, data are included from costs that have actually been incurred.\n2. Cost calculation: Standard costs are determined and known before the start and completion of production, but historical costs are known only after production is finished.\n3. Cost control: Standard costs are helpful to control costs, judge efficiency, and improve the operations of the organization. By contrast, historical costing does not provide these advantages to the management.\n\n\nCost is divided into two broad categories: historical cost and predetermined cost.\nHistorical costs are computed after the production of goods is complete.

By contrast, historical costing does not provide these advantages to the management.\nDifference Between Standard Costing and Historical Costing FAQs\n\n\nAre historical costs the same as standard costs?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, historical costs are not the same as Standard Costs. Standard Costs are estimates that are made up front for materials, labor and overhead needed to produce goods or services. Historical costs can be obtained after production because they represent what actually occurred during the manufacturing process.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between standard costing and job order costing?\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Costing is used in a job order or Process Costing environment while actual costing is used in a batch or mass production environment.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between standard costs and variances?\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Costs are better to control costs, judge efficiency and improve operations of an organization. Variances can be calculated from either Standard Costs or historical costs. Historical costing is simply the process of determining costs after production.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between actual costs and standard costs?\n\n\n\n\n\nActual costs are determined by recording how much was actually spent on materials, labor and other expenses while Standard Costs are estimates that are calculated in advance based on data from past periods or expert advice.\n\n\nCan historical costs be used to test the reasonableness of standard costs?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, historical costs can be used in testing whether or not Standard Costs are in line with expected direct material and labor rates. Actual costs cannot however because they are simply what occurred during production.\nAbout the Author\nTrue Tamplin, BSc, CEPF\u00ae\nTrue Tamplin is a published author, public speaker, CEO of UpDigital, and founder of Finance Strategists.\nTrue is a Certified Educator in Personal Finance (CEPF\u00ae), author of The Handy Financial Ratios Guide, a member of the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing, contributes to his financial education site, Finance Strategists, and has spoken to various financial communities such as the CFA Institute, as well as university students like his Alma mater, Biola University, where he received a bachelor of science in business and data analytics. \nTo learn more about True, visit his personal website or  view his author profiles on Amazon, Nasdaq and Forbes.\nOur Services\nAsk a Financial Professional Any Question\nQuick Links\nOrganization\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinance Strategists\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n(213) 536-9984\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5550 Tech Center DriveColorado Springs,CO 80919\nDISCLAIMERS\nFinance Strategists has an advertising relationship with some of the companies included on this website.

As borders closed and people went into quarantine mode for almost two years, the fear remained consistent for a lot of popular tourist destinations as they wondered how they would recover following the global pandemic, and whether the industry would ever go back to the way it was before.\nWhile the same fears applied to the Maldives, a country where the economy largely depends on income from tourism, Maldives was one of the first destinations that opened its borders as early as July 2020. With this, visitors from all around the globe flooded the country, as the Maldives became a safe haven for anyone looking to get a glimpse of a more normal \u2018outside world\u2019. Even with this, people still remained skeptical about how the country\u2019s economy would recover from the downturn of the pandemic.\u00a0\nAnd now, almost three years after the pandemic, the fears are gone and the Maldivian tourism industry appears to be doing better. By the end of 2022, it became evident that the Maldivian tourism industry was picking up, better than ever following the pandemic as the country welcomed over 1.6 million tourists at the end of 2022. While this was a major accomplishment for the country, especially only a year after the lockdown was lifted for most nations, the arrivals really picked up for the Maldives in 2023.\u00a0\nIn the first few months of 2023, especially during January and February, the tourist arrivals for the Maldives were extremely positive, leaving the country\u2019s Tourism Ministry hopeful about reaching the 2 million milestone for the year 2023. In May 2023, however, there was a decline in the arrival rates, as the off-season hit the Maldives as the monsoon season is not popular among visitors travelling to the country. Even with this, the arrivals for this time period in 2022 were marked at 66,938 while this year the arrivals are at 62,816.\nThough May showed a decline in tourist arrivals, the total arrival numbers for the Maldives is proving to be positive as the annual total as of 10 June 2023 is at 846,674.\u00a0 This means the country is extremely close to hitting the million mark!\nAs of June 2023, the top arrival market for the Maldives remains very similar to last year with arrivals from India taking the top spot with 99,922 visitors, Russia following close with 99,356 visitors and the UK at a close third with 75,472 visitors as at 10 June 2023. China is at sixth place so far.\u00a0\nMaldives has a total 60,818 operational bed capacity as at 10 June 2023, with 68 percent of them in the resorts, and 24 percent in guesthouses.\u00a0\n\n                                    Eydhafushi is set to be transformed into a new urban hub with a housing project\n                                \n\n                                    Azerbaijan Airlines\u2019 inaugural flights link Azerbaijan and the Maldives\n                                \n\n                                    The Maldivian Government launches the Hiyaavahi Finance Scheme for affordable home construction projects\n                                \n\n                                    Noonu Atoll Maafaru Airport resumes international flights in time for peak tourist season\n                                \nMaldives Financial Review\n\n                            9th Floor, M.

    "document": "Strategies for Mitigating Environmental Impacts of Tourism\nHave you ever gazed upon a pristine beach, an unspoiled forest, or a historic site brimming with ancient stories and wondered how these places can be preserved amidst the growing pressures of tourism? The answer lies in effective impact mitigation measures, strategies specially designed to balance the need for tourism development with the imperative of environmental preservation. Let\u2019s explore the innovative approaches that can help sustain the beauty and integrity of tourist destinations for generations to come.\nTackling the Challenges: Understanding Environmental Impacts of Tourism \ud83d\udd17\nBefore delving into mitigation strategies, it\u2019s crucial to comprehend the environmental impacts tourism can have. These range from natural resource depletion, pollution, and habitat destruction to wildlife disturbance and cultural erosion. Recognizing these impacts is the first step in formulating robust measures to counteract them.\nDepletion of Natural Resources \ud83d\udd17\nTourism often leads to increased consumption of water, energy, and land, putting a strain on these vital resources. In areas with limited availability, this can lead to significant ecological imbalances.\nPollution and Habitat Destruction \ud83d\udd17\nThe influx of tourists can result in increased waste, air, and water pollution. This not only affects the scenic value of a destination but also leads to the destruction of critical habitats for flora and fauna.\nWildlife Disturbance \ud83d\udd17\nClose encounters with wildlife may seem like an enriching experience, but they can disrupt natural behaviors and breeding patterns, threatening the survival of species.\nCultural Erosion \ud83d\udd17\nTourism can sometimes lead to the commercialization of culture, where traditions are modified to suit tourist expectations, risking the authenticity of local customs and practices.\nStrategies for Sustainable Tourism \ud83d\udd17\nHow can we mitigate these impacts and ensure that tourism contributes positively to environmental preservation? The following strategies offer a pathway to sustainable tourism development:\nTargeting Alternative Tourist Types \ud83d\udd17\nNot all tourists have the same environmental footprint. By promoting and developing facilities for eco-tourists, cultural enthusiasts, and adventure seekers who are more inclined to respect and preserve the environment, destinations can reduce their overall impact.\nEnhancing Resource Resistance \ud83d\udd17\nBuilding resilience: Strengthening the ability of natural and cultural sites to withstand tourist pressures is key. This can include measures such as using sustainable materials in construction, implementing water-saving techniques, and adopting renewable energy sources.\nEducation and Awareness \ud83d\udd17\nEmpowering stakeholders: Educating tourists, local communities, and industry stakeholders about the importance of environmental preservation creates a shared responsibility. Informative campaigns, guided tours with a focus on sustainability, and training programs for local businesses are effective tools.\nRegulating Tourist Numbers \ud83d\udd17\nLimits of acceptable change: By determining the carrying capacity of sites and setting limits on visitor numbers, destinations can prevent the overuse of resources and maintain the quality of the tourist experience.\nImplementing Effective Mitigation Measures \ud83d\udd17\nUnderstanding the necessity of impact mitigation is one thing; putting these measures into practice is another. Here\u2019s how stakeholders can operationalize these strategies:\nPolicy and Planning \ud83d\udd17\nGovernment and planning authorities must incorporate sustainability into tourism policies, ensuring that environmental considerations are at the forefront of development decisions.\nCommunity Involvement \ud83d\udd17\nLocal communities should be active participants in tourism planning and management, as they are often the custodians of the natural and cultural resources that attract tourists.\nMonitoring and Evaluation \ud83d\udd17\nContinuous monitoring of the environmental impacts of tourism helps in evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation measures and provides data for informed decision-making.\nStakeholder Collaboration \ud83d\udd17\nFrom tour operators to conservationists, all stakeholders must work collaboratively to promote and implement sustainable practices within the tourism industry.\nPromoting Responsible Tourism Practices \ud83d\udd17\nTo facilitate the adoption of impact mitigation measures, promoting responsible tourism practices among all stakeholders is vital. Here\u2019s what that entails:\nFor Tourists \ud83d\udd17\nEncouraging travelers to adopt eco-friendly habits, such as minimizing waste, conserving water, and respecting local customs, plays a significant part in reducing environmental impacts.\nFor Businesses \ud83d\udd17\nTourism businesses can lead by example, implementing green initiatives in their operations and educating their clientele on the importance of sustainability.\nFor Governments \ud83d\udd17\nCreating incentives for sustainable practices and enforcing environmental regulations ensures that the tourism industry aligns with broader conservation objectives.\nConclusion \ud83d\udd17\nImpact mitigation measures in tourism are not just strategies; they are necessary actions to ensure the longevity and integrity of our planet\u2019s precious destinations. By understanding and addressing the environmental impacts of tourism, promoting responsible tourism practices, and fostering collaboration among stakeholders, we can achieve a balance between the economic benefits of tourism and the preservation of natural and cultural resources.\nWhat do you think?

See Guide to this Report for more on\nassessments of likelihood and confidence.\n6.0: Introduction\nTemperature is among the most important climatic elements used in\ndecision-making. For example, builders and insurers use temperature\ndata for planning and risk management while energy companies and\nregulators use temperature data to predict demand and set utility\nrates. Temperature is also a key indicator of climate change: recent\nincreases are apparent over the land, ocean, and troposphere, and\nsubstantial changes are expected for this century. This chapter\nsummarizes the major observed and projected changes in near-surface\nair temperature over the United States, emphasizing new data sets\nand model projections since the Third National Climate Assessment\n(NCA3). Changes are depicted using a spectrum of observations,\nincluding surface weather stations, moored ocean buoys, polar-orbiting\nsatellites, and temperature-sensitive proxies. Projections are based\non global models and downscaled products from CMIP5 (Coupled Model\nIntercomparison Project Phase 5) using a suite of Representative\nConcentration Pathways (RCPs; see Ch. 4: Projections for more on\nRCPs and future scenarios).\n6.1: Historical Changes\n6.1.1 Average Temperatures\nChanges in average temperature are described using a suite of\nobservational datasets. As in NCA3, changes in land temperature are\nassessed using the nClimGrid dataset.1\n,2\nAlong U.S. coastlines,\nchanges in sea surface temperatures are quantified using a new\nreconstruction3\nthat forms the ocean component of the NOAA Global Temperature\ndataset.4\nChanges in middle tropospheric temperature are examined using updated\nversions of multiple satellite datasets.5\n,6\n,7\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States has\nrisen since the start of the 20th century. In general, temperature\nincreased until about 1940, decreased until about 1970, and increased\nrapidly through 2016. Because the increase was not constant over\ntime, multiple methods were evaluated in this report (as in NCA3)\nto quantify the trend. All methods yielded rates of warming that\nwere significant at the 95% level. The lowest estimate of 1.2\u00b0F\n(0.7\u00b0C) was obtained by computing the difference between the average\nfor 1986\u20132016 (i.e., present-day) and the average for 1901\u20131960\n(i.e., the first half of the last century). The highest estimate\nof 1.8\u00b0F (1.0\u00b0C) was obtained by fitting a linear (least-squares)\nregression line through the period 1895\u20132016. Thus, the temperature\nincrease cited in this assessment is 1.2\u00b0\u20131.8\u00b0F (0.7\u00b0\u20131.0\u00b0C).\nThis increase is about 0.1\u00b0F (0.06\u00b0C) less than presented in NCA3,\nand it results from the use of slightly different periods in each\nreport. In particular, the decline in the lower bound stems from\nthe use of different time periods to represent present-day climate\n(NCA3 used 1991\u20132012, which was slightly warmer than the 1986\u20132016\nperiod used here). The decline in the upper bound stems mainly from\ntemperature differences late in the record (e.g., the last year of\ndata available for NCA3 was 2012, which was the warmest year on\nrecord for the contiguous United States).\nEach NCA region experienced a net warming through 2016 (Table 6.1).\nThe largest changes were in the western United States, where average\ntemperature increased by more than 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) in Alaska, the\nNorthwest, the Southwest, and also in the Northern Great Plains.\nAs noted in NCA3, the Southeast had the least warming, driven by a\ncombination of natural variations and human influences.8\nIn most regions, average\nminimum temperature increased at a slightly higher rate than average\nmaximum temperature, with the Midwest having the largest discrepancy,\nand the Southwest and Northwest having the smallest. This differential\nrate of warming resulted in a continuing decrease in the diurnal\ntemperature range that is consistent with other parts of the globe.9\nAnnual average\nsea surface temperature also increased along all regional coastlines\n(see Figure 1.3), though changes were generally smaller than over\nland owing to the higher heat capacity of water. Increases were\nlargest in Alaska (greater than 1.0\u00b0F [0.6\u00b0C]) while increases\nwere smallest (less than 0.5\u00b0F [0.3\u00b0C]) in coastal areas of the\nSoutheast.\nMore than 95% of the land surface of the contiguous United States\nhad an increase in annual average temperature (Figure 6.1). In\ncontrast, only small (and somewhat dispersed) parts of the Southeast\nand Southern Great Plains experienced cooling. From a seasonal\nperspective, warming was greatest and most widespread in winter,\nwith increases of over 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) in most areas. In summer,\nwarming was less extensive (mainly along the East Coast and in the\nwestern third of the Nation), while cooling was evident in parts\nof the Southeast, Midwest, and Great Plains.\nFigure 6.1\nObserved changes in annual, winter, and summer temperature (\u00b0F). Changes are the difference\nbetween the average for present-day (1986\u20132016) and the average for the first half of\nthe last century (1901\u20131960 for the contiguous United States, 1925\u20131960 for Alaska and Hawai\u2018i).\nEstimates are derived from the nClimDiv dataset.\n1\n,2\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nThere has been a rapid increase in the average temperature of the\ncontiguous United States over the past several decades. There is\ngeneral consistency on this point between the surface thermometer\nrecord from NOAA1\nand the middle tropospheric satellite records from Remote Sensing\nSystems (RSS),5\nNOAA\u2019s Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR),7\nand the University\nof Alabama in Huntsville (UAH).6\nIn particular, for the\nperiod 1979\u20132016, the rate of warming in the surface record was\n0.512\u00b0F (0.284\u00b0C) per decade, versus trends of 0.455\u00b0F (0.253\u00b0C),\n0.421\u00b0F (0.234\u00b0C), and 0.289\u00b0F (0.160 \u00b0C) per decade for RSS version\n4, STAR version 3, and UAH version 6, respectively (after accounting\nfor stratospheric influences). All trends are statistically significant\nat the 95% level. For the contiguous United States, the year 2016\nwas the second-warmest on record at the surface and in the middle\ntroposphere (2012 was the warmest year at the surface, and 2015 was\nthe warmest in the middle troposphere). Generally speaking, surface\nand satellite records do not have identical trends because they do\nnot represent the same physical quantity; surface measurements are\nmade using thermometers in shelters about 1.5 meters above the\nground whereas satellite measurements are mass-weighted averages\nof microwave emissions from deep atmospheric layers. The UAH record\nlikely has a lower trend because it differs from the other satellite\nproducts in the treatment of target temperatures from the NOAA-9\nsatellite as well as in the correction for diurnal drift.10\nRecent paleo-temperature evidence confirms the unusual character\nof wide-scale warming during the past few decades as determined\nfrom the instrumental record. The most important new paleoclimate\nstudy since NCA3 showed that for each of the seven continental\nregions, the reconstructed area-weighted average temperature for\n1971\u20132000 was higher than for any other time in nearly 1,400 years,11\nalthough with\nsignificant uncertainty around the central estimate that leads to\nthis conclusion. Recent (up to 2006) 30-year smoothed temperatures\nacross temperate North America (including most of the continental\nUnited States) are similarly reconstructed as the warmest over the\npast 1,500 years12\n(Figure 6.2). Unlike the PAGES 2k seven-continent result mentioned\nabove, this conclusion for North America is robust in relation to\nthe estimated uncertainty range. Reconstruction data since 1500 for\nwestern temperate North America show the same conclusion at the\nannual time scale for 1986\u20132005. This time period and the running\n20-year periods thereafter are warmer than all possible continuous\n20-year sequences in a 1,000-member statistical reconstruction\nensemble.13\n6.1.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.2\nPollen-based temperature reconstruction for temperate North America.\nThe blue curve depicts the pollen-based reconstruction of 30-year\naverages (as anomalies from 1904 to 1980) for the temperate region\n(30\u00b0\u201355\u00b0N, 75\u00b0\u2013130\u00b0W). The red curve shows the corresponding tree\nring-based decadal average reconstruction, which was smoothed and\nused to calibrate the lower-frequency pollen-based estimate. Light\n(medium) blue zones indicate 2 standard error (1 standard error)\nuncertainty estimations associated with each 30-year value. The\nblack curve shows comparably smoothed instrumental temperature\nvalues up to 1980. The dashed black line represents the average\ntemperature anomaly of comparably smoothed instrumental data for\nthe period 2000\u20132006. (Figure source: NOAA NCEI).\nShifts in temperature extremes are examined using a suite of\nsocietally relevant climate change indices14\n,15\nderived from long-term\nobservations of daily surface temperature.16\nThe coldest and warmest\ntemperatures of the year are of particular relevance given their\nwidespread use in engineering, agricultural, and other sectoral\napplications (for example, extreme annual design conditions by the\nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning;\nplant hardiness zones by the U.S. Department of Agriculture). Cold\nwaves and heat waves (that is, extended periods of below or above\nnormal temperature) are likewise of great importance because of\ntheir numerous societal and environmental impacts, which span from\nhuman health to plant and animal phenology. Changes are considered\nfor a spectrum of event frequencies and intensities, ranging from\nthe typical annual extreme to the 1-in-10 year event (an extreme\nthat only has a 10% chance of occurrence in any given year). The\ndiscussion focuses on the contiguous United States; Alaska, Hawai\u2018i,\nand the Caribbean do not have a sufficient number of long-term\nstations for a century-scale analysis.\nCold extremes have become less severe over the past century. For\nexample, the coldest daily temperature of the year has increased\nat most locations in the contiguous United States (Figure 6.3). All\nregions experienced net increases (Table 6.2), with the largest\nrises in the Northern Great Plains and the Northwest (roughly 4.5\u00b0F\n[2.5\u00b0C]), and the smallest in the Southeast (about 1.0\u00b0F [0.6\u00b0C]).\nIn general, there were increases throughout the record, with a\nslight acceleration in recent decades (Figure 6.3). The temperature\nof extremely cold days (1-in-10 year events) generally exhibited\nthe same pattern of increases as the coldest daily temperature of\nthe year. Consistent with these increases, the number of cool nights\nper year (those with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile\nfor 1961\u20131990) declined in all regions, with much of the West having\ndecreases of roughly two weeks. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile for\n1961\u20131990) has fallen over the past century (Figure 6.4). The\nfrequency of intense cold waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) peaked\nin the 1980s and then reached record-low levels in the 2000s.17\nFigure 6.3\nObserved changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures (\u00b0F) of the year in the contiguous United States.\nMaps (top) depict changes at stations; changes are the difference between the average for present-day (1986\u20132016)\nand the average for the first half of the last century (1901\u20131960). Time series (bottom) depict the area-weighted\naverage for the contiguous United States. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with minimal missing data\nin the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily dataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nFigure 6.4\nObserved changes in cold and heat waves in the contiguous United States. The top panel depicts changes\nin the frequency of cold waves; the middle panel depicts changes in the frequency of heat waves; and the\nbottom panel depicts changes in the intensity of heat waves. Cold and heat wave frequency indices are\ndefined in Zhang et al.,15\nand the heat wave\nintensity index is defined in Russo et al.14\nEstimates are\nderived from long-term stations with minimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in warm extremes are more nuanced than changes in cold\nextremes. For instance, the warmest daily temperature of the year\nincreased in some parts of the West over the past century (Figure\n6.3), but there were decreases in almost all locations east of the\nRocky Mountains. In fact, all eastern regions experienced a net\ndecrease (Table 6.2), most notably the Midwest (about 2.2\u00b0F [1.2\u00b0C])\nand the Southeast (roughly 1.5\u00b0F [0.8\u00b0C]). The decreases in the\neastern half of Nation, particularly in the Great Plains, are mainly\ntied to the unprecedented summer heat of the 1930s Dust Bowl era,\nwhich was exacerbated by land-surface feedbacks driven by springtime\nprecipitation deficits and land mismanagement.18\nHowever, anthropogenic\naerosol forcing may also have reduced summer temperatures in the\nNortheast and Southeast from the early 1950s to the mid-1970s,19\nand agricultural\nintensification may have suppressed the hottest extremes in the\nMidwest.20\nSince the mid-1960s, there has been only a very slight increase in\nthe warmest daily temperature of the year (amidst large interannual\nvariability). Heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile for 1961\u20131990) increased in frequency\nuntil the mid-1930s, became considerably less common through the\nmid-1960s, and increased in frequency again thereafter (Figure 6.4).\nAs with warm daily temperatures, heat wave magnitude reached a\nmaximum in the 1930s. The frequency of intense heat waves (4-day,\n1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most\nregions except the Midwest and the Great Plains.17\n,21\nSince the early 1980s\n(Figure 6.4), there is suggestive evidence of a slight increase in\nthe intensity of heat waves nationwide14\nas well as an increase\nin the concurrence of droughts and heat waves.22\nFigure 6.5\nObserved changes in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures\nin the contiguous United States. Red bars indicate a year with more\ndaily record highs than daily record lows, while blue bars indicate\na year with more record lows than highs. The height of the bar\nindicates the ratio of record highs to lows (red) or of record lows\nto highs (blue). For example, a ratio of 2:1 for a blue bar means\nthat there were twice as many record daily lows as daily record\nhighs that year. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with\nminimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures are\nalso apparent. Very generally, the number of record lows has been\ndeclining since the late-1970s while the number of record highs has\nbeen rising.23\nBy extension, there has been an increase in the ratio of the\nnumber of record highs to record lows (Figure 6.5). Over the past\ntwo decades, the average of this ratio exceeds two (meaning that\ntwice as many high-temperature records have been set as low-temperature\nrecords). The number of new highs has surpassed the number of new\nlows in 15 of the last 20 years, with 2012 and 2016 being particularly\nextreme (ratios of seven and five, respectively).\n6.2: Detection and Attribution\n6.2.1\nAverage Temperatures\nWhile a confident attribution of global temperature increases to\nanthropogenic forcing has been made,24\ndetection and attribution\nassessment statements for smaller regions are generally much weaker.\nNevertheless, some detectable anthropogenic influences on average\ntemperature have been reported for North America and parts of the\nUnited States (e.g., Christidis et al. 2010;25\nBonfils et al. 2008;26\nPierce et al.\n200927\n).\nFigure 6.6 shows an example for linear trends for 1901\u20132015,\nindicating a detectable anthropogenic warming since 1901 over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States for\nthe CMIP5 multimodel ensemble\u2014a condition that was also met for\nmost of the individual models.28\nThe Southeast stands out\nas the only region with no \u201cdetectable\u201d warming since 1901; observed\ntrends there were inconsistent with CMIP5 All Forcing historical\nruns.28\nThe\ncause of this \u201cwarming hole,\u201d or lack of a long-term warming trend,\nremains uncertain, though it is likely a combination of natural and\nhuman causes. Some studies conclude that changes in anthropogenic\naerosols have played a crucial role (e.g., Leibensperger et al.\n2012a,b;29\n,30\nYu et al. 201431\n), whereas other studies infer a possible large role for atmospheric\ncirculation,32\ninternal climate variability (e.g., Meehl et al. 2012;8\nKnutson et al.\n2013a28\n), and\nchanges in land use (e.g., Goldstein et al. 2009;33\nXu et al. 201534\n). Notably, the\nSoutheast has been warming rapidly since the early 1960s.35\n,36\nIn summary, there\nis medium confidence for detectable anthropogenic warming over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States.\nFigure 6.6\nDetection and attribution assessment of trends in annual average\ntemperature (\u00b0F). Grid-box values indicate whether linear trends\nfor 1901\u20132015 are detectable (that is, distinct from natural\nvariability) and/or consistent with CMIP5 historical All-Forcing\nruns. If the grid-box trend is found to be both detectable and\neither consistent with or greater than the warming in the All-Forcing\nruns, then the grid box is assessed as having a detectable anthropogenic\ncontribution to warming over the period. Gray regions represent\ngrid boxes with data that are too sparse for detection and attribution.\n(Figure source: updated from Knutson et al. 2013;28\n\u00a9 American Meteorological\nSociety. Used with permission.)\n6.2.2\nTemperature Extremes\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC\u2019s) Fifth\nAssessment Report (AR5)24\nconcluded that it is very likely that human influence has\ncontributed to the observed changes in frequency and intensity of\ntemperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century.\nThe combined influence of anthropogenic and natural forcings was\nalso detectable (medium confidence) over large subregions of North\nAmerica (e.g., Zwiers et al. 2011;37\nMin et al. 201338\n). In general,\nhowever, results for the contiguous United States are not as\ncompelling as for global land areas, in part because detection of\nchanges in U.S. regional temperature extremes is affected by extreme\ntemperature in the 1930s.17\nTable 6.3 summarizes\navailable attribution statements for recent extreme U.S. temperature\nevents. As an example, the recent record or near-record high March\u2013May\naverage temperatures occurring in 2012 over the eastern United\nStates were attributed in part to external (natural plus anthropogenic)\nforcing;39\nthe century-scale trend response of temperature to external forcing\nis typically a close approximation to the anthropogenic forcing\nresponse alone. Another study found that although the extreme March\n2012 warm anomalies over the United States were mostly due to natural\nvariability, anthropogenic warming contributed to the severity.40\nSuch statements\nreveal that both natural and anthropogenic factors influence the\nseverity of extreme temperature events. Nearly every modern analysis\nof current extreme hot and cold events reveals some degree of\nattributable human influence.\n6.3: Projected Changes\n6.3.1 Average Temperatures\nTemperature projections are based on global model results and\nassociated downscaled products from CMIP5 using a suite of\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). In contrast to NCA3,\nmodel weighting is employed to refine projections of temperature\nfor each RCP (Ch. 4: Projections; Appendix B: Model Weighting).\nWeighting parameters are based on model independence and skill over\nNorth America for seasonal temperature and annual extremes. Unless\nstated otherwise, all changes presented here represent the weighted\nmultimodel mean. The weighting scheme helps refine confidence and\nlikelihood statements, but projections of U.S. surface air temperature\nremain very similar to those in NCA3. Generally speaking, extreme\ntemperatures are projected to increase even more than average\ntemperatures.41\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States is\nprojected to rise throughout the century. Increases for the period\n2021\u20132050 relative to 1976\u20132005 are projected to be about 2.5\u00b0F\n(1.4\u00b0C) for a lower scenario (RCP4.5) and 2.9\u00b0F (1.6\u00b0C) for the\nhigher scenario (RCP8.5); the similarity in warming reflects the\nsimilarity in greenhouse gas concentrations during this period\n(Figure 4.1). Notably, a 2.5\u00b0F (1.4\u00b0C) increase makes the near-term\naverage comparable to the hottest year in the historical record\n(2012). In other words, recent record-breaking years may be \u201ccommon\u201d\nin the next few decades. By late-century (2071\u20132100), the RCPs\ndiverge significantly, leading to different rates of warming:\napproximately 5.0\u00b0F (2.8\u00b0C) for RCP4.5 and 8.7\u00b0F (4.8\u00b0C) for RCP8.5.\nLikewise, there are different ranges of warming for each scenario:\n2.8\u00b0\u20137.3\u00b0F (1.6\u00b0\u20134.1\u00b0C) for RCP4.5 and 5.8\u00b0\u201311.9\u00b0F (3.2\u00b0\u20136.6\u00b0C) for\nRCP8.5. (The range is defined here as the difference between the\naverage increase in the three coolest models and the average increase\nin the three warmest models.) For both RCPs, slightly greater\nincreases are projected in summer than winter (except for Alaska),\nand average maximums will rise slightly faster than average minimums\n(except in the Southeast and Southern Great Plains).\nFigure 6.7\nProjected changes in annual average temperatures (\u00b0F). Changes are\nthe difference between the average for mid-century (2036\u20132065; top)\nor late-century (2070-2099, bottom) and the average for near-present\n(1976\u20132005). Each map depicts the weighted multimodel mean. Increases\nare statistically significant in all areas (that is, more than 50%\nof the models show a statistically significant change, and more\nthan 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nStatistically significant warming is projected for all parts of the\nUnited States throughout the century (Figure 6.7). Consistent with\npolar amplification, warming rates (and spatial gradients) are\ngreater at higher latitudes. For example, warming is largest in\nAlaska (more than 12.0\u00b0F [6.7\u00b0C] in the northern half of the state\nby late-century under RCP8.5), driven in part by a decrease in snow\ncover and thus surface albedo. Similarly, northern regions of the\ncontiguous United States have slightly more warming than other\nregions (roughly 9.0\u00b0F [5.5\u00b0C] in the Northeast, Midwest, and\nNorthern Great Plains by late-century under RCP8.5; Table 6.4). The\nSoutheast has slightly less warming because of latent heat release\nfrom increases in evapotranspiration (as is already evident in the\nobserved record). Warming is smallest in Hawai\u2018i and the Caribbean\n(roughly 4.0\u00b0\u20136.0\u00b0F [2.2\u00b0\u20133.3\u00b0C] by late century under RCP8.5)\ndue to the moderating effects of surrounding oceans. From a\nsub-regional perspective, less warming is projected along the coasts\nof the contiguous United States, again due to maritime influences,\nalthough increases are still substantial. Warming at higher elevations\nmay be underestimated because the resolution of the CMIP5 models\ndoes not capture orography in detail.\nRCP4.5\nMid-Century\n(2036\u20132065)\nRCP8.5\nMid-Century\n(2036\u20132065)\nRCP4.5\nLate-Century\n(2071\u20132100)\nRCP8.5\nLate-Century\n(2071\u20132100)\n6.3.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.8\nProjected changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures\n(\u00b0F) of the year in the contiguous United States. Changes are the\ndifference between the average for mid-century (2036\u20132065) and the\naverage for near-present (1976\u20132005) under the higher scenario\n(RCP8.5). Maps in the top row depict the weighted multimodel mean\nwhereas maps on the bottom row depict the mean of the three warmest\nmodels (that is, the models with the largest temperature increase).\nMaps are derived from 32 climate model projections that were\nstatistically downscaled using the Localized Constructed Analogs\ntechnique.51\nIncreases are\nstatistically significant in all areas (that is\u00ad\u00ad,\nmore than 50% of the models show a statistically significant change,\nand more than 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nDaily extreme temperatures are projected to increase substantially\nin the contiguous United States, particularly under the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5). For instance, the coldest and warmest daily\ntemperatures of the year are expected to increase at least 5\u00b0F\n(2.8\u00b0C) in most areas by mid-century,42\nrising to 10\u00b0F (5.5\u00b0C)\nor more by late-century.43\nIn general, there will\nbe larger increases in the coldest temperatures of the year,\nespecially in the northern half of the Nation, whereas the warmest\ntemperatures will exhibit somewhat more uniform changes geographically\n(Figure 6.8). By mid-century, the upper bound for projected changes\n(i.e., the average of the three warmest models) is about 2\u00b0F (1.1\u00b0C)\ngreater than the weighted multimodel mean. On a regional basis,\nannual extremes (Table 6.5) are consistently projected to rise\nfaster than annual averages (Table 6.4). Future changes in \u201cvery\nrare\u201d extremes are also striking; by late century, current 1-in-20\nyear maximums are projected to occur every year, while current\n1-in-20 year minimums are not expected to occur at all.44\nThe frequency and intensity of cold waves is projected to decrease\nwhile the frequency and intensity of heat waves is projected to\nincrease throughout the century. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile) will\ndecrease the most in Alaska and the least in the Northeast while\nthe frequency of heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile) will increase in all regions, particularly\nthe Southeast, Southwest, and Alaska. By mid-century, decreases in\nthe frequency of cold waves are similar across RCPs whereas increases\nin the frequency of heat waves are about 50% greater in the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5) than the lower scenario (RCP4.5).45\nThe intensity of cold\nwaves is projected to decrease while the intensity of heat waves\nis projected to increase, dramatically so under RCP8.5. By mid-century,\nboth extreme cold waves and extreme heat waves (5-day, 1-in-10 year\nevents) are projected to have temperature increases of at least\n11.0\u00b0F (6.1\u00b0C) nationwide, with larger increases in northern regions\n(the Northeast, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, and Northwest; Table\n6.5).\nFigure 6.9\nProjected changes in the number of days per year with a maximum\ntemperature above 90\u00b0F and a minimum temperature below 32\u00b0F in the\ncontiguous United States. Changes are the difference between the\naverage for mid-century (2036\u20132065) and the average for near-present\n(1976\u20132005) under the higher scenario (RCP8.5). Maps in the top row\ndepict the weighted multimodel mean whereas maps on the bottom row\ndepict the mean of the three warmest models (that is, the models\nwith the largest temperature increase). Maps are derived from 32\nclimate model projections that were statistically downscaled using\nthe Localized Constructed Analogs technique.51\nChanges are statistically\nsignificant in all areas (that is, more than 50% of the models show\na statistically significant change, and more than 67% agree on the\nsign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC and NOAA NCEI).\nThere are large projected changes in the number of days exceeding\nkey temperature thresholds throughout the contiguous United States.\nFor instance, there are about 20\u201330 more days per year with a maximum\nover 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) in most areas by mid-century under RCP8.5, with\nincreases of 40\u201350 days in much of the Southeast (Figure 6.9). The\nupper bound for projected changes is very roughly 10 days greater\nthan the weighted multimodel mean. Consistent with widespread\nwarming, there are 20\u201330 fewer days per year with a minimum temperature\nbelow freezing in the northern and eastern parts of the nation,\nwith decreases of more than 40\u201350 days in much the West. The upper\nbound for projected changes in freezing events is very roughly 10\u201320\ndays fewer than the weighted multimodel mean in many areas.\nReferences\nModal\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n1800 G Street, NW, Suite 9100, Washington, DC 20006 USA\nTel: +1 202.223.6262 | Fax: +1 202.223.3065\nContact Us \u2022\nCredits \u2022\nPrivacy Policy \u2022\nSite Map\nSome figures and images are copyright protected.\nPermission of the copyright owner must be obtained\nbefore making use of copyrighted material.",

    "document": "Phoenix and Maricopa County on track to count fewer heat deaths for first time in a decade\nMaricopa County's medical examiner isn't quite done counting heat-related deaths for 2024, but the Department of Public Health told The Arizona Republic this week the totals are likely to come in under that for 2023. It would be the first year in a decade when the number has not increased.\nIn 2023, 645 people died from factors related to environmental heat in Arizona's most populous county, with a majority of those cases determined to have been directly caused by heat. That staggering death toll, which drew international attention to metro Phoenix's record-breaking temperatures due to climate change and urban development, was a 52% increase over the previous year, which was a 25% jump compared to the year before that.\nLast year's heat mortality count was also nearly an eightfold increase over the 84 heat-related deaths in 2015.\n\"This is not yet absolute by any means, but about 75% of the cases that are under investigation are what we estimate will likely be confirmed,\" Dr. Nick Staab, a medical epidemiologist and assistant medical director for the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, told The Republic Tuesday. \"With our update today, that would be around 609 cases, which would be less than the 645 from last year.\"\nThe medical examiner's office changed protocols for flagging deaths under investigation as potentially heat-related in 2023 to address process oversights that may have resulted in undercounts for previous years. But \"nothing has changed for counts of confirmed heat-related deaths,\" chief medical examiner Dr. Jeff Johnston told The Republic on Wednesday, adding that \"comparisons of annual counts of heat-related deaths are reliable and should be comparable to other jurisdictions who are medically investigating such deaths.\"\nThe protocol change reflects a growing awareness nationwide of the deadly consequences of worsening extreme heat. In 2017, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a guidance toolkit for disaster-related medical death investigations that included a form and checklist for heat wave disasters. As some of the hottest urban areas in the country, Maricopa and Pima Counties were already ahead of the curve on these efforts at that point, Johnston said.\nThe CDC still \"does not have any real-time surveillance protocols that we are aware of for such investigations,\" he said, but the agency has praised Maricopa County's heat surveillance efforts, which have helped guide practices in other regions dealing with dangerously rising temperatures, including Miami-Dade County, FL; Harris County, TX; King County, WA; the state of Louisiana; and most recently Los Angeles County.\nMore:In Arizona, a generation fears uncertainties in abortion access and climate action\nThe fact that an increased focus on considering environmental temperatures in death investigations may be offset by fewer heat-caused cases this year also suggests that local programs aimed at stemming health impacts to Arizonans from extreme heat might be working. If the 2024 heat death total bends the skyrocketing trend from recent years downward, as Staab expects, even with changes that might result in more deaths being attributed to heat over the past two years than in previous assessments, it will signify a needed shift many years in the making.\n\u201cThere has been some reporting that maybe we were ahead of last year\u2019s numbers and really we think we will end up very close to last year\u2019s numbers, and maybe just under,\" Staab said. \"We\u2019re at a point where we feel like what we\u2019re doing in public health is working because we\u2019ve all seen in the last couple of years this kind of persistent climb upwards. We really want to see that number significantly lower because, as we have always said, we do believe all these deaths are preventable.\"\nPhoenix cites 20% fewer heat-related illness emergency calls in 2024\nThough Phoenix officials also do not yet have a confirmed 2024 heat-related death count, they, too, cited measurable progress this week on addressing the human toll of extreme heat.\n\"When we look at the number of heat-related emergencies that our firefighters are dealing with, we saw a 20% reduction when compared to the same period last year,\" Phoenix's executive assistant fire chief Tim Kreis told reporters at a news briefing Thursday.\nEven with that decrease, firefighters still responded to 1,416 heat-related calls for service between May 1 and October 1, during which time fire and emergency management staff used ice-filled cooling bags to quickly reduce dangerously high body temperatures of patients more than 300 times.\nSo far in 2024, the county medical examiner has determined that 240 people died from heat-related causes within Phoenix city limits, 83% of whom were exposed to dangerous temperatures outdoors. In 2023, a total of 340 people succumbed to heat in Phoenix, with 79% of cases originating in outdoor settings.\nThe slight drop in likely totals for 2024 and shift to outdoor risks highlights both Phoenix's challenges with keeping its large unhoused population safe from extreme heat and its successes in making some headway indoors. Access to cooled spaces for unhoused people and programs to check on indoor residents who may be at risk of heat impacts, like elderly and low-income families who may not have or use air conditioning at home, seem to be helping.\nDave Hondula, who directs Phoenix\u2019s Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, told The Republic last year that he makes many of the calls to check on vulnerable residents signed up with the city's \"Cool Callers\" program during heat waves himself. He attributed this year's incremental gains to improved coordination between members of the county's regional Heat Relief Network. One stat he shared Thursday was that his office had distributed one million water bottles to network partners this summer to facilitate regional cooling hydration.\n\u201cAlthough we had a record number of heat records this summer, I\u2019m very confident there\u2019s been a significant and positive public health impact from this heat relief work,\" Hondula said Thursday. \"Lives were saved and lives were changed.\u201d\u00a0\nMore:In a heat wave, some people wait too long to turn on the AC. Smart data use could help\nMayor Kate Gallego also attributed progress on heat initiatives to collaborative action between Hondula's team and the city's Offices of Homeless Solutions, Public Health, Emergency Management and the Fire Department.\nThis year, these efforts included: expanding a network of more than sixty cooling centers and hydration stations; extending hours at certain respite centers to include overnight access; providing transitional shelter space cooled using solar-generated power; the phased opening of the new \"Phoenix Navigation Center\" homeless shelter that was controversial with nearby residents; and managing the \"Safe Outdoor Space\" campground with basic services.\nIn March, the Phoenix City Council passed an ordinance to shield city-contracted workers from extreme heat, in contrast with delayed action on worker protections by the state and nationwide. Throughout the summer, the city also distributed heat relief supplies and grant funding originating from $1.8 million in federal funds from the American Rescue Plan Act, $500,000 from the state and $1.6 million from the county, Gallego said on Thursday.\nMore:Arizona workers one step closer to extreme heat protections with proposed Biden rules\n'The weather is not working in our favor'\nAmid these indications of progress, speakers at Thursday's city news briefing and at the Maricopa County Department of Public Health underscored that more must be done to address the hundreds of preventable heat deaths that occur locally each year.\n\u201cAcross our state, we have to treat extreme heat as a public health hazard, just like other states and communities have to prepare for harsh weather such as blizzards, hurricanes, and flooding,\u201d Gallego said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we need other levels of government to provide additional resources and support to this cause. Our summers are only growing hotter and more intense, and it\u2019s past due that we treat heat like the emergency it is.\u201d \u00a0\nOne way this must happen, scientists say, is through action to address the warming influences of climate change. Burning fossil fuels for energy releases molecules into the air known as greenhouse gases, the most common of which is carbon dioxide. There, they absorb heat from the sun and alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere, which scientists have consistently concluded leads directly to more chaotic and extreme storms, drought and heat waves.\nThe destruction wrought by the most major of these \"not-so-natural\" disasters has already cost the American economy more than $61 billion in 2024, a figure that doesn't include extreme heat events and may triple after the price tags of supercharged Hurricanes Helene and Milton are confirmed. Grocery bills are also spiking in response to crop losses caused by drought and rising temperatures.\nA climate action progress report recently published by Gallego's team tracks Phoenix's recent efforts to address this root cause. But the global problem is exacerbated by other leaders, like members of the Arizona Legislature who have not engaged with climate-based solutions to heat illness and inflation. The most obvious of those solutions, experts say, is to shift energy use to clean and renewable sources. In the past two years, Arizona's solar, battery storage and electric vehicle industries have leveraged nearly $12 billion in investments and more than 18,000 jobs facilitated by President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act toward this goal, though increases in energy demand threaten overall progress.\nMore:In its first climate plan report card, Phoenix claims some progress, with work still to do\nPolitics could also play a role in how Maricopa County's scientists are able to track and study the environmental causes of local heat-related deaths. Staab of the County's Public Health Department told The Republic that insight into heat health impacts has benefitted from the use of publicly available data from the National Weather Service.\n\u201cWith data sources expanding so much, our (epidemiologists) are looking at National Weather Service data and all sorts of stuff to bring into our analysis and that power communicating it out,\" Staab said.\nThat data source has been targeted by the Project 2025 agenda for a second Donald Trump administration. While Trump has distanced himself from this 900-page plan to dismantle many federal and scientific agencies and environmental protections, its creation by members of his prior administration leads many to believe he would enact many of its suggestions, complicating Arizona's efforts to study and address heat-caused deaths.\n\u201cThere is an obvious benefit to having a public, reliable National Weather Service that is funded collectively by taxpayer dollars,\" David Kieve, president of Environmental Defense Fund Action, told The Republic in August. \"The idea that you\u2019re going to privatize that and it will run better as a private business, that\u2019s not going to work. And it\u2019s not going to work for Arizonans at a time when we\u2019re seeing a rising number of extraordinarily hot days.\"\nMore:Climate was barely mentioned in the debate, but Harris and Trump showed wide differences\nRising average temperatures and increasingly frequent extreme heat waves are, Staab also noted, not the only contributors to deaths coded by the medical examiner as heat-related. Drug use, particularly meth, is a growing problem in Phoenix and can \"shut down the body's heat defense system,\" according to reporting by The Republic this summer.\n\u201cWe continue to see a lot of our heat-related deaths amongst those who are unsheltered and those who are using substances, whether that\u2019s drugs or alcohol,\" Staab said. \"As we move forward in our efforts to reach these individuals, we need to focus on partnering with community-based organizations working with those high-risk communities.\"\nAt Thursday's heat relief briefing, Rachel Milne, director of Phoenix's Office of Homeless Solutions, highlighted efforts the city has made to \"help individuals connect with resources beyond heat relief, like housing or shelter.\" Data from the Heat Relief Network showed that 92% of more than 35,000 visitors to cooling centers during summer 2024 reported they were experiencing homelessness. More than 1,000 of them then received direct onsite assistance from Community Bridges Inc, a partner organization working with Milne.\nRead our climate series:The latest from Joan Meiners at azcentral on climate change\nBut while the progress made in 2024 to reduce preventable heat deaths \u2014 through the smart use of data sources, the application of federal, state and county funding, the body bags of ice, the heat-aware changes to medical examining protocols and more \u2014 is promising and inspiring and likely saved lives, innumerable more water bottles, cooling centers and heat ordinances may be needed if climate change is not brought under control.\n\u201cThe weather is not working in our favor,\u201d Staab said.\nJoan Meiners is the climate news and storytelling reporter at The Arizona Republic and\u00a0azcentral.com.

Over the past 12 months, the increase in the CPI has surpassed the median estimate in 5 months, matched the median estimate in 2 months, and fallen short of the median estimate in 5 months. It is interesting to note that actual CPI number has been below the estimate over the past four months (May 2024 through August 2024). Over the past 5 years (60 months), the increase in the CPI has surpassed the median estimate 52% of the time, matched the median estimate 15% of the time, and fallen short of the median estimate 33% of the time.\nThe median estimate of 2.3% is based on 17 estimates collected by FactSet. These CPI estimates range from a low of 2.20% to a high of 2.40%, for a spread of 20 bps. This spread is smaller than the trailing 12-month average spread between the low and high estimate of 27 bps and smaller than the 5-year (60 month) average spread between the low and high estimate 49 bps.\nThe median estimate (year-over-year, not seasonally adjusted) for the consumer price index excluding food & energy (Core CPI) is 3.2%.\nTomorrow (October 10) the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release the CPI and Core CPI numbers for September.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThis blog post is for informational purposes only.

    "document": "Lung Health and Your Environment The health of our lungs depends on a healthy environment. Research supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) shows that protecting lung health requires strategies to improve our environment and lifestyle choices.\nMany environmental factors can affect the health of your lungs. Air pollution and cigarette smoke are the greatest threats. Some lung diseases are caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. Air Quality Studies linking air quality to health effects are numerous and important. Pollution can be found outdoors, from vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, or wildfires, but also indoors. Outdoor pollution can enter a building. At home, indoor pollutants can come from gas stoves, tobacco smoke, or fireplaces. Air pollution comes in many forms and can be present anywhere. Airborne pollutants are substances, such as chemicals in smoke or exhaust, that can reduce air quality and harm health. These pollutants can contribute to lung diseases such as asthma,1 emphysema,2 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer.3 Improving air quality may lead to health benefits. Large studies show an association between decreases in levels of outdoor air pollutants and improvement in lung function, including reductions in asthma symptoms.4 Former smokers with COPD who used portable air cleaners with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in their homes had improved respiratory symptoms.5 Interventions that improve indoor air quality may be a way to improve respiratory health.\nClimate Change Changes in temperature and precipitation may increase health risks related to air quality, such as respiratory and cardiopulmonary illnesses. Also, the frequency and severity of allergic illnesses, including asthma and hay fever, are expected to increase as a result of a changing climate.6 More intense wildfires, hurricanes, and floods can lead to increased hospitalization and death due to cardiopulmonary disease.7 Tobacco Smoke Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, which is the leading type of cancer-related death worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Research shows that smoking just a few cigarettes a day causes long-term lung damage.8 Breathing secondhand smoke also increases a person\u2019s chance of developing respiratory disease.9 Electronic Cigarettes Using electronic cigarettes, also called vaping, can lead to lung injury, according to the American Thoracic Society. Aerosols from these devices are complex and contain many different ingredients in varying amounts. NIEHS-funded researchers found exposure to electronic cigarette aerosols with nicotine could lead to increased cell death in the lungs and weaken disease-fighting white cells that are essential for healthy lungs.10 Wildfires Exposure to wildfire smoke can increase the risk of respiratory diseases and result in a significant decrease in lung function that can persist up to two years.11 More frequent and severe wildfires due to climate change may increase rates of respiratory illness from exposure to smoke.6 Mold Most types of molds are harmless, but some produce compounds that trigger allergies or asthma attacks. Studies show that mold exposure can worsen asthma symptoms, especially in young children.12 PO Box 12233 \u2022 Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 Phone: 919-541-3345 \u2022 https://niehs.nih.gov April 2022 National Institutes of Health U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Printed on recycled paper National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Radon Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that is colorless and odorless. In the U.S., radon exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Outdoors, radon disperses quickly, reducing the chance for it to harm health.\nRadon can seep indoors and accumulate inside buildings and homes. Testing is the only way to know whether indoor radon levels are high. If levels are high, a qualified professional can install special vents to make a home safer. Types of Respiratory Disease Airway diseases that affect breathing involve reduced or blocked air flow. Asthma is an example. COPD includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is often caused by smoking and indoor or outdoor air pollution. People can have a mix of asthma and COPD.\nInterstitial lung diseases reduce the lungs\u2019 ability to hold air. For example, pulmonary fibrosis is a scarring of lung tissue.\nLung cancer, an abnormal growth of cells, usually starts in the lungs, but can start elsewhere and spread to the lungs. It can have environmental and genetic causes.\nLung infections are caused by microorganisms (i.e., bacteria, viruses, or fungi) that damage lung tissue. Pneumonia is an infection that causes air sacs to fill with fluid. Pollution can increase the chance that lungs are more susceptible to infections, such as COVID-19.\nOther NIEHS Research \u2022\tMore than 50 genetic changes that affect the risk of pulmonary disorders have been identified. One change occurs in lung cells from drinking water contaminated with hexavalent chromium, an industrial chemical and human carcinogen.13 This information could improve drug development to treat lung function problems.14 \u2022\tThe NIEHS Matrix Biology Group has found a potential therapy in hyaluronan, a substance secreted by living tissue that acts as a biological scaffold for cells. It improved lung function in patients suffering from severe COPD.15 \u2022\tNon-small-cell lung cancer is often resistant to chemotherapy; however, NIEHS found silencing a gene called INO80 led to reduced tumor growth, potentially leading to better treatments and improved patient outcomes.16 \u2022\tMany tumors in the 10-20% of lung cancer sufferers who have never smoked arise from the accumulation of mutations caused by natural processes in the body.17 This finding may help researchers identify risk factors for lung cancers.

It identifies and explores the biggest trends in energy demand and supply, as well as what they mean for energy security, emissions and economic development.\nThis year\u2019s Outlook comes against a backdrop of escalating risks in the Middle East and heightened geopolitical tensions globally, and explores a range of energy security issues that decision makers face as they proceed with clean energy transitions. With rising investment of clean technologies and rapid growth in electricity demand, the WEO 2024 examines how far the world has come on its journey towards a safer and more sustainable energy system, and what more needs to be done to reach its climate goals.\nReflecting today\u2019s uncertainties, our three main scenarios are complemented with sensitivity cases for renewables, electric mobility, liquefied natural gas and how heatwaves, efficiency policies and the rise of artificial intelligence might affect the outlook for electricity.\nEnglish \nLanguage\n\nEnglish\nPolski\n\nPublished October 2024\nLicence CC BY 4.0 (report); CC BY NC SA 4.0 (Annex A)\nPress release\nLaunch live stream\nShare Cite\nOnline table of contents\n\n###### 1.0 Executive Summary Read online\n###### 2.0 Overview and key findings Read online\n###### 3.0 Context and scenario design Read online\n###### 4.0 Pathways for the energy mix Read online\n###### 5.0 Exploring uncertainties in the Outlook Read online\n###### 6.0 Security, affordability and sustainability Read online\n###### 7.0 Regional insights Read online\n###### 8.0 Regional dashboards Read online\n\nGlobal Energy and Climate Model\nThe Global Energy and Climate (GEC) Model key input dataset includes selected key input data for all three modelled scenarios (STEPS, APS, NZE).

The average temperature for October 2024 was recorded at around 11 degrees Celsius, compared to 11.9 degrees a year before. In the broader context of climate change, average monthly temperatures are indicative of where the national climate is headed and whether attempts to control global warming are successful.\u00a0\nSummer and winter\nAverage summer temperature in Germany fluctuated in recent years, generally between 18 to 19 degrees Celsius. The seasons remain generally warm, and while there may not be as many hot and sunny days as in other parts of Europe, heat waves have occurred. In fact, 2023 saw 11.5 days with a temperature of at least 30 degrees, though this was a decrease compared to the year before. Meanwhile, average winter temperatures also fluctuated, but were higher in recent years, rising over four degrees on average in 2024. Figures remained in the above zero range since 2011. Numbers therefore suggest that German winters are becoming warmer, even if individual regions experiencing colder sub-zero snaps or even more snowfall may disagree.\u00a0\nRain, rain, go away\nAverage monthly precipitation varied depending on the season, though sometimes figures from different times of the year were comparable. In 2024, the average monthly precipitation was highest in May and September, although rainfalls might increase in October and November with the beginning of the cold season. In the past, torrential rains have led to catastrophic flooding in Germany, with one of the most devastating being the flood of July 2021. Germany is not immune to the weather changing between two extremes, e.g. very warm spring months mostly without rain, when rain might be wished for, and then increased precipitation in other months where dry weather might be better, for example during planting and harvest seasons. Climate change remains on the agenda in all its far-reaching ways.\u00a0\n\n                        Average monthly temperature in Germany from October 2023 to October 2024 \n                    \n                            (in Celsius)\n                        \n\n                                    Additional Information\n                                \n\n                                Show sources information\n                            \n                                Show publisher information\n                            \n                                Use Ask Statista Research Service\n                            \nOctober 2024\nGermany\nOctober 2023 to October 2024\nFigures for the months preceding October 2024 were retrieved from previous report editions of the German Meteorological Service.According to the source, figures are preliminary.

This sign of growth offers \"a real chance of achieving the goal of tripling global capacity by 2030 that governments set at the COP28 climate change conference.\"\nIn 2022, 29.1% of the world's electricity was generated by renewable energy resources, and in 2023, renewable capacity grew another 50%. That year, 21.4% of total U.S. energy was produced by renewables, and in April of this year alone, solar, wind, hydropower and biomass provided 31% of the nation's electricity.\nBecause renewable energy sources depend on the environment, both the supply of and demand for renewables are affected by climate impacts such as high heat, drought, altered precipitation patterns, flooding, extreme weather and wildfires. Geothermal energy, which depends on heat from the Earth's interior, is the renewable energy source least affected by climate change impacts, but it provides only 0.4% of U.S. electricity.\n\"Where there may be impacts on renewable generating facilities, we need to plan for that and prepare for that,\" said Romany Webb, deputy director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at the Columbia Climate School. \"But we need to think about how climate change will impact the energy system as a whole because, unfortunately, no electricity generating system is immune from the impacts of climate change.\"\nWebb said that the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and others suggest that fossil fuel-based resources are actually at much higher risk from climate impacts. For example, most fossil fuel facilities are designed to operate at a specific temperature and require water for cooling.\nAs air temperatures rise and increase water temperatures, fossil fuel and nuclear facilities have had to shut down because nearby water bodies were too warm to draw from, or the plants couldn't release used water into them because that would have exceeded their thermal limits.\nHow are renewable energy resources affected by climate change?\nSolar\nSolar provides between 6% and 8% of electricity in the U.S. As heat waves become more frequent, high heat makes solar panels less efficient, and ensuing warmer nights do not allow a solar system's infrastructure to cool down, stressing it and reducing efficiency. Heat waves also increase the demand for cooling, which strains the grid and can affect the system's capacity to generate and transmit energy.\nSmoke from wildfires and added cloud cover during extreme weather events may decrease the amount of solar radiation reaching panels and reduce solar output. Hurricanes have been found to decrease solar photovoltaic generation by 18% to 60% compared with clear days. And tropical cyclones can decrease solar radiation by 80%, even for days after they hit. Any extreme weather can also damage solar energy infrastructure, especially wind hazards.\nWind\nWind power, which provides 10.2% of U.S. electricity, is especially affected by extreme weather events. For example, cyclones can alter the patterns and intensity of wind, leading to fluctuations in the generation of electricity.\nIntense wind events can force wind turbines to shut down altogether to prevent damage when wind speeds exceed a certain threshold, typically 55 mph. Even a category one hurricane has wind speeds of 74 to 95 mph. Hurricane Maria caused one wind farm in Puerto Rico to lose almost half its turbine blades.\nCold temperatures and icing deposit on turbines can reduce wind generation by 10%, according to one study. The 2021 winter storm Uri in Texas resulted in extensive blackouts as wind turbines froze and natural gas and coal providers went offline. Offshore wind towers and foundations can also be damaged by storm surges and sea ice. Overall, researchers have found that 40% of wind energy production could be lost in some regions due to climate change impacts.\nHydropower\nHydropower, which produces 5.7% of electricity in the U.S, and 44% of all global renewable energy (the largest renewable source) is susceptible to heat and drought. Higher temperatures result in shrinking glaciers and reduced snow melt in some areas, and increased evaporation and less precipitation reduce the amount of water in reservoirs and the generating capacity of hydropower.\n\"I think hydropower is very challenging in a climate-changed world,\" said Webb. \"We've seen that in California, which has traditionally been so heavily reliant on hydropower. There has been such variation due to drought reducing stores there.\"\nEarly snow melt also has a huge impact, she added. \"Previously, the snowpack would melt gradually and provide a source of water over an extended period of time. Now, with temperatures rising rapidly, we see earlier and faster snow melt that can just overwhelm the system so you can't get the most out of it. That means that you have these extended, long summer dry periods.\"\nFor instance, in 2021, Lake Oroville in California was at only 35% of capacity, forcing the Hyatt hydropower station, which supplied 60% of the county's power, to be shut down.\nIn Zambia, a shorter rainy season and droughts are presently affecting hydropower, which provides 80% of the country's electricity, resulting in blackouts and power rationing. Ecuador is currently imposing nighttime blackouts and a ban on remote working because the worst drought in decades is impacting the reservoirs that generate its hydropower.\nGlobal electrical energy storage relies almost entirely (99%) on pumped hydro storage, which is also dependent on the availability of water in reservoirs. It generates power by storing water in a reservoir at a higher elevation, then releasing it through turbines to generate electricity.\nChanges in precipitation, runoff and river flow can also affect hydropower, and extreme rain and floods can damage dam infrastructure. And while floods and storms may increase hydropower's resources, the gains are offset by droughts and heat waves.\nBiomass\nBiomass energy, which provides 1.1% of U.S. electricity, is produced through the combustion of wood, agricultural residue, plant and animal waste and other organic material. It can generate heat or electricity directly or be turned into biofuels.\nClimate change will affect temperatures, rainfall patterns and CO2 levels, and make droughts and wildfires more likely, all of which will affect biomass production by damaging crops and forests, altering growth rates, growing seasons, soil chemistry and microbes, and by increasing pests and crop diseases.\nExtreme weather can also physically damage crops as well as the biomass energy generating infrastructure. One study found that a global average temperature increase of 1\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C would result in the decrease of 14% to 35% of all remaining species, resulting in the extinction of many. This reduction in biodiversity will affect biomass's energy potential.\nThe energy system as a whole is vulnerable\nOur renewable energy resources, as well as the overall grid and energy infrastructure, need to be ready to deal with climate impacts\u2014but they aren't. Because much of the system is old and was largely built for temperatures and weather conditions that prevailed in the past, it is vulnerable to climate change impacts.\nHotter temperatures not only mean higher demand for electricity for cooling, which stresses the grid, they also cause power lines to sag and reduce their carrying capacity and efficiency. High temperatures also stress transformers and other equipment, decreasing their lifespan.\nHot nighttime temperatures prevent transmission lines from cooling down, adding to their stress. And extreme weather events such as storms and floods can jeopardize energy generation infrastructure and damage power lines.\nIn addition, climate change impacts will likely cause mismatches of supply and demand in many parts of the world, particularly where the energy system is more dependent on renewable energy, according to one study. For the smooth and consistent operation of energy systems, supply and demand sides need to match. When they don't, power outages and a cascade of consequences, such as delayed access to energy and higher prices, could result.\nSolutions for energy system resiliency\nThe solutions to the energy system challenges are known but have yet to be sufficiently implemented.\nDistributed and diversified energy\nDistributed energy systems\u2014where small-scale electricity generation and storage are located closer to users\u2014can help increase resilience and incorporate renewable energy. For example, microgrids could generate and distribute energy from a variety of renewable sources such as solar panels, wind turbines and energy storage systems.\nBecause they are less dependent on one power source, they are not as susceptible to single incidents of failure that might result from extreme weather. In addition, they can operate alone or be connected to other modular units or the larger grid, so they can draw on other power sources during an emergency.\nHaving a mix of energy resources is also key. \"Each energy-generating facility is impacted by climate change and each impact is different,\" said Webb. \"That means we can actually achieve quite a lot of reliability and resilience just by diversifying the energy mix.\"\nBalancing supply and demand\nSmart grids, often integrated into microgrids, use sensors, smart meters and real time monitoring and control to optimize electricity generation and transmission. They can help manage the supply and demand challenges of renewable energy sources and even out variability. They can also incorporate energy storage technology to quickly respond to imbalances between supply and demand in the system and help stabilize the grid.\nSmart grids also enable demand side management, a strategy to shift patterns of energy use according to supply and demand. When demand for electricity is high because of a heat wave, for example, demand side management may have agreements with high energy users to turn off some equipment or use incentives such as lower electricity rates to encourage consumers to use less energy. This can increase the resilience of the energy system by helping to balance supply and demand.\nMaking infrastructure more resilient\nThe entire energy system, including renewables, needs to be made more resilient to climate impacts. This entails strengthening and hardening all structures, conductors and poles. New technologies can make renewable energy resources more adaptable. For example, some wind turbines have variable speeds, and some are made taller to reduce vulnerability to wind variability. Wind speed detectors and sensors on the turbine, blades or tower could help the turbine predict wind conditions.\nSome nacelles\u2014the brains of the turbine\u2014have heaters to deal with the cold; some turbines are equipped with de-icing products in their rotors to prevent ice buildup and others can detect ice on their blades and shut down until it melts. Wind turbines are also being designed to withstand typhoons by adjusting the pitch or bend of their blades. And some solar cells are being developed that tolerate higher temperatures.\nBetter planning\nPlanners need to link their climate, advanced weather forecasting and energy system models to have a comprehensive understanding of the risks and resilience of the overall system. They also need to consider siting, carefully choosing where facilities are located to minimize risks from storm damage or other extreme events.\n\"Many utilities have yet to really plan for the impacts of climate change in a sort of comprehensive, system-wide way,\" said Webb. \"It's not just that they're ignoring climate risks to renewables, we see utilities ignoring climate risks across the board.\"\nWhile climate change poses risks to renewable energy facilities, fossil fuel systems are jeopardized by the same impacts, so the vulnerabilities of renewable energy should not be a reason to delay the transition to clean energy, which will reduce climate-related risks by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\"We see so much misinformation about renewable energy generation and the impacts it will have,\" said Webb. \"There is a risk that, as we have this growing recognition of the vulnerabilities of renewable energy systems to climate change, it just feeds into the narrative that we shouldn't be making the transition [to renewables].\"\n\"In fact, the opposite is true,\" she said. \"If we don't make the transition, we will have a much less reliable and resilient energy system.\"\n\nThis story is republished courtesy of Earth Institute, Columbia University http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu.\n\nExplore further\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\n Feedback to editors\n16 hours ago\n0\nNov 14, 2024\n0\nNov 13, 2024\n0\nNov 13, 2024\n0\nNov 12, 2024\n0\n15 hours ago\n16 hours ago\nNov 15, 2024\nNov 15, 2024\nNov 14, 2024\nNov 14, 2024\nNov 14, 2024\nNov 14, 2024\nNov 14, 2024\nNov 14, 2024\nRelated Stories\nJul 19, 2024\nAug 21, 2024\nMay 8, 2024\nSep 17, 2020\nJul 19, 2022\nJun 6, 2024\nRecommended for you\nNov 15, 2024\nNov 14, 2024\nNov 14, 2024\nNov 14, 2024\nNov 14, 2024\nNov 14, 2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUse this form if you have come across a typo, inaccuracy or would like to send an edit request for the content on this page.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor general inquiries, please use our  contact form.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor general feedback, use the public comments section below (please adhere to guidelines).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPlease select the most appropriate category to facilitate processing of your request\nThank you for taking time to provide your feedback to the editors.\nYour feedback is important to us.

    "document": "Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of March 2024 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $16.2 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 593 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $11.1 billion has been announced for transportation \u2013 to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports \u2013 and roughly $995 million has been announced for clean water and water infrastructure. Florida received $2.1 billion to connect everyone in the state to reliable high-speed internet and, as of today, more than 1,708,000 Florida households are already saving on their monthly internet bill due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida \u2013 including rural communities and historically underserved populations \u2013 the law makes critical investments that will improve the lives of Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $8.5 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $7.7 billion in highway formula funding and $158 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges to date. o $117.1 million through the RAISE program to date. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $207 million through the INFRA program to date. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet over 272,962 homes and small businesses in Florida do not have access to high-speed internet infrastructure. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to everyone in America. The Biden-Harris Administration worked with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. Now, the Biden-Harris Administration is calling on Congress to extend this program through 2024. Without action from Congress, millions of Americans will lose their internet connection and the economic opportunities that come with it. See ACP enrollment for every state and territory here. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received $2.1 billion for high-speed internet. Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program to provide access to high-speed internet to everyone in Florida. Florida also received $2.8 million in funding to expand middle-mile infrastructure in the state. In addition, about 1,708,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in water infrastructure in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $995 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $995 million available to date to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $229.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation and 19% of transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $1.3 billion to improve public transportation options across the state. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Announced funding to date will double the number of clean transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Schools in Florida have been awarded $45 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. Communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $113.7 million has been announced in Florida to date to build out a network of EV chargers in the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy about $150 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $392.4 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power. This includes: o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; o $162.8 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received approximately $1 billion for airports. Ports and Waterways: Our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received roughly $128.3 million for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $24.9 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $1.5 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience, including $51.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $123 million has been allocated to cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites. Approximately $25 million has been allocated to Florida for capping orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaiming abandoned mine lands.

Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.The Alaska summer temperature was 51.7\u00b0F, 1.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.For the January\u2013August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9\u00b0F, 3.0\u00b0F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January\u2013August period on record.\nThe Alaska January\u2013August temperature was 31.2\u00b0F, 2.4\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June\u2013August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.For summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.The January\u2013August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January\u2013August period.The January\u2013August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month\u2019s consolidation.\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October. Precipitation consolidation guidance has trended wetter across the northern tier of the CONUS, resulting in an expansion of elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the northern High Plains and Great Lakes relative to last month. Above-normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska.\u00a0\n\n\nImpacts and Outlooks for Your Region\nMap of the United States depicting the Seasonal Precipitation Outlook for October\u2013December 2024.\u00a0\nCreating These Quarterly Summaries\u00a0\nNOAA\u2019s Regional Climate Services lead the production of these quarterly summaries of climate impacts and outlooks for various regions of the United States as well as parts of Canada along the border.

    "document": "Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of July 2023 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $10.5 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 359 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $6.9 billion has been announced for transportation \u2013 to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports \u2013 and roughly $800 million has been announced for clean water. As of today, more than 1,389,000 households across the state are receiving affordable high-speed internet due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. To date, Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) to help provide access to high-speed internet across the state. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida \u2013 including rural communities and historically underserved populations \u2013 the law makes critical investments that will improve lives for Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, $5.4 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $5.1 billion in highway formula funding and $105.3 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges in 2022 and 2023. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 o $117.1 million through the RAISE program and $27 million through the INFRA program in 2022 and 2023. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet nearly 22% of Floridians do not have an internet subscription. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to every American. Additionally, experts estimate that as many as 3,283,000 households in Florida are eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which cuts internet bills by up to $30 per month, or $75 for households on Tribal lands, and provides a one-time $100 discount off a connected device. The Biden-Harris Administration is providing further cost savings by working with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. \u25cf Progress to date: To date, Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) to help provide access to high-speed internet across the state. In addition, about 1,389,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program, with more signing up every day. Households can check their eligibility, sign up, and find fully covered internet plans at GetInternet.gov. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, $800 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $800 million available in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $146.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 more likely to commute via public transportation and 20% transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has been allocated $529.4 million to improve public transportation options across the state in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This year alone, funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help double the number of clean public transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, schools in Florida have been awarded $11.8 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. In addition, communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $71.5 million in 2022 and 2023 to build out a network of EV chargers across the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy more than $70 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $168.5 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power in 2022 and 2023. This includes: Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; and o $31.5 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Additional grid funding will be made available in the coming months. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received approximately $658.6 million in 2022 and 2023 for airports. Ports and Waterways: Like airports, our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received roughly $143.6 million in 2022 and 2023 for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $43.2 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $1.4 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience in 2022 and 2023 including $32.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $120.4 million has been allocated to cleaning up brownfield sites in Florida.

Florida Project Spotlights Low- and No-Emission Project Spotlight City Of Tallahassee The Department of Transportation awarded $20.3 million to the City of Tallahassee's StarMetro system to buy battery-electric buses and support charging infrastructure. This funding will also develop a workforce training program for the city's mechanics and operators to maintain the fleet. The project will help reduce emissions and improve service and reliability for riders in and around Tallahassee. See here for a full list of FY23 Bus and Low- and No-Emission Grant projects. Middle Mile Project Spotlight WANRack-mm-FL2 The Department of Commerce awarded $2.8 million to WANRack to build 44.8 miles of open access middle mile infrastructure from north of Lakeland, FL going through Pasco and Zephyrhills/Dade City and then continuing north on Route 98 into Hernando County. The Middle Mile Grant Program plays a critical role in providing quality, affordable high-speed Internet and connecting unserved regions to the Internet backbone. See here for more information about Enabling Middle Mile Broadband Infrastructure Program award recipients. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 Brownfields Cleanup Project Spotlight South Florida Regional Planning Council The Environmental Protection Agency awarded the South Florida Regional Planning Council $1 million to accelerate cleanup efforts at contaminated sites in Central Miami. Until 1985, Central Miami was physically separated from the predominantly white area east of 12th Avenue by an 8-foot-high concrete wall, and was nearly destroyed by a fire after riots broke out in 1979. Priority sites in Central Miami include the 2-acre former Orkin Site, the 20-acre Poinciana Industrial Center assemblage property, and the 4.3-acre Northside Transit-Oriented Development property. See here for a full list of Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) recipients. PHMSA Project Spotlight City of Milton Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization Grant The Department of Transportation awarded $10 million to the City of Milton to replace 4.38 miles of cast iron natural gas lines and 7.91 miles of steel gas mains. The project will help improve public safety, protect public health, and reduce methane emissions from natural gas distribution pipes in underserved communities. See here for more information on Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) projects. Roads and Bridges Project Spotlight I-4 West Central Florida Truck Parking Facility The $15 million grant from the Department of Transportation will help build a new truck parking facility with about 120 spaces, electric charging stations, and pedestrian infrastructure to access nearby amenities. This corridor between Tampa and Orlando carries an average of 18,000 trucks daily, but currently lacks sufficient parking. The facility will be connected to Florida\u2019s Department of Transportation Truck Parking Availability System in order to help drivers identify available parking locations more quickly. By providing reliable parking capacity, the project improves safety for tired drivers and makes supply chain movement more efficient. See here for more information on awarded grants through the INFRA program. Superfund Cleanup Project Spotlight Southern Solvents, Inc. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 The Environmental Protection Agency has announced $5 million in funding for the cleanup at the Southern Solvents, Inc. site. The funds will be used to remove and treat tetrachloroethylene (also known as PCE or PERC) and trichloroethylene (TCE) contamination in the soil and groundwater. This funding will allow EPA to restore and protect a valuable drinking water resource in the Tampa, Florida area. The cleanup will restore the site and prevent the contaminants from migrating to other areas. See here for more information on EPA Superfund cleanup work. SMART Project Spotlight A MicroFreight Approach for Safer Streets The Department of Transportation has awarded over $1.9 million to the Miami-Dade County to introduce a platform of integrated data sensors, and digital infrastructures systems to enable and scale safe, zero-emission last-mile freight and goods deliveries in Miami-Dade County. See here for more information on the Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing Transportation (SMART) Grants Program. Reconnecting Communities Project Spotlight Uniting Neighborhoods and Infrastructure for Transportation Equity: Ashley Drive The City of Tampa will receive a $5.3 million Capital grant from the Department of Transportation to reconnect the Downtown Tampa area and its riverfront. The project will lower the current interchange ramp to street level, increasing mobility through new bicycle and pedestrian routes. The area will be safer and more accessible with new installation of new signals and improved active transportation facilities. See here for a full list of announced Reconnecting Communities Awards.",

Bastick, director (and Excel MVP) with SumProduct Pty Ltd, highlights some of the common issues and scenarios in financial modelling / Excel spreadsheeting.\u00a0 This time he looks at how to create formulae which consider historical, actual and forecast data simultaneously.\nMany accountants and analysts have to analyse trends using past and current performance in order to create informed forecasts for the future. \u00a0This requires three distinct datasets:\n\nHistorical information: data that has now been gathered that actually happened.\u00a0 This is often recorded in Management Information Systems, general ledgers, tax returns, etc.\u00a0 This data tends to have one thing in common: it\u2019s a matter of fact\nActual data: whilst historical information summarises past data that has been locked down, \u201cactuals\u201d may be slightly more fluid in that data may be available for the first nine months of the year (say) combined with three months\u2019 projections, based upon predicted orders, work schedules, hours of operation and so on\nForecast projections: these numbers are usually based upon calculations and correlations with the historical / actual data.\u00a0 The first two datasets may be distinct and independent, but typically, there is a relationship with at least one of the other types and forecast projections.\n\nYou may or may not agree with my above summation.\u00a0 That\u2019s not really the point here.\u00a0 They key takeaway here is that when we undertake financial modelling, we often have more than one situation that occurs over the time periods, e.g.\n\nThe problem with data set out like this is two-fold:\n\nLess experienced modellers will use three types of data entry for the three segments, which may be a combination of formulae and / or hard code.\u00a0 The concern is someone else will come along and copy one formula across the entire row which will not be appropriate for the other data categories\nMore experienced modellers acknowledge one consistent formula must be used across the row \u2013 but then try and do all calculations in the one cell and construct a formula that typically starts \\=IF(IF(\u2026 etc.\n\nNeither is optimal, but the second option is nearer the truth.\u00a0 The problem with \\=IF(IF(\u2026 is it intimidates end users who try to follow it, with a succession of nested calculations.\u00a0 Excel 2016\u2019s IFS function is even worse as people have to understand both the concept of nesting and the prevailing syntax. \u00a0Stepping out seems way simpler.\nI am going to take start with an example with three scenarios:\n\nHistorical: in my example, these will be inputs, but they could link to another file (say)\nActual: in my example, again, these will be inputs, but this could be a calculation based on actual data for the period to date and then extrapolated (say)\nForecast: in my example, this will be a formula.\n\nYou could have five situations, two linked, one hard coded and two formulaic \u2013 the idea would remain the same.\u00a0 The first thing is to collate all necessary inputs:\n\nMy plan here is to use the first row of data for historical periods, the second row for the actual period, and then use the growth rate on the previous period for forecasts.\u00a0 Clearly, only one value would be used in each year (column).\nNext, I created a selector for which year was the actual year:\n\nThe input cell (Actual, in yellow) drives the other two dates, as Historical would have to be all periods up to the year before and Forecast from the following year.\u00a0 With more situations, there would have to be more inputs, but the general idea would remain similar.\nI can now create a \u201cflag\u201d system (1 for on / yes, 0 for off / no) to denote which situation relates to which period:\n\nThe Historical flags (row 37 of the image above) are 1 for years 2015, 2016 and 2017 using the formula\n\\=(G$36<\\=$G25)*1\nin cell G37, for example.\u00a0 This checks that the years in question is less than the value in cell G25, which is 2017.\u00a0 Similarly, the Actual formula is\n\\=(G$36=$G26)*1\nand the Forecast formula is\n\\=(G$36>\\=$G27)*1\nwhich means all formulae are simple.\nA check has been put in row 41 to ensure there is a \u20181\u2019 (but only one \u20181\u2019) in each column (year) too:\n\\=(SUM(G37:G39)<>1)*1\nFinally, the Choice (row 43) uses the MATCH function (see >Are Things LOOKing Up for INDEX and MATCH?\u00a0for more information) to determine where the 1 in each column is, i.e. 1 if it is in the first row, 2 if it is in the second, etc.\n\\=MATCH(1,G$37:G$39,0)\nMATCH(lookup_value,lookup_array,[match_type]) returns the relative position of an item in an array that (approximately) matches a specified value.\u00a0 It is not case sensitive.\nThe third argument, match_type, does not have to be entered, but for most situations, I strongly recommend that it is specified.\u00a0 It allows one of three values:\n\nmatch_type 1 [default if omitted]: finds the largest value less than or equal to the lookup_value \u2013 but the lookup_array must be in strict ascending order, limiting flexibility;\nmatch_type 0: probably the most useful setting, MATCH will find the position of the first value that matches lookup_value exactly.\u00a0 The lookup_array can have data in any order and even allows duplicates; and\nmatch type -1: finds the smallest value greater than or equal to the lookup_value \u2013 but the lookup_array must be in strict descending order, again limiting flexibility.\n\nWhen using MATCH, if there is no (approximate) match, #N/A is returned (this may also occur if data is not correctly sorted depending upon match_type).\nFor example:\n\nIn the figure above, MATCH(\u201cd\u201d,F12:F22,0) gives a value of 6, being the relative position of the first \u2018d\u2019 in the range.\u00a0 Note that having match_type 0 here is important.\u00a0 The data contains duplicates and is not sorted alphanumerically.\u00a0 Consequently, match_types 1 and -1 would give the wrong answer: 7 and #N/A respectively.\nReturning to the 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s section (the latter displayed as dashes in the graphic), these values have also been used to drive conditional formatting in the original input section too, viz.\n\nTo create grey cells, I have simply highlighted the entire range and use conditional formatting (in the \u2018Styles\u2019 section of the \u2018Home\u2019 tab of the Ribbon, ALT + O + D) as follows:\n\nWe are pretty much done now.\u00a0 All that is needed is a formula for the output:\n\nThe formula\n\\=CHOOSE(G$43,G$13,G$14,F53*(1+G$15))\nin cell G53 uses the value in row 13 if the choice is 1 (historical selected), in row 14 if the choice is 2 (actual) and multiplies the previous period by 1 plus the growth rate in row 15 if the choice is 3 (forecast) using the CHOOSE function.\nThe CHOOSE function employs the following syntax to operate:\nCHOOSE(index_number, value1, [value2])\nAs a reminder, the CHOOSE function has the following arguments:\n\nindex_number: this is required and is used to specify which value argument is to be selected. \u00a0The index_number must be a number between 1 and 254, or a formula or reference to a cell containing a number between 1 and 254.\nif index_number is 1, CHOOSE returns value1; if it is 2, CHOOSE returns

In the North Sea, fish have been comprehensively monitored throughout this period and resulting data provide a unique record of changes in distribution and abundance in response to climate change2,3. We use these data to demonstrate the remarkable power of generalized additive models (GAMs), trained on data earlier in the time series, to reliably predict trends in distribution and abundance in later years. Then, challenging process-based models that predict substantial and ongoing poleward shifts of cold-water species4,5, we find that GAMs coupled with climate projections predict future distributions of demersal (bottom-dwelling) fish species over the next 50 years will be strongly constrained by availability of habitat of suitable depth. This will lead to pronounced changes in community structure, species interactions and commercial fisheries, unless individual acclimation or population-level evolutionary adaptations enable fish to tolerate warmer conditions or move to previously uninhabitable locations.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\n        Receive 12 print issues and online access\n      \n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nShifting fish distributions in warming sub-Arctic oceans\n                                        \n\n\nFuture trends of marine fish biomass distributions from the North Sea to the Barents Sea\n                                        \n\n\nMarine fish traits follow fast-slow continuum across oceans\n                                        \n\nReferences\nSherman, K. & Hempel, G.

Ocean heat waves are phenomena in which ocean temperatures increase rapidly over a period of several days to several years. The frequency of their occurrence has increased significantly over the past 100 years, and may have been a factor in the expansion of the red tide along the Pacific coast of Hokkaido in September 2021.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired. We\u2019re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,\u201d said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county\u2019s two hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It\u2019s going to be exhausting, stretching.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\u00a0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\u00a0\n\u201cThat person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,\u201d Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\u00a0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there\u2019s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it\u2019s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.\u201d\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\u00a0\n\u201cOur hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cWhen you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that\u2019s 500 to 1000 people that are out.\u201d\u00a0\nSome are out because they\u2019re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\u00a0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure \u2014 at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar\u2019s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn\u2019t been cleared to talk to the press, said she\u2019s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\u00a0\n\u201cI was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter\u2019s while doing everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juggling act.\u201d\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\u00a0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\u00a0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county\u2019s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are full with patients coming to us through the front door,\u201d Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital\u2019s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. \u201cNothing about COVID-19 is typical.\u201d\u00a0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\u00a0\n\u201cICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.\u201d\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County \u2014 the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, \u201chospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,\u201d Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\u00a0\nSince October, Modoc County \u2014 wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet \u2014 has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county\u2019s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko. Typically, that includes hospitals in Modesto as well as Vohra\u2019s congested Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have the ability to do an improvised ICU should we have to hold patients but this is clearly not the preferred option,\u201d Sergienko said.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people, and has already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties.\nEven small counties that do have their own ICUs need to transfer patients who require a higher level of care than they can provide. Colusa County, for instance, has three ICU beds \u2014 none of which were occupied as of Monday, according to county counsel Marcos Kropf. (State data reports that zero ICU beds are available in Colusa. The state did not respond to a request for clarification.)\nBut Colusa County has nevertheless needed to transfer patients to hospitals elsewhere, including Chico, Roseville and Marysville. And in Marysville, the only ICU serving nearly 176,000 people in Sutter and Yuba counties is full, according to a health advisory released Friday.\u00a0\nPhuong Luu, health officer for both Sutter and Yuba counties, wrote that the surge has led hospitalizations at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville to almost triple.\u00a0\nMonica Arrowsmith, a spokesperson for the hospital, would not say Friday whether the ICU was at capacity or whether the hospital had enough staff, but she said the hospital has access to additional supplies, expertise and support from the rest of the Adventist Health system.\u00a0\nLuu, however, said the ICU \u201cis full because of the surge in COVID-19 patients needing ICU level care. There are not enough ICU nurses to expand for more ICU beds,\u201d according to the health advisory. \u201cThe current COVID-19 situation is dire in Yuba-Sutter.\u201d\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has requested 815 medical staffers, including 435 specifically for ICUs, from contractors and most are expected within a week, with Imperial County a high priority. The state has also asked the federal government for help staffing ICUs.\u00a0\nImperial County\u2019s El Centro Regional Medical Center plans to open 21 beds in a 50-bed parking lot tent facility today with staffing from the state, according to hospital CEO Edward. He also said the state will allow the hospital to increase the number of patients each nurse can care for. He hopes the changes will help the hospital increase its staffed ICU beds to 32 from 20.\nExhausted healthcare workers\nThe onslaught of cases after nine months of a pandemic are pushing healthcare workers to the brink. The word repeated by each healthcare worker CalMatters interviewed was \u201cexhausted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cExhausted. Oh man. Exhausted and frustrated,\u201d said one Northern California emergency medicine physician, who asked that her name and hospital not be named because she had not been cleared to speak to the press. \u201cAnd a little scared about what\u2019s going to happen soon.\u201d\u00a0\nAlready, she said, she\u2019s finding it increasingly difficult to transfer patients needing specialty care.\u00a0\n\u201cI called every single hospital in Northern California out to Reno and all the Bay Area hospitals, and they all refused to take this patient,\u201d the doctor said, adding that she found a local doctor who could help. \u201cFor those non-COVID patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\nEven at hospitals that still have room in their ICUs, healthcare workers are feeling the emotional toll of the prolonged pandemic.\u00a0\n\u201cFor those non-covid patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be dependent on this post-Thanksgiving surge,\u201d said Nick Sawyer, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health. \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we will overwhelm the system and people will end up in a hospital that is overwhelmed, that doesn\u2019t have the staffing that is necessary to provide that best care.\u201d\u00a0\nSawyer said that he traveled to New York to help the overwhelmed hospitals during the early days of the pandemic, and was shaken by what he saw there.\u00a0\n\u201cFamilies have to say goodbye to their loved ones over Facetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to the family. It\u2019s devastating to the nurses. It\u2019s devastating to the physicians. It\u2019s just not a normal thing we\u2019re used to doing. And it\u2019s so impersonal, for something that\u2019s so personal.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore that experience, he said, it wouldn\u2019t even register when he heard an ambulance siren.\u00a0\n\u201cNow when I hear an ambulance go by, I feel this heaviness in the pit of my stomach of like, \u2018Is that another coronavirus patient that\u2019s going to be going into the hospital?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m emotionally exhausted by it, even though we\u2019re just getting going.\u201d\u00a0\nCalMatters COVID-19 coverage, translation and distribution is supported by generous grants from the Penner Family Foundation, Blue Shield of California Foundation, the California Wellness Foundation and the California Health Care Foundation.\nRead more from CalMatters\nText\nGet breaking news on your phone.\nDownload\nKeep up with the latest via our app.\nSubscribe\nReceive updates in your inbox.\nMaricela, Montrose\nFeatured CalMatters Member\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel BeckerWater Reporter \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel Becker is a journalist reporting on California\u2019s complex water challenges and water policy issues for CalMatters.

    "document": "L.A. County shatters COVID-19 record with 12,741 new cases in one day\nLos Angeles County shattered its daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 12,741 reported Thursday as hospitals continued to fill with patients, according to an independent Times tally.\nThe new total is more than 2,800 more coronavirus cases than L.A. County has seen in a single day \u2014 breaking the previous record set Sunday \u2014 and shows the coronavirus is still spreading rapidly through communities. The county also reported 74 new deaths, the fourth-highest single-day total of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe surge in cases likely represents the consequence of an explosion of virus transmission over the Thanksgiving holiday, officials said. \n\u201cI do think that we\u2019re starting to see some of the increases from Thanksgiving week, and the thousands of people that were either traveling or mingling with people outside their household for the holiday,\u201d L.A County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said earlier this week. \nWith the new numbers, L.A. County is now averaging nearly 9,500 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, and 52 COVID-19 deaths a day. Those are both records in this pandemic. Until Thursday, the highest average daily number of COVID-19 deaths in L.A. County over a weekly period was 50, a record set for the seven-day period that ended April 24.\nL.A. County is now recording double the number of daily coronavirus cases than it saw on Nov. 30, and quadruple its daily coronavirus cases since mid-November. Cumulatively, L.A. County has tallied 488,519 coronavirus cases and 8,151 COVID-19 deaths. \nCalifornia has averaged nearly 29,000 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, a new record. More Californians are also dying of COVID-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. The state has averaged about 150  deaths a day over the last week \u2014 breaking a record set in August.\nCalifornia on Thursday recorded 33,995 new coronavirus cases, marking the third highest tally for a single day, and 172 deaths.\nCumulatively, the state has logged more than 1.48 million coronavirus cases and more than 20,600 COVID-19 deaths. \nAt the same time, the availability of intensive care beds in Southern California and the Central Valley hit alarming new lows. \n\u201cLike a speeding car approaching a cliff, if we do not rapidly change course, we are in jeopardy of catastrophic consequences,\u201d Dr. Paul Simon, chief science officer for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said during a briefing Thursday. \nIn Southern California, ICU availability fell to 7.7% on Thursday, down from 9% the day before, the latest data show. The state defines the region as Imperial, Inyo, Los Angeles, Mono, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. \nThe situation was even more dire in the San Joaquin Valley region, which is reporting 1.9% ICU availability, down from 4.2%. Numbers have also worsened in the Greater Sacramento area, which reported in at 13.3%, down from 14.3%; and the San Francisco Bay Area, which was at 17.8%, down from 20.9%.\nRural Northern California remains in comparatively solid shape, at 30.3% ICU availability.\nStatewide, an all-time high of 11,497 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized as of Wednesday, the most recent day for which complete data are available. \nThat number increased by 485 in just one day and has swelled by 30% over the last week, state figures show. \nThe story is much the same when it comes to ICUs. The number of Californians requiring that level of care jumped 115 in just one day to a record 2,621 as of Wednesday.\nAs of Wednesday, L.A. County had 3,624 people in its hospitals with coronavirus infections, the 11th consecutive day that number has been a new high. The county\u2019s net number of COVID-19 hospitalizations increased overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday by 191 \u2014 the highest single-day jump in the pandemic.\nSan Bernardino and Orange counties are the only others that have more than 1,000 coronavirus-positive patients, according to state data. \n California \n Southern California is a main driver of state\u2019s record COVID-19 deaths, with no signs of a letup \nSouthern California and the Central Valley are by far the state\u2019s biggest contributors of total COVID-19 deaths in the last week.\nDec. 10, 2020\nHospitals can take steps to gird themselves against an influx of new patients \u2014 by canceling scheduled surgeries and outpatient visits; discharging patients as quickly as possible; and temporarily diverting ambulances with certain types of patients, for instance. \nBut ICU beds require high-tech equipment and specially trained healthcare professionals, which are in high demand throughout the state and nation.\nHealthcare systems can move trained staff around to help plug gaps where needed, but \u201cat a certain point, you run out of options, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re worried about,\u201d Simon said. \n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is what we saw back in the spring in New York City and in northern Italy where there were literally people in gurneys in hallways that were dying or near death, and that\u2019s beyond a tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that we can\u2019t let happen. We have to do everything possible to prevent that.\u201d\n World & Nation \n One-day U.S. death toll from COVID-19 tops 3,000, more than D-Day or 9/11 \nAs officials met to discuss approval of a coronavirus vaccine on Thursday, the number of cases and deaths grew ever more stunning.\nDec. 10, 2020\nThe way the state calculates regional ICU capacity is more complicated \u201cthan just looking at how many beds are full at any given point in time,\u201d said Ferrer.\nShe said Wednesday that the state had set a threshold that only 30% of ICU beds should be occupied by COVID-19 patients and that, should an area exceed that, \u201cthey make a downward adjustment \u2014 sort of, you get a penalty.\u201d\nThe California Department of Public Health elaborated in response to an inquiry from The Times Thursday: \u201cIf a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is reduced by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold. This is done to preserve the capacity of the ICU to also treat non-COVID-19 conditions.\u201d\n\u201cThe ICU is an important tool to save lives for those with COVID-19 and other critical medical conditions such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes,\u201d the department statement continued. \u201cIf a disproportionate number of ICU beds are being utilized to treat COVID-19 patients, then patients with non-COVID medical issues may not be receiving or be able to receive the level of care they need.\u201d\nAccording to data provided by Los Angeles County, 47% of the region\u2019s intensive care beds were filled with COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday. That\u2019s a significant cause for alarm, officials said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to need ICU beds for those many other conditions and so there is greater concern if, in addition to seeing a reduced overall capacity, we\u2019re seeing a greater proportion of these ICU beds taken up by COVID-19 patients,\u201d Simon said.\nHow California determines ICU availability is of keen interest, as that\u2019s the metric the state uses to determine whether to hand down additional restrictions on businesses and activities. \nThe state is implementing new stay-at-home orders in any region that sees its ICU capacity drop below 15%.\nThose orders \u2014 which reduce capacity at retail stores; close businesses including hair salons, nail salons, card rooms, museums, zoos and aquariums; and prohibit outdoor restaurant dining \u2014 are already in place in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley.\nThose restrictions will also go into effect in Greater Sacramento beginning Thursday night.\nOfficials have said they hope the additional restrictions will help stymie the latest coronavirus surge. \nGiven how widespread the virus is in communities up and down the state, experts say the best thing residents can do to keep themselves and their loved ones from being infected is to stay home as much as possible over the next few weeks.\n\u201cTo be blunt, we have one chance to turn this serious surge around, and that chance is right now,\u201d San Francisco health director Dr. Grant Colfax said this week. \u201cBut our window is narrowing and closing fast.\u201d\nWith grim case counts, officials have pointed to the relief a vaccine will soon bring as a way to encourage people to continue to maintain precautions.\nFerrer announced earlier this week that the county would likely get its first doses of the coronavirus vaccine as early as next week. During a Thursday  news conference, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said that as many as 500,000 doses may be distributed by the end of December.\n\u201cVaccines will be our most important tool in getting this crisis under control,\u201d he said. \u201cFDA authorization will mean that it\u2019s safe and that it\u2019s effective, and I urge all Angelenos to get vaccinated as soon as they qualify and those vaccines are available.\u201d\nHe urged residents, however, to continue to stay at home as much as possible, stating that \u201cthe worst is not yet behind us.\u201d\nTimes staff writers Maura Dolan, Ryan Menezes and Leila Miller contributed to this report. \nMore to Read \n \u2018A huge burden\u2019: L.A. hospitals strained by COVID surge, very bad flu season \nDec. 8, 2022\n Another bummer coronavirus summer for California?

Seven state hospitals were given \"D\" grades and one hospital earned an \"F\" rating. \nHospitals are ranked based on the number of infections, problems with surgeries, safety issues, staffing and measures aimed at preventing errors. \nThe \"F\" was given to South Shore Hospital in Chicago. \nThe hospital did not respond to NBC Chicago's requests, but was given low marks in some infection categories, hospital falls, error prevention strategies, and staffing and communication. \nSouth Shore CEO Leslie Rogers told the Chicago Tribune after stepping into a leadership role this summer, that the not-for-profit hospital was striving to have a \"C\" or better in the next ranking.\nLocal\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWoman shot and killed in northwest suburbs\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHere's what changes are coming to Social Security in 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMeanwhile, more than half a dozen other facilities got \"D\" grades on the list. \nThat includes Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Gateway Regional Medical Center in Granite City, Javon Bae Hospital in Rockford, Roseland Community Hospital in Chicago, Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center in Mattoon, Vista Medical Center East in Waukegan and Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago. \nWeiss Hospital told NBC Chicago in a statement that its low ranking was \"due to an increase in hospital acquired infections\" during earlier reporting periods. \n\"Since then, we have improved our processes and expect future scores, specifically Fall, to reflect those improvements,\" a spokesperson said. \"Patient safety is our highest priority, and our physicians and staff are fully committed to quality in our patient care activities.\" \nVista Health System said it \"improved during this rating period and continuously focuses on safety, quality, and our patients\u2019 experience\" but noted that data used in its grade \"is more than three years old in some cases and does not reflect the dedication and clinical performance of Vista\u2019s physicians, nurses, and staff.\"\n\"Several national and state agencies acknowledge Vista\u2019s commitment to quality and safety, including U.S. News and World Report, which recently recognized Vista as a high-performing hospital in stroke and COPD care for 2022-2023, and the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, which recognized Vista with a 'Get with The Guidelines Stroke Gold Plus' achievement award with Target: Type 2 Diabetes Honor Roll,\" the healthcare company said. \nAdvocate Aurora Health said it has a \"robust plan in place to drive continued improvement in both safety and health outcomes for our patients.\"\n\"We firmly believe that meaningful quality and safety data should be transparent to the public. However, accurately measuring this data can be challenging, and some organizations use limited methodologies that don\u2019t always reflect the quality of care or the varied factors that contribute to patient outcomes,\" the hospital system said in a statement.\nNBC Chicago reached out to a number of other hospitals listed in the ranking but did not receive a response. \nSome prominent Chicago-area hospitals were also among the \"C\" ratings on the list, including Northwestern Medicine's Lake Forest Hospital, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Science System, a number of OSF HealthCare facilities, Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago and more.  \nNorthwestern Medicine said its Lake Forest Hospital \"is committed to providing high quality, safe, patient-centered care.\" \n\"Our physicians, nurses and staff are driven by their dedication and passion for delivering outstanding care while always striving to do what is better for our patients,\" the hospital said in a statement. \"We believe that quality and safety data should be meaningful, informative and transparent to the public. We appreciate the ongoing efforts by\u00a0Leapfrog\u00a0to improve the usefulness and accessibility of information for consumers.\"\nOSF HealthCare said 10 of its 15 hospitals received a grade in the report, one of which was given an A and five others given B's. \nIn total, four were given a C rating. \n\u201cOSF supports transparency about quality and safety information such as that provided through the Leapfrog grades and is committed to finding ways to improve safety and quality of care. We are proud of the work our Mission Partners (employees) do every day and how they have faced the many challenges of the past two years,\" the healthcare company said in a statement. \nIllinois ranked 28th in the U.S., with 26.5% of hospitals getting an \"A\" grade in the bi-annual report.

The state is seeing a shortage of physicians to meet the demands of the growing population.\nWith a shortage in care, that leads to longer appointment wait times and other issues.\nKate Snedeker knows the importance of getting a checkup. She lost her dad to a rare brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, earlier this year.\n\"If he hadn't gone to get it checked on again when he did, he would have been a lot more negatively impacted than he was immediately after,\" Snedeker said.\nBut the University of Texas at Austin senior said getting in to see a doctor herself has been tough.\n\"I was put on a waitlist to see someone for mental health freshman year, and I think I'm still on it. And I'm going to be a senior,\" Snedeker said.\nIt's become a problem for patients across the Lone Star State. According to the Texas Medical Association (TMA), Texas has 204.6 physicians per 100,000 people. The national average is closer to 245.5 per 100,000.\n\"Over the past decade, the population of Texas has grown by about 12% or so. The physician population of Texas has about doubled that, or about 25% increase during that period of time,\" said Dr. Rodney Young, a former chair for TMA's Council on Medical Education.\nYoung said that is great progress and that those ratios used to be worse. The state has opened new medical schools and put itself on the map for up-and-coming doctors. Still, many only practice in urban areas.\n\"We have this vast area of Texas where you have all these rural counties with very limited access to care. So we do still have a lot of work before us,\" Young said.\nRelated Articles\n\nCompany provides virtual alternative for primary health care\nAscension Seton Hays is delivering a lot of babies\n\nEven in town, Snedeker said she is now starting to plan her appointments months in advance.\n\"I've learned that I need to, when I come home from school, I need to book it at the beginning of the summer or the beginning of winter break to make sure that I can be seen,\" Snedeker said.\nBut as new medical schools and residency programs expand, Snedeker and Young are hopeful for a more stable future for physicians and patients in Texas.\nFord Sanders on social media:\u202fFacebook\u202f|\u202fTwitter\u202f|\u202fInstagram\nKVUE on social media:\u202fFacebook\u202f|\u202fTwitter\u202f|\u202fInstagram\u202f|\u202fYouTube\nClose Ad\nBefore You Leave, Check This Out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAd Choices\n\n\nEEO Public File Report\n\nFCC Online Public Inspection File\nClosed Caption Procedures\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\n\u00a9 2024 KVUE-TV.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5888/pcd21.240171.\nPEER REVIEWED\nWhat is known on this topic?\nAlthough evidence-based policy can lead to better community health outcomes, public health researchers need support and resources to communicate their work to policymakers.\nWhat is added by this report?\nThis project describes the state-level adaptation of a federal model that links researchers with policymakers to accelerate the implementation of evidence-based public health policy.\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?\nThe Texas Research-to-Policy Collaboration Project determined emerging health priorities for the state legislative session and developed communication strategies and resources to link researchers with policymakers.\nAbstract\nPurpose and Objectives\nSignificant barriers to the implementation of evidence-based policy exist. Establishing an infrastructure and resources to support this process at the state level can accelerate the translation of research into practice. This study describes the adaptation and initial evaluation of the Texas Research-to-Policy Collaboration (TX RPC) Project, focusing on the adaptation process, legislative public health policy priorities, and baseline researcher policy knowledge and self-efficacy.\nIntervention Approach\nThe federal Research-to-Policy Collaboration (RPC) method was adapted to the Texas legislative process in 2020. Policymakers and public health researchers were recruited using direct outreach and referrals. Legislators or their aides were interviewed to determine health policy needs, which directed the development of legislator resources, webinars, and recruitment of additional public health researchers with specific expertise. Researchers were trained to facilitate communication with policymakers, and TX RPC Project staff facilitated legislator and researcher meetings to provide data and policy input.\nEvaluation Methods\nBaseline surveys were completed with legislators to assess the use of health researchers in policy. Surveys were also administered before training to researchers assessing self-efficacy, knowledge, and training needs. Qualitative data from the legislator interviews were analyzed using inductive and deductive approaches. Quantitative survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics for scales and individual survey items.\nResults\nLegislative offices (n = 21) identified health care access, mental health, and health disparities as key health issues. Legislators reported that health data were important but did not actively involve researchers in legislation. Researchers (n = 73) reported that policy informed their work but had low engagement with legislators. Researcher training surveys indicated lower policy self-efficacy and knowledge and the need for additional training.\nImplications for Public Health\nAdaptation of the RPC model for state-level health policy is feasible but necessitates logistical changes based on the unique legislative body. Researchers need training and resources to engage with policymakers.\nTop\nIntroduction\nAlthough it is well accepted that nonmedical drivers of health or social determinants of health, such as housing, food insecurity, and transportation, exert significant effects on population health (1\u20133), recent scholars have begun to look further upstream at political determinants of health (4). Political determinants of health can be defined as the forces that reinforce or influence environmental or system-level factors that either exacerbate or attenuate health equity (4). These determinants, which include voting, government, and policy, are the forces that shape the environmental or systemic factors influencing health equity, either exacerbating disparities or contributing to their mitigation (4). Recognizing the critical interplay between civic participation and health, Healthy People 2030 has set a national health objective to increase the proportion of voting-age citizens who participate in elections (5). This acknowledgment underscores the importance of engaging with political determinants of health as a means to advance evidence-based health policies, highlighting a focus for health professionals aiming to improve health outcomes by bridging the gap between research findings and policy implementation.\nBridging the gap from health research to policy implementation remains a serious challenge, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers and policymakers have historically operated in distinct spheres with minimal collaboration (6). This separation is compounded by factors such as differing political structures, cultural beliefs and values, and the inherent trade-offs between costs and benefits, which introduces uncertainty into the process of advancing health policies at the population level. Further, the decision-making processes of researchers and policymakers are notably different and may hamper the connection and collaboration between the 2 groups (6,7). Researchers tend to engage in discrete, planned projects, whereas policymakers navigate a shorter, unplanned flow of tasks, often responding to immediate needs and unforeseen events. The difference in approach results in researchers needing time to collect or compile data to provide evidence-based recommendations, whereas policymakers must often make quick decisions, which are not always grounded in the empirical data that researchers value. Instead, policymakers may resort to rapidly acquired information, which may lack credibility. Recognizing and addressing these operational differences can enhance the translation of research into practice. Such efforts could substantially improve the effectiveness of public health policies and influence political determinants of health (8).\nEven acknowledging the challenges and differences in operations between researchers and policymakers as a fundamental barrier, translation from research to policy is further complicated by additional and substantial barriers. Numerous studies have explored the mechanisms and challenges to better link research and policy (9\u201312). Caplan\u2019s \u201ctwo-communities\u201d theory (13) from 1979 suggests that differing priorities, languages, and reward structures cause the gap between research and policy. Other barriers in translating research to policy include few direct interactions between policymakers and researchers, a lack of trust between policymakers and researchers, the perception that research is untimely or irrelevant, divergent communication styles, conflicting priorities, and budgetary pressures (8,10\u201312). This body of research emphasizes the importance of personal engagement and trusting relationships between researchers and policymakers to transfer research to policy effectively (14). Further, it underscores that these relationships are both timely and sensitive to the constraints policymakers face (15).\nIn response to these persistent barriers, recent initiatives have aimed to provide practical guidance for researchers to more effectively bridge the gap between research and policy. Haynes et al conducted a qualitative analysis of Australian civil servants (16) that identified 3 key attributes of researchers that policymakers particularly value: competence, integrity, and benevolence. Similarly, Oliver and Cairney\u2019s (17) systematic review builds on this perspective by outlining a strategic framework for academic engagement in the policy process, emphasizing delivering high-quality research, fostering relationships with policymakers, and defining a clear stance as either a committed advocate or a neutral \u201chonest broker.\u201d Furthermore, there is growing consensus that a more sophisticated, bi-directional model enhances researchers\u2019 ability to communicate findings, adapt projects to meet policy-relevant research questions, and understand organizational advocacy guidelines, while also encouraging policymakers to proactively engage with researchers ahead of legislative windows and offer political insights for selecting achievable policy-informed research objectives. This reciprocal relationship hinges on the establishment of trusted partnerships wherein researchers serve as honest brokers \u2014 an objective resource for navigating the complexities of policymaking (18,19).\nLeveraging the insights from this body of research, the Research-to-Policy Collaboration (RPC) model was developed to facilitate personal researcher\u2013policymaker relationships at the federal level and support the generation of timely and relevant evidence materials. A pilot study (7,20) of the RPC model was conducted, focusing on criminal justice policy efforts at the federal level. The aim of the study was to determine the effects on legislative\u2013researcher connections and legislator and prevention scientist engagement, in addition to the cost-effectiveness of this approach. Ten Congressional offices participated in the pilot, which was conducted over 230 days. Results illustrated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this model for fostering personal connections between researchers and policymakers at the federal level. The study also highlighted that the most common legislative requests involved reviewing preventive intervention strategies (37%) and summarizing etiologic evidence (23%) (20).\nThe RPC model was developed to address systematic barriers and infrastructure needs that affect researchers\u2019 engagement with policymakers to accelerate the implementation of evidence-based policy by using a 7-step process (21,22). Evaluation of this model shows a greater use of research evidence in legislative offices using this process and increased policy engagement among participating researchers (15,20). The RPC model comprises both capacity-building and collaboration components. More detailed descriptions of the RPC process can be found elsewhere (21), but an overview of the process is described below.\nFor capacity-building, Step 1 is assessing legislators\u2019 policy goals and identifying policy champions on issues of interest. Once policy goals have been elucidated, researchers with relevant expertise are identified to form a resource network (Step 2). Step 3 involves matching policymakers with researchers who can provide relevant information or data to support legislative actions. Before engaging with legislators, researchers participate in training and ongoing technical assistance, providing context and skills to ensure effective communication between the legislator and the researchers (Step 4).\nTo build collaboration in policymaker\u2013research matches, Step 5 of the RPC process entails rapid-response meetings, where legislative offices and researchers are brought together to discuss policy goals and develop a plan for relevant resource development and interactions. In Step 6, meetings are followed by initial strategic planning, which outlines goals, action steps, and timelines. Finally, Step 7 focuses on maintaining responsiveness to legislative interests and needs, which could include further involvement in the legislative process, such as testimony, research synthesis, or consultation. The success of this process depends on providing the infrastructure needed by researchers, most of whom are in academic institutions, to develop their knowledge transfer skills and provide needed resources for supporting the network and ongoing implementation (21).\nTop\nPurpose and Objectives\nGiven the success of the RPC model in a federal context, a natural and useful extension of this work is to explore its applicability and potential impact on public health policy within state-level legislative processes. With its distinctive legislative session, Texas presents an ideal case for this exploration and offers a unique opportunity to assess the model\u2019s adaptability and effectiveness in a regional legislative environment. This article details the process of adapting a national framework of researcher\u2013policymaker collaboration to the state level and presents initial evaluation data on the awareness and application of evidence-based policy practices among Texas researchers and policymakers, as well as lessons learned.\nTop\nIntervention Approach\nThe RPC model, designed for application at the federal level (20), was adapted for use within the Texas legislative process for the 2021 Legislative Session as the Texas Research-to-Policy Collaboration (TX RPC) Project (Table 1). This adaptation of the federal RPC evaluation and project tools was informed by prior research conducted with Texas legislators (23) and with input from the developers of the federal RPC model. Recommendations from the members of the project\u2019s advisory committee, which included academic partners and health policy experts, and university governmental relations advisors, further informed the adaptation process. Key modifications were made to ensure the TX RPC Project aligned with the unique timelines and procedures of the Texas legislative cycle. An emphasis was placed on child health legislation and research, reflecting the state\u2019s specific needs, potential areas of bipartisan agreement (24), and the investigators\u2019 area of expertise. Beyond adapting the RPC model, the TX RPC Project expanded its outreach to include newsletters, webinars, and \u201clunch and learn\u201d sessions at the Capitol, complemented by a legislative bill tracker to monitor relevant policy developments.\nThe Texas legislature operates under a schedule mandated by the state constitution, convening every odd-numbered year (eg, 2021, 2023) for 140 days. This biennial session typically spans from the beginning of January through the end of May. Governance is provided by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, elected by the voters, and the Speaker of the House, elected by the House of Representatives. Texas uses a bicameral legislative system, with 150 House members and 31 Senators. House representatives serve 2-year terms, while Senators serve 4-year terms, with elections staggered so that approximately half the Senate is elected every 2 years. Despite the short session, the legislature typically has 7,000 or more bills filed.\nAdapting the RPC methodology to Texas maintained all 7 steps of the model but required logistical and procedural modifications (Table 1). For example, the first 4 steps, which included assessing legislators\u2019 goals, finding researchers with the appropriate expertise, matching legislators and researchers, and training researchers, were very similar to the federal RPC model. The short timeline of the Texas legislative session made it difficult to engage in many rapid-response meetings (Step 5) or to engage in significant strategic planning (Step 6), although we were able to maintain responsiveness to legislative needs (Step 7). Key format and procedural adaptations involved transitioning from federal to state-specific language and methods, which included updates in training protocols, use of shared sites for collaboration, and redesign of data request forms. Format and procedural adaptations included changes in language (federal to state) and methods (eg, training, shared sites, request forms). Modifying the RPC to fit the state legislature was complicated by the part-time availability of policymakers and their geographic dispersion across the state; thus, the RPC timeline was adjusted to accommodate a compressed, biennial legislative session. As a result, the evaluation design was altered to include a pre- and post-test survey and a different format for the researcher\u2013legislator meetings, which included committees rather than one-on-one relationships. The unforeseen challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for physical distancing also led to a pivot to virtual meetings, enabling continued collaboration between policymakers and the TX RPC Project researchers and team members.\nStudy population\nSince this study sought to understand the use of public health research in the Texas legislature, the sample was purposively recruited to represent legislators who lead policy efforts in child and public health. Elected officials in the Texas Senate and House of Representatives previously involved in public health policy, expressing an interest in the topic, appointed to relevant legislative committees such as health and human services, or members of select caucuses were invited to join the TX RPC Project in November 2019. Project staff sent a maximum of 4 recruitment emails to 68 legislative offices, with the goal of enrolling 20 legislative offices. Interested offices received a telephone call follow-up from study staff. A reception event at the state capitol was also held to inform these and other legislators about the study. Interested policymakers and their staff were scheduled for an in-person baseline survey and semi-structured policy identification needs-assessment interview. Baseline assessments were conducted in January, February, and May 2020 with 21 policymakers or their staff, who provided verbal consent to participate.\nExperts in health research from academic, nonacademic, and nonprofit settings in Texas were invited to join the TX RPC Project network of researchers in November 2019 based on their expertise and location in Texas. Project staff contacted 111 researchers by individual email but also recruited researchers through academic or state coalition listservs and an internal weekly newsletter. Up to 3 follow-up emails and phone calls were sent to interested researchers to enroll at least 50 researchers in the network. Researchers interested in participating completed the informed consent form, intake form, and baseline survey online using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) software (25). Training to build capacity for engaging with legislators was offered in person and online to participating researchers, with a goal of training 20 to 30 researchers.\nThe Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas School of Public Health Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (no. HSC-SPH-19\u20130539) reviewed the study and determined it to be exempt for both researchers and legislators.\nCollaborative partnerships\nResearchers in the TX RPC Project Network were matched with participating legislative offices to meet to develop ongoing relationships and provide public health data and resources in preparation for the 2021 Texas Legislative Session. Researchers were matched to legislators based on 1) alignment with legislators\u2019 district location, 2) expertise in reported public health policy priorities of the legislator, 3) availability to commit to a partnership, and 4) high level of engagement in the TX RPC Project Network. The project goal was to support 10 researcher\u2013policymaker partnerships. Forty-five researchers were matched with 21 legislative offices to form collaborative partnerships. Additional researchers who were interested in the project but did not have the time for a legislator match were designated as \u201cresource\u201d members. These researchers served in an ad hoc role, providing expertise when needed for specific legislative requests or other activities (eg, webinars).\nTop\nEvaluation Methods\nMeasures\nThe baseline survey for legislators or their aides was drawn from previous work that established the structural validity of scales used in this study (26). These surveys were conducted in person and assessed 1) use of research evidence (5 items); 2) perceived value of research evidence for policy work (6 items); 3) past and current interactions with researchers (8 items); 4) information sources (19 items); and 5) research training of office staff (4 items). For closed-ended questions, policymakers or their staff indicated agreement using a 5-point Likert scale (1\u2009=\u2009not at all to 5\u2009=\u2009all the time, or 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Scales were developed for each construct by summing responses to the individual items.\nThe semi-structured policy identification needs assessment interview included semi-structured, open-ended questions to ask legislators or their designated staff about 1) policy priorities related to health, well-being, or wellness promotion, 2) strategies to strengthen the impact of policies, and 3) engaging researchers to support health policy efforts. Data from these interviews were used to help our research team prioritize health policy topics for briefs, webinars, and legislative bill tracking, as well as give us insight into each individual legislator\u2019s need for information so that we could match legislators with researchers who had expertise in each health policy area.\nThe online researcher intake form to determine study eligibility collected self-reported demographic information (ie, contact information and organization affiliation), areas of research expertise, prior policy experiences, available time commitment, and preferences for online versus in-person training.\nThe researchers\u2019 baseline survey was drawn from previous work that piloted these measures in the RPC pilot in Congress (7). The TX RPC Project surveys were conducted in an online format and assessed 1) prior policy experiences (1 item); 2) recent policy engagement (14 items); 3) policy-informed research activities (4 items); 4) perceived self-efficacy for engaging with public officials (10 items); 5) reported policy knowledge (7 items); and 6) training needs (9 items). For these closed-ended questions, response options varied; for questions asking about recent policy engagement, researchers responded on a 4-point categorical scale (1 = none to 4 = \u22657 times); for questions about policy-informed research activities, reported policy knowledge, and training needs, researchers responded on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree); and for questions regarding perceived self-efficacy engaging with public officials, researchers responded on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = not at all true to 4 = exactly true). Scales were developed for all constructs except prior policy experience by summing responses to individual items.\nData analysis\nAll analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel 2007/2016 for Windows XP and Stata software version 16.0 (StataCorp LLC). Descriptive statistics (including frequencies and percentages) were calculated for each question in the baseline assessments and for demographic information. For each set of questions, means, standard deviations, and Cronbach \u03b1 were calculated for the scaled sum of items. Person mean imputation was performed for missing data, where at least 1 item in the scale was nonmissing, to minimize bias introduced by simple case deletion (27). For the researcher training evaluation, mean and standard deviation were calculated for each question and scale. Policy priorities were categorized by health topic at baseline. Semi-structured interview notes were entered into a database, and three research team members performed content analysis to identify relevant themes using standard inductive qualitative methods (28,29).\nTop\nResults\nLegislators (n = 21) included both senators and representatives, with a majority (57.1%) from the Texas House of Representatives; most were female (61.9%). Almost all (90.5%) legislators participated in re-election campaigns in November 2020. Eighty-three researchers enrolled in the TX RPC Project Network, and 59 completed the policy capacity training. Researchers were predominantly female (66.3%) and academics with a university affiliation (89.1%).\nInterviews were conducted with legislators and their staff, including legislative directors, chiefs of staff, legislative assistants and aides, policy analysts, an education specialist, and a district director. The most frequently mentioned health policy priority (Table 2) was health care access/Medicare/Medicaid, which 76.2% of legislators identified as a significant area of concern. Health policy topics mentioned by 40% or more of the respondents included mental health, health disparities, vaping/e-cigarettes, and maternal and child health. Other health policy priorities were Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)/food insecurity, school nutrition, immunizations, disabilities, and violence prevention (Table 2). Because most legislative interviews were conducted in early 2020, COVID-19\u2013related health policy was rarely mentioned.\nBaseline surveys were collected from 73 researchers and 21 legislators (Table 3). Most researchers indicated little prior engagement with policymakers, especially during the policy creation process. In general, researchers tended to agree that policy informed their work but also reported moderate levels of policy-related self-efficacy and policy knowledge. Most researchers reported that they needed more training regarding policy-related training needs (Table 3).\nLegislative offices generally reported a high use of research in policy development, and many strongly agreed that it was valuable to use research in their work. Despite these views, legislative offices reported few interactions with researchers, especially working with researchers to identify research direction or priorities (eg, informing researcher work). Legislative offices often obtained policy-related information from people involved with the policy or program, Texas data, and nonprofit organizations or foundations; however, fewer legislative offices reported obtaining information from researchers, conferences, or program-specific materials (Table 3).\nTop\nImplications for Public Health\nAdaptation of the RPC to a state-level government is feasible but must include changes in logistics that depend on the unique structures and practices of the state legislative body. Health policy priorities identified at the state level by legislative offices included mental health, vaping/e-cigarette use, health disparities, health care access, and food insecurity, all important public health issues. Baseline survey data showed that researchers do not frequently engage with legislative offices in a structured manner across the policy development spectrum and that researchers require training in these skills. Legislative officials realize the value of research, especially state-level data, but do not often engage with researchers. Thus, there is a need for a coordinating organization and process to develop and maintain trusted relationships between researchers and legislative offices.\nThe adaptation of the RPC process to Texas posed unique issues. For example, Texas is 1 of only 4 states with a legislature that meets on a biennial basis (30). This compressed schedule leads to policy development before the actual session and often before the election. Most Texas legislators tend to reside in the state capitol for the 140-day term and then return to their districts and a primary job. In terms of establishing partnerships between policymakers and researchers, this schedule leads to fewer opportunities to interact with policymakers, the necessity of interacting with policymakers in their home districts rather than in the Capitol, and limited time to develop new legislation. The short session also required proactive steps to develop a library of potential resource materials ahead of actual requests based on input from the project advisory committee.\nConducting this work during a pandemic also presented several challenges but additional opportunities. Originally, in-person meetings between researchers and legislators were proposed, which would have necessitated travel expenses for researchers across the state. Since the COVID-19 pandemic led to social distancing, many offices were not at the Capitol during the interim period (2020), and researcher\u2013legislative office meetings were pivoted to an online secure video forum using WebEx. Although the project was not able to arrange face-to-face meetings, the video format provided project cost savings and easier scheduling. The pandemic also resulted in several requests for COVID-19 and vaccine-related data and information, which became a major focus of the TX RPC Project.\nAs with other studies (15,20), our work indicated that researchers generally do not actively engage with policymakers and need additional training, especially in facilitating communication and building trusted relationships with legislators (6,9,31). The RPC project provided training, update meetings, communications, support from the research staff, and resources for both researchers and legislators. This support is necessary, as policy-related activities, which fall under knowledge translation or community-engaged research, often do not count toward the tenure and promotion metrics valued in traditional academic environments (9,21,32). Recent work has called for better inclusion of these activities as academic metrics, in addition to bibliographic output and funding, but universities have not widely adopted this practice (32,33).\nAlthough legislative offices reported using research in health policy development, few reported connecting directly with academics and researchers. Consistent with prior research, potential reasons for limited contact between legislative offices and researchers include inadequate translation of complex research into practical recommendations (34), infrequent interactions between policymakers and legislative offices, and differences in culture (10,11). Training is necessary to overcome some of these communication barriers (31). Building trusted relationships between researchers and legislators facilitates advancing evidence-based policy, providing further evidence for the TX RPC Project approach (12). A recent adaptation of the RPC model, the SciComm Optimizer for Policy Engagement (SCOPE), connected researchers and state legislators using email and was evaluated by using a randomized controlled trial. Results showed that legislators who received the intervention were more likely to use research evidence in their social media posts (35). The TX RPC Project model included more engagement and outreach than the SCOPE process, which might be necessary for a short legislative session like that in Texas. Thus, models for connecting researchers and state legislators can accelerate the knowledge transfer of research into public health action, but further evaluation methods should be used to determine effectiveness.\nThe TX RPC Project model sought to accelerate the adoption and reach of evidence-based public health policy (36) at the state level. The TX RPC Project was the first adaptation of the federal RPC process in which the model developers did not oversee its implementation. Thus, the TX RPC Project provides evidence of scalability and institutionalization of the RPC process in a different setting, suggesting that implementation science approaches can be applied to health policy work (36).\nAlthough the TX RPC Project has several strengths, including building on an existing evidence-based model, current governmental and legislative relationships, and evaluation of the process, there are several limitations. Twenty-one legislators participated in the project, so their views may not reflect the dominant views in the Texas legislature. Alternatively, these legislators might represent the subset interested in advancing public health policy. The participating legislators were identified for their interest in health policy but not for their views on other policy domains. Ideally, every legislator in the Texas legislature would be recruited, but given the short session and limited resources, we chose to prioritize those legislators who were most likely to file and advance health policy legislation. The Texas RPC newsletters were sent to all Texas legislators, and a request form was included that invited legislative offices to contact us for any information related to health policy. Additionally, many of the outcomes of this study are largely based on self-reported process-oriented data. Still, this study demonstrates the utility of the RPC model in a state environment and provides an in-depth evaluation of how Texas legislators view public health researchers as experts in developing effective health policy at the state level.\nThe TX RPC Project illustrates some of the benefits and challenges of linking researchers to policymakers using a model that has been successful at the federal level. With the past few years of federal Congressional gridlock, state legislators are a promising means of innovating health policy (37). Thus, further work at enhancing strategies that promote evidence-based health policy that addresses the political determinants of health (4) at the state level can lead to improved health outcomes that can, in turn, be used as exemplars for other states and the nation.\nTop\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors do not have any conflict of interest to report or relationships that might lead to bias or a conflict of interest.

More than 75 percent of respondents expected supply chain challenges to worsen or remain the same this year.\nWhat follows is a current overview of key market updates as we start the new year, and guidance for providers on how to mitigate risk and potential disruptions.\nUnrest in the Middle East\nFollowing COVID-19 pandemic-driven challenges and more recently the Russia/Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas conflict is adding to global supply chain unease.\nMost Premier suppliers are reporting proactive adjustments of their logistics strategies, rerouting shipments and increasing lead times to mitigate the impact of Red Sea disruptions. While some suppliers have already implemented changes to their shipping routes, others are closely monitoring the situation with contingency plans in place.\nThe conflict highlights the interconnected nature of global supply chains and how geopolitical unrest in one region can have ripple effects on logistics operations and supply chains around the world.\nWeather\u2019s Wrath on the Panama Canal\nCommercial ships are facing long queues and delays to travel through the Panama Canal. An extended dry season has reduced the water levels necessary to allow vessels to pass through the canal\u2019s locks \u2013 triggering a logjam of ships awaiting their turn and slowing shipments of healthcare and other products.\nThe Panama Canal is responsible for moving 80 percent of global trade, and Canal authorities have placed restrictions on daily vessel transits that are expected to remain for at least several months. Additionally, some ships are being forced to carry up to 40 percent less cargo to avoid hitting the bottom in low-water levels.\nBeginning Jan. 16, the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) will increase the number of daily transits from 22 to 24 \u2013 compared to the typical 36-40 daily transits. Due to better-than-expected November rainfall and water-saving measures, PCA canceled its previous plans to reduce daily transits to only 18 vessel transits per day by Feb. 1.\nGeopolitical Tensions and Global Dependencies\nGlobal trade flows are shifting as importers increasingly look away from China, the world\u2019s largest goods supplier. In 2023, Mexico surpassed China as the U.S.\u2019s largest trading partner.\nDespite this shift, China continues to play an integral role in manufacturing medical devices, pharmaceutical ingredients and other technological components. Meanwhile, Taiwan is a crucial player in semiconductor production, dominating the global chip industry with 65 percent ownership and producing 90 percent of the world\u2019s most advanced chips.\nIn Aug. 2023, the Biden administration issued an executive order with the goal of preventing investments that might inadvertently benefit China\u2019s military and surveillance capabilities. The order bans U.S. investments in Chinese entities focused on advanced semiconductors, artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computers \u2013 areas integral to various industries, including healthcare.\nWith China and Taiwan crucial to healthcare operations, escalated tensions could create high risk for the healthcare industry \u2013 given the region\u2019s overconcentration of supply for critical goods and raw materials, potential trade and transportation challenges, cost implications and cybersecurity concerns.\nPremier developed a special report exclusively for our members with in-depth background on the geopolitical landscape and dynamics between China and Taiwan \u2013 to provide valuable insights to help navigate the complexities of operating in a global supply chain environment.\nWhat We Can Do\nPremier continues to monitor the global supply chain landscape and pursue proactive preparedness efforts, including ongoing supplier communications on contingency planning and continuous updates for our members.\nProviders should consider rethinking inventory management strategies as manufacturer lead times have increased. Risk management and contingency plans, diversifying product categories, strong supplier relationships, and leveraging the power of Premier\u2019s group purchasing organization can position providers for greater resiliency during this period of uncertainty. In addition, and alongside the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), hospitals should maintain appropriate conservation and stockpiling strategies to help keep supply levels maintained.\nPremier is continuously assessing product categories that are in unhealthy markets \u2013 when a category has two or fewer manufacturers representing 80+ percent of market share \u2013 are critical to patient care and can experience potential disruptions due to global supply chain issues.\nAs such, our Disaster Preparedness and Response team maintains Premier\u2019s data-driven weekly product watch list (available exclusively for members) with actionable information to help mitigate or prevent clinical disruption. Examples of current categories we\u2019re monitoring:\nA Key Solution: Greater Domestic Manufacturing and Supply Sources\nGeographic diversification in production and sourcing \u2013 including reshoring \u2013 continues to gain momentum.\nNinety-six percent of manufacturing CEOs are evaluating reshoring their operations, have decided to reshore or have already reshored \u2013 an increase from 78 percent in 2022. And three out of four U.S. healthcare supply chain leaders also say domestic manufacturing is an \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d component to their organizations\u2019 supply chain resiliency strategies, according to Premier\u2019s 2023 Resiliency survey.\nIncreasingly, U.S. hospitals and health systems are seeking out diverse and domestic suppliers that can reliably provide product without the worry of higher global shipping costs and potential delays that can impact patient care.\nPremier, together with our members, are investing in U.S.-based production. Through our initiatives:\nThe collaborations with Prestige Ameritech, DeRoyal Industries Inc, Honeywell, PRINCO LLC, VGYAAN Pharmaceuticals and Exela Pharma Sciences provide unique value unlocked by Premier and our group purchasing organization (GPO), enabling differentiated access to high-quality, domestically made supplies and a host of pharmaceuticals.\nIf your health system shares in the belief that we need increased domestic resiliency and are interested in participating in one or more of Premier\u2019s programs, please contact us.\nBuilding a proactive culture around mitigating disruptions and improving resiliency is critical to our future success.\nAmid an environment of ongoing uncertainty, Premier continues to arm our members with the information, support and solutions needed to both tackle cost imperatives and enable access to the vital products providers need to care for patients.\nAndy leads the acute and non-acute field and sales teams, Premier\u2019s sponsor programs, commercial operations, Nexera consulting and co-management functions, as well as the stockd\u00ae e-Commerce and alternate site business.\nBruce leads the company\u2019s core supply chain business, including sourcing, contract management, operations and business analytics.

One in 7 reports (14%) were associated with drug shortages (decreases in sales of \u226533%); supply disruptions increased for drugs with and without reports at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and returned to prepandemic levels after May 2020.\nMeaning\u00a0\r\n    These findings suggest that ongoing policy work is needed to protect US drug supplies from future supply shocks.\nImportance\u00a0\r\n    Drug shortages are a chronic and worsening issue that compromises patient safety. Despite the destabilizing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pharmaceutical production, it remains unclear whether issues affecting the drug supply chain were more likely to result in meaningful shortages during the pandemic.\nObjective\u00a0\r\n    To estimate the proportion of supply chain issue reports associated with drug shortages overall and with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\u00a0\r\n    This longitudinal cross-sectional study used data from the IQVIA Multinational Integrated Data Analysis database, comprising more than 85% of drug purchases by US pharmacies from wholesalers and manufacturers, from 2017 to 2021. Data were analyzed from January to May 2023.\nExposure\u00a0\r\n    Presence of a supply chain issue report to the US Food and Drug Administration or the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP).\nMain Outcomes and Measures\u00a0\r\n    The main outcome was drug shortage, defined as at least 33% decrease in units purchased within 6 months of a supply chain issue report. Random-effects logistic regression models compared the marginal odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports. Interaction terms assessed heterogeneity prior to vs during the COVID-19 pandemic and by drug characteristics (formulation, age, essential medicine status, clinician- vs self-administered, sales volume, and number of manufacturers).\nResults\u00a0\r\n    A total of 571 drugs exposed to 731 supply chain issue reports were matched to 7296 comparison medications with no reports. After adjusting for drug characteristics, 13.7% (95% CI, 10.4%-17.8%) of supply chain issue reports were associated with subsequent drug shortages vs 4.1% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.8%) of comparators (marginal odds ratio [mOR], 3.7 [95% CI, 2.6-5.1]). Shortages increased among both drugs with and without reports in February to April 2020 (34.2% of drugs with supply chain issue reports and 9.5% of comparison drugs; mOR, 4.9 [95% CI, 2.1-11.6]), and then decreased after May 2020 (9.8% of drugs with reports and 3.6% of comparison drugs; mOR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.6-5.3]). Significant associations were identified by formulation (parenteral mOR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-3.2] vs oral mOR, 5.4 [95% CI, 3.3-8.8]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.008), WHO essential medicine status (essential mOR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.3-5.2] vs nonessential mOR, 4.6 [95% CI, 3.2-6.7]; P\u2009=\u2009.02), and for brand-name vs generic status (brand-name mOR, 8.1 [95% CI, 4.0-16.0] vs generic mOR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.7-3.6]; P\u2009=\u2009.002).\nConclusions and Relevance\u00a0\r\n    In this national cross-sectional study, supply chain issues associated with drug shortages increased at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing policy work is needed to protect US drug supplies from future shocks and to prioritize clinically valuable drugs at greatest shortage risk.\nDrug shortages have reached record highs.1 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a shortage as \u201ca period of time when the demand\u2026for the drug\u2026exceeds the supply.\u201d2 Shortages have been associated with missed or delayed dosages,3,4 medication errors,5,6 increased spending,7,8 and death.9 Shortages are caused by underreimbursement,10 quality concerns,11 and an overreliance on single-source production.12\nSince 2012, companies must report to the FDA known issues affecting the supply chain which could result in shortages (hereafter, supply chain issue reports).2 These reports are also tracked by the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP).13 Examples of supply chain issue reports include quality concerns (eg, microbial contamination) and unanticipated events that may impact production (eg, natural disasters).14 The FDA also publishes recalls and discontinuations. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with record numbers of supply chain issue reports.1,15 Despite these known risks, it is unknown how often supply chain issues were associated with subsequent shortages, ie, meaningful decreases in the national supply of a medication.\nAs the public health emergency ends, there is an imperative need for evidence regarding its impact on the drug supply chain to inform policies16-20 that protect patients from future, unanticipated shocks.21 The primary objective of our study was to quantify the proportion of all supply chain issue reports that were associated with drug shortages from 2017 to 2021. Our study adds to existing literature by comparing shortages during vs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and by drug characteristics. Our results provide evidence to inform policies to manage upstream events before they impact patients\u2019 access to life-saving treatments.\nWe conducted a population-based, longitudinal cross-sectional study of US prescription drug purchases from January 2017 to December 2021. Using public information from the FDA and ASHP, we identified medications with supply chain issue reports and matched them to drugs without reports. We selected supply chain characteristics based on a conceptual framework and compared the odds of shortages for each group. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved the study as not human participants research; therefore, the requirements for approval and informed consent were waived. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.\nDrug manufacturers are legally required to report known supply chain issues which could result in shortages (eg, inability to obtain raw ingredients) to the FDA; they report voluntarily to ASHP. However, supply chain reports may be incomplete indicators for meaningful decreases in national supplies (ie, shortages). As represented in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1, protective shields in supply chains,22,23 including opening more production lines, importing drugs from other countries, lengthening expiration dates,14,22 or using residual supplies,22 may address issues prior to the depletion of supplies held by manufacturers, wholesalers, and pharmacies. Therefore, not all reported issues necessarily result in drug shortages.\nGiven these complexities and the known limitations of reporting, the purpose of our study was to quantify the proportion of supply chain issue reports that were associated with subsequent population-level shortages, both prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Because there is no legal standard for meaningful decreases in supply, we defined shortages as decreases in purchased units of at least 33% within 6 months after the issuance of a new supply chain issue report. This threshold was chosen based on previous studies24 and is consistent with the FDA and ASHP\u2019s definitions of shortages, ie, significant decreases in national supply2 with the greatest potential to impact patient care.25 We accounted for non\u2013shortage-related supply chain factors by matching drugs exposed to reports to unexposed drugs without reports. We then compared subsequent odds of shortages (ie, \u226533% decreases in supply) for each group.\nOur study population comprised a longitudinal cross-section of drugs purchased in the US from 2017 to 2021 in IQVIA\u2019s Multinational Integrated Data Analysis (MIDAS) database. MIDAS comprises 85% of retail and 97% of nonretail purchases by pharmacies from wholesalers and manufacturers, based on unit volume.26 Data are reported in standardized units, defined as 1 pill, capsule, or vial or 5 mL oral liquid. We conducted our analyses on the drug formulation level. We excluded products with incomplete data, radiopharmaceuticals, unapproved products, allergens, antidotes, and over-the-counter products that are not fully captured in MIDAS. We also excluded topicals, since these may reflect different dosages that are difficult to compare with systemic formulations (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).\nOur exposed group comprised drugs with incident supply chain issue reports issued from January 2017 to September 2021 (3 months prior to data end). For each report, we defined the index date as the initial posting date by the FDA or ASHP. This included issues reported as being likely to result in shortages,2,13,27,28 FDA recalls,29 and discontinuations. Reports for the same drug-form were considered the same episode if they occurred within 90 days (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding recalls and discontinuations which may be indefinite.30\nWe performed exposure density sampling (EDS) to match each drug with a supply chain issue report (ie, exposed) with up to 10 comparison drugs with no reports at the time of exposure (ie, nonexposed).31,32 EDS is akin to sampling techniques for nested case-control studies,32-34 with the exception that matching is performed at the time of an exposure instead of the time of an outcome. This approach mitigated bias due to seasonality. When appropriately combined with multivariable adjustment for confounders, EDS leads to unbiased results.32 We did not match on baseline purchasing trends, since many reports were precipitated by abnormal demand increases.35 Drugs could appear more than once in either group. Drugs with reports could serve as at-risk comparators during any month without an active supply issue report.33\nMotivated by FDA\u2019s definition2 and based on previous studies,24 we defined meaningful shortages as at least 33% decreases in purchased units within 6 months after an incident supply chain issue report, compared with 3 months prior (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1). This decrease is greater than what would be expected based on seasonal trends. We conducted secondary analyses of severe shortages, defined as decreases of at least 66%, as in previous literature.24\nWe used random-effects logistic regression models followed by marginal estimation to compare the odds of shortages for drugs with vs without supply chain issue reports. We included a random intercept for each matched set to account for potential dependency induced by matching. Our main estimates were the mean marginal odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports.34,35 We estimated absolute incidence by comparing the estimated probabilities of shortages in each group. A type 1 error rate of .05 was assumed, all hypothesis tests were 2-sided, and no adjustments were made for multiplicity. Analyses were conducted from January to May 2023 in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute), Stata version 16.1 (StataCorp), and RStudio version 4.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing).\nTo determine the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with US drug supply shortages, we included interaction terms to assess differential changes in the odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports before the pandemic (January 2017 to January 2020), in the first few months after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 an emergency and when stockpiling occurred36 (February 2020 to April 2020), and in the first pandemic year (May 2020 to September 2021). We grouped issues based on their issuance date.\nTo assess the associations of supply chain characteristics with shortage incidence, we included interaction terms by formulation. We then used marginal estimation to compare odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports, within each form, eg, parenteral drugs with reports vs parenteral comparators. Additional interaction terms were added for other characteristics, including years since market entry and generic availability from the FDA National Drug Code Directory (August 2022),37 WHO essential medicine status (June 2022),38 and clinician- vs self-administration, defined using J-codes.39 We proxied supply chain redundancy using the number of manufacturers in MIDAS in the 6 months prior to a supply chain issue report. To capture market size, we adjusted for total sales in MIDAS during the same period (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of methodological assumptions. Because some shortages take longer to develop (eg, due to residual supply), we redefined shortages as decreases in supply within 9 months after report issuance. We assessed 5 (vs 10) matched comparisons, FDA and ASHP reports separately, and excluded recalls and discontinuations.30 Finally, we used nearest-neighbor propensity score methods to match drugs on month, formulation, class, clinician- vs self-administration, WHO essential-medicine status, at least 20 years since market or generic availability, at least 5 manufacturers, and at least $5 million in sales.\nPrior to inclusion criteria, there were 4142 drugs. As shown in Figure 1, 2276 drugs met exclusion criteria, resulting in a final sample of 1866 drugs. Among these, 571 drugs (31%) had 731 incident supply chain issue reports. These were EDS-matched to 1597 unique drugs without concurrent exposures; 717 reports were matched to 10 comparators and 14 reports had 9 comparators, for a total sample size of 7296 comparators.\nPer the Table, generic drugs were overrepresented in supply chain issue reports (616 reports [84%] vs 4397 comparison drugs [60%]), as were products at least 20 years old (375 reports [51%] vs 2434 comparison drugs [33%]), drugs with at least 5 manufacturers (378 reports [52%] vs 2225 comparison drugs [30%]), WHO essential medicines (316 reports [43%] vs 2199 comparison drugs [30%]), and drugs with less than $5 million baseline sales (234 reports [32%] vs 2158 comparison drugs [30%]). Manufacturers did not provide a reason for 264 reports (36%); the percentage of reports with unknown or unspecified reasons increased to 42% from February to April 2020 and 47% after May 2020 (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Across the entire study period, more than half of reports were recalls or discontinuations (498 reports [68%]), mostly due to quality concerns (Table; eTable 4 in Supplement 1).\nWe observed 15 to 71 incident supply chain issue reports per quarter from 2017 to 2021 (Figure 2). Across the study period, the mean change in drug purchases was \u22125.1% (95% CI, \u22128.2% to \u22122.1%) in the first quarter and \u22127.0% (95% CI, \u221214.7 to 0.01%) in the second quarter after report-issuance (Table). Among all reports, 113 reports (16%) were associated with shortages (\u226533% decrease) within 6 months vs 491 of 7290 unexposed comparison drugs (7%) (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). We observed an increase in comparison drugs with shortages in the first quarter of 2020 (Figure 2). Severe shortages (\u226566% decrease) were less common, with 63 reports (9%) and 188 comparison drugs (3%) associated with severe shortages (eTable 5, eFigure 4, and eFigure 5 in Supplement 1). Nonrecall and nondiscontinuation reports were more likely to be associated with meaningful (83 reports [23%]) and severe (43 reports [12%]) shortages, compared with recalls (meaningful: 13 reports [10%]; severe: 4 reports [3%]) and discontinuations (meaningful: 48 reports [13%]; severe: 33 reports [9%]) (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1).\nMarginal odds ratios (mORs) and estimated probabilities from our logistic regression analysis are shown in Figure 3, with full regression output in eTable 6 in Supplement 1. Across baseline drug characteristics, the marginal estimated percentage of supply chain issue reports associated with shortages was 13.7% (95% CI, 10.4%-17.8%) of reports vs 4.1% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.8%) of comparators (Figure 3). Compared with drugs without reports, drugs with reports had greater marginal odds of shortages (mOR, 3.7 [95% CI, 2.9-5.1]). Results were similar for severe shortages (mOR, 6.3 [95% CI, 3.7-10.9]), although adjusted incidences were lower (6.0% [95% CI, 3.8%-9.2%] for supply chain issue reports and 1.0% [95% CI, 0.7%-1.4%] for comparison drugs) (eFigure 6 in Supplement 1).\nAs shown in Figure 3, the adjusted incidence of shortages for supply chain reports issued in the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to be associated with subsequent shortages than reports issued during the prepandemic period (34.2% [95% CI, 18.6%-54.1%] vs 13.7% [95% CI, 10.0%-18.5%]). However, we also observed increases in the adjusted proportion of comparison drugs without reports with shortages at or above our 33% cutoff compared with the prepandemic period (9.5% [95% CI, 7.2%-12.5%] vs 4.0% [95% CI, 3.3%-4.7%]). There were no significant interactions by COVID-19 pandemic period. The 95% CIs of the mORs comparing drugs with vs without reports issued from February to April 2020 overlapped with the prepandemic period (prepandemic mOR, 3.9 [95% CI, 2.6-5.6] vs February to April 2020 mOR, 4.9 [95% CI, 2.1-11.6]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.60). The mOR for drugs with vs without reports issued during or after May 2020 also did not significantly differ from the prepandemic period (mOR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.6-5.3]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.38) (Figure 3). The association between report status and severe shortages did not significantly differ during the prepandemic period (mOR, 6.8 [95% CI, 3.6-12.4]) vs during the early stage of the pandemic (February to April 2020: mOR, 5.9 [95% CI, 1.3-26.3]) or after May 2020 (mOR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.4-11.8]) (eFigure 6 in Supplement 1).\nFigure 4 summarizes our assessment of heterogeneity by drug characteristics. Across other characteristics, we observed a significant interaction for parenteral drugs with vs without reports, compared with oral drugs (parenteral mOR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-3.2] vs oral mOR, 5.4 [95% CI, 3.3-8.8]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.008). There were also significant interactions by WHO essential medicine status (essential mOR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.3-5.2] vs nonessential mOR, 4.6 [95% CI, 3.2-6.7]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.02), and for brand-name vs generic drugs (brand-name mOR, 8.1 [95% CI, 4.0-16.0] vs generic mOR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.7-3.6]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.002). We observed similar heterogeneity for severe shortages  (eFigure 7 in Supplement 1).\nAs shown in eFigure 8 and eTables 7 to 11 in Supplement 1, sensitivity analyses were consistent with our main findings. Excluding recalls and discontinuations resulted in a slightly higher adjusted incidence of shortages (16.7% [95% CI, 12.9%-21.4%]); however, the marginal odds of shortage were similar (mOR, 3.9 [95% CI, 2.8-5.4]).\nIn this national cross-sectional study, approximately 1 in 7 supply chain issue reports (14%) were associated with drug shortages within 6 months, and 1 in 15 supply chain issue reports (6%) were associated with severe shortages. The incidence of shortages increased to 1 in 3 reports (34%) from February to April 2020 and then reduced to prepandemic levels after May 2020. However, we also observed increases in shortages in drugs with no supply chain issues during the early pandemic. WHO essential and parenteral medicines were less likely to be associated with shortages, and brand name drugs were more likely to be associated with shortages.\nOur findings are mostly consistent with a similar RAND study in MIDAS from 2016 to 2019.30 In that study, utilization decreased by a mean of 8.4% in the quarter after a supply chain issue report vs 5.1% in our study. Our smaller absolute estimate may be due to a lower incidence of shortages after May 2020. Nevertheless, our study is an important contribution to the literature because we included recalls and discontinuations, which were less likely to be associated with shortages. We also tested whether shortages changed after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn our study, drugs with and without reports from February to April 2020 were more likely to be associated with subsequent shortages, compared with prepandemic rates. These findings are consistent with the known destabilizing impact of COVID-19 on supply chains. We observed a return to prepandemic levels after May 2020. This finding may be explained by the implementation of new policies that empowered the FDA to take more direct action.16,40,41 Despite these improvements, ongoing vulnerabilities in drug supply chains are in need of policy action,17 including greater supply chain transparency19,21 and addressing root economic causes of shortages.42\nIt is also possible that issuance of an FDA or ASHP report, while consistently associated with higher odds of shortages, may have underestimated relevant upstream issues at pandemic start. Before the pandemic, 4% of drugs with no report were associated with shortages at or above our 33% decrease cutoff; this increased to 10% from February to April 2020. We also observed a greater proportion of supply chain issues with no or unspecified reasons during the pandemic vs the prepandemic period. Temporary pauses in quality assurance reviews during COVID-19 lockdowns may have been associated with underreporting. There are no penalties for failure to report.22 Our wide 95% CIs for February to April 2020 should be interpreted with caution, given the small sample size (57 reports) and potential underreporting.\nWhen examining variation across drugs, we observed a higher mOR for the association between having a report and subsequent shortage among branded medications. This finding is not unexpected, given that branded markets usually have 1 supplier. The higher mOR among branded medications may therefore be explained by the unavailability of alternative manufacturers to supply product. Shortages of branded drugs may also respond to different underlying reasons, such as increased demand, quotas, or manufacturer capacity.43,44 In contrast, approximately 4 in 5 supply chain issue reports in our study were for generic medications, and one-third were for drugs with prereport sales less than $5 million. Generic supply chain issues likely involve insufficient incentives for manufacturers to invest in resilient supply chains for products of limited profitability.11,41 In this context, recent policy proposals suggest the implementation of reimbursement models which would provide add-on payments for generics manufactured in more resilient supply chains.42,45 Our findings of differing shortage risk by supply chain characteristics could be used to develop lists of high-priority generic drugs for the application of these novel reimbursement models. Our findings may also be informative for the development of shortage-critical lists to prioritize medications for other drug shortage policies,22,46 like those in Canada and Europe.47,48 Similar frameworks have not yet been adopted in the US but would be useful in the prioritization of national drug shortage policy.49\nInterestingly, we observed a lower mOR for the association between having a report and subsequent shortage for parenteral vs oral drugs. Changes in demand for these products, eg, cancellation of elective surgeries, may have resulted in residual supply during the pandemic. A higher proportion of parenteral drugs without supply chain reports were also associated with meaningful decreases in supply at or above our 33% cutoff, eg, 7% of parenteral vs 3% of oral drugs, suggesting that it is also possible all parenteral products were more vulnerable to disruption, lessening the difference between exposed vs unexposed drugs.11,41 Generic sterile injectables have therefore been prioritized in several recent drug shortage policy proposals.42,45\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, the observed increase in drugs without supply chain issue reports that experienced shortages from February to April 2020 suggests potential for underreporting during the COVID-19 shutdown. Our mORs comparing drugs with vs without reports from February to April 2020 should be interpreted with caution. Our dataset was also time-limited (2017-2021). Many pandemic-related policies were not yet fully implemented, and we could not assess the association of the end of the public health emergency in May 2023.50 Second, although MIDAS is the most comprehensive dataset available, it does not fully capture over-the-counter and topical products, many of which have recently been experiencing shortages. Third, we do not know the downstream impact of the identified shortages on patients. Bedside efforts and availability of therapeutic alternatives may maintain standards of care, even when shortages occur.22 ASHP includes information on equivalents for some drugs; however, this information was lacking in FDA databases.\nThis cross-sectional study found that 1 in 7 supply chain issue reports were associated with drug shortages. Although the shortages increased early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a return to prepandemic levels after May 2020. As the public health emergency ends, continued policy effort is needed to mitigate shortages and to prepare pharmaceutical supply chains for future, unanticipated shocks.\nAccepted for Publication: January 29, 2024.\nPublished: April 5, 2024. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.4246\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2024 Callaway Kim K et al.

    "document": "Drug Shortages Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic\nChristina M. Bookwalter, PharmD, BCPSClinical PharmacistWomack Army Medical CenterFort Bragg, North Carolina\n\nUS Pharm. 2021;46(2):25-28.\nABSTRACT: The uncertainty of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused anticipatory purchasing of medications around the world, driving demand to an unprecedented high. Meanwhile, drug factories shut down in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the drug-supply chain was disrupted, and drug shortages resulted. In the face of these drug shortages, pharmacy personnel responded by initiating local policy changes, implementing detailed antibiotic stewardship, and enacting quantity limits for in-demand medications. Pharmacists are indispensable during a drug shortage because of their unique skills and ability to bridge shortage gaps with effective action plans that will not imperil patient safety.\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s a shortage of everything\u2019: Pharmacies in New York City struggle to keep key medications stocked amid coronavirus outbreak.\u201d1 \u201cCoronavirus pandemic is causing \u2018unacceptable\u2019 shortages in US drug supplies.\u201d2 These headlines and many others have overwhelmed news outlets, social media, and general conversation among the American public for months. When pharmacy personnel hear about drug shortages, panic, fear, and frustration begin to set in. Pharmacy\u2019s primary responsibility is to supply patients with life-saving medications. When drugs run out, pharmacy personnel may feel responsible for failing to supply the patient with a life-saving pharmaceutical. Accordingly, when pharmacy professionals encounter drug shortages, there is a call to action to be prepared. Pharmacies prepare by purchasing available product, looking for alternatives, implementing protocols to save stock, and finding creative solutions to conserve valuable resources. The uncertainty of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has highlighted the difficulties inherent in having a global drug-supply chain and has caused an increase in global demand for certain medications. It is imperative for pharmacists to understand the causes of drug shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, key medications affected at this time, and how to ensure patient safety during a shortage.\nCauses of Drug Shortages\nDrug shortages have been an ongoing problem for the medical community for decades; however, drug-shortage concerns have been exacerbated by this worldwide pandemic. Drug manufacturing follows standard business practices in order to make a profit. Excess stock in the warehouse is risky from a business standpoint. It costs money to store and maintain product in anticipation of sales and profit. Therefore, businesses may operate on a just-in-time model by manufacturing the product when it is needed in order to keep costs down and maintain efficiency. With no on-hand reserve, if anything alters supply or increases demand, a shortage can occur.3\nThe supply of goods to the market directly relates to the quantity of goods coming off the production lines over a given time. In order to produce a drug, raw materials must be acquired. The drug-manufacturing process is wholly dependent on the supplier of the raw materials. Often, there are multiple manufacturers for a drug, but there may be only one producer of the raw material. Therefore, any interruption in the supply of the raw material will affect all manufacturers of the drug.4 Currently, about 80% of the raw materials for drugs are imported from abroad, making the American drug supply highly dependent on other countries.4\nEven when adequate raw materials are available, there is a maximum capacity or a limited number of units that can be manufactured at a given time. Because the FDA approves a specific manufacturing line to produce a specific drug at a specific facility, a manufacturer cannot set up additional production of a drug in short supply elsewhere in the facility.4 Further limitations to production include the good manufacturing practices, chemical reactions, and in-process controls that must be in place to turn out a quality product.5\nThe spread of COVID-19 to the level of a global pandemic impacted the acquisition of raw material and caused manufacturing shutdowns around the world. China is a major source of active pharmaceutical ingredients, finished dosage forms, and raw materials.6 In response to COVID-19, roughly 37 pharmaceutical factories in China that manufactured active ingredients for U.S. drug products were shut down.7 Consequently, manufacturers in other parts of the world were forced to depend on current stock or find alternative supply sources. India, which imports roughly 70% of its raw materials from China and is the world\u2019s largest producer of generic drugs, began to experience delays in receiving ingredients and could not keep up with global demand under these conditions.7 In anticipation of drug shortages, the Indian government restricted the exportation of medications to other parts of the world in order to prevent a potential shortage in its own country.7 The limiting of drug exports from India amplified shortages in other areas of the world that depend on that supply.\nWith factory doors closed and COVID-19 a global threat, supplies start to run low. Not knowing when and where the next COVID-19 surge will occur, everyone is trying to be prepared. Pharmacies prepare by managing the inventory of critical drugs required for providers to adequately treat the virus. As soon as evidence surfaces to support a potential treatment, pharmacies begin procuring the drug, and global demand starts to increase. Some drugs that have been in high demand in association with COVID-19 include albuterol metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and sedation medications.\nDrugs in Demand for COVID-19 Treatment\nAlbuterol MDIs: Treatment of COVID-19 often involves the use of bronchodilators owing to the specific lung cells targeted by the virus. Given that nebulizers increase the generation of aerosolized virus in COVID-19 patients and potentially escalate the spread of the virus, MDI use is preferred. Inhaler shortages are occurring because of increased demand by hospitals for treatment of COVID-19.8 To combat potential shortages, hospitals can conserve supply by creating local policies that would allow patients to bring their inhaler supply from home to use during their inpatient stay.9 Another way to conserve supply is when an inpatient pharmacy dispenses an inhaler for hospital use, then gives it to the patient upon discharge, eliminating the need for the patient to obtain a new prescription from the outpatient pharmacy.9 The possibility of using one MDI for multiple patients has been discussed. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) currently recommends against a common MDI-canister protocol.9 Common canister protocol involves using the same MDI for multiple patients by disinfecting the MDI mouthpiece with an alcohol pad before inserting it into a patient-specific spacer with a one-way valve, administering the medication, and disinfecting the MDI mouthpiece after use.9 Studies have found rates of bacterial contamination on the disinfected mouthpiece of up to 5%.9 The ISMP states that using a common canister for patients on isolation or those who are immunocompromised may not be appropriate and that the methods in previous studies have been aimed at preventing bacterial contamination, which would not be applicable to COVID-19.9 Given the elevated demand for MDIs because of COVID-19, it is imperative that pharmacists consider their current inventory and plan to conserve supplies if needed.\nAzithromycin: Azithromycin has been used as adjunctive therapy to provide antibacterial coverage and potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of some viral respiratory tract infections.10 Many trials are testing the effect of azithromycin in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients.10 The increasing number of reports on azithromycin has led to an increased demand for the drug. On April 14, 2020, the FDA reported that there was currently a shortage of azithromycin owing to high demand.11 Although the intention to acquire supplies to keep on hand in case of a COVID-19 surge is laudable, it is important to remember that in 2018 the United States dispensed 38.5 million azithromycin prescriptions for conditions other than COVID-19.12 In order to reserve a supply of azithromycin, it is imperative that pharmacists practice good antibiotic stewardship and ensure that patients who receive azithromycin have an appropriate indication. In the U.S. alone, the CDC estimates that at least 30% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, commonly being written for viral respiratory infections when therapy is not indicated.13 Some other examples of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing include the use of non\u2013first-line antibiotics and the use of an antibiotic with excessively broad-spectrum activity for which a narrow-spectrum drug could be substituted.13 Pharmacists should review all azithromycin prescriptions to ensure that there is a proper indication and, when appropriate, recommend other proven therapy alternatives in order to help conserve the azithromycin supply.\nHydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are indicated for a very small population of patients with uncommon conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria. Therefore, typical purchasing quantities are minimal. However, COVID-19 research involving hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine has heightened the demand for these drugs. Many small trials began testing the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients because their mechanisms of action include targeting of lysosome, which can control graft-versus-host disease; inhibition of entry of the virus; prevention of virus cell fusion; anti-inflammatory effects; and reduction of cytokine storm.10 On March 20, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile to be used by licensed healthcare providers to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19.14 An analysis of outpatient retail pharmacy transaction data found that the prescribing of these drugs increased from 383,435 prescriptions in February 2020 to 759,186 prescriptions in March 2020.14 With demand doubling over 1 month, shortages followed, and the FDA published information on the shortages on March 31, 2020.15 In response, certain state boards of pharmacy established new rules to control use by requiring a diagnosis for the indicated disease to be written on the prescription, placing quantity limits for COVID-19 prescriptions, and restricting refills.16 On June 15, 2020, the FDA rescinded its EUA because the federal COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel issued recommendations against the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 and noted that, at the time, no medication could be recommended for COVID-19 preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis outside the clinical-trial setting.14 Following the release of this information, dispensing trends began to return to prepandemic levels, and the shortage resolved in late June 2020.14\nSedation Medications: COVID-19 can result in acute respiratory distress, and in extreme cases it requires the use of mechanical ventilation. Anticipation of an increase in mechanically ventilated patients and heightened demand for analgesics, sedatives, and paralytics created the perfect conditions for drug shortages. One way to save drug product is to minimize waste. Inpatient pharmacies should consider purchasing or compounding smaller drug volumes, when applicable, in order to minimize waste. Pharmacists should also review current hospital protocols and work with key stakeholders to make contingency plans for shortages of sedation medications. Traditionally, IV administration of opioids is preferred in mechanically ventilated patients; however, to conserve resources and keep opioid use to a minimum, hospitals can establish protocols for intermittent bolus analgesia, enteral administration of opioids, or implementation of adjuvant therapies.17 In ventilated patients, light sedation\u2014which helps conserve drug supply\u2014is preferred over deep sedation.17 Nonbenzodiazepine sedatives such as propofol and dexmedetomidine are preferred, but contingencies should be put in place to use other agents, such as ketamine, benzodiazepines, and pentobarbital.17 Awakening trials with reassessment of sedation needs should be performed daily. This practice may result in a reduction in sedation requirements while effectively conserving drug supply.17 In addition to analgesics and sedatives, some patients with COVID-19 will require paralytics. In order to conserve resources, hospital guidelines should be established for the use of continuous infusion versus intermittent bolus use of paralytic agents.17 In general, when a drug shortage arises, it is imperative that pharmacists familiarize themselves with all alternative products and assist in creating contingency plans.\nPatient Safety During a Drug Shortage\nA drug shortage commonly requires the substitution of an item that is ordered, prepared, or dispensed differently than the standard product. When prescribing practices switch to less-familiar alternative agents\u2014especially those that are less efficacious, have a worse adverse-effect profile, or require an unusual or difficult dosing regimen\u2014medication errors are more likely to occur.18 To minimize medication errors and maximize patient safety, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) guidelines on managing drug-product shortages recommend implementing a drug-product shortage team, creating a resource-allocation committee, and establishing a process for approving alternative therapies and addressing ethical considerations.18 The product-shortage team would have multiple responsibilities, including the purchasing of alternative agents, decisions on conserving or rationing supplies, implementation of technology updates, and communication of changes.18 The resource-allocation committee would create a framework for rationing drug resources in advance, thereby eliminating the need for bedside decisions during a shortage.18 The final ASHP recommendation is to have a process in place for approving alternative therapies and addressing ethical considerations. A multidisciplinary team would be responsible for establishing ethical procedures and protocols before they are needed in order to ensure that the rationing of life-saving drugs reflects the fundamental healthcare principles of justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence.18\nThe overarching recommendation for preventing medication errors and ensuring patient safety is to focus on communicating information about the drug shortage. Communication updates should include all pertinent information about the shortage, such as the drug affected and the substitution or rationing plan.18 If a new drug is being selected, educational references about prescribing differences should be distributed, and pharmacists should be prepared to answer questions about the new agent. When information is being disseminated, it is important to include all potential stakeholders across all shifts. With drug shortages on the rise during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that the pharmacy profession take a proactive leadership role in developing and implementing processes to address drug shortages and ensure patient safety.\nConclusion\nThe pharmacy profession has been dealing with drug shortages for years. However, no past experience could have adequately prepared pharmacists for the drug shortages and unprecedented high demand resulting from the extensive disruptions caused by COVID-19. The pandemic crippled the global drug-supply chain by leading to factory closings, limited access to raw materials, and altered import and export rates of final dosage forms. With an inadequate supply chain and high demand worldwide, prescription drug shortages became a common topic in the pharmacy realm. Fear of not having enough supplies to battle the virus motivated pharmacy personnel to change current practices by initiating local policy changes, focusing on antibiotic stewardship, and implementing quantity limits in order to conserve drug stock. Overall, the need to combat historic drug shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to innovation and critical thinking in an effort to conserve valuable supplies without sacrificing patient safety under less-than-ideal circumstances. Pharmacists are indispensable during a drug shortage because of their unique skills and ability to bridge shortage gaps with effective action plans that will not imperil patient safety.\nREFERENCES\n1.

In recent times, one of the greatest challenges stirring concern among professionals and patients alike has been the drug shortages of 2024. These shortages have broad-reaching implications, affecting everything from the supply chain management of pharmaceuticals to the availability of lifesaving, critical drugs for patients in need.\nDrug shortages can sound somewhat of a vague issue until we consider the direct and often critical impact on patient\u2019s lives. From vital chemotherapy drugs for cancer patients to essential medications for hyperactivity disorder, the landscape of drug availability has shifted dramatically in 2024, sparking widespread concern and calls for swift action.\nFor updated information on the drug shortage crisis, including the reason for the shortage, availability of products, and estimation of resupply, view the ASHP list or the FDA database.\n\nThe landscape of healthcare in the United States often feels as intricate and complicated as the human body itself.

After all, why would a country as powerful as the United States struggle with such a basic need? The answer, unfortunately, is not straightforward but is intertwined with a network of intricate factors involving not only the production and distribution of drugs but also economic, political, and regulatory elements.\nSupply Chain Vulnerabilities\nOne major element contributing to the drug shortage crisis is the vulnerabilities in the supply chain. Often, drugs and their raw materials are sourced and processed in different countries \u2013 a complex tapestry that can be easily disrupted by a range of factors, from natural disasters affecting raw material supplies to political instabilities and even global pandemics.\nThe contracting practices between drug wholesalers and manufacturers, which often prioritize high-value drugs over lower-cost generic ones\u2014those most at risk of shortage\u2014contribute to the problem. This bias for profitability over sustainability can leave the supply of lower-cost generic drugs, essential medicines for a large fraction of the U.S. population, teetering on the edge.\nMarket Forces\nMarket forces also play a critical role. Some drug manufacturers may opt to discontinue production of less profitable drugs, leading to shortages. In an industry driven by profit margins, these decisions can have a domino effect, causing shortages that ripple across the country.\nQuality Concerns for Generic Drugs\nFinally, there are quality issues to consider within drug production. This aspect focuses on challenges faced by generic manufacturers. Increasing amounts of generic drugs have been recalled due to quality concerns, fueling the shortage. Alarmingly, popular medications like Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate, a drug used to treat ADHD, have come under scrutiny, further exaggerating the crisis.\nIn this intricate web of causes, one thing is clear: the drug shortages of 2024 are a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to resolution. Understanding these causes is the first step toward finding sustainable solutions.\n\nAt first glance, the shortage of prescription drugs may be challenging to understand.

Understanding these causes is the first step toward finding sustainable solutions.\nImplications of the Drug Shortages\nAs we delve into the aftermath of drug shortages, we cannot overlook the strain they place on both healthcare providers and patients. The conditions that arise from shortage situations are far-reaching and directly impact the quality of care.\nAn active drug shortage implies that there are limitations on what is available for patient treatment. In some situations, alternatives exist, but they may not have the same efficacy as the initially intended medication. Also, alternative drugs may come with a higher risk of side effects, putting an additional strain on the patient\u2019s health.\nPublic comments and white papers have been increasingly filled with stories reflecting this crisis. Instances of parents unable to find ADHD medications for their children, or families of cancer patients scrambling to find equally effective alternatives for unavailable emergency medications like chemotherapy drugs, are becoming deeply unsettling realities of the crisis.\nThe response of the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Health and Human Services, and other federal agencies provides a sobering reflection of the severity of the situation. Given the complexity of these active shortages, federal bodies are grappling with formulating strategies to tackle the issue, with a focus on increasing generic drug production and bolstering the capacity of manufacturing chains.\nIn this light, the drug shortages of 2024 are not just numbers on spreadsheets and inventory lists. They represent a perilous reality for patients and healthcare providers across the United States. Exploring potential solutions, therefore, is not just a matter of balanced books\u2014it is a matter of life and health.\n\nAs we delve into the aftermath of drug shortages, we cannot overlook the strain they place on both healthcare providers and patients.

However, by taking systematic, strategic steps, it is possible to grapple with this issue effectively. Here are a few essential strategies being proposed to address and improve the drug shortage situation:\n1. Imposing Financial Penalties\nSome suggest leveraging financial penalties for delays in drug administration. This measure is believed to infuse a sense of responsibility and urgency within drug companies and discourage them from delay tactics that can exacerbate medical supplies shortage situations.\n2. Enhancing Supply Chain Resilience\nThe essence of this strategy lies in the diversification and reinforcement of the supply chain. This can be achieved through increased domestic manufacturing capabilities and a diversified global supply chain for key drug components. It is a tall order, requiring international cooperation, but it stands as a promising recourse for buffering against supply chain disruptions.\n3. Building a Robust Drug Shortage Database\nThe development of a comprehensive, up-to-date database on current and potential drug shortages is another crucial step towards mitigation. With access to real-time data, healthcare providers can anticipate supply issues, adjust inventories, and modify treatment plans, as necessary.\n4. Overhauling Contracting Practices\nThere is an emerging call to reassess contracting mechanisms within the pharmaceutical industry. Some contracts prioritize high-cost drugs over lower-cost generic ones\u2014a practice that needs to be revisited to ensure a stable supply of essential generic medications, most susceptible to shortages.\nIn summary, these proposed strategies represent a multi-pronged approach to tackling drug shortages\u2014a combination of regulatory measures, strategic overhauls, and technological solutions. By adopting such an approach, it opens the possibility of mitigating future drug shortages, ensuring that essential medications remain readily available to those who need them the most.\n\nNavigating through the complexities of drug supply shortages might seem daunting at first.

Even the \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008, which affected trade in many other products, did not cause a fall in exports or imports. With exports increasing more than imports, the trade surplus increased from C 18 billion in 2002 to a record high of C 174 billion in 2022 but fell to C 158 billion in 2023.\nFigure 1: EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Increasing share in total trade In 2023, the share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade was 7.8% with the share for imports (4.7%) much smaller than the share for exports (10.8%). Between 2002 and 2008 these shares remained fairly stable (Figure 2). In 2009, the share of imports increased by 1.3 percentage points (pp) and exports by 1.6 pp.\nThis was not caused by an increase in trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products but rather by the decline in total trade. Since 2009, the shares have been \ufb02uctuating but there is a clear overall growth.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 2 Figure 2: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade, 2002-2023 (% in total trade) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) United States and Switzerland remain the top EU partners The United States stands out as the EU\u2019s main trading partner for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023 (Figure 3). Exports to the United States (33 %) were almost a third of all EU exports and were followed at some distance by Switzerland (15 %) and China (8 %). Imports to the EU were dominated even more by the United States (39 %) and Switzerland (32 %) followed by the United Kingdom (7 %). Since the United States and Switzerland are by far the two largest trade partners, the development of their trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products with the EU is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 3 Figure 3: Main EU partners for trade of medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade with the United States and Switzerland between 2002 and 2023 Figure 4 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and the United States from 2002 to 2023. Between 2022 and 2023, imports from the United States increased by 19.3% while exports decreased by 1.5%. This caused the trade balance to fall from C 54 billion in 2022 to C 45 billion in 2023.\nMeasured as average annual growth between 2002 and 2023, exports increased by 8.8 % per year and imports increased by 7.2 % per year. During the whole period the EU has had a trade surplus with the United States, peaking at C 54 billion in 2022.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 4 Figure 4: EU trade with the United States in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Figure 5 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and Switzerland from 2002 to 2023. In 2023, for the \ufb01rst time in the period under investigation, exports (C 43 billion) were larger than imports (C 38 billion), causing the trade de\ufb01cit of C 1 billion in 2022 to turn into a surplus of C 4 billion in 2023. Over the whole period between 2002 and 2023, measured as average annual growth, exports increased by 10.0 % per year, while imports increased by 7.3 % per year.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 5 Figure 5: EU trade with Switzerland in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products by EU Member State The share of intra EU imports in total (intra + extra) imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products varied greatly between EU countries in 2023 (Figure 6). For Luxembourg, Lithua-nia and Estonia it was above 93 %, while for Slovenia and Malta it was below 40 %.

Four countries had shares higher than 20 % for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU exports. These were Slovenia (59 %), Ireland (33 %), Denmark (27 %) and Belgium (25 %).\nBelgium (C 26 billion), Germany (C 20 billion) and the Netherlands (C 16 billion) were the largest importers of medicinal and pharmaceutical products from countries outside the EU, in 20231. In 2023, Slovenia (18 %), Belgium (14 %) and Austria (13 %) had the highest shares for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU imports.\nGermany (C 43 billion) and Ireland (C 31 billion) had the largest extra-EU trade surpluses for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023. Only Romania, Slovakia, Malta, Estonia and Czechia had trade de\ufb01cits.\n1Dutch and Belgian imports can be overestimated due to the so-called \"Rotterdam effect\" (See sectionData sources for more details) International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 8 Table 1: Extra EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (C million and %) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Source data for tables and graphs \u2022 International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products: tables and \ufb01gures Data sources This article is based on data available in the Eurostat COMEXT database for EU EU countries and in the United Nations COMTRADE database for non-EU countries.\nA code (such as \u2019DS_018995\u2019) is inserted as part of the source. This code allows the reader to easily access the most recent EU data on the Eurostat website. Note that data on the website is frequently updated and may also be more detailed or have a different measurement unit. It should also be noted that European statistics on international trade in goods are compiled according to the EU concepts and de\ufb01nitions and may, therefore, differ from national data published by EU countries.\nProduct classi\ufb01cation Division 54 \u2019Medicinal and pharmaceutical products\u2019 of the Standard international trade classi\ufb01cation revision 4 (SITC Rev. 4), is made up of the sub-groups: \u2022 5411 \u2019Provitamins and vitamins (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5413 \u2019Antibiotics (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5414 \u2019Vegetable alkaloids (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5415 \u2019Hormones, prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes\u2019; \u2022 5416 \u2019Glycosides; glands or other organs; antisera, vaccines; International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 9 \u2022 5419 \u2019Pharmaceutical goods, other than medicaments\u2019; \u2022 5421 \u2019Medicaments containing antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5422 \u2019Medicaments containing hormones, etc., but not antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5423 \u2019Medicaments containing alkaloids, but not containing hormones etc. or antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5429 \u2019Medicaments not elsewhere speci\ufb01ed\u2019.\nUnit of measure Trade values are expressed in millions (106) or billions (109) of euros. They correspond to the statistical value, i.e.\nto the amount which would be invoiced in case of sale or purchase at the national border of the reporting country. It is called a FOB value (free on board) for exports and a CIF value (cost, insurance, freight) for imports.\nA bias in the geographical allocation of extra-EU \ufb02ows Extra-EU imports and exports are reported by the Member State where the customs declaration is lodged, usually the place where the goods cross the EU external frontier (here referred to as the exit/entry Member State). This is not necessarily the Member State of actual import or export. The geographical allocation of an extra-EU \ufb02ow is biased in the case where the entry/exit Member State is not the actual importing/exporting Member State. In such a case, the extra-EU trade will be allocated to the entry/exit Member State and the actual importing/exporting Member State will report only intra-EU \ufb02ows with the exit/entry Member State. This issue particularly impacts the extra-EU imports of EU countries having important ports for transshipment of goods like Antwerp in Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. This is why it is known as the \u2019Rotterdam effect\u2019.\nThe United Kingdom is considered as an extra-EU partner country for the EU for the whole period covered by this article. However, the United Kingdom was still part of the internal market until the end of the transitory period (31 December 2020), meaning that data on trade with the United Kingdom are still based on statistical concepts applicable to trade between the EU countries. Consequently, while imports from any other extra-EU trade partner are grouped by country of origin, the United Kingdom data re\ufb02ect the country of consignment. In practice this means that the goods imported by the EU from the United Kingdom were physically transported from the United Kingdom but part of these goods could have been of other origin than the United Kingdom. For this reason, data on trade with the United Kingdom are not fully comparable with data on trade with other extra-EU trade partners.\nContext Pharmaceutical products are among the most important products within the chemicals sector (SITC section 5).\nToday, the pharmaceutical sector is extensively regulated at EU level in the dual interest of ensuring the highest possible level of public health and patient con\ufb01dence in safe, effective and high-quality medicinal products, while continuing to develop a single EU market for pharmaceuticals in order to strengthen the European pharmaceutical industry\u2019s competitiveness and research capability.\nThe most common trade impediments faced by pharmaceutical exporters are a range of burdensome and costly registration, licensing and certi\ufb01cation procedures. The EU aims to redress these through its bilateral trade agreements or by tackling individual barriers as part of its market access partnership.\nOther articles \u2022 International trade in goods - other articles International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 10 Dedicated section International trade in goods - dedicated section Database International trade in goods - database Data visualisations \u2022 International trade in goods - visualisations Methodology International trade in goods - methodology Legislation \u2022 International trade in goods - legislation External links \u2022 European Commission - DG Trade Notes International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 11",

    "document": "Medicare Drug Prices Are Changing: What to Know\nMedicare released its new drug prices for 2026, and many of the costliest prescriptions are set to be lowered for Americans who rely on the government health insurance.\nPresident Joe Biden has approved deals with drug companies to lower the costs of 10 of Medicare's most common and expensive drugs.\nThe Biden administration said that the new prices would save taxpayers about $6 billion, while the seniors on Medicare could save $1.5 billion on their prescriptions.\n\"For years, millions of Americans were forced to choose between paying for medications or putting food on the table, while Big Pharma blocked Medicare from being able to negotiate prices on behalf of seniors and people with disabilities. But we fought back\u2014and won,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\"Today, for the first time in history, my Administration is announcing that Medicare has reached agreements on new, lower prices with the manufacturers of all 10 drugs selected for the first round of drug price negotiation.\"\nThe affected medications include those Americans use to manage diabetes, cancer and heart disease, which affect millions each year.\nFor the 10 medications, Medicare recipients will save between 38 and 79 percent starting in 2026. The drugs include Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp.\nBlood clot medications Eliquis and Xarelto went down to $231 and $197, while diabetes medications got major savings too.\nJardiance, Januvia, Farxiga and Fiasp shaved hundreds off their list prices for 2026, now costing between $100 and $200 compared to previous costs above $500 for a 30-day supply.\nThe full list of price changes was announced on the White House website.\nAltogether, more than 67 million Americans rely on Medicare for their health coverage, but high drug prices and premiums have made health care unaffordable for many.\n\"It's a relief for the millions of seniors that take these drugs to treat everything from heart failure, blood clots, diabetes, arthritis, Crohn's disease, and more\u2014and it's a relief for American taxpayers,\" Biden said.\nMedicare previously said blood thinners Xarelto and Eliquis would see lower prices because of the new deals, alongside diabetes medications Jardiance and Januvia.\nPreviously, the U.S. government was not permitted to negotiate with Big Pharma over drug prices, though private insurers always had this ability.\n\"This meant that drug companies could basically charge whatever they want for lifesaving treatments people rely on, and all Americans paid the price,\" White House adviser Neera Tanden said in a media call on Wednesday evening.\nPharmaceutical companies have not been pleased with Biden's price negotiations and pushed against the Inflation Reduction Act, which made the negotiations law.\nWhile the first 10 selected drug prices aren't set to change until 2026, the U.S. government can pick another 15 medications to negotiate on next year.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the negotiations would save the government $25 billion in the next seven years.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act also instituted a cap on out-of-pocket drug costs, which is set to start in 2025. Next year, seniors can expect to pay a maximum of $2,000 for their prescriptions.\n\"As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare Part D has become a stronger safety net for Medicare beneficiaries who need expensive medications,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst for medicareresources.org, told Newsweek. \"This will provide significant financial relief to enrollees who used to spend far more than that for their medications.\"\nWith the lower costs on prescriptions, there is some concern that those costs could be passed on to Medicare premium prices. Likely in an effort to mitigate some of those issues, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is paying an extra $15 per member per month to insurers.\n\"Some Republican lawmakers are challenging the premium stabilization program, alleging that it should have required congressional approval,\" Norris said. \"But the implementation of this program should ensure that people with Medicare Part D continue to have multiple affordable options for 2025.\"\nOpen enrollment for Medicare begins October 15 and runs to December 7, with all plan selections taking effect in January.\n\"It's a big win for Medicare recipients. One of the concerns going into these negotiations was that a deal wouldn't be reached, and a few of these drugs wouldn't have the same amount of coverage many need,\" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek.\n\"Even if you don't use one of the drugs covered, it's an encouraging sign,\" he added. \"With an increasing older population in America, more taxpayers are going to join Medicare in the coming years. The government taking a more proactive approach to negotiations to cover drug prices is one current and future recipients will be thankful for.\"\nUpdate 8/15/24, 10:18 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nTop stories\n\nTrump Is Picking the 'Avenger Squad' for Cabinet, Charlie Kirk Says\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nTrump Allies React to Biden Allowing Ukraine to Hit Russia With US ATACMS\n\nTrump Picks FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr To Lead the Agency\nAbout the writer\nSuzanne Blake is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

With telemedicine, patients can now receive medical advice, diagnosis, disease management and treatment from the comfort of their homes, increasing their access to care and eliminating physical barriers created by hospital capacity, distance or transportation.\nThis report examines the continued adoption of telemedicine, its applications across various specialties and health care services, and its effects on physician well-being, patient access, and continuity of care. Study findings show that 88% of physicians surveyed believe telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, with many reporting reduced wait times, improved adherence to treatment plans, and decreased no-show rates. Additionally, a consider- able portion of physicians surveyed reported that telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules and positively impacted their feelings of autonomy and work-life balance. Beyond expanding access to health care, telemedicine may also be increasing patients\u2019 willingness to seek medical attention. The majority of all patients surveyed (70%) said they may be more likely to consult with a doctor if they can do so virtually, with convenience and efficiency being primary drivers of adoption. Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year, 85% said it resulted in equivalent or superior quality of care, with the majority reporting increased satisfaction. As the digitization of health care continues, telemedicine is poised to main- tain a pivotal role in health care delivery. Telemedicine and in-person care are not mutually exclusive, and uniting both can help reduce costs, expand access, and improve care for everyone. With further identification and im- plementation of best practices, telemedicine\u2019s capacity to personalize care models, promote continuity of care, and improve patient outcomes will only get stronger.\nReport Introduction 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Introduction 03 Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 04 An analysis of fee-for-service Medicare telemedicine claims throughout 2022 revealed that nearly 47% of billing physicians were users of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform. In the last quarter of 2022 (October to December) alone, Doximity's telemedicine tools were used by over 375,000 unique clinicians.* To gain a deeper understanding of the progression and sustained utilization of telemedicine, Doximity conducted an analysis of how its physician members, across all specialties and practice areas, used its telemedicine tools throughout 2022. To supplement this data, Doximity conducted a survey of over 1,200 of its physician telemedicine users across nine specialties: cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology, endocrinology, rheumatology, pulmonology, and psychiatry.\n*As reported on February 9, 2023 during Doximity\u2019s Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter earnings call 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 05 Physician Insights Telemedicine Insights from Doximity's Physician Membership 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 06 The metro areas with the highest physician adoption of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform in 2022 ranged across all regions of the U.S. New York had the highest overall adoption of telemedicine among physicians, followed by Chicago and Boston.\nMetro Areas with the HIGHEST HIGHEST Adoption 1.

This trend may be attributed to telemedicine\u2019s ability to promote continuity of care and long-term patient-physician relationships. Among all physicians surveyed, over 83% reported they found telemedicine useful in enhancing continuity of care for patients with complex or chronic conditions, and nearly two-thirds (65%) said telemedicine improved communication with their patients. 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 08 Adoption by Specialty Adoption of Telemedicine Highest in Specialties that Manage Chronic Illness 1.

Psychiatry Top Specialty by Adoption Rate \"I\u2019m an advanced heart failure cardiologist, and there are not many of us in the state. With telemedicine, patients now have access to subspecialists which may not be available in their area. In addition, follow ups for things like adjusting a heart failure therapy can be done via telemedicine, eliminating the need for patients to drive long distances for a short office visit. Over the past few years, we\u2019ve learned telemedicine is not a replacement, but a complement to our practices. \u2013 Munir Janmohamed, MD, Medical Director Heart Failure, Dignity Health Medical Foundation 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 09 As health care becomes more digitized, physicians across specialties are integrating telemedicine into their practices. In a survey of Doximity's telemedicine users, nearly 84% of physicians reported using telemedicine at least weekly, with 40% incorporating it into their daily clinical practice. The highest reports of daily use were among psych- iatrists at 84%, followed by endocrinologists at 57%. Looking ahead, the increasing popularity of mobile medicine and remote patient monitoring devices \u2014 estimated to reach 60.6 million U.S. patients by 20243 \u2014\u00ad is likely to drive further demand for reliable and complementary telemedicine solutions.\nFrequency of Use Many Physicians Incorporating Telemedicine into Daily, Weekly Practice *May not sum to 100 due to rounding numbers.\nHow often do you use telemedicine (via voice, video, text, etc.) in your practice?* Monthly 11% Quarterly 3% None of the Above 3% Participant None of the Ab Quarterly Monthly Daily Weekly 44% 40% 11% 3% 3% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 1 Daily 40% Weekly 44% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine As physicians lean into digital, they are embracing multiple telemedicine modalities, with video emerging as the most predominant among physicians surveyed. Audio-only phone visits are also widely employed, demonstrating the need for telemedicine tools that are versatile and adaptable to patients\u2019 needs. According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, Medicare patients with less technology access, lack of video experience, Latinx ethnicity, or limited English pro- ficiency, were all more likely to be offered telephone visits compared to video visits.4 These findings underscore the importance of audio-only options and the ongoing need for inclusive, flexible, and accessible telemedicine and product features that meet the needs of an increasingly diverse patient population.

While one of the most predominant applications among physicians is routine follow-up visits (92% of physicians surveyed), the majority of physicians surveyed (57%) use telemedicine to discuss lab and test results and treatment options with their patients, and this is even higher among oncologists (70%). Telemedicine also offers an important channel for prescription refills and timely follow-ups after a missed in-person visit, while playing a non-trivial role in remote patient monitoring, patient triage and urgent care. Notably, a recent study conducted by Epic Research found that most patients who had a telemedicine visit did not require an in-person follow-up appointment within the same specialty for three months. These findings suggest that telemedicine can provide effective medical attention without the need for additional in-person visits.5 Adoption by Use Case Telemedicine's Role Extends Beyond Routine Care How Physicians Apply Telemedicine in Clinical Practice: Routine Follow-Up Patient Visits Patient Consults Patient Triage Remote Patient Monitoring Test Results and Treatment Options Follow-Ups After Missed In-Person Visits Medication Management Urgent Care 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 12 While the pandemic certainly increased telemedicine use, the opportunity for better time management could help explain its continued adoption. Two-thirds of all physicians surveyed (66%) reported at least one time management benefit, such as greater autonomy and work-life balance, increased productivity, and easier schedule management. In fact, the majority of physicians surveyed reported telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules. As physicians continue to navigate burnout and overwork, these benefits could drive even greater adoption of telemedicine in the future.\nEffects on Productivity, Work-Life Balance Physicians Report Better Time Management \"Telemedicine has made it easier to manage my schedule.\" \"Telemedicine helps me be more productive and better serve my patients.\" \"Telemedicine has provided me with greater autonomy and work-life balance.\" \"Telemedicine helps me to provide care to more patients per day.\" Physician-Reported Benefits of Telemedicine Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 13 Telemedicine is also instrumental in addressing the costly and disruptive issue of patient no-shows for doctor visits. Approximately 61% of physicians surveyed reported a reduction in their patient no-show rates as a result of telemedicine, likely due to the increased convenience, accessibility, and flexibility of virtual care visits. Importantly, 77% of physicians said they have observed either equivalent or improved patient adherence to treatment plans through telemedicine, with less than 2% reporting decreased adherence.\nEffects on Patient Visit, Treatment Adherence Reduces No-Show Rates, Improves or Maintains Adherence to Treatment Plans How has telemedicine affected your patients' adherence to treatment plans?* Not applicable 1 Not applicable 1% Decreased adherence 2% Unsure 21% Increased adherence 37% No change 40% 1 Decreased adherence 2% No change in adherence 40% Increased adherence 37% *May not sum to 100, due to rounding numbers.\nUnsure 21% Not applicable 1% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 14 Patient access also appears to be a leading contributor to telemedicine adoption. Nearly 88% of physicians surveyed said telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, particularly among populations that may have faced barriers to care previously. Similarly, 87% of physicians reported telemedicine has enabled them to provide care to patients who face obstacles visiting their office in person. As additional benefits, nearly 44% of physicians found that telemedicine has actually reduced wait times for their patients, while 41% said telemedicine has expanded their community reach and referral networks.\nEffects on Patient Access Physicians Report Improved Access, Reduced Wait Times for Patients Physicians Who Agree Telemedicine Has Increased Patient Access to Health Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree 88 Neutral 10 Disagree 3 Disagree 3% Neutral 10% Agree 87% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Approximately 92% of physicians surveyed identified ease of use as a key factor in promoting patient access, followed by cross-device compatibility, allowing access from both desktop and mobile devices. Notably, the majority of physicians surveyed identified the ability to avoid application downloads and login-protected patient portals as important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine.\nFactors Influencing Patient Access Ease of Use, Cross-Device Compatibility Key Attributes for Patient Access Which of the following features are important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine?\nEase of use Accessibility across desktop and mobile No application download required No patient portal log-in required Ability to add family member or care partner Language support (translation or interpreter service) 0 100 75 50 25 92% 81% 71% 56% 55% 42% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 16 As telemedicine\u2019s role in U.S. health care continues to evolve, pay parity and the ability to offer telemedicine services across state lines will continue to be two issues that can greatly impact patient access. Among all physicians surveyed, over 78% indicated they believe there should be pay parity between telemedicine and in-person visits, and nearly 84% said the ability to practice telemedicine across state lines is critical to improving patient access to specialists and other timely care. With a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034,1 telemedicine is likely to play a significant role in promoting patient access to care, particularly in rural or underserved areas.\nPolicies to Preserve Patient Access Pay Parity, Licensing Across State Lines Critical to Patient Access Percentage of Physicians Who Agree There Should Be Pay Parity Between Telemedicine and In-Person Visits Percentage of Physicians Who Agree Ability to Practice Telemedicine Across State Lines is Critical to Improving Patient Access to Specialists, Other Timely Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree Neutral Disagree Disagree 4% Neutral 12% Agree 84% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Survey respondents included 1,200 patients who identified as having a chronic illness and 1,200 patients who did not. Among all respondents surveyed, the majority reported participating in a telemedicine visit within the last year (between March 2022 to March 2023). The following analyses examine these patients' direct experiences with telemedicine, as well as broader trends and preferences among the full patient cohort.\nPatient Insights Tracking Patient Perception and Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 19 In 2022, telemedicine reached the 80% adoption mark overall, becoming the preferred channel for prescription care and minor illness.6 While this is a significant milestone, the frequency of telemedicine use is also noteworthy. Based on survey results, nearly 60% of patients who had a telemedicine visit in the past year participated in a minimum of three virtual visits. Over one in five (21%) participated in six or more visits, and this frequency was similar among patients with and without chronic illnesses. Further, nearly 76% of patients who had a telemedicine visit reported it improved their access to health care services.\nTelemedicine Use Among Patients Patients Report Recurring Use of Telemedicine Within One-Year Period In the past year, how many times did you meet with a doctor virtually?* Has virtual care improved your access to health care services?* *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nFundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold 6+ times 21 3-5 times 38 1-2 times 41 41% 38% 21% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Fundrais Participant Unsure No No Change Yes 76% 17% 5% 2% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 3-5 Times 38% No 5% Unsure 2% 1-2 Times 41% Yes 76% 6+ Times 21% No Change 17% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 20 Patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year identified a number of reasons for adoption, with efficiency and convenience being primary drivers. Telemedicine enables patients to consult with their doctors from the comfort of their homes, eliminating the need to interrupt their daily routines or commute to a doctor's office. Importantly, more than one in four patients with a telemedicine visit in the past year reported opting for a virtual visit because they did not believe their situation warranted an in-person appointment. This suggests that telemedicine could play a vital role in ensuring patients less inclined to visit a doctor's office still receive timely medical evaluation. In fact, the majority of all patients surveyed (70%) indicated they may be more likely to consult with a doctor in a non-emergency situation if the visit could be conducted virtually.\nFactors Driving Telemedicine Adoption Efficiency, Convenience Leading Drivers of Patient Adoption *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nWhy did you see your doctor virtually within the past year?* Easier than in-person visit (more convenient) Faster than in-person visit Concerns about COVID-19 and other infections Didn't feel in-person was needed (didn't feel bad enough) Difficulty getting to doctors office Couldn't miss work 0 60 45 30 15 53% 43% 31% 27% 26% 16% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 21 Over the past year, patients participated in telemedicine visits to receive a number of health care services, ranging from routine check-ups to appointments to discuss test results and treatment options. While follow-up appointments appear to be one of the primary applications of telemedicine use, this is likely due to the comprehensive nature of these visits, which can encompass various health care services. Among all patients who had a virtual care visit in the past year, approximately one in three patients (34%) used telemedicine to discuss their medications with their doctor or to refill their prescriptions, while roughly one in five used telemedicine to review test or treatment options. Notably, some of the highest use of telemedicine for these services was among patients with chronic illnesses.\nAdoption by Health Care Service Strong Telemedicine Adoption for Routine Visits, Medication Management What type(s) of care have you received virtually in the past year?\nFollow-ups after an in-person visit Regular check-ups Medication management and refills Review of test or lab results Mental health appointments Review of test or treatment options Same-day appointments (non-emergency) Urgent or emergency care Remote monitoring device check-up 0 50 38 25 13 46% 36% 34% 32% 25% 20% 17% 11% 9% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 22 Patients are also embracing a variety of telemedicine modalities to cater to their diverse needs and preferences. These modalities include video consultations, audio-only phone calls, and chat or text messaging. Among all patients surveyed, video emerged as the most preferred modality, with audio- only phone visits closely behind. These relatively strong preferences across modalities underscore the need for adaptable and flexible telemedicine solutions that can promote a positive patient experience for all.\nPreferences by Modality Patients Report Similar Preferences for Video, Audio-Only Visits Which types of virtual care formats do you prefer?\nAll Patients Patients with Telemedicine Visit in Past Year Video Phone (audio only) Chat or text messaging I prefer to meet with my doctor in person 15 0 30 45 60 42% 56% 39% 46% 27% 31% 27% 13% Computer (laptop/desktop) 51% Tablet or iPad 38% Home phone or basic cell phone 20% Wi-Fi or Internet 54% Among all patients surveyed, the majority (77%) reported having regular access to a smartphone, making it the most commonly available device for virtual health care visits. This was followed by computers at 51% and tablets at 38%. Importantly, only 54% of respondents reported having reg- ular access to Wi-Fi, underscoring the need for flexible telemedicine solutions that can easily adapt to meet individual patients\u2019 needs, including adjusting for no or low internet connection. In terms of patient preferences, 60% of respondents indicated a strong preference for using mobile devices for telemedicine visits, with less than one-fourth (24%) reporting a preference for computers.\n2023 State of Telemedicine Report 23 Device Access and Preferences Patients Continue to Favor, Depend on Smartphones Which of the following resources do you have regular access to for virtual health care visits?\nSmartphone 0 20 40 60 80 77% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 24 Consistent with prior year findings, patients continue to report equivalent or superior quality of care as the result of their experience with telemedicine. Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit within the past year, 85% reported their overall care was better or about the same with virtual care, and over half indicated increased satisfaction. These results underscore telemedicine\u2019s ability to enhance patient experiences and outcomes, making it a valuable tool in modern health care delivery.\nTelemedicine Satisfaction, Quality of Care Patients Report Increased Satisfaction, Equivalent or Superior Quality of Care Which of the following best represents your experience with virtual care overall?* How has virtual care affected your satisfaction with your care?* F Participant My overall care My overall care My overall care same Unsure 9% 46% 39% 6% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold My overall care is worse 7 My overall care is better 34 Increased Satisfaction 54 Unsure 5 5% 54% 34% 7% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Increased satisfaction 54% Unsure 9% Unsure 5% Decreased satisfaction 7% My overall care is worse 6% No change in satisfaction 34% My overall care is about the same 46% My overall care is better 39% *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\n2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 25 Expectations for Future Use Patients Emphasize Importance of Virtual Care Options Nearly 67% of patients with a telemedicine visit in the past year emphasized the importance of their doctor providing virtual care options, and this number was even higher among patients who had three or more telemedicine visits (72%). Notably, the large majority of patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year (83%) indicated they expect to maintain or increase their usage of telemedicine in the future.\nof patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year indicated they expect to maintain or increase their usage of telemedicine in the future 83% Conclusion, Methodology, & Sources 26 With strong adoption among physicians and patients, telemedicine is poised to maintain an important role in health care delivery, particularly as the U.S. contin- ues to grapple with physician burnout and shortage and an aging population. Moving forward, uniting telemedicine with in-person care will help personalize care models, promote more equitable access to care, and strengthen the overall health care system for all. By leveraging the advantages of both telemedicine and in-person care, physicians as well as care teams can create flexible and adaptable models that better meet the diverse needs of their patients. This flexibility could also provide much- needed support for physicians and other medical professionals, as they continue to navigate a complex and evolving health care landscape.\nConclusion, Methodology & Sources Conclusion 27 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Conclusion, Methodology & Sources 28 Physician Insights Medicare Telemedicine Insights: Doximity partnered with CareJourney, a health analytics organization, to measure the number of physicians billing a set of Medicare telemedicine codes throughout 2022.

COVID-19 patients who were isolated and received HBIC were monitored through telephone consultations (TC), in-person TC visits, and a self-reporting application. By evaluating patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC, healthcare providers could gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of the HBIC program.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study design enrolled 444 HBIC patients who answered a structured questionnaire. A binary logistic regression model assessed the association between independent variables and patient satisfaction. The length of stay in HBIC was analyzed using Cox regression analysis. The data collection started on April (1\u201330), 2022, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\nResults: The median age was 34, and 247 (55.6%) were females. A greater proportion (313, 70.5%) of the participants had high satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AOR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those who were symptomatic (AOR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were found to be significant factors for high user satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and more in-person visits (>1 visit) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001) had greater chances to reduce the length of stay in the COVID-19 HBIC.\nConclusion: 70.5% of the participants had high satisfaction with the system, and frequent phone call follow-ups on patients\u2019 clinical status can significantly improve their satisfaction and length of recovery. An in-person visit is also an invaluable factor in a patient\u2019s recovery.\n1 Introduction\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on numerous countries, resulting in a staggering number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide. Specifically, 774,771,942 confirmed cases and 7,035,337 deaths were reported globally. In Africa, approximately 9,576,309 confirmed cases and 175,500 deaths have been recorded, whereas Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths (1). Given the outbreak\u2019s severity and the prevailing epidemiological situation, the Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia has taken swift action by developing, approving, and implementing a national guide on home-based isolation and care (HBIC). This guide is tailored for asymptomatic and mildly confirmed COVID-19 cases (2). Consequently, many patients have enrolled in the system, establishing a comprehensive telephone consultation (TC) service. Healthcare workers from health centers have been diligently monitoring the clinical condition of these patients through regular phone calls or in-person visits (2). The national or regional COVID-19 emergency centers are available for assistance to ensure that patients receive the necessary support and information. Patients facing challenges or requiring guidance on the system\u2019s functioning, worsening symptoms, medication advice, or ambulance requests can reach these centers (2). This approach provides comprehensive care and support to individuals affected by COVID-19 in Ethiopia.\nSeveral studies have emphasized the utilization of teleconsultations (TC) in Sub-Saharan Africa amid the COVID-19 outbreak. For instance, a study conducted at the Aga Khan Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, revealed varying frequencies of TC calls over 3\u2009months, with peaks observed at 7\u2009weeks and lows at 13\u2009weeks (3). In Uganda, the Ministry of Health rolled out TC services across multiple health centers simultaneously (4). Similarly, in Cameroon, many physicians resorted to TC consultations during the pandemic, often using WhatsApp applications (5). Despite the progress in telemedicine practices, assessing the quality of care provided through these methods is crucial. Quality indicators for telemedicine outcomes include mortality rates, average length of stay, and complication rates (6). The adoption of telemedicine has played a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of diagnosis and treatment in primary public hospitals (7). This is evident in the reduction of treatment duration, decrease in the average length of hospital stays, and decline in the percentage of critically ill patients (8). Moreover, telemedicine aids in improving personalized care and broadening the accessibility of medical services. Healthcare providers can deliver more efficient and effective patient care by harnessing telemedicine, particularly during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic (9, 10). Patient satisfaction is a significant indicator of the societal perception of healthcare services, particularly in telemedicine. The practical advantages of telemedicine further underscore its social reputation within primary healthcare facilities. First, Telemedicine plays a crucial role in alleviating the financial burden on patients and their families by eliminating expenses associated with transportation and accommodation (11). Second, the efficient nature of telemedicine expedites disease diagnosis and treatment, thereby mitigating patients\u2019 suffering (11). Lastly, telemedicine\u2019s unique \u201cface-to-face\u201d communication system fosters a novel connection between medical professionals and patients, ultimately enhancing the healthcare experience (12, 13). Despite numerous studies, the findings remain inconclusive and conflicting. Some researchers suggested recruiting adaptable patients who embrace this new technology\u2019s convenience (14). Conversely, others highlight limitations, such as the relative novelty of telehealth in medicine, which makes it challenging to compare its outcomes with those of more traditional interventions (15). In addition, patient satisfaction is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors. However, the factors influencing patient satisfaction in different settings or conditions remain debated (15).\nPatient satisfaction and length of stay are crucial metrics for assessing the quality of healthcare programs. This study aimed to provide insights into the factors influencing the satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC of COVID-19 patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This study uses traditional care (TC) and hybrid (in-person-TC) approaches in different sub-city areas. By understanding these factors, policymakers can develop strategic plans to improve the quality of healthcare services, thereby ensuring high satisfaction levels and shorter medical residence stays. The findings of this study can also inform the National Public Health Emergency Operation Center and the Federal Ministry of Health in Ethiopia on how to intervene and strengthen the healthcare system. In addition, the results can contribute to expanding telemedicine services and adopting digital health technologies in the country\u2019s healthcare sector.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Study area\nThis study focuses on Addis Ababa, primarily because of the significant burden of COVID-19 cases. Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths, with nearly 67% of these cases originating in Addis Ababa (1). Moreover, implementing the COVID-19 HBIC model in Addis Ababa surpasses other regions. Furthermore, the HBIC\u2019s self-reporting and follow-up application is exclusively available in Addis Ababa, making it an ideal location for research. Addis Ababa is divided into 11 sub-cities [Addis Ketema, Akaky Kaliti, Arada, Bole, Gullele, Kirkos, Kolfe Keranio, Lideta, Nefas Silk-Lafto, Yeka, Lemi Kura (New)], all of which have adopted the HBIC system for COVID-19 patients since the initial case was identified. The digital follow-up tool was specifically launched in the Bole sub-city (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Addis Ababa district locations. This map of the 11 Addis Ababa sub-cities is included in this study. Lemi Kura is a new district and is not included in this map.\n2.2 Study period\nThe study was conducted from 1 to 30 April 2022 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.3 Telemedicine medical team and technology\nEach sub-city is equipped with two to four health centers that serve as the base for the telemedicine medical team. A well-established system ensures that patient data is promptly transmitted to follow-up teams, enabling healthcare workers to initiate their follow-up procedures without delay. To support this initiative, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Addis Ababa Health Bureau allocated a tablet with complimentary airtime to each sub-city proportionate to the needs of the telemedicine medical team.\n2.4 Population studied\nThis study encompasses all individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who were isolated, received care at home, and met the criteria for inclusion. The study population consisted of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to HBIC from its inception, aged between 18 and 60, individuals who underwent regular follow-up assessments while at HBIC, and those whose contact information was documented in the registry.\n2.5 Patient\u2019s independent variables\nPatients were classified based on the following criteria: Gender (male, female), Age (<30, 31\u201340, 41\u201350, 51\u201360\u2009years), city of residence, education level (no education and elementary, secondary and diploma, degree and above), occupation (government employee, private employee, self-employee, not working), symptoms (asymptomatic, symptomatic), type of attention (only telephone call\u2014TC, telephone call with in-person visits - in-person-TC), frequency of calls (\u22642 calls, \u22653 calls), and frequency of in-person visits (no visits, \u22642 visits, \u22653 visits).\n2.6 Study design\nA cross-sectional research design assessed two primary variables: patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC in days. The formula for a single population proportion was applied to determine the required population size of 385 (with a Z-score of 1.96, an outcome proportion of 50%, and a marginal error of 5%). The technique of proportionate stratified sampling involved dividing the entire population into 11 strata or sub-cities. The total sample size was then distributed proportionally among each sub-city based on the burden of the disease. Study participants were selected from each stratum or sub-city using systematic probability sampling (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Data collection. Sampling technique from each sub-city in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.7 Data collection tools, techniques, and quality assurance\nA validated patient satisfaction survey from the teleneurology program in Chile (13) employed a Likert scale to assess the extent of patient satisfaction. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collected, a pretest was conducted on a random sample of 23 (5%) patients. Based on the findings from the pretest, necessary amendments were made to the data collection tool. Additionally, the collected data underwent daily reviews for clarity and completeness checks. Before analysis, the internal consistency of the questionnaire was evaluated using Cronbach\u2019s alpha test (13). The local language was used during data collection to ensure the required information was collected with greater understanding. To facilitate this, the data collection questionnaire was first developed in English and then translated into Amharic, and the data collected were back-translated to English for consistency. The data collectors administered the questionnaire over the telephone, and responses were recorded on the individual datasheets. Training on the basics of the questionnaire and how to use it appropriately was given by the principal investigator for two BSc nurses for 2\u2009days.\n2.8 Patient satisfaction survey\nThe final questionnaire consisted of 17 closed-response questions, each assigned a numerical value ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree). The questions were categorized into four contextualized areas. The overall score on the questionnaire, with a maximum of 85 points, served as an indicator of patient satisfaction. The scoring system classified satisfaction levels as follows: very low (17 points or below), low (18\u201334 points), moderate (35\u201351 points), high (52\u201368 points), and very high (69\u201385 points). Following completion of the survey, patients were divided into two main groups based on their scores: (i) those with a score below 51 points, indicating moderate or low patient satisfaction, and (ii) those with a score over 52 points, indicating high or very high patient satisfaction (Table 1).\nTable 1. Study questionnaire.\r\n\n2.9 Data and outcomes analysis\nSummary statistics, including frequency, percentage, median, and interquartile range, were utilized to summarize the characteristics of patients and other relevant information. This research aimed to assess the relationship between the independent variables and two primary outcomes: (i) the level of patient satisfaction and (ii) the length of stay in the HBIC. The binary logistic regression (Backwald) model was employed to examine the independent variables associated with patient satisfaction, and the findings were presented as odds ratios (OR). Cox regression (Backwald) analysis was conducted to evaluate the independent variables linked to the length of stay in HBIC, and the results were reported as hazard ratios (HR). To compare the means of length of stay in HBIC, a non-normal distribution, the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for independent samples was employed, while the chi-square test was used for categorical variables. The significance level was set at p\u2009<\u20090.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 26.\n2.10 Ethical considerations\nThe study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee. Oral informed consent was obtained from the participants before any form of data collection. Participants\u2019 contact information was obtained after a formal request was made to the Addis Ababa Health Bureau. Demographic data of all participants and survey responses were anonymously collected and entered. Access to the collected information was limited to the authors, and confidentiality was maintained throughout the project.\n3 Results\n3.1 Data collection\nA 17-question structured questionnaire was developed by reviewing similar studies (Table 1) (13). Upon completing a reliability assessment of the survey, the internal reliability of the survey was robust, as evidenced by a Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of 0.96 (data not shown). The study included 509 patients, yielding a response rate of 87.2% (n\u2009=\u2009444). Among the non-respondents (n\u2009=\u200965, 12.8%), the reasons provided for their lack of participation were as follows: 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) had incorrect contact information, and another 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) did not receive any follow-up, either in-person or through phone communication. The remaining 60% (n\u2009=\u200939) of participants displayed uncooperative behavior, as their phones were inactive, unreachable, or did not answer (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Patient\u2019s response from telephone calls. Response rate and reasons for non-response include: (i) wrong phone number, (ii) no follow-up, and (iii) other.\n3.2 Population description, patient satisfaction, and length of stay in HBIC\nThe descriptive statistics of the 444 patients who participated in the study are below. The median age was 34\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u2009years, with an age distribution as follows: Age:<30 (n\u2009=\u2009164, 36.9%); 31\u201340 (n\u2009=\u2009141, 31.8%); 41\u201350 (n\u2009=\u200987, 19.6%); and 51\u201360 (n\u2009=\u200952, 11.7%). The gender distribution of the patients was as follows: Female 247 (55.6%) (Table 2). We outline the performance of the HBIC system according to the patient satisfaction parameter. Due to the low frequency obtained in the lower user satisfaction groups (very low, low, and moderate), we grouped patients into two major groups according to the degree of user satisfaction: low or moderate and high or very high. patients with high or very high user satisfaction represent 313 (70.5%). When we break down this group by gender, we see that women have a slightly higher percentage of high or very high user satisfaction than men, with 177 (56.9%) females. However, no statistically significant differences are observed. Analyzing the distribution of patients with high and very high user satisfaction by age, we observe that more than 50% of patients are concentrated in a population under 40\u2009years old (Table 2). The length of stay for patients with high or very high satisfaction varied depending on certain variables. The average length of stay for females was 15\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009days, while for males, it was 16\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009days, and in terms of age groups, patients showed similar lengths between 14 and 16 days (Table 2).\nTable 2. Patient\u2019s demographic variables.\r\n\nThe distribution of patients according to sub-city of residence was found to be quite homogeneous, with some exceptions as detailed below: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200962, 14.0%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Arada (n\u2009=\u200943, 9.7%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200977, 17.3%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200959, 13.3%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u200911, 2.5%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200936, 8.1%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200922, 5.0%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u200916, 3.6%). Patients with high or very high satisfaction were distributed according to sub-city of residence as follows: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200948, 10.8%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200935), Arada (n\u2009=\u200932, 7.2%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200957, 12.8%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%, 7.9%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u20096, 1.4%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200923, 5.2%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200920, 4.5%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200918, 4.1%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u20098, 1.8%) (Table 2). Regarding the city of origin, the average length of stay varied as follows: Addis Ketema (17\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Akaki Kality (16\u2009\u00b1\u20098), Arada (16\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Bole (14\u2009\u00b1\u20093), Gulele (17\u2009\u00b1\u20094), Kirkos (17\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Kolfe Keranyo (16\u2009\u00b1\u20096), Lideta (14\u2009\u00b1\u20094), Nefas Silk Lafto (20\u2009\u00b1\u20097), Yeka (15\u2009\u00b1\u20097), and Lemi Kura (14\u2009\u00b1\u20097) (Table 2).\nThe patient\u2019s satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC can be influenced by various factors, including the patient\u2019s level of education and occupation. The distribution of patients\u2019 education level is as follows: 79 patients (17.8%) had no education or only completed elementary school, 174 patients (39.2%) had completed secondary school or obtained a diploma, and 191 patients (43.0%) had a degree or higher education. The distribution of patients\u2019 occupation is as follows: 121 patients (27.3%) were government employees, 114 patients (25.7%) were private employees, 120 patients (25.0%) were self-employed, and 89 patients (20.0%) were not working (Table 2). The majority of patients who showed high or very high user satisfaction have higher levels of education: Education: No Educ and Elementary (n\u2009=\u200945, 10.1%), Secondary and Diploma (n\u2009=\u2009125, 28.2%), Degree and above (n\u2009=\u2009143, 32.2%); however, the distribution was found to be more symmetrical according to the occupational level of these patients: Government employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.0%), Private employee (n\u2009=\u200985, 19.1%), Self-employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.1%), Not working (n\u2009=\u200968, 15.3%) (Table 2). No significant differences were found in the duration length of stay in HBIC among patients concerning their level of education and occupation type. The respective data for education are as follows: No Education and Elementary 14\u2009\u00b1\u20097, Secondary and Diploma 15\u2009\u00b1\u20094, Degree and above 17\u2009\u00b1\u20095. Similarly, the data for occupation type were: Government employee 14\u2009\u00b1\u20095, Private employee 15\u2009\u00b1\u20095, Self-employee 16\u2009\u00b1\u20094, Not working 18\u2009\u00b1\u20097 (Table 2).\nMost patients who participated in this study were symptomatic, accounting for 275 (61.9%) with an average length of stay for HBIC of 16 (\u00b16). Patients who displayed symptoms were more satisfied (n\u2009=\u2009215, 48.5%) than those who were asymptomatic (n\u2009=\u200998, 22.1%). The length of stay in HBIC for asymptomatic patients (14\u2009\u00b1\u20095), was slightly lower than that of Symptomatic patients (16\u2009\u00b1\u20095). However, no statistically significant differences were observed (data not shown).\nNext, we described the frequency of phone call follow-ups for patients during their stay at HBIC. The most common type of care was TC, with 330 patients (74.3%), followed by in-person and TC visits, with 114 patients (25.7%). The overall frequency of in-person visits was 1\u2009\u00b1\u20092 visits, and it can be further broken down as follows: no visits (n\u2009=\u2009330, 48.9%), \u22642 visits (n\u2009=\u200984, 18.9%), and\u2009\u2265\u20093 visits (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%). The average frequency of phone call follow-ups was 3\u2009\u00b1\u20096 calls, and we observe that the distribution of calls appears to be symmetrical: TC was \u22642 calls (n\u2009=\u2009221, 49.8%) and\u2009\u2265\u20093 calls (n\u2009=\u2009223, 50.2%).\nIn terms of the mode of care, patients who were exclusively contacted through teleconsultation (TC) 217 (48.9%) were more satisfied than those receiving hybrid care with both TC and in-person visits 96 (21.6%). Consistent with the findings, patients exhibited higher user satisfaction with an increased frequency of calls in TC, as those patients with more than \u22653 calls (n\u2009=\u2009184, 41.4%) expressed greater satisfaction compared to patients with less than or equal to \u22642 calls (n\u2009=\u2009129, 29.1%) (Table 2). Upon analyzing the frequency of in-person visits, patients with fewer visits reported higher user satisfaction: No visits (n\u2009=\u2009217, 69.3%), 1 visit (n\u2009=\u200970, 22.0%), and\u2009\u2265\u20092 visits (n\u2009=\u200926, 8.3%).\nIt is important to mention that differences in patient length of stay were observed according to the type of care, as patients treated through the TC system 14\u2009\u00b1\u20095 stayed for a shorter period than those receiving hybrid care through TC and in-person visits 18\u2009\u00b1\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). As expected, patients with more calls stayed longer in the HBIC system as described below: Frequency of calls in TC: \u22642 calls 13\u2009\u00b1\u20093, and\u2009\u2265\u20093 calls 18\u2009\u00b1\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Table 2).\n3.3 Statistical analysis associated with patient satisfaction\nA binary logistic regression analysis was utilized to explore the variables associated with high or very high patient satisfaction levels. The results revealed that individuals who placed more than three calls (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those displaying symptoms (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were more inclined to report increased satisfaction. Nevertheless, no statistically significant relationships were found between user satisfaction and the other independent variables investigated (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 3).\nTable 3. Relevant demographic variables that influence patient satisfaction.\r\n\n3.4 Statistical analysis associated with patient length of stay in HBIC\nA Cox regression analysis was employed to examine the factors influencing the duration of hospital stays in patients who reported high levels of satisfaction. The findings revealed that patients who made more than three phone calls had a significantly lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000), indicating a greater likelihood of reducing their length of stay. Similarly, patients with more in-person visits also exhibited a lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). However, no statistically significant associations were observed between the length of stay and the other independent variables analyzed (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 4).\nTable 4. Cox regression analysis to elucidate the demographic variables associated with the length of stay in HBIC and patients\u2019 satisfaction.\r\n\n3.5 Statistical analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC\nPreviously, we identified the following variables that significantly influence patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC: the presence of symptoms, the number of phone calls, and in-person follow-ups. Subsequently, we examined the relationship between symptoms and patient satisfaction with the number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups (Table 5). It was noted that symptomatic patients with low or moderate satisfaction levels have an OR\u2009=\u20095.7 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and 7.6 times higher likelihood of having in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was notably longer for those with a higher number of phone calls. Conversely, patients with high or very high satisfaction levels have a 2.3 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was significantly longer for those with in-person follow-up. Sig p\u2009<\u20090.05 (Table 5).\nTable 5. Analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC.\r\n\n4 Discussion\nThis study aimed to evaluate the levels of patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC among COVID-19 patients while also examining the different factors that may impact these outcomes. Given the considerable number of COVID-19-positive instances and the limited bed availability at COVID-19-specific hospitals, the HBIC endorsed the practice of home isolation for COVID-19-affected persons. This directive was instituted because most COVID-19 patients were either asymptomatic or displayed mild symptoms. Such cases generally do not necessitate hospitalization at COVID-19-designated medical facilities and can be adequately managed at home with appropriate medical guidance and monitoring. The heightened level of patient satisfaction observed in symptomatic individuals treated by HBIC is supported by an associated investigation conducted through a survey-based study (10, 16\u201318).\nWe identified a noteworthy connection between a high or very high satisfaction level and the frequency of phone call follow-ups in patients with COVID-19 symptoms. Essentially, for each increment of one in the frequency of phone call follow-ups, the chances of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction rose by a factor of 2.8 (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000). This tendency may be attributed to patients encountering difficulties during their healthcare facility stay, and regular communication with the follow-up team assists in addressing some of these challenges. As per the National HBIC Guideline, the frequency of phone call follow-ups escalates as the severity of the COVID-19 illness worsens, with follow-ups occurring once a week, every 3\u2009days until discharge, and daily until discharge (19). Correspondingly, individuals exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms had 2.0 times greater odds of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction than those with asymptomatic disease (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Cox regression analysis uncovered a negative correlation between the length of stay in HBIC patients with high or very high satisfaction and the frequency of phone calls, follow-ups, and in-person visits. Specifically, the number of phone calls and in-person visits (with a minimum of two visits) emerged as significant factors impacting the length of stay. Upon adjusting for other variables, it was observed that with each additional phone call, the length of stay in the hospital-based isolation center (HBIC) decreased by 46.3% (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000). Similarly, after accounting for other covariates, the length of stay among COVID-19 patients who had more than one in-person visit was 50.5% lower compared to patients with no in-person visits (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Finally, this investigation determined that symptomatic patients with Low or Moderate satisfaction had a greater likelihood of experiencing a larger Number of Phone Calls, In-Person follow-ups, and a longer stay at HBIC compared to patients with high or very high satisfaction.\nUser satisfaction and length of stay have shown dissimilar results in different latitudes. A study conducted in general and university hospitals in the Netherlands found no evidence of a correlation between the average length of stay in hospital wards and patient satisfaction (20). Several studies conducted at the Nancy University Hospital Center in France and in training hospitals in Turkey and Japan (21\u201323) have found a connection between prolonged lengths of stay and decreased patient satisfaction. These studies have highlighted the importance of environmental factors in influencing patient satisfaction (24). However, a distinct study carried out in teaching hospitals in Turkey discovered that patients who stayed longer expressed higher satisfaction levels than those with shorter stays (25). Despite these variations, one can speculate about the reasons for higher user satisfaction in patients with greater follow-ups. Among these reasons, it can be argued that it is well-documented that telemedicine technology has the potential to enhance the quality of primary medical care, shorten the duration of treatment, and decrease the number of severe hospitalization cases (17). Telemedicine expands the availability of medical services and broadens the range of medical care, which is particularly crucial in Ethiopia, with a fragmented healthcare system and limited coverage (26, 27). The sharing of medical resources is especially significant for rural or isolated areas, and telemedicine offers a greater abundance of advanced medical resources for primary hospital consultations in these vast rural regions, thereby enhancing the quality of medical and healthcare services (10, 28, 29).\nThe incorporation of telemedicine into the healthcare systems of low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as Ethiopia, has the potential to bring about cost savings and resource conservation in the long run. Consequently, this could alleviate the financial burden on individuals and enhance their access to affordable healthcare services (17). It is important to note that in many LMICs, a significant portion of overall health spending comes from out-of-pocket payments, as there is often no general health insurance available (30). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has further strained the already fragile healthcare systems in LMICs (10, 31). In this regard, telemedicine services could be crucial in relieving pressure on the healthcare system by saving time and resources and enhancing efficiency and accessibility. Additionally, telemedicine can facilitate social distancing measures and reduce the need for face-to-face interactions in hospitals and clinics, helping prevent the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 through physical contact (10, 32). Furthermore, telemedicine can also be instrumental in providing counseling and specific advice to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as guidance on prevention measures. Overall, the adoption of telemedicine in LMICs holds great potential for addressing healthcare challenges, reducing costs, and improving access to quality care. It can serve as a valuable tool in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthening healthcare systems in these countries (33).\nThroughout the initial three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, most patients seeking medical care were directed to the HBIC. This strategic decision is believed to have effectively alleviated the potential burden of cases and prevented burnout among the existing treatment facilities (2). The HBIC specifically caters to COVID-19 patients and represents our country\u2019s pioneering national telehealth service. Therefore, it is crucial to examine its operational experiences thoroughly. The focus should be on integrating functionalities that encourage community acceptance of this telehealth modality. As COVID-19 patients continue to be enrolled in the HBIC, the findings from this study will serve as a valuable resource for the Ministry of Health and COVID-19 response teams in their efforts to enhance the healthcare system. The HBIC framework offers a practical solution for healthcare providers who aim to extend their services to patients residing in remote areas. Moreover, the growing acceptance and familiarity with telemedicine visits, driven by the pandemic, are likely to shape the future landscape of healthcare delivery for both patients and providers.\nThe study\u2019s findings should be evaluated considering the strengths and limitations identified. The study\u2019s strength lies in the thorough selection process of participants from various sub-cities throughout the entire duration of the service. The research questions were also carefully developed using a validated tool and assessed for internal consistency, ensuring their comprehensibility.\n4.1 Limitations\nIt is important to acknowledge a limitation of the study, which is the potential recall bias introduced by enrolling most patients during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this limitation, this study is expected to pave the way for advancements in telemedical services in Ethiopia. Furthermore, it can potentially expand and incorporate other telemedicine care modalities, such as videoconferencing, in the future.\n5 Conclusion\nThe investigation evaluated patient satisfaction and length of stay in telemedicine services. The findings revealed that most patients, accounting for over 70.5%, reported high or very high satisfaction with these services. Notably, patients who received frequent follow-up phone calls and exhibited symptomatic COVID-19 disease expressed higher satisfaction. Additionally, it was observed that a higher frequency of phone calls and in-person visits resulted in a shorter stay in the Hospital-Based Isolation Center (HBIC). Consequently, it is crucial to consider the aforementioned factors to enhance patient satisfaction and reduce the length of stay in HBIC or other telemedicine services. It is worth mentioning that the HBIC, which caters specifically to COVID-19 patients, represents the first large-scale national telemedicine service implemented in our country. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly examine the experiences gained from this service, with particular attention given to incorporating features that facilitate community acceptance and reimbursement of this mode of healthcare delivery. Meanwhile, as the enrollment of COVID-19 patients in the HBIC continues, the findings of this study will serve as a valuable resource for guiding the Ministry of Health, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, and the COVID-19 response team in their efforts to improve the system.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving humans were approved by the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee.

More information is available at the\u202fCDC\u2019s website.\nWhere can I get a vaccine?\nVaccines are administered at retail pharmacies, including Walgreens, Walmart and CVS, clinics and other locations, such as doctor\u2019s offices. Use the federal government\u2019s website Vaccines.gov to search for vaccination sites by ZIP code. Get the same information by texting your ZIP code to 438829 or by calling 800-232-0233. You can check with your primary care physician\u2019s office to see if COVID-19 vaccinations are offered. If you are a veteran, the Department of Veterans Affairs offers COVID-19 vaccinations at VA facilities. Sign up online or call 800-827-1000 to make an appointment.More information about COVID-19 vaccines is available at the Florida Department of Health\u2019s Florida COVID-19 Response website and on the department\u2019s Facebook page. You can also call one of the department\u2019s local health offices, which are listed at the top right-hand side of the department\u2019s home page under \u201cCounties.\u201d Get advice for finding or requesting your vaccination records on the Florida Department of Health\u2019s website or visit Florida SHOTS, a free, online, statewide immunization system.\nDo I have to pay for the vaccination?\nThe federal government no longer covers the cost of the vaccines, but most people with Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance will not have to pay out of pocket for the shot.If you are uninsured, contact your local or state public health department or a nearby federally qualified health center about vaccination opportunities.Children 18 and younger may qualify to receive no-cost or low-cost vaccines through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program.Florida residents can check whether they qualify for the Vaccines for Adults (VFA) Program or Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program.\nWhat should I bring to my vaccine appointment?\nSome vaccination sites ask for proof of identity or eligibility. Bring a driver\u2019s license or other state-issued ID that shows your name, age and state residency, along with your health insurance card.\nDo I need to bring my vaccine card?\n The CDC no longer distributes vaccine cards, and\u202fthey are not required to receive a vaccine. If you\u2019ve lost your vaccine card, you can call the site where you were vaccinated to request a new one or a copy of your vaccination record. You can also contact the Florida Department of Health to get a copy of your record.\nWhat are the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine?\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to experience mild to moderate side effects after getting vaccinated, such as soreness in the arm, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, nausea, fever or chills \u2014 but these are temporary \u201cand normal signs that your body is building protection,\u201d the CDC says.A small number of vaccine recipients have experienced adverse reactions to the shots.\nCan I get the COVID-19, RSV and flu vaccines at the same time?\nAccording to the CDC, it is safe to receive the flu vaccine and updated COVID-19 vaccines simultaneously, although you are a little more likely to experience side effects, such as a headache and fatigue. Adults 75 or older (and those 60 to 74 with certain underlying health conditions) who are encouraged to get the RSV vaccine may receive that at the same time as the others, but some health experts suggest\u202fspacing them out. If you had the RSV vaccine last year, you don\u2019t need another one this year.Contact your health care provider for more information.\nHow are vaccinations working in nursing homes and long-term care facilities?\nThe U.S. government no longer distributes COVID-19 vaccines to long-term care facilities. That means nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other long-term care settings are responsible for coordinating COVID-19 vaccination programs for their residents and staff. Most long-term care facilities have partnerships with pharmacies or health departments to provide vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and other illnesses. Long-term care facilities that receive Medicare and/or Medicaid dollars are required by\u202ffederal law\u202fto educate residents, their representatives and staff about COVID-19 vaccines and offer a COVID-19 vaccine to residents, resident representatives and staff.\nHow protected am I postvaccination?\nAll vaccines reduce the risk of COVID-19 infections and are highly effective at preventing severe illness and death from the disease. No vaccine is 100 percent effective, and infections can still occur postvaccination.\nHow can I avoid COVID-19 scams?\u00a0\nBe aware that scammers often purport to offer COVID-19 vaccines and treatments and try to charge for them. The \u202fAARP Fraud Watch Network is tracking the latest scams.Florida residents who believe they\u2019ve encountered a COVID-19 scam can report it to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General by calling 800-447-8477 or by submitting a complaint online.Editor's note: This guide was last published Oct. 5, 2023, and has been updated with new information.Michelle Tuccitto Sullo is a contributing writer covering state and federal policy.

March 2024 April 2023 March 2024 April 2023 Unvaccinated children are at increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases like mumps, pertussis, and varicella. Communities with a higher proportion of religious exemptions (REs) to vaccination are at increased risk of vaccine-preventable disease transmission. The proportion of children age 4-18 years with new REs are increasing each month. Statewide, the estimated prevalence of REs among children age 4\u201318 years old is 5.5% with individual counties ranging from 1.0\u201312.5%. In March 2023, the statewide prevalence was 4.9% and the prevalence has gradually increased since. To learn more about REs at the local level, please visit FloridaHealth.gov/ REmap For all vaccine-preventable diseases, timely and complete vaccination is the best way to prevent infection. Although vaccinated individuals can still become infected with diseases like pertussis or varicella, in general, those who have received at least 1 dose of vaccine have less severe outcomes than those who have never been vaccinated for the disease. Posted April 29, 2024 on the Bureau of Epidemiology (BOE) website: FloridaHealth.gov/VPD Produced by the BOE, Florida Department of Health Vaccine-Preventable Disease Surveillance Report March 2024 The rate of religious exemptions is likely higher than the rate presented in this report. This is due to eligible persons with religious exemptions who have opted out of Florida SHOTS and persons who have had their religious exemptions processed outside of the Florida SHOTS system.

The number of reported hepatitis A cases in March decreased from the previous month and was below the previous 5-year average. In 2024, 28 hepatitis A cases were reported. The best way to prevent hepatitis A infection is through vaccination. In March 2024, 64% of cases were not up-to-date on hepatitis A vaccinations and 18% of cases had unknown hepatitis A vaccination status. Since 2006, hepatitis A vaccine has been recommended for all children at age 1 year. Hepatitis A vaccine is also recommended for certain adult high-risk groups, including persons using injection and non-injection drugs, persons experiencing homelessness, and men who have sex with men. To learn more about the hepatitis A vaccine, talk to your doctor or visit: www.CDC.gov/Vaccines/HCP/VIS/VIS-Statements/Hep-A.html. 40-49 year olds had the highest incidence *The white bars indicate the total number of cases as of March for each year 11 cases 18% of cases linked to other cases 64% of cases were not up-to-date and 18% of cases had unknown vaccination status In 2024, 40-49 year olds have the highest incidence rate at 0.28 cases per 100,000 population. In March 2024, 2 cases were epidemiologically (epi) linked to another case. Varicella Surveillance Hepatitis A Surveillance National activity Hepatitis A rates have decreased by more than 95% since the first vaccine became available in 1995. However, since outbreaks were first identified in 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been monitoring outbreaks in 37 states. More information about these outbreaks can be found here: www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/ outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm Hepatitis A surveillance goals \u2022 Identify cases to limit transmission \u2022 Identify and prevent outbreaks \u2022 Monitor effectiveness of immunization programs and vaccines To learn more about hepatitis A, please visit FloridaHealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vaccine-preventable-disease/hepatitis-a. For more information on the data sources used in Florida for hepatitis A surveillance, see the last page of this report. In March 2024, no cases were co-infected with chronic hepatitis C and no cases were co-infected with chronic hepatitis B. Co-infection with more than one type of viral hepatitis can lead to more severe liver disease and increase the risk of developing liver cancer. In March 2024, there was an average of 1 contact to reported cases. Contacts are those who were exposed to the virus and recommended prophylaxis for illness prevention. Epi linked cases Total cases Varicella Surveillance Hepatitis A Surveillance ! Vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A infection. Health care providers are encouraged to actively offer the hepatitis A vaccine to individuals at risk including men who have sex with men. For more information about hepatitis A vaccination in Florida visit: https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/ hepatitis/hepatitis-vaccination-testing-program.html Hepatitis A infections can be severe, leading to inpatient hospitalization and sometimes death. In 2024, 18 cases (64%) reported in Florida have been hospitalized due to hepatitis A infection. No deaths have been identified as hepatitis A associated in 2024. The Florida Department of Health is actively working to vaccinate those most at risk for hepatitis A infection. In March 2024, 3,940 doses were administered. The number of first doses of hepatitis A vaccine administered by both private providers and county health departments to adults age 18 years and older, as recorded in Florida SHOTS, increased and was below the previous 5-year-average. Vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A infection. In 2024, 39% of the 28 cases in Florida reported the risk factor of travel outside of the U.S. and 4% of cases reported the risk factor of men who have sex with men. No cases reported drug use or recent homelessness. Household-associated Outbreak-associated Total cases *The white bars indicate the total number of cases as of March for each year Pertussis Surveillance In March 2024, five pertussis cases were household-associated. One pertussis cases was outbreak-associated. In the past 6 months, there was an average of 3 household-associated cases, an average of 1 outbreak-associated cases and an average of 14 total cases. From October 2022 to March 2023, there was an average of 0 household-associated cases, an average of 0 outbreak-associated cases and an average of 6 total cases. For most pertussis cases, exposure to other known cases is not identified and are not able to be linked to outbreaks. Map 3 March Key Points 84 cases in the past 6 months One outbreak of 2 cases 24 cases The number of pertussis cases reported in March increased from the previous month and was above the previous 5-year average. <1 year olds had the highest 6 month average incidence In 2024, 55 pertussis cases were reported. In March 2024, 24 pertussis cases were reported in 14 counties, outlined in black in the map below. From January 2023 through March 2024 the average county rates varied throughout the state. There was an average of 2 contacts per case between October 2022 and March 2023 and between October 2023 and March 2024. Contacts are classified as people whom antibiotics were recommended to prevent illness. Antibiotics can shorten the amount of time cases are contagious and can also be used to prevent illness in those exposed. Understanding pertussis transmission is a key factor in decreasing pertussis infections. In Florida, transmission setting is not routinely identified for non-outbreak cases, resulting in 82% of cases reporting unknown setting in 2024. Pertussis Surveillance October 2023 to March 2024 October 2022 to March 2023 The average incidence rate was highest among <1 year olds at 0.775 cases per 100,000 population between October 2023 and March 2024. Infants experience the greatest burden of pertussis infections, not only in number of cases but also in severity. Infants <2 months old are too young to receive vaccinations against pertussis, which is why vaccination of parents, siblings, grandparents, and other age groups is important in infection prevention among infants. In 2024, over half of cases reported were not up-to-date on their pertussis vaccinations. In general, those who have received at least one pertussis vaccination have less severe outcomes than those who have never been vaccinated. If a person was born before January 1st, 1982, the current pertussis immunization recommendation would not have been implemented when they were receiving their childhood immunizations. Based on the case\u2019s age, 11 cases would not have been vaccinated under the current childhood immunization recommendations. Pertussis surveillance goals \u2022 Identify cases to limit transmission in settings with infants or others who may transmit pertussis to infants \u2022 Identify and prevent outbreaks \u2022 Identify transmission settings in non-outbreak cases to prevent the spread of sporadic cases \u2022 Identify contacts of cases and recommend appropriate prevention measures, including exclusion, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunization \u2022 Monitor the effectiveness of immunization programs and vaccines To learn more about pertussis, please visit FloridaHealth.gov/Pertussis. For more information on the data sources used in Florida for pertussis surveillance, see the last page of this report. National activity The number of pertussis cases gradually increased since the 1980s, peaking in 2012 at levels not seen since the 1950s. Since 2012, the number of pertussis cases started gradually decreasing. Pertussis incidence has remained highest among infants <1 year old and lowest among adults \u226520 years old since the 1990s. Pertussis Surveillance Meningococcal disease rates have been declining in Florida with more than 150 cases reported annually 25 years ago to 27 cases reported in 2021, as vaccination rates have increased. Rates of disease have been stable over the last 5 years with an exception to 2022. The number of reported meningococcal cases is higher in 2022 than previous years. The last time meningococcal cases exceeded 65 cases in a year was 2007 at 67 cases reported in 25 counties. *The white bars indicate the total number of cases as of March for each year March Key Points The number of meningococcal disease cases reported in March 2024 increased from the previous month and was above the previous 5 year average. Meningococcal Disease Surveillance 6 cases In 2024, 13 meningococcal disease cases were reported in 9 counties. 100% of cases not vaccinated for meningococcal disease. Vaccines can help prevent meningococcal disease. In March 2024, 100% of reported cases were not vaccinated for meningococcal disease. There are currently two types of meningococcal vaccines available in the United States: Meningococcal conjugate or MenACWY vaccines and Serogroup B meningococcal or MenB vaccines. Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) recommends meningococcal disease vaccination for all preteens and teens as well as other children and adults who are at increased risk of meningococcal disease. To learn more about the meningococcal vaccine, talk to your doctor or visit: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mening/public/index.html 24 cases in the past 6 months 0% of cases linked to other cases National and International activity Meningococcal disease rates are at a historic low in the United States. Rates have been declining since the 1990s and currently remain low. In 2021, there were about 210 total cases of meningococcal disease reported (incidence rate of 0.06 cases per 100,000 persons). Meningococcal outbreaks are rare in the United States and only about 1 in 20 cases is related to outbreaks. Meningococcal disease occurs worldwide. The highest incidence of disease is found in the \u2019meningitis belt\u2019 located in sub-Saharan Africa. This region experiences large-scale epidemics every 5 to 12 years. Epidemics during the dry season (December-June) reach up to 1,000 cases per 100,000 population. More information can be found at https:// www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/global.html Meningococcal disease surveillance goals \u2022 Identify cases to limit transmission and prevent outbreaks by implementing control measures \u2022 Collect data on key variables for monitoring meningococcal disease \u2022 Monitor effectiveness of immunization programs and vaccines In 2024, the meningococcal disease rate was highest among <1 years at 0.859 cases per 100,000 population. Meningococcal Disease Surveillance In 2024, among reported cases, 100% of reported cases were seen in the emergency department and 85% of reported cases were hospitalized. In 2024, 1 death was identified as being associated to meningococcal disease. The best protection against meningococcal disease is keeping up-to-date with recommended vaccines. Meningococcal disease can often be severe leading to inpatient hospitalization and sometimes death. According to the CDC, about 10 to 15 in 100 people with meningococcal disease will die. Up to 1 in 5 survivors will have long-term disabilities which may include: loss of limb/s, deafness, nervous system problems, brain damage. More information can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/clinical-info.html *The white bars indicate the total number of cases as of March for each year The number of varicella cases reported in March 2024 increased from the previous month and was above the previous 5-year average. Due to robust vaccination programs, there is no longer discernable seasonality for varicella cases in the United States. In March 2024, 106 varicella cases were reported in 17 counties, outlined in black in the map below. From January 2023 through March 2024 the average county rates varied throughout the state. Map 3 Varicella Surveillance March Key Points 106 cases Two new outbreaks In 2024*, 216 varicella cases were reported. The annual number of reported varicella cases increased from 2018 to 2019 and decreased significantly in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Cases reported in 2023 returned to levels similarly observed prior to the 2020 pandemic. *CDC MMWR report year 80% cases not up-to-date or unknown vaccination status In March, the varicella rate was highest among 1-5 year olds at 2.54 cases per 100,000 population. 1-5 year olds had the highest incidence Varicella Surveillance Household-associated Outbreak-associated Total cases National activity Varicella incidence decreased significantly following the vaccine becoming available in 1995 and has continued to decrease since 2006 when recommendations changed from 1 to 2 doses of varicella vaccine. From 2006 to 2015, all age groups had a substantial decrease in incidence with the largest decline in children aged 5 to 14 years. Although varicella is not reported to the CDC by all states, based on available data, the number of varicella cases nationally has steadily decreased each year from 2012 to 2015. Varicella surveillance goals \u2022 Identify and control outbreaks, monitor trends, and identify severe outcomes \u2022 Identify transmission settings in non-outbreak cases to prevent the spread of sporadic cases \u2022 Monitor effectiveness of immunization programs and vaccines To learn more about varicella, please visit FloridaHealth.gov/Varicella. For more information on the data sources used in Florida for varicella surveillance, see the last page of this report. In March, 9 cases were household-associated and 44 case were outbreak-associated. For most varicella cases, exposure to other known cases is not identified. In Florida, transmission setting is not routinely identified for non-outbreak cases resulting in 45% of cases reporting unknown setting in March. People with shingles infection can transmit the virus that causes varicella to people without immunity. In March, 10 cases reported contact with someone diagnosed with shingles during their exposure period. In March 2024, 80% of individuals reported with varicella had not received the recommended number of varicella vaccinations for their age or had unknown vaccination status. Vaccination against varicella is important for infants, children, teenagers, and adults. If a person was born before July 1, 1994, the current varicella immunization recommendation would not have been implemented when they were receiving their childhood immunizations. Based on the case\u2019s age, 45 cases in 2024 would not have been vaccinated under the current childhood immunization recommendations. In 2024, the majority of adults aged 19 years and older with varicella were not up-to-date on their varicella vaccinations or had unknown vaccination status. Although individuals who have been vaccinated can still develop varicella, complete and timely vaccination remains the best way to prevent varicella and severe complications. Case Data \u2022 Current case data are preliminary and will change as new information is gathered. The most recent data available are displayed in this report. \u2022 Case data is calculated using CDC MMWR Report Year. \u2022 Pertussis, varicella, hepatitis A and meningococcal disease are reportable diseases in Florida. Case information is documented by county health department (CHD) epidemiologists in Merlin, Florida\u2019s reportable disease surveillance system. \u2022 Only Florida residents are included in case counts, but contact investigations are conducted for all exposed individuals. \u2022 Pertussis, varicella, hepatitis A, and meningococcal disease case counts include both confirmed and probable cases. \u2022 Map counts and rates are determined by the individual\u2019s county of residence; these data do not take into account location of exposure. \u2022 CHD epidemiologists also report outbreaks of pertussis, varicella, hepatitis A, and meningococcal disease into Merlin. \uf0e0 Household-associated cases are defined as \u22652 cases exposed within the same household. \uf0e0 Pertussis outbreaks are defined as \u22652 cases associated with a specific setting outside of a household. \uf0e0 Varicella outbreaks are defined as \u22653 cases associated with a specific setting outside of a household. \uf0e0 An outbreak for meningococcal disease occurs when there are multiple cases of the same serogroup in community or institution over a short period of time.

A qualitative study was planned to understand the barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation program at rural and tribal areas. The study participants were medical officers from rural and tribal areas who actively planned and implemented COVID-19 vaccination at the primary health centre.\u00a0A total of 30 medical officers were interviewed.\u00a0Interview questions were focussed on the planning of COVID-19 vaccination in their area. Other questions were the problem faced during the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program and how it has been tackled.\nResults\nThe factors identified were grouped into three groups: Health system factors, Human resource factors and Community level factors.\u00a0Health system factors like shortage of vaccines and syringes, tablet paracetamol, online digital method of vaccination registration, overcrowding at the initial stage, and inadequate infrastructure were barriers to vaccination. Fear about vaccine adverse events, even in healthcare workers (HCWs), and overburdened healthcare workers were also factors affecting vaccination. At the community level, high resistance initially and misconception about the vaccine, and also the fear about post-vaccination side effects have an impact on the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural and tribal areas.\nConclusion\nThe successful vaccination rate among the population needs community leadership and a community-centred approach when conducting outreach and strengthening primary health care in terms of infrastructure, manpower, and capacity building of healthcare staff.\nKeywords: india, vaccination, outreach, barriers, facilitators, covid-19\nIntroduction\nOne of the greatest advancements in public health of the 20th century was the development of vaccines to prevent communicable diseases, which have prevented millions of deaths and saved billions of dollars [1]. Willingness to be vaccinated varies among individuals and groups based on various factors, including individual beliefs about vaccine safety and efficacy.\u00a0Every Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccination has been reported to cause reluctance, including delays in or outright rejection of the vaccines by some medical professionals [2,3].\nThe national policy includes a thorough, secure, and effective immunization effort. Successful vaccine awareness campaigns typically employ multiple strategies [4]. India set a goal to vaccinate 300 million people against COVID-19 by August 2021, the largest immunization program\u00a0ever. This challenge was announced on January 16, 2021. The homegrown vaccines made by Bharat Biotech, Covishield and Covaxin have been licensed for limited emergency use by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI)\u00a0[5]. India simultaneously planned COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in both urban and rural areas. The designated manpower, such as midwives, auxiliary nurses, etc., from all the states, who played a significant part in the healthcare of people in rural India, were trained in COVID-19 immunization. Midwives and auxiliary nurse midwives, who have a far broader reach in the interior and rural areas, were included in the first set of health workers educated in vaccination skills because India planned to have COVID-19 immunization programs in the urban and rural areas at the same time. The government utilized allied healthcare personnel, including pharmacists and public health professionals, to scale up a vaccination campaign. Primary health centres are in charge of effectively implementing the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural areas [6]. So, the study was planned to seek insight into the challenges faced by health personnel in the effective implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program.\nMaterials and methods\nA qualitative study was planned to understand the barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation program at rural and tribal areas.\u00a0Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of Government Medical College Akola (MH). The study was conducted in a rural area of Akola district, which lies in the western parts of Maharashtra State and belongs to the Vidarbha region, and is said to be one of the progressive districts in the region. The district has one municipal corporation (Akola Municipal Corporation), six municipalities (Murtizapur; Akot; Balapur; Patur; Telhara and Barshitakli) and 535 Gram panchayat (Total 864 villages). According to the 2011 Census, the district has a total population of 18,13,906, comprising 10,94,165 persons in rural areas and 7,19,741 persons in urban areas accounting for 1.6 percent of the total population of the State [7].\u00a0In Akola district, there are 30 primary health centres and 178 subcentres.\nThe study participants were medical officers from rural and tribal areas who actively planned and implemented COVID-19 vaccination at the primary health centre.\u00a0A total of 30 medical officers were interviewed.\u00a0Informed consent was taken from each participant. Each subject gave their informed consent. The Government Medical College (GMC) Akola Institutional Ethics Committee approved the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in person between September 2021 and December 2021.\u00a0All participants were asked regarding problems faced during the implementation of COVID-19 vaccination in their area.\u00a0Interview questions included: (1) How do you plan for COVID vaccination in your area? (2) What are the problems faced during COVID vaccination?\u00a0(3) What measures had been taken to solve the problems? (4) What measures will you suggest to implement COVID vaccination in your area successfully?\u00a0The interviews lasted 20 to 30 minutes and were conducted in the participants' preferred language (Hindi, Marathi, or English). A brief introduction and explanation of the study goals opened the session. Confidentiality was maintained to all participants. Participants were made aware of the existence of no right or wrong responses. Participants were welcomed to express their opinions on the effective implementation and difficulties encountered with the COVID vaccine.\nTranscripts of all recordings were created. Two researchers independently read the transcripts before using descriptive words or phrases to code them. Then, areas of interest were assigned to the coded transcripts, and developing themes were described. Review and editing were done on these emergent topics as well as sample transcripts that had been coded. A written presentation of the data is used whenever necessary to highlight study findings with quotes.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nA total of 30 medical officers involved in COVID vaccination working at the primary health centres (PHCs) were interviewed.\u00a0Twelve individuals (12 [40%] women; mean [SD] age, 45.04 [6.9] years) participated (Table 1). Twenty-three (76.7%) participants had work experience of more than five years at PHC in a rural area.\u00a0A total of 16 (53.3%) medical officers held MBBS degrees.\nTable 1. Characteristics of study participants.\nBarriers and facilitators in COVID vaccination\nThe factors identified were grouped into three groups: Health system factors, Human resource factors and Community level factors.\nHealth system factors\nIn the initial phase of the mass COVID-19 vaccination program, the barrier to implementation was a shortage of vaccine supply. The basic requirements to conduct an effective vaccination session, like space, manpower, vaccine stock, syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc. were not available initially. One key respondent mentioned that \u201cPeople unnecessarily argued for the non-availability of vaccine and created a panic situation that was difficult to handle by us. So we took help from the police department.\u201d\nRural or illiterate people did not prefer the online digital method of vaccination registration. Additionally, the network issue for registration was also one of the barriers to vaccination.\n\u201cDue to compulsory online registration for vaccination, people keep postponing for it.\u201d\nThe respondent also mentioned about the inconvenience to the people due to overcrowding highlighting the inadequate infrastructure as a barrier to vaccination.\nHuman resource factors\nRespondent mentioned that initially there was fear about vaccine adverse events even among healthcare workers.\n\u201cInitially there was fear about vaccine adverse events even among healthcare workers which led to misconception and rejection for vaccination.\u201d\nMost respondents referred to the general shortage of health personnel as a barrier to vaccination. The deficit in human resources affected the vaccination program and overburdened the healthcare workers; it affected non-COVID activities like Universal Immunization Programme, Antenatal check-ups, Field visits, etc.\u00a0One respondent mentioned that, due to a shortage of manpower in some facilities only one health worker has to perform various tasks in vaccination such as registration, counselling of clients and administration of vaccine.\n\u201cThere should be proactive involvement of other than health department like for registration, teachers from primary school should be involved. Such involvement should not be on paper but actually on the field.\u201d\nThe poor attitude among health care workers and lack of commitment due to everyday daily vaccination sessions also were reported to impact negatively on the implementation of the program. Lack of appreciation from higher authority and no additional incentives for staff involved in vaccination was also the barrier observed in the study. Regular training creates awareness among staff. Review from higher authority, especially bureaucrats under the disaster management act, also has an impact on the vaccination program.\nCommunity level factors\nRespondents also discussed the attitude of the community towards vaccination.\u00a0Most respondents viewed the misconception about the vaccine seen to undermine the delivery of COVID vaccine.\u00a0Respondents stated that there was high resistance initially and misconception about the vaccine particularly.\u00a0Misconception and superstitious behaviour about the vaccine is present in some communities like Muslims, Buddhist so half of the population of villages is unvaccinated.\u00a0Healthcare staff also faced high reluctance to vaccination in tribal areas. In Akola district, there were pockets of tribal populations; these populations were also not ready to take vaccines initially due to fear and mistrust.\nOne respondent said that:\n\u201cIn a few villages, people\u00a0were not ready to take the COVID vaccine, only after involving leaders from villages like Sarpanch and house-to-house counselling by Healthcare staff motivated the people for vaccination.\u201d\nMisconception and myths about the adverse outcome of the vaccine was a major barrier at the community level. The people were very hesitant and had a phobia about the side effects of vaccination. Pregnant women were also unwilling to take the COVID vaccination due to fear of side effects.\u00a0One respondent has mentioned that:\n\u201cInitially, people were unaware of the safety of vaccines. People had various misbeliefs about the efficacy and safety of vaccine like an increase in death rate after vaccination.\u201d\nSome respondents stated that vaccination session timing was not feasible, so people didn\u2019t prefer to lose their daily wages for vaccine.\n\u201cIn rural areas, in the afternoon, people go to the field, which is more preferred than taking the vaccine, so we can\u2019t cover the total population.\u201d\nPost-vaccination side effects like fever, headache, and myalgia created fear among unvaccinated people.\nDiscussion\nThis qualitative study explored barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural and tribal blocks of Akola district.\u00a0The findings highlighted in our study were classified at three levels: health system, human resource and community.\u00a0There were several administrative barriers during the initial phase of the COVID pandemic. India is a big country with disparities in health literacy, access to care, and risk perception among the general public by area [7]. The basic requirements to conduct an effective vaccination session like space, manpower, vaccine stock, syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc. were not available initially. In the initial phase, online digital registration for COVID-19 vaccination and internet or mobile network issues in rural areas were critical issues for illiterate people in rural areas. Vaccinating the whole population was challenging even though the country has the largest vaccine-producing units [8]. More than 2.4 billion doses of the vaccine are produced in India each year, in addition to a variety of surgical and medical disposables such as vials, stoppers, syringes, gauze, and alcohol swabs. However, because this necessitates adhering to very strict temperature guidelines, the first barrier was the storage and delivery of the vaccinations until the inoculation sessions [9]. Representatives from the Government of India (GOI) claim that the current healthcare system may not need more personnel to administer the vaccine to healthcare professionals [9].\nIn relation to WHO standards, India's health worker density continues to be low. In addition to the scarcity, it is extremely difficult to keep skilled health workers in rural and neglected areas [7]. In our study, the general shortage of health personnel and overburdening the healthcare workers affected non-COVID activities like Universal Immunization Programme, Antenatal Care Check-ups, field visits, etc. The frontline HCWs (FLHCWs) were particularly susceptible to increased work stress for a variety of reasons, such as having to work under stressful conditions because of rapidly changing guidelines, the inevitable need to be deployed to new settings and high-risk areas, the lack of adequate technical and human resources, and the worry that they might infect their families after work with COVID-19 [6]. In our study, fear about vaccine\u00a0adverse events even among healthcare workers (HCWs) was also a reason behind the effective implementation of the COVID vaccination program.\nA review by Biswas et al. indicated that 22.51% of 76,471 HCWs\u00a0worldwide reported COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy. Their main concerns with the vaccine were potential side effects (60%), safety (48%), and how well it works (30%). HCWs in this review also found higher vaccine acceptance in Whites and Asians [10]. A study conducted by Fu et al. on Chinese healthcare workers found that about 50% were unwilling to accept COVID-19 vaccination [11]. However, a study by Saudi healthcare workers\u00a0Magadmi and\u00a0Kamel\u00a0displayed hesitancy toward vaccination [12]. Medical professionals showed a high level of vaccine scepticism, according to Dror et al. [2]. Concerns about the safety of a quickly created vaccine were raised by several respondents who did not follow the recommendations for vaccines. In contrast, individuals who believed they had a higher risk of sickness showed greater vaccine acceptance [2].\nThe poor attitude among healthcare workers and lack of commitment due to daily vaccination sessions were also reported to impact the program's implementation negatively. Lack of appreciation from higher authority and no additional incentives for staff involved in vaccination was also the barrier observed in the study. Regular training creates awareness among staff. Review from higher authority, especially bureaucrats under the disaster management act, also has an impact on the vaccination program.\u00a0Rao and\u00a0Chowdhury also mentioned that frontline workers across the country were the backbone of the Indian public health system [13]. They were underpaid, undervalued, and alienated without any state support or protection. Workloads were raised during the COVID epidemic. The lack of medical insurance, proper governmental support, decreased physical and mental health, and delayed payments all contributed to the financial vulnerability that the healthcare workforce was experiencing [13].\nIn our study, it was observed that misconception and superstitious behaviour about vaccines were present in some communities like Muslim\u00a0and Buddhist so half of the population of villages is unvaccinated.\u00a0Healthcare staff also faced high reluctance to vaccination in tribal areas in the tribal block. The people were very hesitant and had a phobia about the side effects of vaccination [14,15]. Dutta et al. mentioned that various studies have identified myriad factors related to vaccination refusal and hesitancy, including refusal for religious, social, and philosophical reasons, lack of trust in vaccine providers and others, and fear of vaccines and adverse outcomes following immunization [16]. At the same time, King et al. mentioned that mandatory vaccination requirements must be planned with great care; there is no reason to think they are incompatible with human rights law [17]. So there is a need to create awareness regarding vaccination in the community. Vaccination session timing was not feasible for some people, so they didn\u2019t prefer to lose their daily wages for vaccines.\nThe limitation of our study is that findings cannot be extended to wider area populations with the same degree of certainty as the research findings are not tested statistically. In our study, we focussed on the understanding and explanation of the dynamics of the implementation of COVID vaccination in rural areas, but we haven\u2019t quantified the coverage and issues. This can be better answered with further research with a mixed-method approach.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, our findings were enablers and barriers for COVID-19 vaccination programs in rural and tribal areas.\u00a0Health system factors like shortage of vaccines and syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc., online digital method of vaccination registration and overcrowding at the initial stage, and inadequate infrastructure were a barrier to vaccination.\u00a0Fear about vaccine adverse events even in healthcare workers and overburdened healthcare workers were also factors affecting vaccination. At the community level, high resistance initially, misconception about the vaccine, and fear about post-vaccination side effects impact the COVID-19 vaccine program in rural and tribal areas.\u00a0The successful vaccination rate among the population needs community leadership and a community-centred approach when conducting outreach and strengthening primary health care in terms of infrastructure, manpower, and healthcare staff capacity building.\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nHuman Ethics\nConsent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.

Health insurance is compulsory, but people with an income above a fixed threshold or belonging to a particular professional group (e.g. self-employed people or civil servants) can opt out of SHI coverage and enrol in (substitutive) private health insurance (PHI). About 11 % of the population are covered by PHI; 89 % by SHI. Although coverage is universal for all legal residents and only 0.1 % of the population do not have health insurance, there are still gaps due to financial or administrative barriers (see Section 5.2). The multi-payer SHI system currently consists of 103 sickness funds and 41 PHI companies, and the three biggest sickness funds cover more than one third of the German population.\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cIn Germany, 88\u00a0percent of the population is covered by statutory health insurance, which is financed by financially and organizationally independent statutory health insurance funds, and 9\u00a0percent of the population is privately insured.15\u00a0The guiding principle of the German statutory health insurance system is solidarity regarding both income and provision of services: All insured people contribute a share of their income, irrespective of their health risk, and people are entitled to benefits according to their health needs, irrespective of their socioeconomic status, ability to pay, or location.16\u00a0All employed people earning less than the opt-out threshold, people receiving welfare benefits, and pensioners have mandatory statutory health insurance, and their nonearning dependents are insured free of charge. People with high income and self-employed people can purchase private health insurance or keep the statutory health insurance. Coverage of services is roughly the same in both systems, apart from certain newly launched drugs, which are paid for by private insurance. There is no restriction on patients\u2019 choice of hospitals, and patient copays for hospital stays do not differ across hospitals.\u201d\nSource: Esra Eren Bayindir\u00a0and\u00a0Jonas Schrey\u00f6gg. Public Reporting Of Hospital Quality Measures Has Not Led To Overall Quality Improvement: Evidence From Germany. Health Affairs\u00a02023\u00a042:4,\u00a0566-574\n\u201cThe German health system has a complex governance structure. The federal government defines only the legal framework, while regulatory details are specified in directives issued by the Federal Joint Committee \u2013 the highest self-governing decision-making body in the country. The Committee consists of representatives of associations of sickness funds, physicians, dentists and hospitals, as well as three independent members (plus patient representatives without voting rights). It takes decisions on SHI benefits, reimbursement systems and quality assurance.\u201cThe states (Bundesl\u00e4nder) supervise the self-governing bodies at the regional level and are responsible for hospital planning and investments, as well as medical education. They are also responsible for public health services and the running of public health offices, which gained in importance during the COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, the crisis revealed the challenges faced by federal systems in coordinating and managing the pandemic. Governance mechanisms have been put in place to enable rapid, cross-state measures to respond to the crisis through ordinance authorisations, particularly by the Federal Ministry of Health (Box 1).\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cThe German system provides universal population coverage either through social health insurance (SHI) (almost 90% of the population) or substitutive VHI [Voluntary Health Insurance]. As OOP [Out-Of-Pocket] policies of substitutive VHI vary widely (and data is largely unavailable), we focus on SHI. OOP spending in Germany is related to both direct payments for services not covered by SHI (e.g., over-the-counter drugs) and cost-sharing for SHI covered services, but the relative importance of cost-sharing versus direct payments is not known because of the health system\u2019s accounting methods. OOP spending above reference prices for dental care and medical aids can be substantial; for example, reference prices for dental care cover only about 50% of the costs of standard care. Cost-sharing requirements increased in 2004 for such things as prescription drugs, inpatient care, and physician and dental care, while at the same time adult eyeglasses were excluded from coverage. Since these increased requirements became effective in 2004 they do not affect the average growth rate in the 2004\u20132014 period and therefore do not contradict the observed drop in average growth in 2004\u20132014 compared to the 1994\u20132004 period. The most plausible explanation for the low growth in this period is the fact that in 2013, co-payments for physician visits were discontinued. The most important protection mechanism against OOPs is the exemption of children under 18\u00a0years of age and a maximum cost-sharing limit of 2% of annual income (or 1% for patients with severe chronic conditions). This has remained largely unchanged over the study period.\u201d\nRice, Thomas et al. \u201cRevisiting out-of-pocket requirements: trends in spending, financial access barriers, and policy in ten high-income countries.\u201d BMC health services research vol. 18,1 371. 18 May. 2018, doi:10.1186/s12913-018-3185-8.\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German federal government recently orchestrated a fundamental change to its public health infrastructure. This reconstruction centers around the founding of a National Institute for Prevention and Education in Medicine (Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Pr\u00e4vention und Aufkl\u00e4rung in der Medizin, BIPAM) at the cost of two federal institutions, the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) and the Federal Center for Health Education (Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, BzGA). Thus, the Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit, BMG) plans to dissolve the BzGA and integrate its personnel into the future BIPAM. Further, all RKI research and surveillance activities related to non-communicable diseases, including AI methods development will be transferred into the BIPAM. The RKI responsibilities will solely focus on infectious diseases. According to announced plans of the BMG the primary objective for establishing the BIPAM is to address non-communicable diseases and enhance overall population health. However, the medical specialist training for public health remains non-academic at a state institution. Simultaneously the BMG already replaced two thirds of experts of the permanent commission on vaccination (St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission, STIKO) and determined new procedures for appointing future expert commissioners. With these changes, Germany embarks on an extraordinary reshuffling of its national public health organizations and responsibilities, by fundamentally separating all issues around non-communicable diseases from those of infectious diseases. Germany\u2019s unraveled research tasks of public health authorities however remains unmet. Thus, 2024 marks a pivotal caesura for public health in the modern history of Germany.\u201d\nSource: Savaskan N, Lampl BMJ, Yavuz M, Tinnemann P. Germany\u2019s national public health gets reorganized: A new institute shall take center stage.\u00a0Health Policy. 2024;145:105084. doi:10.1016/j.healthpol.2024.105084\n\u201cThe German health system and its governance is highly complex. It is the only country in Europe with coexisting SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] and substitutive PHI [Private Health Insurance]. Both schemes are separated along different organizational, regulative and financial lines (Figure 2.1). Care sectors are also separated in terms of organization, governance and financing. Due to separate legislation for individual sectors within public health, ambulatory and inpatient care, as well as in long-term care, there is strong fragmentation of service provision (Figures 2.1 and 2.2).\u201cHealth insurance is compulsory for all citizens and permanent residents, with SHI constituting the main source of financing health care. The multi-payer SHI insurance scheme covered 72.8 million people or 87.7% of the population in 2018. Employees above an opt-out threshold of income, \u20ac 62 550 in 2020, and certain professional groups, e.g. self-employed or civil servants, can opt to enroll in substitutive PHI. Thus, 8.7 million people (or 10.5% of the population) were covered by substitutive PHI (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit (BMG), 2019d; Statistisches Bundesamt, 2019b; Verband der privaten Krankenversicherung, 2019a) (see Section 3.3.1 Coverage for more detail). Another unique feature of the German health care system is that the vast majority of providers serve both insured populations. The few exemptions that are accessible only to those insured under substitutive PHI represent less than 1% of total hospitals in 2018 (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2020g).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i\u2013273.\n\u201cHealth insurance coverage is mandatory for the entire population. Coverage is virtually universal and less than 1% of the population is not insured. Some groups of people can choose between publicly financed coverage provided through the statutory health insurance scheme and privately financed substitutive coverage provided by private insurers. Access to substitutive private coverage is restricted to civil servants, self-employed individuals and high-income employees (the annual earnings threshold was \u20ac50,850 in 2012). These groups may opt out of the statutory scheme, but once they do so the return options are limited. For example, employees may only return to the statutory scheme when their earnings fall below the threshold. Individuals with substitutive private coverage who are older than 55 years are prohibited from returning to the statutory scheme.\u201d\nSource: Stefan Gre\u00df. \u201cGermany.\u201d In Voluntary health insurance in Europe: Country experience [Internet].

Health Econ Policy Law. 2010, 5 (3): 251-67. 10.1017/S1744133110000022.\n\u201cThe German health care system is notable for two essential characteristics: 1) the sharing of decision-making powers between states, federal government, and self-regulated organizations of payers and providers; and 2) the separation of SHI (including the social LTCI) and PHI (including the private LTCI). SHI and PHI (as well as the two long-term care insurance systems) use the same providers\u2014that is, hospitals and physicians treat both statutorily and privately insured patients, unlike those in many other countries.\u201cWithin the legal framework set by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Joint Committee has wide-ranging regulatory power to determine the services to be covered by sickness funds and to set quality measures for providers (see below). To the extent possible, coverage decisions are based on evidence from health technology assessments and comparative-effectiveness reviews. The Federal Joint Committee is supported by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency (IQWiG), a foundation legally charged with evaluating the cost-effectiveness of drugs with added therapeutic benefits, and the Institute for Quality and Transparency (IQTiG), which is responsible for intersectoral quality assurance. It has 13 voting members: five from the Federal Association of Sickness Funds, two each from the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation, one from the Federal Association of SHI Dentists, and three who are unaffiliated. Five patient representatives have an advisory role but no vote. Representatives of patient organizations have the right to participate in different decision-making bodies\u2014for example, the subcommittees of the Federal Joint Committee.\u201cThe Federal Association of Sickness Funds works with the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation to develop the SHI ambulatory care fee schedule and the DRG catalogue, which are then adopted by bilateral joint committees.\u201d\nSource: Commonwealth Fund.

Last accessed Sept. 30, 2019.  \n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health (\u201cBundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit\u201d \u2013 BMG) is responsible for policy-making at the federal level. Its tasks include developing laws and drawing up administrative guidelines for the self-governing activities within the health care system. The Ministry of Health directs a number of institutions and agencies responsible for dealing with higher-level issues of public health, such as the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (\u201cBundesinstitut f\u00fcr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte\u201d \u2013 BfArM) and the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices makes decisions concerning the approval of pharmaceuticals. The Paul Ehrlich Institute is responsible for approving vaccines.\u201cWhen it comes to matters concerning statutory health insurance, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) is the highest decision-making body within the self-governing health care system. It includes members representing doctors, dentists, psychotherapists, the statutory insurers, hospitals and patients. As the central entity of federal-level self-governance, the Federal Joint Committee makes decisions concerning which medical services will be covered by the statutory insurers and what form that coverage will take.\u201d\nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

In addition to these four pillar organizations, patient representatives also participate in all sessions; they are entitled to put topics on the agenda, but not to vote.\u201d\nSource: The Federal Joint Committee: Who we are and what we do. Gemeinsame Bundesausschuss (Federal Joint Committee). Last accessed September 30, 2019.\n\u201cThe framework for health care in Germany is based on central decision making:\u201c1) Legislation established by the parliament,\u201c2) Decrees issued by the Ministry of Health,\u201c3) Directives issued by the G-BA under supervision of the ministry, and\u201c4) Contracts between self-governing organizations under supervision of the ministry.\u201cThere is no competition on products on services between the funds. All provide the same services as defined by the G-BA (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) or the different umbrella organizations of the SHFs (referred to in the following the Statutory Health Insurer\u2019s organizations (SHIs). Private insurance covers nearly the same services but allows additional benefits (e.g. first class service) \u2013 there is competition between private insurers. Since 2004, decision-making in statutory health insurance has been integrated into a trans-sector federal joint committee that is supported by an independent institute for quality and efficiency in health care, the German IQWiG. Since 2008, according to the new Competition Enhancement Act, the IQWiG has to evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of pharmaceuticals in Germany based on international accepted guidelines in evidence based medicine and in health economics.\u201d\nSource: ISPOR\u2014The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research.

Last accessed Oct. 2, 2019.\n\u201cThe German health care system is divided into three main areas: outpatient care, inpatient care (the hospital sector), and rehabilitation facilities.\u201cThe institutions responsible for running the health care system include the associations and representatives of various providers and professions, health insurers, regulatory bodies, the Federal Ministry of Health, patient organizations and self-help groups.\u201cThe basic principles of the health care system\u201cThe health care system in Germany is based on four basic principles:\u201cCompulsory insurance: Everyone must have statutory health insurance (\u201cgesetzliche Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 GKV) provided that their gross earnings are under a fixed limit (\u201cVersicherungspflichtgrenze\u201d). Anyone who earns more than that can choose to have private insurance (\u201cprivate Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 PKV).\u201cFunding through insurance premiums: Health care is financed mostly from the premiums paid by insured employees and their employers. Tax revenue surpluses also contribute. To give you an idea of what this means: State-funded health care systems like those in Great Britain or Sweden draw on tax revenue. In market-oriented systems such as that in the United States, many people have to carry the costs of treatment and loss of earnings due to illness themselves, or have to get private health insurance.\u201cPrinciple of solidarity: In the German health care system, statutory health insurance members jointly carry the individual risks of the costs of medical care in the event of illness. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care and continued payment of wages when ill \u2013 regardless of their income and premium level. The premiums are based on income. This means that the rich can help the poor, and the healthy can help the ill. However, these premiums are only calculated based on a percentage scale up to a certain income level (\u201cBeitragsbemessungsgrenze\u201d). Anyone earning more than this amount pays the same maximum premium.\u201cPrinciple of self-governance: While the German state sets the conditions for medical care, the further organization and financing of individual medical services is the responsibility of the self-governing bodies within the health care system. These are made up of members representing doctors and dentists, psychotherapists, hospitals, insurers and the insured people. The Federal Joint Committee (\u201cGemeinsamer Bundesausschuss\u201d or G-BA \u2013 please also see below: \u201cStructure and institutions of the health care system\u201d) is the highest entity of self-governance within the statutory health insurance system.\u201d \nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

Public coverage includes both national health systems and social health insurance. On national health systems, most of the financing comes from general taxation, whereas in social health insurance systems, financing typically comes from a combination of payroll contributions and taxation. Financing is linked to ability-to-pay. Primary private health insurance refers to insurance coverage for a core set of services, and can be voluntary or mandatory by law (for some or all of the population.\u201d\nSource: OECD (2021), Health at a Glance 2021: OECD Indicators, OECD Publishing, Paris, https://doi.org/10.1787/ae3016b9-en.\nCurrent Health Expenditure As Percentage Of Gross Domestic Product, 2020: 12.82%\nSource: Global Health Observatory.

Health insurance is compulsory, but people with an income above a fixed threshold or belonging to a particular professional group (e.g. self-employed people or civil servants) can opt out of SHI coverage and enrol in (substitutive) private health insurance (PHI). About 11 % of the population are covered by PHI; 89 % by SHI. Although coverage is universal for all legal residents and only 0.1 % of the population do not have health insurance, there are still gaps due to financial or administrative barriers (see Section 5.2). The multi-payer SHI system currently consists of 103 sickness funds and 41 PHI companies, and the three biggest sickness funds cover more than one third of the German population.\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cIn Germany, 88\u00a0percent of the population is covered by statutory health insurance, which is financed by financially and organizationally independent statutory health insurance funds, and 9\u00a0percent of the population is privately insured.15\u00a0The guiding principle of the German statutory health insurance system is solidarity regarding both income and provision of services: All insured people contribute a share of their income, irrespective of their health risk, and people are entitled to benefits according to their health needs, irrespective of their socioeconomic status, ability to pay, or location.16\u00a0All employed people earning less than the opt-out threshold, people receiving welfare benefits, and pensioners have mandatory statutory health insurance, and their nonearning dependents are insured free of charge. People with high income and self-employed people can purchase private health insurance or keep the statutory health insurance. Coverage of services is roughly the same in both systems, apart from certain newly launched drugs, which are paid for by private insurance. There is no restriction on patients\u2019 choice of hospitals, and patient copays for hospital stays do not differ across hospitals.\u201d\nSource: Esra Eren Bayindir\u00a0and\u00a0Jonas Schrey\u00f6gg. Public Reporting Of Hospital Quality Measures Has Not Led To Overall Quality Improvement: Evidence From Germany. Health Affairs\u00a02023\u00a042:4,\u00a0566-574\n\u201cThe German health system has a complex governance structure. The federal government defines only the legal framework, while regulatory details are specified in directives issued by the Federal Joint Committee \u2013 the highest self-governing decision-making body in the country. The Committee consists of representatives of associations of sickness funds, physicians, dentists and hospitals, as well as three independent members (plus patient representatives without voting rights). It takes decisions on SHI benefits, reimbursement systems and quality assurance.\u201cThe states (Bundesl\u00e4nder) supervise the self-governing bodies at the regional level and are responsible for hospital planning and investments, as well as medical education. They are also responsible for public health services and the running of public health offices, which gained in importance during the COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, the crisis revealed the challenges faced by federal systems in coordinating and managing the pandemic. Governance mechanisms have been put in place to enable rapid, cross-state measures to respond to the crisis through ordinance authorisations, particularly by the Federal Ministry of Health (Box 1).\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cThe German system provides universal population coverage either through social health insurance (SHI) (almost 90% of the population) or substitutive VHI [Voluntary Health Insurance]. As OOP [Out-Of-Pocket] policies of substitutive VHI vary widely (and data is largely unavailable), we focus on SHI. OOP spending in Germany is related to both direct payments for services not covered by SHI (e.g., over-the-counter drugs) and cost-sharing for SHI covered services, but the relative importance of cost-sharing versus direct payments is not known because of the health system\u2019s accounting methods. OOP spending above reference prices for dental care and medical aids can be substantial; for example, reference prices for dental care cover only about 50% of the costs of standard care. Cost-sharing requirements increased in 2004 for such things as prescription drugs, inpatient care, and physician and dental care, while at the same time adult eyeglasses were excluded from coverage. Since these increased requirements became effective in 2004 they do not affect the average growth rate in the 2004\u20132014 period and therefore do not contradict the observed drop in average growth in 2004\u20132014 compared to the 1994\u20132004 period. The most plausible explanation for the low growth in this period is the fact that in 2013, co-payments for physician visits were discontinued. The most important protection mechanism against OOPs is the exemption of children under 18\u00a0years of age and a maximum cost-sharing limit of 2% of annual income (or 1% for patients with severe chronic conditions). This has remained largely unchanged over the study period.\u201d\nRice, Thomas et al. \u201cRevisiting out-of-pocket requirements: trends in spending, financial access barriers, and policy in ten high-income countries.\u201d BMC health services research vol. 18,1 371. 18 May. 2018, doi:10.1186/s12913-018-3185-8.\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German federal government recently orchestrated a fundamental change to its public health infrastructure. This reconstruction centers around the founding of a National Institute for Prevention and Education in Medicine (Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Pr\u00e4vention und Aufkl\u00e4rung in der Medizin, BIPAM) at the cost of two federal institutions, the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) and the Federal Center for Health Education (Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, BzGA). Thus, the Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit, BMG) plans to dissolve the BzGA and integrate its personnel into the future BIPAM. Further, all RKI research and surveillance activities related to non-communicable diseases, including AI methods development will be transferred into the BIPAM. The RKI responsibilities will solely focus on infectious diseases. According to announced plans of the BMG the primary objective for establishing the BIPAM is to address non-communicable diseases and enhance overall population health. However, the medical specialist training for public health remains non-academic at a state institution. Simultaneously the BMG already replaced two thirds of experts of the permanent commission on vaccination (St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission, STIKO) and determined new procedures for appointing future expert commissioners. With these changes, Germany embarks on an extraordinary reshuffling of its national public health organizations and responsibilities, by fundamentally separating all issues around non-communicable diseases from those of infectious diseases. Germany\u2019s unraveled research tasks of public health authorities however remains unmet. Thus, 2024 marks a pivotal caesura for public health in the modern history of Germany.\u201d\nSource: Savaskan N, Lampl BMJ, Yavuz M, Tinnemann P.

It is the only country in Europe with coexisting SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] and substitutive PHI [Private Health Insurance]. Both schemes are separated along different organizational, regulative and financial lines (Figure 2.1). Care sectors are also separated in terms of organization, governance and financing. Due to separate legislation for individual sectors within public health, ambulatory and inpatient care, as well as in long-term care, there is strong fragmentation of service provision (Figures 2.1 and 2.2).\u201cHealth insurance is compulsory for all citizens and permanent residents, with SHI constituting the main source of financing health care. The multi-payer SHI insurance scheme covered 72.8 million people or 87.7% of the population in 2018. Employees above an opt-out threshold of income, \u20ac 62 550 in 2020, and certain professional groups, e.g. self-employed or civil servants, can opt to enroll in substitutive PHI. Thus, 8.7 million people (or 10.5% of the population) were covered by substitutive PHI (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit (BMG), 2019d; Statistisches Bundesamt, 2019b; Verband der privaten Krankenversicherung, 2019a) (see Section 3.3.1 Coverage for more detail). Another unique feature of the German health care system is that the vast majority of providers serve both insured populations. The few exemptions that are accessible only to those insured under substitutive PHI represent less than 1% of total hospitals in 2018 (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2020g).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i\u2013273.\n\u201cHealth insurance coverage is mandatory for the entire population. Coverage is virtually universal and less than 1% of the population is not insured. Some groups of people can choose between publicly financed coverage provided through the statutory health insurance scheme and privately financed substitutive coverage provided by private insurers. Access to substitutive private coverage is restricted to civil servants, self-employed individuals and high-income employees (the annual earnings threshold was \u20ac50,850 in 2012). These groups may opt out of the statutory scheme, but once they do so the return options are limited. For example, employees may only return to the statutory scheme when their earnings fall below the threshold. Individuals with substitutive private coverage who are older than 55 years are prohibited from returning to the statutory scheme.\u201d\nSource: Stefan Gre\u00df. \u201cGermany.\u201d In Voluntary health insurance in Europe: Country experience [Internet].

SHI and PHI (as well as the two long-term care insurance systems) use the same providers\u2014that is, hospitals and physicians treat both statutorily and privately insured patients, unlike those in many other countries.\u201cWithin the legal framework set by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Joint Committee has wide-ranging regulatory power to determine the services to be covered by sickness funds and to set quality measures for providers (see below). To the extent possible, coverage decisions are based on evidence from health technology assessments and comparative-effectiveness reviews. The Federal Joint Committee is supported by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency (IQWiG), a foundation legally charged with evaluating the cost-effectiveness of drugs with added therapeutic benefits, and the Institute for Quality and Transparency (IQTiG), which is responsible for intersectoral quality assurance. It has 13 voting members: five from the Federal Association of Sickness Funds, two each from the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation, one from the Federal Association of SHI Dentists, and three who are unaffiliated. Five patient representatives have an advisory role but no vote. Representatives of patient organizations have the right to participate in different decision-making bodies\u2014for example, the subcommittees of the Federal Joint Committee.\u201cThe Federal Association of Sickness Funds works with the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation to develop the SHI ambulatory care fee schedule and the DRG catalogue, which are then adopted by bilateral joint committees.\u201d\nSource: Commonwealth Fund.

Its tasks include developing laws and drawing up administrative guidelines for the self-governing activities within the health care system. The Ministry of Health directs a number of institutions and agencies responsible for dealing with higher-level issues of public health, such as the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (\u201cBundesinstitut f\u00fcr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte\u201d \u2013 BfArM) and the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices makes decisions concerning the approval of pharmaceuticals. The Paul Ehrlich Institute is responsible for approving vaccines.\u201cWhen it comes to matters concerning statutory health insurance, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) is the highest decision-making body within the self-governing health care system. It includes members representing doctors, dentists, psychotherapists, the statutory insurers, hospitals and patients.

In addition to these four pillar organizations, patient representatives also participate in all sessions; they are entitled to put topics on the agenda, but not to vote.\u201d\nSource: The Federal Joint Committee: Who we are and what we do. Gemeinsame Bundesausschuss (Federal Joint Committee). Last accessed September 30, 2019.\n\u201cThe framework for health care in Germany is based on central decision making:\u201c1) Legislation established by the parliament,\u201c2) Decrees issued by the Ministry of Health,\u201c3) Directives issued by the G-BA under supervision of the ministry, and\u201c4) Contracts between self-governing organizations under supervision of the ministry.\u201cThere is no competition on products on services between the funds. All provide the same services as defined by the G-BA (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) or the different umbrella organizations of the SHFs (referred to in the following the Statutory Health Insurer\u2019s organizations (SHIs). Private insurance covers nearly the same services but allows additional benefits (e.g. first class service) \u2013 there is competition between private insurers. Since 2004, decision-making in statutory health insurance has been integrated into a trans-sector federal joint committee that is supported by an independent institute for quality and efficiency in health care, the German IQWiG. Since 2008, according to the new Competition Enhancement Act, the IQWiG has to evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of pharmaceuticals in Germany based on international accepted guidelines in evidence based medicine and in health economics.\u201d\nSource: ISPOR\u2014The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research.

Last accessed Oct. 2, 2019.\n\u201cThe German health care system is divided into three main areas: outpatient care, inpatient care (the hospital sector), and rehabilitation facilities.\u201cThe institutions responsible for running the health care system include the associations and representatives of various providers and professions, health insurers, regulatory bodies, the Federal Ministry of Health, patient organizations and self-help groups.\u201cThe basic principles of the health care system\u201cThe health care system in Germany is based on four basic principles:\u201cCompulsory insurance: Everyone must have statutory health insurance (\u201cgesetzliche Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 GKV) provided that their gross earnings are under a fixed limit (\u201cVersicherungspflichtgrenze\u201d). Anyone who earns more than that can choose to have private insurance (\u201cprivate Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 PKV).\u201cFunding through insurance premiums: Health care is financed mostly from the premiums paid by insured employees and their employers. Tax revenue surpluses also contribute. To give you an idea of what this means: State-funded health care systems like those in Great Britain or Sweden draw on tax revenue. In market-oriented systems such as that in the United States, many people have to carry the costs of treatment and loss of earnings due to illness themselves, or have to get private health insurance.\u201cPrinciple of solidarity: In the German health care system, statutory health insurance members jointly carry the individual risks of the costs of medical care in the event of illness. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care and continued payment of wages when ill \u2013 regardless of their income and premium level. The premiums are based on income. This means that the rich can help the poor, and the healthy can help the ill. However, these premiums are only calculated based on a percentage scale up to a certain income level (\u201cBeitragsbemessungsgrenze\u201d). Anyone earning more than this amount pays the same maximum premium.\u201cPrinciple of self-governance: While the German state sets the conditions for medical care, the further organization and financing of individual medical services is the responsibility of the self-governing bodies within the health care system. These are made up of members representing doctors and dentists, psychotherapists, hospitals, insurers and the insured people. The Federal Joint Committee (\u201cGemeinsamer Bundesausschuss\u201d or G-BA \u2013 please also see below: \u201cStructure and institutions of the health care system\u201d) is the highest entity of self-governance within the statutory health insurance system.\u201d \nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

The country also spends the highest share of its GDP on health among EU Member States (11.7 % in 2019, compared to the EU average of 9.9 %).\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cGermany spends almost an equal amount on inpatient and outpatient care. At EUR 1,221 per capita for outpatient care and EUR 1,212 for inpatient care in 2019, these figures are above the EU averages (EUR 1,022 for outpatient and EUR 1,010 for inpatient care), as was Germany\u2019s spending across all categories of health care (Figure 8). However, overall spending has increased more slowly than the EU average since 2016, and the distribution of resources across different functions is close to the EU averages at around 27 % each for inpatient and outpatient care (EU: 29.1 % and 29.5 %), 19 % for long-term care (LTC) (EU: 16 %), 19 % for medical goods (EU: 18 %) and 3 % for prevention (EU: 3 %). Over recent years, LTC spending has grown more strongly than other expenditure categories. In 2015, Germany spent EUR 637 per capita on LTC (the health component); this increased to EUR 849 in 2019. The 2017 reform of LTC increased spending as it expanded the benefits package and increased the number of recipients entitled to LTC services.\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cGermany spends a substantial amount of its wealth on health. Total expenditure on health amounted to 11.7% of GDP in 2018 according to data of the Federal Statistical Office. According to WHO data, per capita health expenditure more than doubled between 2000 and 2018, from US$ 2687 (adjusted for differences in purchasing power) to US$ 6098, which ranks Germany third in comparison to other WHO Europe countries in 2018 (after Switzerland and Norway) (World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, 2020) (see Section 3.1 Health expenditure). By OECD data, health expenditure in Germany as a share of GDP was the fourth highest share among OECD countries (after the United States, Switzerland and Norway) and per capita spending was way above the OECD36 average of US$ 3994 in 2018 (OECD, 2019).\u201cPer capita expenditure on health in Germany rose by an average of 2.5% per annum in real terms between 2013 and 2018 (up from 2.1% p.a. between 2008 and 2013). In comparison to other OECD countries, this was a relatively large increase during this period, and higher than in the Netherlands (0.5%), France (0.8%), Austria (1.0%), Switzerland (2.1%) and the OECD36 average (2.4%). According to OECD calculations, average per capita health expenditure growth is projected at 1.9% a year between 2015 and 2030, which would reflect a moderate increase compared to other OECD countries (OECD, 2019). The pace of health expenditure growth is partly attributable to the comparatively large human, technical and infrastructural resources in the German health care system and a high level of activity (e.g. in terms of consultations, hospital cases, consumption of pharmaceuticals). In addition, the full implementation of reforms to the long-term care insurance (LTCI) scheme, such as the broadening of eligibility criteria and benefits, and a rapidly ageing population, represent additional pressures on the sustainability of financing (see Section 5.8 Long-term care).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R.

Sickness funds offer selectable tariffs with a range of deductibles and no-claims bonuses. Preventive services do not count toward the deductible. SHI-contracted physicians are not allowed to charge above the fee schedule for services in the SHI benefit catalogue. However, a list of \u201cindividual health services\u201d outside the comprehensive range of SHI coverage may be offered to patients paying out of pocket.\u201cSafety nets: Children under 18 years of age are exempt from cost-sharing. For adults, there is an annual cap on cost-sharing equal to 2 percent of household income; part of a household\u2019s income is excluded from this calculation for additional family members. About 0.3 million of those insured under SHI exceeded the 2 percent cap in 2014 and were exempted from further cost-sharing. The cap is lowered to 1 percent of annual gross income for qualifying chronically ill people; to qualify, those people have to demonstrate that they attended recommended counseling or screening procedures prior to becoming ill. Nearly 6.3 million people, or around 9 percent of all the SHI-insured, benefited from this regulation in 2014.10 Unemployed people contribute to SHI in proportion to their unemployment entitlements. For the long-term unemployed, government contributes on their behalf.\u201d \nSource: Commonwealth Fund. International Health System Profiles: Germany. From the web, last accessed Sept. 30, 2019.\n\u201cAllocative efficiency indicates the extent to which an appropriate mix of services or interventions are purchased to maximize population health outcomes. In Germany the allocation of resources at the federal level mostly reflects the bargaining process between corporatist bodies, rather than a restrictive budget plan. Although there are mechanisms in place to secure the (cost-)effectiveness of benefits covered under SHI using tools such as Health Technology Assessment (see Section 2.7 Regulation), there is no priority setting by e.g. formulating goals. Pooled resources are reallocated among the sickness funds according to a morbidity-based risk-adjustment scheme, by which sickness funds have to cover all costs (see Section 3.3 Overview of the statutory financing system). However, the details of care provision and reimbursement are consequently negotiated between corporatist bodies and are not guided by an overarching strategic programme at the national level (instead, budgets are determined by historic spending levels).\u201cInternational comparisons of health expenditure by function show that Germany spent 27.2% on curative and rehabilitative care in inpatient and day care settings in 2018, which is higher than in the Netherlands (24.4%), Denmark (25.1%) and Switzerland (25.3%), but lower than the EU average (30%), France (31.5%) and Austria (33.3%) (OECD, 2020b). In more detail, Germany spent \u20ac 1169 per inhabitant on hospital care in 2018 (up from \u20ac 691 in 2000), \u20ac 428 on inpatient long-term care (up from \u20ac 211 in 2000) and \u20ac 122 on preventive and rehabilitative institutions (up from \u20ac 92 in 2000).\u201cGermany spent considerably less on ambulatory care than other EU countries. For instance, France (27.2%), Austria (29%), the Netherlands (29.2%), Switzerland (33.4%) and Denmark (34.9%) spent a higher share of health expenditure on ambulatory care, and the EU average is 31.4% (OECD, 2020b). In 2018, \u20ac 662 was spent per inhabitant for ambulatory care practices (up from \u20ac 383 in 2000), \u20ac 330 for dental care practices (up from \u20ac 227), \u20ac 257 for ambulatory long-term care (up from \u20ac 83) and \u20ac 206 on other allied health professionals (up from \u20ac 73).\u201cPharmaceuticals and medical devices accounted for another 13.7% of current health expenditures in 2018 (the fourth highest), according to the Federal Statistical Office. OECD data give a higher estimation for this category, with pharmaceuticals and medical devices representing the third highest budget item (19.3%). Under this data source, comparative countries like France (18.4%), Austria (168%), Switzerland (14.8%) and the Netherlands (11.5%) spent less on pharmaceuticals than Germany, while Denmark (10%) recorded almost half of the German costs (OECD, 2020b).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i\u2013273.\n\u201cA large part of health care expenditure in Germany is derived from the SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] system (see Table 3.2). Contributions to the 105 sickness funds constitute the major system of financing health care. The sickness funds are responsible for collecting contributions, which they transfer to a central reallocation pool known as the Gesundheitsfonds, which is responsible for pooling and reallocating the revenues according to a risk-adjustment mechanism (see Section 3.3.3 Pooling and allocation of funds).\u201cGeneral tax revenue is also used for various purposes in the health care system. All tax-based budgets, at federal as well as state level, are determined by legislatures acting on proposals from their governments. In addition, the Hospital Financing Act stipulates that investment costs should be paid from state taxes as well as by owners of public, private not-for-profit and private for-profit hospitals, if listed in the state\u2019s hospital requirement plan. Therefore, states receive tax money for investments in their hospitals (see Section 3.7.1 Paying for health services).\u201cTaxes as a source of health care financing have decreased throughout the last decade, falling from 10.8% of total health expenditure in 1996 to 4.2% in 2018. The most substantial decrease has been observed in spending on long-term care (about 50%), reflecting the unburdening of municipal budgets after the introduction of statutory long-term care insurance (see Section 5.8 Long-term care). Nevertheless, other spending on investments has decreased as well. Altogether, general government and statutory public sources accounted for 73.5% of current expenditure on health. Private sources accounted for a total 26.5% of total current expenditure: this includes direct out-of-pocket payments made by private households (13.6%). Private insurers financed 8.7%, which includes expenditures for substitutive/comprehensive health insurance, complementary health insurance and long-term care insurance.\u201cIt should be noted that the largest tax-financed item \u2013 the subsidies for SHI \u2013 is not declared as such in the fiscal statistics. Sickness funds receive a fixed amount from the federal budget for several benefits relevant to family policies: maternity benefits, sick-pay for parents caring for sick children, in-vitro fertilization, sterilization for contraceptive purposes, and prescription-only contraception up to the age of 21 and legal abortions. The federal government transfers its subsidy to the central reallocation pool (see Section 3.3.3 Pooling and allocation of funds). In 2012 the federal subsidy was \u20ac 14 billion. In order to consolidate the federal budget, the subsidy was temporarily reduced to \u20ac 10.5 billion in 2013 and \u20ac 11.5 billion in 2015. In 2016 it was again at \u20ac 14 billion and from 2017 it has been set at \u20ac 14.5 billion annually (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit (BMG), 2020j). Although these funds come from general taxation, these sums are coded as \u201cstatutory health insurance\u201d in health expenditure statistics.* Figure 3.4 shows the main financial flows between the population, purchasers and health care providers in the German health care system in 2018 \u2013 including public health services and long-term care (except the purchasers and providers mentioned in the footnote).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R.

With the public system, public patients are covered by Medicare and often do not have many out-of-pocket fees. The downside to Medicare is that they do not cover every procedure. The private system has more freedom in choice and a faster expectation regarding the surgery date. The downside to this system is that it is often expensive and requires a good health insurance policy that will cover all the associated costs that Medicare cannot.\nKey facts\nCompare Health Insurance Quotes\nProtect what\u2019s most important to you.

Please consider the PDS before purchasing any products.\nUnderstanding Surgery Costs in Australia\nSurgeries are classified into three distinct groups. Urgent, elective and cosmetic.\u00a0Understanding each surgery type will assist you in knowing if your health insurance policy covers it.\u00a0Let\u2019s look closely at these surgery types, the difference between each and why they are necessary.\nMedicare and surgery\nMedicare is free health insurance for all Australian residents. Medicare assists in covering most fees at a public hospital and some at a private hospital.\u00a0Medicare\u00a0does not cover the costs of accommodation and theatre at private hospitals. Private health insurance is important because it creates a safety blanket between you and unforeseen costs. Different health insurance policies are tailored to different requirements. Before any procedure, you must speak to your health insurance provider to\u00a0understand the associated coverage and what out-of-pocket costs can be expected.\nPrivate Surgery and Associated Costs\nPrivate health insurance\u00a0covers any costs that Medicare does not. This may include accommodation, theatre and ambulance costs. Private health insurance offers three packages: Hospital, Extras and Combined. Hospital policies cover costs associated with being a private patient in a private hospital. Extras policies cover out-of-hospital costs that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover, as well as ambulance cover for those who live in a state that does not provide ambulance cover. Combined cover is an option that merges both hospital and extras policies. Identifying your personal requirements will assist you in choosing the health insurance policy that meets your needs.\nWhen the costs of your procedure are larger than your policy\u2019s coverage, you will often need to pay for it out-of-pocket or as a copayment. The medical gap scheme assists you in this situation. This is usually a result of specialist fees, bulk billing availability and the services you need. The amount owed is referred to as \u2018the gap\u2019. Most private health insurance providers have policies that include coverage for any gaps that may occur.\u00a0The amount of assistance provided for gap costs varies between health insurance providers.\nAdvantages of private health insurance\nAnalysis of Costs for Top 10 Surgical Procedures\nCataract Surgery\nCataract surgery is a procedure that involves the removal of the eye\u2019s lens and replacing it with an artificial lens.\u00a0The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $2000 in specialist fees and $2400 in hospital fees. Private health insurance will typically cover the full hospital fee, depending on your coverage type.\u00a0\nFor private patients requiring cataract surgery with a glaucoma stent in a private hospital, the average out-of-pocket payment is $490 and $370 for private patients needing general cataract surgery. The average expected costs for uninsured patients can range from $1700 to $2500 per eye. The cost may fluctuate depending on the chosen artificial lens, hospital, and location. Medicare provides cover for this procedure.\u00a0Medicare will pay for 80% of the involved costs, with the patient needing to pay the remaining 20%.\nGastroscopy\nGastroscopy is a procedure that utilises a small and thin flexible tube to examine the upper digestive tract.\u00a0This procedure is used to visualise the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and rule out possible conditions such as peptic ulcers and gastritis. The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $940 for specialist fees and $530 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure receive an average out-of-pocket cost of $140.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $370. This out-of-pocket cost will fluctuate based on your policy. Medicare will pay an average of $420 towards the procedure, with the rest being covered by your private health insurer.\nKnee Replacement\nKnee replacement surgery involves the removal and replacement of diseased, worn-out or damaged knee joint areas.\u00a0The replacement is usually an artificial piece that acts just as a knee joint would and lowers the overall pain a patient may feel while restoring movement to the designated area. The average out-of-pocket cost of this procedure in Australia is around $4,800 for specialist fees and $ 18,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $680.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $3900 but fluctuates based on the chosen policy.\nHeart Angiogram with or without Heart Catheterization\nA heart angiogram is a procedure in which an X-ray is used to view the blood supply to the heart.\u00a0This is to check if the patient has any heart-related issues that need rectifying. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2000 for specialist fees and $ 4,200 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $40.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $490.\nCesarean Section\nA cesarean section, also known as a C-section, is a\u00a0pregnancy-related procedure that allows the baby to be delivered through an incision made on the mother\u2019s abdomen.\u00a0This usually occurs when the healthcare provider believes it is safer for the mother, baby, or both. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 3,500 for specialist fees and $ 7,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $450.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $570.\nCholecystectomy\nA cholecystectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a patient\u2019s gallbladder.\u00a0This surgery is often done to remove gallstones and any complications they may cause. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2,800 for specialist fees and $4,500 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $400.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,200.\nCoronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)\nA coronary artery bypass graft is a surgical procedure that improves oxygen supply and blood flow to the heart.\u00a0\u00a0This surgery is usually done to assist with coronary artery disease, which causes a buildup of plaque in the heart\u2019s arteries. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $15000 for specialist fees and $ 35,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $470.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,600.\nHip Replacement Surgery\nA hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which\u00a0damaged, diseased or worn-out hip joint areas are removed and replaced with an artificial piece.\u00a0The artificial piece works in the same manner that a healthy hip joint would and aims to reduce pain in the patient\u2019s hip area while also increasing the area\u2019s mobility. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 5,000 for specialist fees and $ 20,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $690.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 4,000.\nBreast Biopsy\nA breast biopsy is a procedure in which\u00a0a sample of the breast tissue is removed and tested for abnormal cells.\u00a0This test rules out the possibility of breast cancer or any other condition. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 2,400 for specialist fees and $1,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $500.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 100.\nVentral Hernia Repair\nA ventral hernia repair is a surgical procedure in which the surgeon makes an\u00a0incision into the abdomen above the hernia and pushes any protruding intestines back into the abdomen to repair the muscle wall.\u00a0The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 800 for specialist fees and $3 300 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $380.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 1,000.\nCompare common surgeries\nSource: Medical Costs Finder (October 2023; The prices above are estimates for specialists fees; Please refer to your medical professional for an accurate cost estimation)\nHow Private Health Insurance Can Assist with Surgery Costs\nPrivate health insurance is designed to assist patients with any fees that they may have during the course of the necessary procedure.\u00a0Depending on the coverage type, this may include ambulance, extras, and hospital cover.\nThere may be an instance in which the total cost of the procedure is higher than the coverage provided by both Medicare and your Private Health Insurance Provider. Depending on your chosen provider, the policy\u00a0will often provide assistance in the form of gap cover that partially or completely lowers the final amount that you will have to\u00a0pay out-of-pocket.\u00a0The assistance amount will vary based on the provider and policy that you have chosen.\nHow Medicare Works with Private Health Insurance\nMedicare typically covers 75% of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee for procedures performed in private hospitals, but this doesn\u2019t include hospital accommodation or theater fees. Private health insurance helps cover the remaining costs, but the level of coverage depends on your plan. It\u2019s crucial to understand the limits of your policy, including any gaps you might need to pay out of pocket.\nWhat is the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS)?\nThe Medicare Benefits Schedule is a list of medical services covered by Medicare, including surgery, and specifies the amount Medicare will pay for each service. When you have surgery, Medicare covers 75% of the MBS fee, and private health insurance typically covers the rest, though you may still have out-of-pocket costs if your specialist charges more than the MBS fee.\nFrequently Asked Questions and Answers\nThree main types of surgeries could occur. Elective, emergency or cosmetic. Depending on the type of surgery needed, the location, the specialist, and the hospital itself, these factors will increase or decrease the overall cost of surgery in Australia.\nMedicare is a free Health Insurance that is provided to all residents of Australia. It covers the costs associated with public hospitals and most general procedures. Medicare also assists in lowering the total out-of-pocket cost that a patient may need to pay after their procedure.\nTalking to your specialist beforehand will assist you in understanding the costs involved. It is also important to speak with your health insurance provider to ensure that the costs are covered and to verify the estimated amount that may be required.\nPrivate health insurers cover the costs that Medicare does not. For private hospitals, this may include ambulance fees, theatre and accommodation.

    "document": "The Cost of Common Surgeries Compared\nUpdated: 13 September 2024\nAustralia\u2019s healthcare system is divided into two distinct sectors. Private and public. With the public system, public patients are covered by Medicare and often do not have many out-of-pocket fees. The downside to Medicare is that they do not cover every procedure. The private system has more freedom in choice and a faster expectation regarding the surgery date. The downside to this system is that it is often expensive and requires a good health insurance policy that will cover all the associated costs that Medicare cannot.\nKey facts\nCompare Health Insurance Quotes\nProtect what\u2019s most important to you.

Please consider the PDS before purchasing any products.\nUnderstanding Surgery Costs in Australia\nSurgeries are classified into three distinct groups. Urgent, elective and cosmetic.\u00a0Understanding each surgery type will assist you in knowing if your health insurance policy covers it.\u00a0Let\u2019s look closely at these surgery types, the difference between each and why they are necessary.\nMedicare and surgery\nMedicare is free health insurance for all Australian residents. Medicare assists in covering most fees at a public hospital and some at a private hospital.\u00a0Medicare\u00a0does not cover the costs of accommodation and theatre at private hospitals. Private health insurance is important because it creates a safety blanket between you and unforeseen costs. Different health insurance policies are tailored to different requirements. Before any procedure, you must speak to your health insurance provider to\u00a0understand the associated coverage and what out-of-pocket costs can be expected.\nPrivate Surgery and Associated Costs\nPrivate health insurance\u00a0covers any costs that Medicare does not. This may include accommodation, theatre and ambulance costs. Private health insurance offers three packages: Hospital, Extras and Combined. Hospital policies cover costs associated with being a private patient in a private hospital. Extras policies cover out-of-hospital costs that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover, as well as ambulance cover for those who live in a state that does not provide ambulance cover. Combined cover is an option that merges both hospital and extras policies. Identifying your personal requirements will assist you in choosing the health insurance policy that meets your needs.\nWhen the costs of your procedure are larger than your policy\u2019s coverage, you will often need to pay for it out-of-pocket or as a copayment. The medical gap scheme assists you in this situation. This is usually a result of specialist fees, bulk billing availability and the services you need. The amount owed is referred to as \u2018the gap\u2019. Most private health insurance providers have policies that include coverage for any gaps that may occur.\u00a0The amount of assistance provided for gap costs varies between health insurance providers.\nAdvantages of private health insurance\nAnalysis of Costs for Top 10 Surgical Procedures\nCataract Surgery\nCataract surgery is a procedure that involves the removal of the eye\u2019s lens and replacing it with an artificial lens.\u00a0The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $2000 in specialist fees and $2400 in hospital fees. Private health insurance will typically cover the full hospital fee, depending on your coverage type.\u00a0\nFor private patients requiring cataract surgery with a glaucoma stent in a private hospital, the average out-of-pocket payment is $490 and $370 for private patients needing general cataract surgery. The average expected costs for uninsured patients can range from $1700 to $2500 per eye. The cost may fluctuate depending on the chosen artificial lens, hospital, and location. Medicare provides cover for this procedure.\u00a0Medicare will pay for 80% of the involved costs, with the patient needing to pay the remaining 20%.\nGastroscopy\nGastroscopy is a procedure that utilises a small and thin flexible tube to examine the upper digestive tract.\u00a0This procedure is used to visualise the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and rule out possible conditions such as peptic ulcers and gastritis. The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $940 for specialist fees and $530 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure receive an average out-of-pocket cost of $140.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $370. This out-of-pocket cost will fluctuate based on your policy. Medicare will pay an average of $420 towards the procedure, with the rest being covered by your private health insurer.\nKnee Replacement\nKnee replacement surgery involves the removal and replacement of diseased, worn-out or damaged knee joint areas.\u00a0The replacement is usually an artificial piece that acts just as a knee joint would and lowers the overall pain a patient may feel while restoring movement to the designated area. The average out-of-pocket cost of this procedure in Australia is around $4,800 for specialist fees and $ 18,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $680.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $3900 but fluctuates based on the chosen policy.\nHeart Angiogram with or without Heart Catheterization\nA heart angiogram is a procedure in which an X-ray is used to view the blood supply to the heart.\u00a0This is to check if the patient has any heart-related issues that need rectifying. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2000 for specialist fees and $ 4,200 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $40.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $490.\nCesarean Section\nA cesarean section, also known as a C-section, is a\u00a0pregnancy-related procedure that allows the baby to be delivered through an incision made on the mother\u2019s abdomen.\u00a0This usually occurs when the healthcare provider believes it is safer for the mother, baby, or both. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 3,500 for specialist fees and $ 7,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $450.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $570.\nCholecystectomy\nA cholecystectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a patient\u2019s gallbladder.\u00a0This surgery is often done to remove gallstones and any complications they may cause. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2,800 for specialist fees and $4,500 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $400.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,200.\nCoronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)\nA coronary artery bypass graft is a surgical procedure that improves oxygen supply and blood flow to the heart.\u00a0\u00a0This surgery is usually done to assist with coronary artery disease, which causes a buildup of plaque in the heart\u2019s arteries. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $15000 for specialist fees and $ 35,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $470.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,600.\nHip Replacement Surgery\nA hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which\u00a0damaged, diseased or worn-out hip joint areas are removed and replaced with an artificial piece.\u00a0The artificial piece works in the same manner that a healthy hip joint would and aims to reduce pain in the patient\u2019s hip area while also increasing the area\u2019s mobility. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 5,000 for specialist fees and $ 20,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $690.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 4,000.\nBreast Biopsy\nA breast biopsy is a procedure in which\u00a0a sample of the breast tissue is removed and tested for abnormal cells.\u00a0This test rules out the possibility of breast cancer or any other condition. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 2,400 for specialist fees and $1,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $500.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 100.\nVentral Hernia Repair\nA ventral hernia repair is a surgical procedure in which the surgeon makes an\u00a0incision into the abdomen above the hernia and pushes any protruding intestines back into the abdomen to repair the muscle wall.\u00a0The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 800 for specialist fees and $3 300 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $380.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 1,000.\nCompare common surgeries\nSource: Medical Costs Finder (October 2023; The prices above are estimates for specialists fees; Please refer to your medical professional for an accurate cost estimation)\nHow Private Health Insurance Can Assist with Surgery Costs\nPrivate health insurance is designed to assist patients with any fees that they may have during the course of the necessary procedure.\u00a0Depending on the coverage type, this may include ambulance, extras, and hospital cover.\nThere may be an instance in which the total cost of the procedure is higher than the coverage provided by both Medicare and your Private Health Insurance Provider. Depending on your chosen provider, the policy\u00a0will often provide assistance in the form of gap cover that partially or completely lowers the final amount that you will have to\u00a0pay out-of-pocket.\u00a0The assistance amount will vary based on the provider and policy that you have chosen.\nHow Medicare Works with Private Health Insurance\nMedicare typically covers 75% of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee for procedures performed in private hospitals, but this doesn\u2019t include hospital accommodation or theater fees. Private health insurance helps cover the remaining costs, but the level of coverage depends on your plan. It\u2019s crucial to understand the limits of your policy, including any gaps you might need to pay out of pocket.\nWhat is the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS)?\nThe Medicare Benefits Schedule is a list of medical services covered by Medicare, including surgery, and specifies the amount Medicare will pay for each service. When you have surgery, Medicare covers 75% of the MBS fee, and private health insurance typically covers the rest, though you may still have out-of-pocket costs if your specialist charges more than the MBS fee.\nFrequently Asked Questions and Answers\nThree main types of surgeries could occur. Elective, emergency or cosmetic. Depending on the type of surgery needed, the location, the specialist, and the hospital itself, these factors will increase or decrease the overall cost of surgery in Australia.\nMedicare is a free Health Insurance that is provided to all residents of Australia. It covers the costs associated with public hospitals and most general procedures. Medicare also assists in lowering the total out-of-pocket cost that a patient may need to pay after their procedure.\nTalking to your specialist beforehand will assist you in understanding the costs involved. It is also important to speak with your health insurance provider to ensure that the costs are covered and to verify the estimated amount that may be required.\nPrivate health insurers cover the costs that Medicare does not. For private hospitals, this may include ambulance fees, theatre and accommodation. Each policy is tailor-made to fit specific requirements and as such, there may be certain limitations for each policy type. Understanding these limitations will ensure you are not caught off-guard with unexpected fees and out-of-pocket costs.\nPublic hospitals are often cheaper than private hospitals. The downside to a public hospital is that the wait time is often longer and the patient does not have the option to choose their own specialist. Private hospitals are often more expensive but have faster surgery times and grants the patient the ability to choose their own specialist.\nOther Topics\nFind out more with our useful guides\nHave a question?

Fifteen is common, and 20 is going to be the norm.\" The LAFD serves the second-largest city in the nation with nearly 4 million people, not including the large number of tourists.\nHow long is the wait for ambulance in Europe?\nResponse times can differ between countries from five to twenty minutes for life-threatening events. Ambulance services collaborate with various other service-types, e.g. hospitals, general practices, mental healthcare institutions, fire brigades, and police departments.\nWhat is the emergency waiting time in the UK?\nTime spent by patients in A&E For patients who required admission to hospital, the median A&E waiting time remained below four hours until September 2019. In December 2019, the median wait increased to a high of 5 hours 21 minutes.\nWhy do paramedics walk so slow?\nNever move faster than your ability to make good decisions Running to a patient prevents us from spotting hazards on the way in. Remember, we're walking into an unknown. We must carefully observe and assess for danger.\nWhat percentage of ambulance calls are life threatening?\nIn 2021/22 a higher proportion of incidents were life-threatening (category 1, 12%) or emergency (category 2, 66%) compared with 2018/19 (9% and 60%, respectively). These life-threatening and emergency incidents require more resources than categories 3 and 4.\nWhat is priority 3 patient?\nPriority 3 (Green) \"Walking-wounded\" Victims who are not seriously injured, are quickly triaged and tagged as \"walking wounded\", and a priority 3 or \"green\" classification (meaning delayed treatment/transportation).\nHow long should an ambulance take for a stroke?\nThe target response time for a category 2 call (which includes heart attacks and strokes) is 18 minutes.\n",

    "document": "No 'silver bullet' to fix ambulance response times, CEO says\nAmbulance N.B. says on-time formula, bonus payments on the table in contract negotiations\nSocial Sharing\nAmbulance New Brunswick says there's no easy solution to chronically poor response times in many rural and remote communities around the province.\nOfficials appearing at a committee of MLAs for the second time this month said the problems require changes in the broader health-care system that would, for example, reduce the time ambulances are stuck at hospitals waiting to offload patients.\u00a0\n\"There is not a silver bullet solution to these challenges,\" said Craig Dalton, the CEO of EM/ANB Inc., a provincial government-owned company that contracts with Medavie Health Services New Brunswick Inc. to operate the ambulance service.\n\"It's really an attempt to do as many things as we can to reduce pressure on the system, and not just the emergency health system but the health system in general.\"\nDalton said a growing population, with a fast-expanding share of older people, will mean more calls for ambulances \u2014 while at the same time, recruiting paramedics is a challenge.\n\"The level of service decreases as those pressures increase,\" he said.\nDalton and Ian Watson, the chair of EM/ANB and also the assistant deputy minister in the provincial Health Department, confirmed Sept. 6 that they are talking to Medavie about changing the contract before it expires in 2027.\nUnder that agreement, Medavie must be on time for calls 90 per cent of the time.\n\"On time\" is defined as within nine minutes in urban areas and 22 minutes in rural areas.\nA 2020 auditor-general's report found that low on-time response rates in rural areas do not count against bonus payments to Medavie.\nThe formula in the contract allows those calls to be averaged into broader regional numbers that include a far greater number of on-time responses in urban areas \u2014 producing an overall regional number that hits the target.\nWatson said Thursday that formula, which allowed Medavie to scoop up $2.7 million in bonuses last year, is on the table as part of a possible renegotiation of the contract.\n\"The short answer is 'yes,'\" he said.\nBut Dalton rejected the auditor general's finding that the formula creates a disincentive for ANB to improve by rewarding them for overall numbers so they don't need to hire more paramedics to address local shortfalls.\n\"My comment would be there's no internal disincentive to have the absolute best performance that we can have,\" he said.\n\"I understand the perception, which is why we're really keen to sit down and look at those as well. But I can assure you inside the organization, the only incentive is doing the best we can on each and every call.\"\u00a0\nDalton and Watson were at the legislature's public accounts committee for the second time this month because MLAs from all parties agreed they wanted more answers than what they got during their first appearance Sept. 6.\nLast year's numbers showed 19 rural and remote communities, out of 67 in total, having on-time ambulance responses far below 90 per cent of the time.\u00a0\nThey were the same 19 that the auditor-general identified in 2020, including:\nBelledune, whose calls did not hit the target of 90 per cent on-time response in any month of 2022, and which had an on-time rate of just 29.2 per cent in December.\u00a0\nPort Elgin, where the on-time response rate ranged from 55.6 per cent in July to 15.8 per cent in September.\nFords Mills, in Kent County, with a 57.1 per cent rate in May of last year as its best result, and a 23.1 per cent rate its lowest in August.\nDalton said some new pilot projects are working, including a \"pre-alert\" system that allows paramedics to assess a patient on-site and divert them from a hospital emergency department in some cases.\nThat diverted 10,000 calls in which paramedics helped patients arrange to get care elsewhere.\nNew rapid response units with a single paramedic who can provide care before an ambulance arrives also free up some ambulances for other calls.\nBut Green MLA Kevin Arseneau questioned why there's no such unit in Kent County, given Fords Mills and other communities have had such poor response times.\nDalton said the units were placed in areas with the highest need, and ANB will likely look at putting one in Kent County when the next service review happens. Those reviews take place every two years.\u00a0\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nProvincial Affairs reporter\nJacques Poitras has been CBC's provincial affairs reporter in New Brunswick since 2000.

    "document": "Ambulance wait times endangering patients, doctors say\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nWatch: Injured 10-year-old told ambulance would take hours\nDoctors and paramedics have told the BBC that long waits for ambulances across the UK are having a \"dangerous impact\" on patient safety. \nBBC analysis found a 77% rise in the most serious safety incidents logged by paramedics in England over the past year, compared to before the pandemic. \nIn Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the 999 system is also under \"tremendous pressure\", doctors say.\nNHS England said the safety of patients is its \"absolute priority\".\n'Help should have been there'\nIn October, nine-year-old Willow Clark fell off her bike on a country path in Hertfordshire, cracking her helmet and leaving her with a fractured skull and a nine-inch laceration across her leg.\n\"I could see it was a really bad accident and I was 20 minutes away from home screaming for help,\" said her mother Sam. \"These really nice people who were passing by phoned 999.\n\"They explained she had a severe head injury and her leg was badly hurt but we were told it would be a 10-hour wait for an ambulance and we'd have to get her to hospital ourselves.\"\nSam's husband had to drive through a farmer's field to pick up his daughter. \nWhen they got to A&E, Willow was immediately transferred to the trauma department. Doctors told her family that she should not have been moved because of her back and neck injuries.\n\"It's the first time I've ever had to phone an ambulance and I was so disappointed,\" said Sam. \"When we really needed it, help just wasn't there and it should have been.\"\nShe later found out that Willow had been classified as an \"urgent\" category three case, meaning an ambulance should have arrived within 120 minutes.\nEast of England Ambulance Service said it was under \"significant pressure\" that day because of a high number of 999 calls and was asking some patients to make their own way to hospital. \nIt has apologised, and said Willow - now 10 - should have been dealt with as a more critical category two case.\nSamantha's daughter Willow is still in some pain and has problems with her sight after her accident in October\nWillow's experience, although traumatic for her family, was not recorded as a serious safety incident by the NHS. \nTo reach that threshold, an incident must have potentially led to long-term harm or death. \nBBC research shows there were 551 serious safety reports filed by ambulance staff in England between March 2021 and February 2022, up from 312 in the same period before the pandemic.\nWithin that data, there were 201 unintended or unexpected deaths, up from 78 in 2019/20.\nThe data does depend on staff deciding to report problems, and not all serious incidents will be linked to long ambulance delays. The largest proportion though do relate to the 'access, admission or transfer' of patients.\nCoroners and lawyers have highlighted recent cases including:\nStaffordshire's assistant coroner issued a 'prevention of future deaths' warning, external after a patient in Stoke died after waiting eight hours for an ambulance\nThe family of a man who died after waiting nine hours for treatment has issued a legal challenge against the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service over a \"chronic shortage\" of ambulances\nThe London Ambulance service is investigating after a man died when paramedics took almost 70 minutes to respond to a suspected heart attack\nDr Katherine Henderson, an A&E consultant and president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC's Today programme the problem with ambulance waits was \"more serious than we've ever seen it\".\nShe said: \"We've got big queues - we can't get flow out of our departments. The underlying reason is that emergency departments are absolutely packed.\"\nDr Henderson explained the bottleneck was caused by emergency departments having to wait to move patients into wards.\nLengthy response times\nAll 10 of England's major ambulance trusts have raised their internal alert level to a point indicating they are under severe or extreme pressure, research for the BBC has found. \nThe latest data from NHS England shows that response times are now at their highest since the current system was introduced five years ago.\nIn April, crews were responding to a \"life-threatening\" callout in nine minutes and two seconds on average, significantly above the seven-minute national target. \nThe response time for a category two emergency, such as a heart attack or a stroke, has risen to more than 51 minutes, almost three times longer than the 18-minute target.\nOne paramedic, who often works as a clinical call handler, told the BBC: \"Sitting staring at a screen with over 400 people waiting for an ambulance is soul-destroying.\n\"Do the delays mean people are dying? Absolutely, but we also need to be educating people on when someone really needs an ambulance.\"\nShe said that on one recent shift, the longest wait for a category two emergency was more than 15 hours, for an elderly man with abdominal pain.\nThe patient hadn't phoned again overnight and no welfare calls had taken place. When the crew arrived the next morning, they found the man dead.\nThere are different factors behind the long waiting times.\nThe ambulance service is seeing record levels of demand this year, as Covid restrictions have been lifted. \nMore than 860,000 calls to 999 were answered in England in April, 20% higher than in the same month in 2019.\nThere is a national shortage of paramedics across the UK, and Covid has still been causing disruption - with higher levels of staff sickness over the winter.\nCrucially though, ambulance crews themselves have faced long delays when they pick up patients and then try to deliver them to hospital staff in a busy emergency department.\nIn the first week of April, around one in ten patients had to wait more than an hour for their ambulance to be unloaded in England, far higher than the same week last year, and well above the 15-minute NHS target.\nAnother paramedic told the BBC that those kinds of waits were having a 'dangerous impact' on patient safety. \n\"We are doing the job to provide emergency care and to save lives, but actually now we are just an extended ward of the hospital,\" he said.\n\"I'm meant to care for a patient who had been in the back of my ambulance for 14 hours, but nobody has ever really taught me how to look after someone like that.\"\nThe Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE), which represents services across the whole UK, says handover delays cut the number of hours crews could operate by \"up to one-third\" in some areas in March.\n\"The potential harm... could be impacting thousands of patients every month, with obvious knock-on effects on the morale and wellbeing of staff,\" managing director Martin Flaherty said.\n\"Every possible effort is being made to prioritise those patients whose conditions are most serious. \n\"Sadly, given the loss of capacity associated with handover delays, this is simply not always possible to achieve.\"\nAmbulances waiting outside Royal Stoke University Hospital on 12 April, 2022\nBBC News has spoken to patients in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland who have experienced similarly long waits:\nLast week, one in 10 ambulances across Scotland took more than 80 minutes to drop patients at an emergency department\nWelsh Ambulance Service figures show just 51% of immediately life-threatening calls were reached within the target time of eight minutes in March, well below the 65% target\nIn Northern Ireland, ambulance delays could have contributed to 14 deaths in the past year, the service's chief executive told BBC News\nAn NHS England official said it was working closely with ambulance trusts and care homes to free up more capacity in accident and emergency departments.\n\"The safety of patients is our absolute priority and it is a good thing that more staff are being encouraged to report all incidents to help prevent repetition,\" she said. \n\"There's no doubt the last few months have been some of the toughest ever for NHS staff, with ambulances responding to the highest number of 999 calls on record over the past year, while more than a 10th of all hospital beds have been filled by people fit to be discharged to services such as social-care providers.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson in England said \"a record \u00c2\u00a336bn\" from the health and social care levy was being provided over the next three years for the NHS and social care.\nThere is also a plan to tackle the Covid backlog, and additional funding this year to support increased NHS 111 capacity in taking calls, to ensure people only visit A&E when necessary.\n\"We recognise the unprecedented pressure NHS staff are under from the pandemic - especially frontline ambulance workers,\" the spokesperson said.\nAdditional reporting by Victoria Park.\nHave you experienced a long delay, either waiting for an ambulance or at A&E?

In the UK there has been a radical shift in how (and whether) many of us travel to and for work, for shopping and for leisure. This shift has had a very visible impact on our towns and cities, with urban centres at times during 2020 appearing virtually empty and at other times hyper-congested as people have sought alternative means of transport in response to the evolving pandemic.\nEach year the London Ambulance Service (LAS) typically attends around 1.1m incidents while the London Fire Brigade 1 (LFB) attends around 100,000 incidents . In many cases the 2 speed of these responses can mean the difference between life and death, so over the years, considerable effort and money has been invested to shave seconds off response times so that first responders are on the scene as soon as possible.\nMuch has been made of this fact during the recent debates over low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and pop-up cycle lanes introduced as part of the government\u2019s response to the pandemic, with opponents of the changes - though typically not the emergency services themselves - routinely claiming that measures to reduce traffic could cost lives by causing delays to fire and ambulance response times. It is true that the response times of these emergency services are sensitive to changes in road conditions, and ambulance chiefs have recently reported that their in house SatNav systems have 3 sometimes not kept pace where changes to road layouts were made rapidly.\nBut there remains no evidence that 4 London\u2019s new active travel measures have yet caused any measurable increase in overall emergency response times .\n5 LFB records do show an increase in reported delays due to traffic calming measures in fire crew incident reports in areas where LTNs have been introduced but, crucially, any such impacts experienced and reported by crews were completely 5 London\u2019s Police, Fire Brigade and Ambulance Service have all stated they have no records of increased 999 response times as a result of these measures.\n4 https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/low-traffic-neighbourhoods-ltns-999-calls-lo ndon-ambulance-b953716.html 3 https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/london-ambulances-need-new-live-data -systems-to-beat-traffic-jams-in-emergencies-report-claims-a3875251.html 2 https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/incident-response-times-fire-facts 1 https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ambulance-quality-in dicators/ 6 offset by a concomitant decrease in other kinds of delays (likely, reduced overall traffic levels across the areas in question) so that the actual recorded response times in these areas have remained unchanged.6 While the novelty of new and unexpected road layouts and the rapid pace of recent changes have given rise to a mismatch between perceived and actual delays to 999 response times, there is another factor affecting these journeys which may suffer from the opposite effect. Traffic congestion is a daily fact of life in the UK capital - ranked as the 8th most congested city in the world in 2019 - that is so 7 mundane as to be effectively invisible to its residents. Yet the resultant risk of delays to emergency vehicles has the clear potential to have a real impact on the outcomes for critically ill patients and people who are victims of fire and accidents.\nUntil the pandemic hit in 2020 it had been difficult to estimate the extent of the effect that congestion has on emergency service response times, or to separate this effect from other factors.\nBut with traffic levels dropping sharply to unprecedented lows during the various lockdowns, an unplanned, living experiment was thrust upon us, allowing us to gain a fuller picture of how much typical congestion levels delay emergency service vehicles in London for the first time.\n7 https://inrix.com/press-releases/2019-traffic-scorecard-uk/ 6 https://findingspress.org/article/23568-the-impact-of-2020-low-traffic-neighbourh oods-on-fire-service-emergency-response-times-in-london-uk 7 Congestion Levels in London In order to quantify the change in congestion levels experienced in London since the pandemic started, three sources of data on traffic levels in London were accessed.\nThe car navigation platform TomTom uses their satellite 8 navigation systems to gather data on congestion in cities around the world, including London. TomTom quantifies congestion by comparing the actual time taken by vehicle drivers in a given hour against an estimate of the time the same journey would take in the absence of any congestion.\nFor example, a congestion level of 36% means that a trip will take 36% more time than it would have done in uncongested conditions.9 At the time of writing, the TomTom website hosted weekly congestion level data for London for the whole of 2021 to date.\nFor 2020 only monthly data was available on the live TomTom website, however it was possible to access data for the first 41 weeks of 2020 by using archive.org\u2019s Wayback Machine.\nThe 10 gap in the weekly data series from October to December 2020 has been bridged by using the monthly data (dashed lines in the chart below).\nThe TomTom data starts with the normal lull in congestion as Londoners return from their Christmas and New Year holidays, with levels rapidly returning to historical norms for the first two months of the year. It then shows a steep reduction in the level of congestion starting well in advance of the official announcement on 23rd March of the first lockdown.\nCongestion reduced from the peak in week 10 of 2020 (2nd March to 8th March) to a minimum in week 14 (29th March to 5th April) before starting to creep back up again early in the lockdown and gradually returning to levels similar to before the lockdown by November.\nThe monthly data for October to December (dashed lines) suggest a smaller reduction during the shorter second lockdown before a more substantial drop over Christmas and as the country entered the third lockdown. Congestion levels then resumed their upwards trend as the lockdown 10 https://web.archive.org/web/20201115144731/https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic -index/london-traffic/ 9 https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic-index/about/ 8 https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic-index/london-traffic/ 8 progressed and as it was gradually phased out starting in March 2021.\nFigure 1: London congestion levels 2020-21 (Source: TomTom) Another relevant source of data exists in the form of an ongoing programme of traffic counts at locations on major and minor roads across the country managed by the Department for Transport.\n149 of the traffic count points in 11 the London region had one of these 12-hour vehicle counts take place in either 2018 or 2019 (mostly between April and June) and another during the first lockdown (all between April and June 2020). Comparing the count in 2018 or 2019, years which represent recent baseline traffic flows, with the count during the first lockdown gives an indication of how traffic flows changed during the pandemic.\nIn total nearly 2 million vehicles of all kinds were logged passing these 149 points during the counts undertaken in 2018 or 2019. At the same 149 points during the pandemic the number of vehicles logged had reduced by an average of 50%: 11 https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/downloads 9 Table 1: Overall traffic flows in London, 2018/19 vs 2020 covid lockdown (Source: Department for Transport road traffic stats) 2018 or 2019 First Lockdown Change Vehicle Type Count Share Count Share Count % Pedal Cycles 3,541 0.2% 6,354 0.6% +2,813 +79% Two Wheeled Motor Vehicles 6,645 0.3% 3,620 0.4% -3,025 -46% Cars and Taxis 1,481,960 74.4% 612,514 61.3% -869,446 -59% Buses and Coaches 10,188 0.5% 2,940 0.3% -7,248 -71% LGVs 281,344 14.1% 204,977 20.5% -76,367 -27% HGVs 207,715 10.4% 169,162 16.9% -38,553 -19% Total 1,991,393 999,567 -991,826 -50% Total Excluding 2 Wheeled 1,981,207 989,593 -991,614 -50% With the exception of pedal cycles, which saw an increase of nearly 80% as Londoners took to bikes to get around, all vehicle types saw a reduction.\nPassenger cars, which accounted for around 75% of vehicles counted pre-pandemic, saw an average reduction of nearly 60% during the pandemic and nearly 90% of the change in vehicle numbers counted can be attributed to this reduction in car and taxi traffic.\nFinally, Transport for London tracks bus speeds across its network to monitor bus service performance and this 12 provides an indirect measure of congestion in London. The data shows a substantial increase in average bus speeds across London during the first and third lockdowns in particular as congestion dropped: 12 https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/buses-performance-data 10 Figure 2: London bus speeds, 2017-2021 (Source: Transport for London) 11 London Fire Brigade Travel Times The London Fire Brigade responds to nearly 100,000 incidents each year (over 250 per day) and records data about the response times, including the time taken to travel from the station to the incident, for each of these.\nIt is therefore 13 possible to build up a detailed picture of how response times have changed in the last few years, in particular during the pandemic.\nThe Greater London area is divided up into a number of station areas. The inner London stations typically cover an area ranging from under 1 square mile to around 6 square miles, with outer London station areas being typically 14 considerably larger, one of the reasons why average response times in outer London are over 30 seconds higher than response times in inner London.\nFigure 3: London Fire station boundaries15 15 https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/brigade_orders_and_ground_maps#i ncoming-597801 14 https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/242506/response/597801/attach/2/LFB %20station%20boundaries.pdf 13 https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-fire-brigade-mobilisation-records 12 The chart below shows the average travel times between the station and the incident of the first appliance to arrive on the scene in each week from the start of 2019 to the end of June 2021, overlaid with the dates of the three lockdowns which had been imposed during the pandemic: Figure 4: LFB 999 response travel times 2019-2021 (Source: London Fire Brigade, Fire Facts) A pronounced reduction in travel times can be seen in the weeks running up to the first lockdown (starting in around week 10 of 2020) as Londoners started taking steps to reduce their movements and traffic levels reduced. Reductions in travel time were also seen during the second and third lockdowns although as congestion levels did not drop as far as during the first lockdown, these were not as pronounced.\nThe relationship between travel time and congestion level reveals that for each percent increase in congestion, the travel time by fire appliances increases by approximately one second: 13 Figure 5: LFB response travel times vs congestion metric.\nInner London fire stations saw a 44 second reduction (-20%) in mean travel times between week 10 and week 14 of 2020 while outer London fire stations saw a 38 second reduction (-14%) over the same period. Travel times in outer London dropped further as lockdown continued, reaching an 18% reduction in week 18 of 2020 compared with week 10.\nComparing April 2020 travel times with April 2019 shows that some inner London stations saw large improvements: 14 Table 2: London fire stations which saw the biggest reductions in 999 response times during April 2020 lockdown.\nStation Name Apr-19 Response Times (s) Apr-20 Response Times (s) Reduction % Change Soho 250 159 1m31s -37% Greenwich 204 148 0m56s -27% Deptford 228 169 0m59s -26% Shoreditch 211 157 0m54s -26% Tooting 246 189 0m57s -23% Paddington 233 183 0m50s -22% Lambeth 214 168 0m46s -22% Islington 233 187 0m46s -20% Peckham 215 173 0m42s -19% Euston 215 174 0m41s -19% Nationally, 999 response times to serious \u2018primary\u2019 fires have been rising inexorably since the 1990s. This rise is almost exclusively attributable to increases in travel time, since crew turnout times have fallen over this period, while call handling times flatlined or fell for protracted periods in which overall response times continued to increase . Government analysis 16 of the factors behind rising fire response times nationally from 1996-2006 concluded that rising traffic levels was the primary cause.17 Our analysis from the London lockdowns shows that when traffic levels fall, fire response times come down too - and that the most plausible explanation for this correlation is causal. To put it another way, the presence of \u2018normal\u2019 levels of motor traffic on the capital\u2019s streets are causing substantial delays to the London Fire Brigade\u2019s response times to the most serious incidents.\n17 https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20120919173844mp_/http://www.\ncommunities.gov.uk/documents/fire/pdf/frsresponsetimes.pdf 16 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/atta chment_data/file/857924/response-times-fires-england-1819-hosb0120.pdf 15 London Ambulance Service Response Times NHS England publishes monthly data on average response times for each region of England, detailing the number of incidents and mean response times by incident category.18 Unlike the fire brigade data, the ambulance data represents the total response time and not just the travel time to the incident. The clock starts when the call is coded as C1, when the first ambulance resource is assigned or 30 seconds after the emergency call connects, whichever is earliest.\nAs a result of this approach to reporting ambulance response times, and in contrast to London Fire Brigade response time datasets, it is not possible to fully disentangle the impact of congestion on ambulance journey times from other factors such as changes in call volumes (e.g. higher call volumes lead to longer call answer times) or changes in staffing levels, both of which are understood to have had a major impact on response times during the pandemic .\n19 Incidents coded as C1 (Category 1) in the data are those that received a response on scene where life-threatening injuries and illnesses, specifically cardiac arrest, were involved. These incidents have a target mean response time of seven minutes. C1 incidents where any patients were transported by an Ambulance Service emergency vehicle are coded as C1T.\nC1T does not include incidents where an ambulance clinician on scene determines that no conveyance is necessary, or incidents with non-emergency conveyance. The C1T response time for an incident is the response time of the first vehicle which is capable of conveying the patient.\nThe NHS ambulance response data goes back as far as the end of 2017 when the C1 category was introduced, and shows the C1 target time of 7 minutes (420 seconds) being met since the summer of 2018. However, as the pandemic hit there was a substantial spike in total response times (see the dotted lines in Figure 6) as an exceptionally large volume of calls were received and the NHS was put under the immense 19 Snooks et al, 2021: Call volume, triage outcomes, and protocols during the first wave of the COVID\u201019 pandemic in the United Kingdom: Results of a national survey https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8328888/ 18 https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ambulance-quality-in dicators/ 16 pressure of the pandemic.\nThis peak has since been 20 confirmed as London Ambulance Service\u2019s busiest ever month and during this surge, mean call answer times 21 increased from a pre-pandemic average of around 12 seconds to 200 seconds.\nFigure 6: Mean response times net of mean call answer time (solid lines) for C1 and C1T emergency, 2017-2021. The total response times have also been included along with the mean call answer time.22 By deducting the mean call answer time from the total response times we remove one of the major confounding factors (the time for the call to connect), leaving us with an estimate of the average time from the emergency call connecting to an operator through to the ambulance arriving on scene. However, substantial uncertainties remain in the extent to which the reduction in C1T response times which can be seen in the data can be attributed to reduced 22 https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ambulance-quality-in dicators/ 21 https://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/2021/09/06/2021-summer-months-three-of-our-top-five-busiest-months-ever/ 20 https://www.hsj.co.uk/ambulance-waiting-times-soared-in-march-as-calls-hit-rec ord-high/7027368.article 17 congestion (for example call duration, ambulance availability or crew turnout times may also have changed during this period).\nAs the ambulance data covers total response time, other factors beyond the level of congestion experienced travelling to an incident are also at play - as in the periods when surging Covid-19 cases overwhelmed the service, which were subsequently followed by a sustained drops in call volumes compared to the baseline.\nPast NHS reviews of the factors 23 behind geographical disparities in ambulance response times have found that these tend to be dominated by the overall workload in urban areas.\nWe therefore cannot state 24 with complete confidence that reduced congestion explains the drop in response times seen during the Covid-19 lockdowns.\nNevertheless, the general trend in response times closely correlates with the congestion trends over the period in question. Moreover, there is no other plausible explanation for the substantially reduced travel response times experienced by the London Fire Brigade during the lockdown periods, and we therefore contend that it is reasonable to conclude that reduced congestion has played a dominant part in these faster response times.\nLondon\u2019s ambulances and fire appliances are using the same roads, after all.\nThis hypothesis is also supported by other circumstantial evidence. For instance, analysis of NHS England data by the Nuffield Trust has found a similar pattern in C1 response times since 2018 at the national level, with a spike at the start of the pandemic followed by a dip during lockdown; but the 25 national reduction in response time during this period was less pronounced than that seen in London - which in normal times is the most congested city in the UK.26 We were not able to determine why average response times between C1 and C1T calls have historically varied so widely.\nBut we speculate that this may be explained by the fact that C1T includes only vehicles capable of conveying patients to hospital, and therefore excludes cycle and motorcycle paramedics, who are typically dispatched to life threatening incidents in parallel with ambulances, and are often first on the scene since they can \u201ccan get through the traffic faster 26 https://inrix.com/press-releases/2019-traffic-scorecard-uk/ 25 https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/ambulance-response-times#background 24 https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ambulance-response-pr ogramme-review.pdf 23 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8328888/ 18 than a large ambulance\u201d.\nThis could also explain why the 27 variance between C1 and C1T response times fell to under 100 seconds during lockdown, when it is typically over 300 seconds; perhaps \u201clarge ambulances\u201d were no longer being held up by traffic? Further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis however.\n27 https://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/calling-us/who-will-treat-you/single-respon der/ 19 Implications Although it is well established that there is a causal relationship between fire and ambulance 999 response times and fatality rates, this relationship is in most cases a highly complex one. For instance, the number and range of factors influencing whether a fire leads to fatalities is very large, and the non-linear relationship between fire spread and time elapsed makes it very difficult to draw any straightforward link between 999 response times and outcomes for victims of fires. Outcomes of delays for the diverse range of medical emergencies suffered by Londoners are perhaps even more challenging to quantify, and we were cautioned by clinical researchers that in practice patient outcomes are far too multi-factorial to be amenable to crude attempts at attribution.\nDespite the confounding factors, the Department for Communities and Local Government has in the past used fire service data to develop a benchmark statistical model for planning fire service provision, in the form of the Fire Service Emergency Cover Toolkit.\n\u201cFatality rate response time 28 relationships\u201d were developed which attempted to quantify the impact of different response times on fatality rates for a range of different incident types. There is no real question that Londoners are dying as a consequence of delays to 999 responses caused by congestion - even though it is not practicable to ascertain exactly how many and from what causes.\nIn the context of this report\u2019s focus it should also be noted that of London\u2019s 9,678 serious \u2018primary\u2019 fires in 2019, 1,925 of these involved motor vehicles - around 20% of the total.\nOver 30,000 29 Londoners were casualties of road traffic collisions in 2019, nearly 4000 of whom were seriously injured or killed.\nMotor traffic 30 therefore not only impedes emergency service vehicles on their way to incidents; it also generates a high proportion of the most dangerous incidents being responded to.\n30 https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/road-safety -https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzgyZTc0ZmYtMjlmOC00ZGFmLWJmNzMtZW JkMjdhMDU4MGY1IiwidCI6IjFmYmQ2NWJmLTVkZWYtNGVlYS1hNjkyLWEwODljMjU1MzQ2Y iIsImMiOjh9 29 https://data.london.gov.uk/download/lfb-fires-in-london-1966-2019---fire-facts/cfd 2b25b-8014-436f-add2-a68ef9017bee/Fire%20Facts%20-%20Fires%20in%20Greater% 20London%202019.pdf 28 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2012-updates-to-the-fire-service-em ergency-cover-toolkit-special-service-and-fire-fatality-rate-functions 20 Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of its associated civil lockdowns offer an unprecedented \u2018living experiment\u2019 opportunity to assess the impact of typical congestion levels in London on the response times of its emergency services.\nThis paper has shown that these effects are very substantial, and we believe that in practice they are likely to account for a significant number of excess deaths each year amongst Londoners requiring urgent assistance for both fires and medical emergencies.\nBecause traffic congestion has become an endemic feature of life in London, most residents, including emergency service crews, have become desensitised to its negative effects.\nImaginary grievances about perceived acute impacts on 999 response times arising from new cycle lanes and low traffic neighbourhoods generate sensational headlines and fury on social media -despite not being detectable in official records. Meanwhile the real, chronic impacts of too many cars on the city\u2019s streets are demonstrably preventing life saving emergency services from getting to their destinations as quickly as they might, yet continue to go unremarked and unreported. We hope this short report will go some way towards rectifying this.\n21",

A high Access Ranking\u00a0(1-13) indicates that a state provides relatively more access to insurance and mental health\u00a0treatment than those ranked 39-51.\nThe eight measures that make up the Access Ranking include:\n\n\n\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness.\nIn 2022, 64% of adults who were uninsured said that they did not have health insurance because they could not afford it.\nThe state prevalence of uninsured adults with mental illness ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\nAdults with SUD Who Needed But Did Not Receive Treatment\nOver three-quarters (76.9%) of all adults with a substance use disorder did not receive the treatment they needed.\nMost adults with SUD who sought or thought about receiving treatment reported they didn\u2019t because they thought they should have been able to handle their drug or alcohol use on their own (75.4%).\nThis was followed by: Not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop or cut back using alcohol or drugs (48.4%), thought it would cost too much (47.7%), and did not know how or where to get treatment (47.3%).\nThe state prevalence of adults with SUD with unmet treatment needs ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\n10.2% of adults who experienced a mental illness in the past year had private health insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems.\nThe state prevalence of adults with AMI whose private insurance did not cover mental or emotional problems ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs\n24.58% of adults who reported experiencing 14 or more mentally unhealthy days each month were not able to see a doctor due to costs. This was a 2% increase over last year\u2019s report.\nHigh costs of mental health care are a critical barrier to access. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading. Unfortunately, doing so hides the fact that the percentages are significantly lower.\nThe state rate of students identified as having an emotional disturbance for an IEP ranges from 28.01 per 1,000 students in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 students in Alabama.\n\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\nMental Health Workforce Availability\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. The term \u201cmental health provider\u201d includes psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care.\nAs of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, and only 27% of the mental health need in shortage areas was being met by mental health providers.

The results from this study provide insights into the mental health of Canadians and reveal concerning trends.\u00a0Results from a probability sample of this size could be considered accurate to within \u00b11.6 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. Results have been weighted based on age, gender and region to be representative of the Canadian population.\u00a0\n \nA series of research briefs that provide an in-depth, specific investigation of our polling results can be found here.\u00a0Results of earlier polls are compared when applicable. \u00a0\nFindings from our polls are searchable on our free Data Portal.\nOur latest data shows that negative daily impacts of mental health symptoms are at a near record high, and access to support is on the rise.\u00a0\nThe findings reveal significant insights into mental health indicators and emerging trends:\nNegative Impacts of Mental Health Symptoms at Near Record-High:\u00a0 More than one in four (28%) of Canadians report that their mental health symptoms affect their daily functioning, marking the highest percentage recorded since the middle of the pandemic. Over one-third of respondents indicate that mental health symptoms disrupt various aspects of their lives, including work/school (40%), social/leisure (33%), and family/home (36%).\nHigh-Risk Problem Gambling in Canada: 7% of Canadians present high risk of problem gambling, with a higher rate of 15% among those aged 18-34. Those who present high-risk of problem gambling are more likely to face severe mental health issues, including 22% having planned a suicide attempt, and show higher rates of alcohol (38%) and cannabis (49%) dependency compared to non-gamblers.\nUpward Trend in Accessing Mental Health Support: More Canadians have accessed mental health support in the past year (16%), indicating a 5% increase since the summer of 2022.\nHigh Levels of Resilience: Almost seven-in-ten Canadians express confidence in their ability to bounce back from challenges (68%), marking the highest percentage recorded since the inception of this polling series. While younger Canadians are less optimistic, resilience levels have increased across all age groups.\nAdditional major findings from Poll 20 include:\nSelf-reported anxiety levels remain high, with 12% of Canadians experiencing high anxiety. However, there has been a slight decrease in self-reported depression, down to 9% since the last poll. Younger demographics continue to report higher rates of anxiety and depression compared to older cohorts.\nA growing number of Canadians report missing days of work or school due to mental health concerns (11%). Productivity at work or school has declined for 27% of respondents, reflecting a 6% increase since the previous poll.\nNearly half of Canadians are aware of the 988 Crisis Suicide Helpline (45%), with 4% having utilized the service themselves and an additional 8% knowing someone who has.\n\nMental Health Research Canada\nGet the latest updates on new events and funding opportunities.

After all, to report on impact is not just looking at\u00a0past achievements. It is also a promise for the future: the\u00a0pact,\u00a0the commitment, and the hope. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 6 The ability to foster change in mental health is an ongoing commitment, for even when we achieve milestones we must be aware of emerging challenges. That is why the MHCC seeks to truly understand and engage with people who have lived and living experience of mental health and substance use health challenges. Not only are these experiences integrated into our research, planning, and outreach efforts. They make it possible to identify gaps in policy and services that provide our evidence-based research to inform change, training to reduce stigma, and programs to offer life-affirming hope. One example is Roots of Hope, a community-led initiative to reduce suicide rates whose impact is empowering communities and provinces across the country \u2014 most recently, the government of Manitoba.\nCanada is a vast country with many geographic, cultural, linguistic, and economic differences. But no matter what your status, you can be affected by mental health concerns. Just as we all have physical health, we all have mental health \u2014 and it\u2019s something that needs tending. Yet, because doing so can be difficult for many people, the MHCC is part of a global forum of mental health leaders who are tackling challenges related to virtual care implementation and its intersections with artificial intelligence. As critical questions emerge, so is the potential for virtual care to reduce mental health service wait times \u2014 something we saw this year in the Northwest Territories. An MHCC project, implemented in partnership with the territorial government and Stepped Care Solutions, led to a 79 per cent reduction in\u00a0wait times for mental health counselling in the region. The Stepped Care model allows individuals to access mental health services at level with the most effective impact. Each level can then be stepped up or down depending on progress and the nature of the concern. The reductions in wait times involved simplifying intake processes, introducing drop-in counselling sessions, and implementing e-mental health services.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 7 The MHCC is also changing the lives of Canadians and communities by increasing mental health literacy and improving access to quality mental health and substance use health supports. Since care needs to be culturally informed to do this well, the commission partnered with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) on a research and pilot program for culturally adapted cognitive behavioural therapy that is improving outcomes for Canadians of South Asian origin with anxiety and depression.\nIn addition, MHCC collaboration across numerous communities regarding the relationship between mental health and cannabis resulted in 40 community-based research projects. Six were led by Indigenous researchers, who provided perspectives on parental cannabis use and child welfare, cannabis retailers in Indigenous communities, and guidance on the interface of cannabis and traditional medicines.\nWe have also been collaborating with Indspire, a\u00a0cross-Canada Indigenous charity that invests in the education of First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis youth and young adults. This initiative focuses on mental health education and resources to support Indigenous students with Indspire\u2019s programs.\nWhile these are truly impactful programs, mental health stigma continues to be a significant issue. We know from work with our research partners that 95 per cent of people with a mental health or substance use disorder were impacted by stigma over the past five years, with the majority reporting feelings of self-stigma and internalizing negative stereotypes.\nThis finding underscores the critical importance of our evidence-based training programs, including those offered through Opening Minds to increase mental health literacy. Since the MHCC was established in 2007, we have trained more than a million people in these innovative evidence-based courses and plan to increase this number significantly.\nTogether, we are actively ensuring that we are equipped to advance policy and program objectives in a sustainable and meaningful manner while creatively increasing our impact. Work like this changes lives.Michel Rodrigue\u2019s signature.\nMichel Rodrigue President and CEOChuck Bruce\u2019s signature.\nChuck Bruce Board Chair Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 8 Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 9 Sporting Mindfulness More than 15,000 schoolchildren across Saskatchewan received mental health training thanks to a ground-breaking partnership between the Mental Health Commission of Canada and\u00a0a\u00a0professional football team. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 10Three female athletes celebrating.\nThe MHCC\u2019s alliance with the Saskatchewan Roughriders also led to a new version of The Working\u00a0Mind (TWM), an evidence-based program to promote mental health and reduce the stigma associated with mental\u00a0illness in the workplace.\n\u201cI\u2019ve long been aware of the mental health training developed and delivered by the MHCC,\u201d says Cindy\u00a0Fuchs, the foundation\u2019s executive director and a recognized leader in Saskatchewan\u2019s not-for-profit sector. \u201cWhen\u00a0I learned about plans to develop a version of TWM for the sports industry, I saw an opportunity for us to work together and serve the greater good.\u201d Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 11Three male athletes celebrating.\nThe Saskatchewan Roughrider Foundation, the charitable organization affiliated with the Canadian Football League team, has\u00a0been funding community-based education, health, and amateur sports projects for young people since it\u00a0was\u00a0established in 2019.\nDeveloped by clinicians and peers, TWM offers facilitated discussions that focus on work-related mental health topics. Since the MHCC launched TWM in 2013, it has developed a series of industry\u2011specific versions of the training by collaborating with a range of\u00a0partners. One of those versions is TWM\u00a0Sport, which was piloted through the foundation with the help of Saskatchewan Roughrider players and coaches, along with a handful of elite athletes in the\u00a0province. Feedback\u00a0from the pilot led to additional improvements to the program.\nDetermined to have more elite football players benefit from the training, the foundation paid to deliver TWM\u00a0Sport to two varsity teams and several junior and women\u2019s teams. To spread its benefits further, the\u00a0foundation also built on its long-standing partnership with the province\u2019s Ministry of Education. For years, the ministry and foundation have partnered on the Game Changers Playbook to give elementary and secondary students evidence-based, curriculum\u2011related mental health and wellness resources. Now, five Roughrider players trained in TWM Sport tour the province to talk about mental health with student groups through the foundation\u2019s Win\u00a0With\u00a0Wellness\u00a0Presentation Series.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 12A Saskatchewan Roughrider team member speaks to students seated at their desks.\n\u201cThe mind is the strongest muscle in your body,\u201d says\u00a0Brayden Lenius, a Saskatchewan Roughrider wide\u00a0receiver who participated in the pilot.\n\u201cYou can develop your mind to become stronger and more resilient. TWM Sport teaches you how to do that.\u201d \u201cLessons from TWM are for everyone \u2014 not just pro athletes,\u201d says Lenius. \u201cTelling schoolchildren about some of the mental health challenges I face, and\u00a0listening to their stories, helps me and helps them.\u201d Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 13 The MHCC continues to seek like-minded partners to expand and improve the effectiveness of programs like TWM. In\u00a0the end, everyone must recognize that mental health can be nurtured, that help is\u00a0available, and that recovery is expected. TWM Versions Besides different versions for employees and managers in\u00a0Canada, Australia, and the United States, TWM is available for\u00a0specific industry groups. These include: \u2022 First responders (fire,\u00a0police, paramedics, corrections\u00a0staff) \u2022 Post-secondary students \u2022 Health care \u2022 Legal \u2022 Oral health care \u2022 Sports By the Numbers More than 300,000 people have completed at\u00a0least one version of TWM.\nMore than 1,500 TWM facilitators have\u00a0been trained worldwide.\nMore and more Peer\u2011reviewed studies demonstrate the effectiveness of TWM.1 1 See, for example, Effects of the Anti-stigma Workplace Intervention \u201cWorking Mind\u201d in\u00a0a\u00a0Canadian Health-Care Setting: A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Immediate Versus Delayed Implementation and The Working Mind: A\u00a0Meta\u2011Analysis of a Workplace Mental\u00a0Health and Stigma Reduction Program.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 14 Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 15 Taking Root Engaging and empowering individuals and\u00a0communities in suicide prevention The Roots of Hope model builds on community expertise to implement suicide prevention and life promotion initiatives based on five pillars of action and 13 guiding principles.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 16Three adults planting a tree together.\nThe impact of Roots of Hope on individuals and communities continues to deepen. Its\u00a0success is based on sound evidence and an operating model that prioritizes collaboration and independence: Each Roots of Hope community is encouraged to develop and implement the initiatives \u2014 and establish the partnerships \u2014 it considers most appropriate. In many cases, they build on existing programs and services.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 17 \u201cGiving back to others through Roots\u00a0of\u00a0Hope has helped to save my life.\u201d \u201cThe launching of an eight-week support group for [suicide] attempt survivors provided a space for them to work through their struggles in a safe space. I went through the group myself and found it beneficial. I know that, as a lived experience person on the team, it has given me the opportunity to use my life experience for good and to make meaning out of what happened. My\u00a0friend Travis also went through the group last year and found it helpful. He unfortunately died by suicide recently, but I think the group bought him the better part of a year.\nI am very grateful that Roots of Hope exists. I am also grateful that the services we provide gave me more time with my friend. This is meaningful work, and I hope to be able to see it through. It\u2019s the only group of its kind in the area \u2014 and by area I\u2019m pretty sure I mean all of Western Canada. Lastly, the suicide prevention-related events that Stony Plain hosts always have good\u00a0turnouts, and I think the public is starting to be able to speak more openly about it.\u201d Wesley Jones Roots of Hope community Stony Plain, Alberta Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 18 \u201cWe are network of 65 volunteers trained in ground-based search and rescue. Many of the people we search for don\u2019t want to be found, usually because they are experiencing a mental\u2011health crisis. These now account for about 75 per cent of our searches. In many cases, the person is contemplating suicide, and time is of the essence. Partnering with Roots of Hope improves our ability to find and rescue people in crisis. The partnership also improves the mental health of our volunteers, who are now more resilient.\u201d Tina Brown Planning Section Chief Colchester Ground Search and Rescue Colchester County, Nova Scotia \u201cA big reason that members of the 2SLGBTQI+ community experience higher rates of both mental illness and suicide ideation is social stigma, particularly in rural and remote communities. Under our partnership with Roots of Hope, two members of the 2SLGBTQI+ community in each of Nova Scotia\u2019s four health-care zones have been trained to deliver SafeTALK suicide-prevention courses. Hundreds of at-risk people, along with their friends and families, will benefit. Roots of Hope is a catalyst \u2014 the extra ingredient that inspires tangible progress.\u201d Tyler Colbourne Executive Director Healthy Minds Cooperative Nova Scotia Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 19Two youths at a race.\nBy the Numbers 2019 eight communities 2021 11 more Today 18 communities, three provinces, and one territory Roots of Hope is based on\u00a0community expertise To increase the impact of their efforts, Roots of Hope community coalition forge partnerships with a variety of local organizations.

Through consultations with\u00a0the community, care providers, and administrators, the partners overhauled service delivery processes and transformed the system. This\u00a0work enabled the government to integrate SC2.0 into its Community Counselling Program and offer diverse care options while significantly reducing or eliminating\u00a0wait\u2011lists.\nSC2.0 comprises a series of increasingly intensive steps or levels of support and service. From a wide range of\u00a0available choices, individuals and families can make informed decisions about the care that best suits their needs and preferences. For instance, they can access relevant information anonymously, get support from an e-mental health app, join a support group, engage with cultural or land-based programs, or access one-on-one counselling, among other\u00a0options.\nThe Mental Wellness and Addictions Recovery Advisory Group includes residents from across the NWT. The\u00a0group helped co-design SC2.0 in the NWT and continues to provide advice and wisdom rooted in lived and living expertise with mental\u00a0wellness and substance use health. Under SC2.0, NWT residents can enjoy free access to several e-mental health services at the time most convenient to them.\n\u2022 Breathing Room\u2122 \u2014 self-guided support to help youth reduce stress, anxiety, and depression \u2022 Strongest Families Institute \u2014 coaching programs for children, youth, adults, and families experiencing mild-to-moderate mental health and\u00a0behavioural\u00a0concerns \u2022 Edgewood Health Network Wagon \u2014 addictions\u00a0recovery aftercare support Within SC2.0, the NWT also promotes and partners with\u00a0several other initiatives, including Wellness\u00a0Together Canada and the 7 Cups, Root\u2019d, and\u00a0Stronger Minds apps.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 30 \u201cThey were very understanding, good to\u00a0work with, and worked around my schedule.

So far this year, the United States has already experienced 25 weather and climate disasters that each resulted in more than a billion dollars of damages, costing hundreds of lives and more than $73 billion total. For some extreme weather events like Hurricane Idalia and the fires in Hawai\u2018i, the full cost is not yet completely known. Actions taken by President Biden through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS for America Act are helping Americans prepare for, and respond to extreme weather events, as well as a spectrum of other climate-related challenges.\nClimate disasters that occur in one region of the United States can have cascading or compounding effects in other regions. For example, wildfires in one region can worsen air quality and health in other regions. When hazards occur in different regions but at the same time, such as the simultaneous megafires that burned across multiple western states and record back-to-back Atlantic hurricanes in 2020, these compounding disasters can put unprecedented demand on federal emergency response resources. Climate change also interacts with other stressors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and social inequities, which can multiply harm and further increase demand for resources that are needed when responding to disasters. This is particularly true for overburdened communities. These interactions can lead to cascading impacts that cross state and national borders. For example, both gradual changes in average climate conditions (e.g., shifts in temperature and precipitation) and extreme events (e.g., floods, droughts, and wildfire) can shock the global food supply chain and lead to food insecurity, geopolitical instability, and mass migration. These cascading and compounding impacts affect people\u2019s well-being, our economy, and our national security.\nIn addition to federal action, state, local, Tribal, and territorial efforts to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions have expanded in every U.S. region. Many of these actions advance climate mitigation and adaptation at the same time. Effective climate action has prioritized equitable and inclusive planning processes to help ensure that affected communities can participate in decision-making. Across the country, mitigation and adaptation efforts that build upon community strengths and center local and Indigenous Knowledge systems improve resilience.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Fifth National Climate Assessment includes ten regional chapters that assess climate risks and describe challenges, opportunities, and success stories for managing those risks. In addition, the new NCA Atlas allows users to explore localized climate projections to inform climate resilience, adaptation, and mitigation efforts in their communities.\nClimate Change Impacts in Regions Across America\nNortheast \u2014 Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia\nThis region is experiencing increases in the frequency of extreme weather events and other climate-driven changes, including intense rainstorms, warmer ocean temperatures, and rapid sea level rise. For example, the amount of rain that falls during the heaviest downpours has increased by approximately 60% in the Northeast since the 1950s\u2014the largest increase in the United States. Many regional climate impacts, including extreme heat and flooding, disproportionately impact low-income communities and communities of color. The region is responding with mitigation and adaptation efforts, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative\u2014a market-based program aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions; eight state laws requiring emissions reductions of at least 80% by 2050; and new financing options, such as grants, loans, or tax assessments, that improve the capacity of households, communities, and businesses to build climate resilience. Cities, states, and Tribes are implementing climate action plans with innovative approaches that embrace inclusive and equitable processes. For example, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\u2019s Climate Action Plan was developed with multi-year civic engagement opportunities, focuses on benefits of climate action that improve equity, and tracks progress through annual reports. The city\u2019s 2022 stormwater code requires any new development that could affect stormwater runoff to plan for projected increases in heavy rainfall under climate change, rather than building to historical rainfall amounts. Read more in Chapter 21: Northeast.\nSoutheast \u2014 Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia\nThis region\u2019s growing population faces rising sea levels and increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves that lead to greater risks of wildfires. Climate stressors, including drought and extreme heat, are expected to disproportionately affect communities of color and low-income communities who struggle to afford energy bills, especially for air conditioning. Due to increasing energy demands and extreme weather events, there is a growing number of power outages in the region that affect more than 1,000 residents for longer than an hour. This is especially true during the warmer months that place some communities at a higher risk of heat exposure and heat-related illness due to a lack of access to air conditioning. While adaptation efforts tend to be concentrated in wealthier coastal and metropolitan areas, there have been notable advancements in climate actions throughout the region. Following repeated flooding from multiple hurricanes, measures to reduce flood risk in Princeville, North Carolina, include buyouts, elevating homes, and building housing that meets local flood standards. In Orlando, Florida, the city government and businesses are adopting commercial building energy efficiency requirements and a community-wide commitment to 100% renewable energy to advance the decarbonization of local buildings. As the largest rental car market in the world, the metropolitan area has also adopted new electric vehicle readiness policies. Read more in Chapter 22: Southeast.\nU.S. Caribbean \u2014 Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands\nWarmer air and ocean temperatures are leading to intense hurricanes and increasingly powerful storms. The number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes is projected to increase as the climate crisis worsens. In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused more than $2.3 billion in losses and damages to crops and infrastructure, which represented a reduction of about 80% of the main island\u2019s total agricultural value. Paired with rising sea levels and other climate changes, these impacts are harming human health\u2014particularly in underserved communities; degrading, disrupting, and undermining the functions of ecosystems, especially in coastal zones; and threatening the region\u2019s water and food security. Critical infrastructure in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands is at risk of flooding due to sea level rise and heavy rainfall. Changes in precipitation and extreme events are expected to increase outbreaks of disease and can also disrupt vital local services, such as health care and water quality management. Across the region, many community-based organizations have taken actions to advance adaptation, social transformation, and sustainable development. Effective adaptation to support resilience in the region could be enhanced by decentralization of energy and water systems, improved governance and funding, and stronger partnerships across the Caribbean region and the U.S. mainland. For example, decentralized household solar systems and rainwater harvesting improve resilience by providing power and water during interruptions to the centralized utility grid or public water system.

These changes affect Midwestern ecosystems, agriculture, infrastructure, and human health, as well as livelihoods and cultural practices that rely on natural resources, including ice fishing or the harvesting of local plant species. Since 1980, the Midwest has incurred more than $49 billion in economic damages due to flooding. Although average corn and soybean yields have increased in recent decades, both flooding and extreme droughts significantly decreased corn yields in some locations and in some years by up to 37%. Over the past decade, clean energy production in the region has grown by more than 275% and has reduced carbon emissions from the energy sector. Communities, local and state governments, and businesses are embracing adaptation approaches that include green infrastructure, climate-smart agriculture, and collaboration with Tribes on land management issues to improve climate outcomes for all residents. For example, climate-smart agricultural approaches have the potential to increase production, improve resilience to climate-related risks, and yield additional benefits for Midwestern ecosystems. An innovative finance and construction approach being used by the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewer District has reduced the number of annual combined sewer overflow events over the last five years. Using a community-based public-private partnership, Milwaukee is now looking to add an additional 20 million gallons of green stormwater infrastructure capture capacity.

Climate change can affect floods along the Missouri River, like the ones in 2011 and 2019 that caused evacuations, costly damages, and interstate closures. With additional global warming, the region would expect to see some of the highest increases in annual flooding damage costs in the United States. At the same time, drought is projected to increase, with moderate to extreme droughts occurring as much as 20% more frequently by the end of the century. These changes threaten economic sectors, such as agriculture and recreation, and affect the mental and physical health of residents. The region\u2019s share of employees working in fossil fuel extraction is four times greater than in the nation as a whole. Shifts in energy demand, production, and policy will affect energy-related livelihoods for the region\u2019s residents, especially rural, Indigenous, and low-income immigrant populations, as opportunities in the clean energy field expand. Renewable energy production is on the rise in the Northern Great Plains, with the region supplying 12% of the total U.S. electricity generation from wind, biomass, and solar sources. In addition, the region is home to a number of Tribes who are leading the nation\u2019s clean energy transition by installing clean energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower. Read more in Chapter 25: Northern Great Plains.\nSouthern Great Plains \u2014 Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas\nIncreasing frequency and intensity of precipitation, warmer ocean temperatures, extreme heat, and rising sea levels are degrading the air, lands, and waters that people in the Southern Great Plains rely on for economic, recreational, and cultural activities. Annual precipitation has increased across most of the region, with Texas enduring its five wettest months on record between 2000 and 2021. By contrast, the region also experienced severe to exceptional drought for significant portions of the years between 2010 and 2022. Between 2018 and 2022, 52 individual billion-dollar climate-related disasters affected all or part of the region. By 2050, annual average temperatures are projected to exceed historical record levels in all three states. These impacts compound existing burdens on disadvantaged communities that have the fewest resources to prepare and adapt to climate change. Communities are adapting through nature-based solutions, reliance on Indigenous and local knowledge, and resilient infrastructure that enhances public health and the region\u2019s economy. In 2020, Oklahoma City produced its first sustainability plan to address climate change. Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas, Texas, adopted plans that included both mitigation and adaptation actions and have started to address local equity issues. Throughout the Southern Great Plains, a major shift in energy generation from fossil fuels toward renewables is underway, with the region accounting for 42% of national wind-generated electricity in 2022. This shift in the demand for clean energy is reducing emissions and creating new jobs and cleaner air in the region. Read more in Chapter 26: Southern Great Plains.\nNorthwest \u2014 Idaho, Oregon, Washington\nHigher temperatures are leading to declining snowpack, melting glaciers, and rising sea levels. These changes, combined with increasing risks of flooding, wildfires, and other climate hazards, threaten human health, ecosystems, infrastructure, and industries. For example, the record-breaking Pacific Northwest heatwave of June 2021 led to more than 1,400 heat-related deaths, a subsequent severe wildfire season, significant losses of economically important fishery species, and total damages exceeding $38.5 billion. Impacts on the Northwest\u2019s economy will have cascading effects on livelihoods and well-being of residents. For instance, snow-based recreational industries, such as skiing, have already lost revenue due to a decrease in snow days per calendar year. In parts of the Cascade Range, the snow season is projected to decrease by nearly half by the end of the century. In response to these changes, local governments, Tribes, labor unions, and community groups across the region are adopting policies and programs that support a just transition to a low-carbon future. State and local climate policies in the Northwest are prioritizing climate response strategies that recognize the importance of climate justice, such as subsidizing adaptation, redistributing benefits, and reducing harm to frontline communities. The Quinault Indian Nation is adapting to accelerated loss of land caused by sea level rise, flooding, and erosion along the central coast of Washington State by reacquiring fractionated land and relocating housing and key facilities from their traditional village site to a newly developed site at higher elevation. Read more in Chapter 27: Northwest.\nSouthwest \u2014 Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah\nClimate change is threatening water resources, increasing challenges to food and fiber production, and compromising human health in the Southwest through drought, wildfire, intense precipitation, sea level rise, and marine heatwaves. Since 2018, 31 climate- and weather-related disasters that have each resulted in more than a billion dollars in damages have affected the Southwest, resulting in more than 700 deaths and estimated damages totaling $67.3 billion. Climate-driven changes to infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries, and other economic sectors are impacting some communities disproportionately. These communities include farmers and ranchers, especially Hispanic, women, and migrant farmworkers; food-insecure households; Indigenous Peoples facing water access challenges; and coastal communities that are reliant on a declining population of traditional fish species. In response, state and local municipalities across the Southwest have implemented adaptive water governance and management approaches. After more than 22 years of historic drought, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation declared the first-ever water shortage on the Colorado River in August 2021. The federal governments of the United States and Mexico, the seven U.S. Colorado River basin states, and Indigenous Peoples are developing a range of adaptation pathways and solutions to enhance long-standing collaboration on the Colorado River, including modeling the impact of more extreme climate change scenarios on water resources in the basin. Efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are also being implemented throughout the region. For example, the Phoenix, Arizona Climate Action Plan states that the city is on track to meet its goal of 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Read more in Chapter 28: Southwest.\nAlaska\nAlaska is warming two to three times faster than the global average, with increases in annual average temperatures since 1971 as high as 6.2\u00b0F in northern Alaska. A 2019 summer heatwave brought record-high temperatures to southern and Interior Alaska, with daily high temperatures exceeding normal by more than 20\u00b0F. The Alaska snowfall season is projected to shorten and snowpack is projected to decrease significantly in the southern and western parts of the state. Warming temperatures, thawing permafrost, and other climate-related changes are damaging ecosystems, disrupting cultural practices, harming fisheries and other livelihoods, exacerbating health disparities, and placing critical infrastructure at risk. Many Alaskans, particularly Alaska Native Peoples, depend on natural resources and have a distinct connection to and understanding of the natural environment. While these communities foster self-reliance and resilience in light of a changing climate, geographical isolation and distance from health care and other services leave many people vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change. In recent years, Alaska has emerged as a leader of climate adaptation initiatives in the Arctic, many of which have been implemented by regional entities and municipal, community, and Tribal governments. For example, to address climate threats to traditional foods, the Chugach Regional Resources Commission, an inter-Tribal fish and wildlife commission in Alaska, is integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Western scientific methods in its adaptation efforts, including weekly water sampling for harmful algal blooms, kelp farming, and restoring clam populations. Community renewable energy initiatives like Thermalize Juneau and the Solarize initiatives in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Kenai, Mat-Su, and Palmer help residential and commercial property owners install solar capacity.

By 2050, fisheries catch are projected to decline by 40% compared to the early 2000s. These climate changes impair access to clean water and healthy food, undermine human health, threaten cultural resources and the built environment, exacerbate inequities, disrupt economic activity, and damage diverse ecosystems across the region. Strategies are being developed and implemented across the region to revitalize healthier traditional food systems, resulting in more just access to food. Subsistence-based food system practices have sustained Pacific Island peoples for millennia and have aided in recoveries from natural disasters such as typhoons and tsunamis. Other promising fisheries adaptations include establishing networks of marine protected areas to preserve coastal resources, safeguarding fish habitats from pollution runoff, and restoring traditional fishpond mariculture. To help mitigate climate change, the Kaua\u02bbi Island Utility Cooperative achieved a nearly 70% renewable portfolio standard in 2021, and the island is sometimes 100% renewably powered during midday hours. Meanwhile, U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands plan to use blue carbon ecosystems, including mangroves and seagrasses, to offset emissions while also protecting coastal infrastructure.

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites.\r\n                            \nIncome, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2023\nIncome, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2023\nSEPT. 10, 2024\u00a0\u2014 The U.S. Census Bureau today announced that real median household income increased by 4.0% between 2022 and 2023. This is the first statistically significant annual increase in real median household income since 2019. The official poverty rate fell 0.4 percentage points, to 11.1%, in 2023. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) rate in 2023 was 12.9%, an increase of 0.5 percentage points from 2022. Meanwhile, 92.0% of the U.S. population had health insurance coverage for all or part of 2023, not statistically different from 2022. An estimated 26.4 million or 8.0% of people did not have health insurance at any point during 2023, according to the 2024 Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC), also not statistically different from the previous year.\nThese findings come from three Census Bureau reports:\u00a0Income in the United States: 2023; Poverty in the United States: 2023; and\u00a0Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2023. While the official poverty measure is based on the concept of money income, which is pretax and does not include tax credits, the SPM is a post-tax and transfer poverty measure. The SPM provides an alternative way of measuring poverty in the United States and serves as an additional indicator of economic well-being. The Census Bureau has published poverty estimates using the SPM annually since 2011 in collaboration with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nFor consistency with past reports, the income estimates in the \u201cIncome in the United States: 2023\u201d report are based on the concept of money income. Appendix B of the income report provides post-tax estimates of median household income and income inequality metrics.\nAll three reports are based on data from the CPS ASEC. The\u00a0Current Population Survey\u00a0(CPS), sponsored jointly by the\u00a0Census Bureau\u00a0and\u00a0BLS, is conducted every month and is the primary source of labor force statistics for the U.S. population. It is used to calculate monthly unemployment rate estimates. Supplements are added in most months. The CPS ASEC \u2014 conducted in February, March and April \u2014 is designed to provide annual, national estimates of income, poverty and health insurance estimates, collecting information about job status, income and health insurance coverage during the prior calendar year.\nAlthough the 2024 ASEC was collected using standard procedures, response rates are still lower than they were before the pandemic. The response rate for the CPS basic household survey declined from 68.9% in March 2023 to 67.2% in March 2024.\nSince the response rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, which were regularly above 80%, it is important to examine how respondents differ from nonrespondents, as this difference could affect the accuracy of the estimates. For more details on how sample difference and the associated nonresponse bias impact income and official poverty estimates, refer to the Research Matters blog, \u201cUsing Administrative Data to Evaluate Nonresponse Bias in the 2024 Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement.\u201d\nIncome \nIncome estimates are based on the concept of money income and do not account for the value of in-kind transfers. They are pretax, unless otherwise indicated.\n\u00a0\nThe female-to-male earnings ratio compares the median earnings of women working full-time, year-round to the median earnings of men working full-time, year-round.\nPost-tax income is defined as money income net of federal and state taxes and credits, payroll taxes (FICA) and temporary cash payments administered by tax agencies like rebates or stimulus payments. Appendix B of the income report compares household median income and inequality measures based on post-tax income.\nPoverty\nAs defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Statistical Poverty Directive 14 and updated for inflation using the Consumer Price Index, the weighted average poverty threshold for a family of four in 2023 was $30,900 (Refer to <www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html> for the complete set of dollar value thresholds that vary by family size and composition).\u00a0\nThe SPM extends the official poverty measure by accounting for several government programs that are designed to assist low-income families but are not included in official poverty measure calculations. The SPM also accounts for geographic variation in housing expenses when calculating the poverty thresholds and includes federal and state taxes, work expenses, and medical expenses. The SPM does not replace the official poverty measure; however, it does provide a different metric of economic well-being that includes resources from government programs and tax credits to low-income families.\nHealth Insurance\nThe CPS ASEC asks people about health insurance coverage during the previous calendar year. People are considered insured if they were covered by any type of health insurance for part or all of the previous calendar year. People are considered uninsured if, for the entire year, they were not covered by any type of insurance. Among the findings:\nRegional estimates are available for income, poverty and health insurance coverage in each respective report. Tables showing state-level poverty and SPM rates using three-year averages are available in the press kit.\nThe CPS ASEC is subject to sampling and nonsampling errors. All comparisons made here and in each respective report have been tested and found to be statistically significant at the 90% confidence level, unless otherwise noted.\nAdditional information on the source of the data and accuracy of the income, poverty and health insurance estimates is available at <https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/techdocs/cpsmar24.pdf>.\n\n###\nShare\nContact\nPatricia Ramos\nPublic Information Office\n301-763-3030 or\n877-861-2010 (U.S. and Canada only)\npio@census.gov\nTop\nReceive Updates\nTo sign up for updates please enter your email address.\nStay Current\nAmerica Counts\nDirector\u2019s Blog\nDeputy Director\u2019s Blog\nRandom Samplings\nResearch Matters\nStay Connected\nContact\nSupport\nJobs\nFollow\nMeasuring America's People, Places, and Economy\n",

This ratio compares family income to a poverty threshold based on the age and number of family members.\nPeople are classified as being in poverty if their family income is less than the poverty threshold. Family resources may determine the ability to afford private health insurance, and families below certain thresholds may qualify for public health insurance, such as Medicaid.\nAge may also factor into individuals\u2019 access to health insurance coverage and type.\nChildren under age 19 may have health coverage through a variety of sources, including a parent\u2019s private plan or public programs like Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\nAdults ages 19 to 64 generally have lower coverage rates than those under age 19 and adults age 65 and older. That\u2019s because their coverage is often directly tied to employment. They do not qualify for programs intended for children and only qualify for public programs under specific medical or income-level circumstances.\nHealth Insurance Coverage by Age and Income-to-Poverty Ratio\nFrom 2020 to 2023, the share of children under 19 and working-age adults ages 19 to 64 with health coverage differed depending on income and poverty levels.\nAmong those who lived below the poverty level:\n\nMost children under 19 and working-age adults had public insurance. In each year, over three-quarters of children under 19 and about half of working-age adults in poverty had public coverage.\nThe uninsured rate of children under 19 in poverty ranged from 8.3% to 10.3% between 2020 and 2023.\nAbout a quarter of working-age adults in poverty were uninsured each year between 2020 and 2023.\n\n\n\nAmong those living in families with incomes between 100% and 399% of poverty thresholds:\n\nMore than half of children under 19 and working-age adults had private insurance.\nThe percentage of children under 19 with public insurance rose from 42.3% in 2020 to 45% in 2023.\nAbout a quarter of working-age adults had public insurance from 2020 to 2023.\nThe uninsured rate among children under 19 dipped between 2020 and 2022 from 7.0% to 6.1% and was 6.7% in 2023.\nThe uninsured rate for working-age adults fell from 17.3% in 2020 to 15.2% in 2022, increasing to 16.1% in 2023.\n\n\n\nAmong those in families with incomes in the highest income-to-poverty ratio group (at or above 400% of poverty):\n\nOver 90% of children under 19 and working-age adults had private insurance.\nThe share of children under 19 with public insurance rose from 5.9% in 2020 to 6.8% in 2023.\nThe share of working-age adults with public insurance rose from 5.2% in 2020 to 6% in 2023 while their uninsured rate fell from 4.5% to 4% during this period.\n\n\n\nDefinitions and more information on confidentiality protection and sampling and nonsampling error are available in the\u00a0technical documentation.\nAll comparative statements in this article have undergone statistical testing and, unless otherwise noted, are statistically significant at the 10% significance level.\nLisa Bunch and Halelujha Ketema are survey statisticians and Katherine Keisler-Starkey is an economist in the Census Bureau\u2019s Health and Disability Statistics Branch.\nThis article was filed under:\nAge\nData Equity\nHealth\nHealth Insurance\nIncome and Poverty\nPopulation\nRelated Statistics\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts Story America Counts: Stories about Health Insurance Stories featured behind the numbers for Health Insurance.\n\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts: Stories about Income & Poverty\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS) The CPS is a monthly survey sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts Story Data Equity Stories We feature stories on various topics such as families, housing, employment, business, education, the economy, emergency management, and population.\n\n\n\nSubscribe\nOur email newsletter is sent out on the day we publish a story.

Savings of \u20ac3.5 billion\nThe government plans to save billions across the healthcare sector, including \u20ac600 million on hospital spending, \u20ac1.3 billion on healthcare products and medicine prices, \u20ac300 million on outpatient care (particularly on analysis laboratories), and \u20ac1.25 billion on \u2018making professionals and patients more responsible\u2019, or \u2018self-sufficient\u2019.\nDespite this, however, health insurance expenditure is still set to represent 8.7% of GDP in 2024, compared with 8.2% before the Covid-19 health crisis.\n2. More measures against social security fraud\nAlso on the government\u2019s list is the \u2018under-declaration\u2019 of turnover by micro-entrepreneurs employed by digital platforms.\nThis is estimated to equal a loss of revenue of \u20ac800 million. By 2027 platforms will be required to deduct these contributions directly, the government has said. The bill will also introduce the offences of 00\u2018incitement to social fraud\u2019 as well as the \u2018promotion and facilitation of fraud\u2019.\n3. Single-pill dispensing in the event of shortages\nIn the event that a medicine is in short supply, pharmacists may be required to dispense single-dose, or specific tablet quantities, of a medicine. Pharmacists will have to dispense \u2018the appropriate quantity\u2019 according to the patient's prescription, rather than a whole box.\nThe government may also make it compulsory to carry out a test rapide d'orientation diagnostique (TROD, rapid diagnostic test) when dispensing certain antibiotics, to ensure that antibiotics are only prescribed when appropriate.\nOn the other hand, testing will also mean that pharmacists will be able to check for issues such as strep throat and cystitis, and dispense antibiotics for these conditions without a doctor's prescription.\nRead more: Shortages of 4,000 medicines in France; what risk for this winter?\n4. Tighter controls on sick leave\nTighter rules on sick leave will mean that companies will have the power to appoint their own examining doctor, who will be authorised to suspend the payment of benefits to the patient on sick leave if they consider the absence to be unjustified. The Assurance maladie may also carry out a second examination.\nSick leave signed off via teleconsultation (video call) will be limited to three days at a time, except for those prescribed by the company\u2019s own appointed doctor.\nRead more: Doctors under fire over number of sick days they grant French workers\n5. \u2018Temporary status\u2019 for therapeutic cannabis\nTherapeutic cannabis - cannabis that is used to help treat health conditions, such as chronic pain - has been granted \u2018temporary status\u2019 for five years, pending a decision from European authorities on its marketing authorisation.\nSome European countries have already authorised medical cannabis to calm pain and anxiety for some patients. However, it was previously only authorised in France as part of an experiment, which had been due to end on March 26, 2024.\nRead more: Medical cannabis gets go-ahead for pain relief in French hospitals\n6. More widespread use of shared medical transport\nThe new bill states that patients who refuse to share a health transport service (light medical vehicle or approved taxi) with another patient without a valid medical reason will have to pay in advance.\nThey will also only be reimbursed on the basis of the price of shared transport, rather than a solo service.\n7. Different sources of hospital funding\nThe new budget is set to introduce two new funding methods for hospitals. One will be based on \u2018public health objectives\u2019 and the other on \u2018specific missions\u2019 (not yet revealed).\nThis reform will not begin to apply in full until January 1, 2025.\n8. Reimbursed physical activity sessions for cancer patients\nCancer patients will benefit from reimbursed physical activity sessions to help support their treatment journey. The scheme will initially be trialled for two years, on an experimental basis.\n9. Menstrual underwear and cups reimbursed\nReusable sanitary protection (menstrual pants and menstrual cups) will now be reimbursed for women under the age of 26, and all women covered by the Compl\u00e9mentaire sant\u00e9 solidaire scheme.\nCondoms will also be free for all insured persons under the age of 26.\n10. Systematic screening for pregnant women\nPregnant women will now be systematically screened for cytomegalovirus (CMV).This is a virus that can affect foetal development.\nIn addition, a three-year trial of a care pathway dedicated to post-partum depression - a serious condition that can range from \u2018baby blues\u2019 to severe psychosis - has also been added.\nRelated articles\nFrance\u2019s 2024 budget plans for healthcare: What could change for you?\nMore tax on alcohol, sick pay: what will France\u2019s 2024 budget change?\nWill sports sessions be reimbursable throughout France?\n\n\n\ngovernment funding\ngovernment\nfrench news\nbudget\nparliament\nhealth\n\nRunners join Nice-Cannes Marathon to fund English-language cancer support services in Alpes-Maritimes \nWet, overcast and blustery weather is forecast for most of the country\nThe door, window and joinery chain has gone into administration and cannot fulfil orders or reimburse customers\nMarathon effort boosts cancer support in France\n\n\n    Runners join Nice-Cannes Marathon to fund English-language cancer support services in Alpes-Maritimes \n\nLetters: French GP is charging more than he should for consultation\n\n\n    Connexion reader says her doctor is already asking for \u20ac30 per visit\n\n\nFrench winter warmer recipes: Boeuf bourguignon \n\n\n    This delicious beef stew braised in red wine is a standard of Parisian bistros\n\nSmartphone SOS alert saves driver's life in France after crash\n\n\n    Crash Detection system is triggered by violent movement and sends message to emergency services\n\nRevered French national icon falls from grace\n\n\n    Celebrated anti-poverty and homelessness campaigner Abb\u00e9 Pierre was voted France\u2019s most popular person for many years, but sexual abuse accusations have shattered the activist priest\u2019s crusading legacy\n\nEU faces legal challenge from French lawyer over weedkiller sale decision\n\n\n    Corinne Lepage fighting decision to allow glyphosate to be sold in Europe for another 10 years\n\nFrance's first national park is an outdoor haven\n\n\n    Discover the breathtaking landscapes and rich biodiversity of Parc National de la Vanoise, in the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region\n\nImprove your language skills with these five French tongue twisters\n\n\n    As well as being a fun party trick, these can help you master pronunciation of difficult sounds\n\nChild health booklets in France will be updated to include risks of screen time\n\n\n    Report by experts recommends banning screens for children under the age of three\n\nHow many bank holidays does France get vs Europe and US?\n\n\n    See how France compares as MPs debate taking away one of the country\u2019s jours f\u00e9ri\u00e9s\n\nBeaujolais Nouveau: France\u2019s youngest, freshest and fruitiest wine\n\n\n    Producer Laurent Metge-Toppin shares ten facts to help you appreciate the once-maligned tipple\n\n\nMany French hospitals trial fingertip test for heart disease\n\n\n    Test takes 15 minutes and can detect early signs of the disease\n\nSNCF train tickets open for early 2025 bookings\n\n\n    International destinations and skiing stations within France are included in the seats now available\n\nIgnoring this increasingly common French road sign could cost you \u20ac135\n\n\n    New driving rule relates to areas designated a zone \u00e0 trafic limit\u00e9\n\nFrench farmer protests: what action is planned and where on November 18?\n\n\n    Major unions are demonstrating against the Mercosur trade deal in a bid to pressure the government to provide more support\n\nFrance\u2019s 2025 budget will \u2018probably\u2019 be forced through without vote, says PM\n\n\n    Right-wing MPs rejected taxation section of the budget earlier this week\n\n\nFrench study tests psychedelics in alcoholism therapy\n\n\n    A groundbreaking experiment explores how psilocybin can be used to combat depressive symptoms in alcohol recovery\n\nHow your pet can be a blood donor in France\n\n\n    Veterinary hospitals say it is crucial to treat sick cats and dogs and it is easy to sign up your pet\n\nLetters: French cycling rules are rarely enforced\n\n\n    Connexion reader says he takes special precautions to stay safe\n\nStrepsils, Olbas Oil, TCP: Find French equivalents to common remedies\n\n\n    Moving to France means navigating pharmacies and hunting down alternatives to treat everyday ailments\n\nBriton applies for French residency card and finds he was adopted -

December 2023 - 12:40 Modified wednesday 06. December 2023 - 12:40\nDel p\u00e5 Facebook Del p\u00e5 Twitter Del p\u00e5 e-post\nThe French parliament has officially adopted its healthcare budget for 2024, including measures to cap spending, address medicine shortages, and limit social security fraud.\nThe budget de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale, sometimes shortened to the \u2018S\u00e9cu\u2019 budget, was adopted on December 4 after the Assembl\u00e9e nationale rejected a motion of no confidence against the government after Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne once again used the controversial article 49.3 to pass the bill.\nRead more: What is France\u2019s article 49.3?\nThere are 113 articles in total, but the major measures include more stringent checks on sick leave and social security fraud, and the enabling of pharmacists to dispense of medicines pill-by-pill (rather than entire boxes) in the event of shortages.\nHere are the 10 key measures and aims.\n1. Savings of \u20ac3.5 billion\nThe government plans to save billions across the healthcare sector, including \u20ac600 million on hospital spending, \u20ac1.3 billion on healthcare products and medicine prices, \u20ac300 million on outpatient care (particularly on analysis laboratories), and \u20ac1.25 billion on \u2018making professionals and patients more responsible\u2019, or \u2018self-sufficient\u2019.\nDespite this, however, health insurance expenditure is still set to represent 8.7% of GDP in 2024, compared with 8.2% before the Covid-19 health crisis.\n2. More measures against social security fraud\nAlso on the government\u2019s list is the \u2018under-declaration\u2019 of turnover by micro-entrepreneurs employed by digital platforms.\nAd\nThis is estimated to equal a loss of revenue of \u20ac800 million. By 2027 platforms will be required to deduct these contributions directly, the government has said. The bill will also introduce the offences of 00\u2018incitement to social fraud\u2019 as well as the \u2018promotion and facilitation of fraud\u2019.\n3. Single-pill dispensing in the event of shortages\nIn the event that a medicine is in short supply, pharmacists may be required to dispense single-dose, or specific tablet quantities, of a medicine. Pharmacists will have to dispense \u2018the appropriate quantity\u2019 according to the patient's prescription, rather than a whole box.\nThe government may also make it compulsory to carry out a test rapide d'orientation diagnostique (TROD, rapid diagnostic test) when dispensing certain antibiotics, to ensure that antibiotics are only prescribed when appropriate.\nOn the other hand, testing will also mean that pharmacists will be able to check for issues such as strep throat and cystitis, and dispense antibiotics for these conditions without a doctor's prescription.\nRead more: Shortages of 4,000 medicines in France; what risk for this winter?\n4. Tighter controls on sick leave\nTighter rules on sick leave will mean that companies will have the power to appoint their own examining doctor, who will be authorised to suspend the payment of benefits to the patient on sick leave if they consider the absence to be unjustified. The Assurance maladie may also carry out a second examination.\nSick leave signed off via teleconsultation (video call) will be limited to three days at a time, except for those prescribed by the company\u2019s own appointed doctor.\nRead more: Doctors under fire over number of sick days they grant French workers\n5. \u2018Temporary status\u2019 for therapeutic cannabis\nTherapeutic cannabis - cannabis that is used to help treat health conditions, such as chronic pain - has been granted \u2018temporary status\u2019 for five years, pending a decision from European authorities on its marketing authorisation.\nSome European countries have already authorised medical cannabis to calm pain and anxiety for some patients. However, it was previously only authorised in France as part of an experiment, which had been due to end on March 26, 2024.\nRead more: Medical cannabis gets go-ahead for pain relief in French hospitals\n6. More widespread use of shared medical transport\nThe new bill states that patients who refuse to share a health transport service (light medical vehicle or approved taxi) with another patient without a valid medical reason will have to pay in advance.\nThey will also only be reimbursed on the basis of the price of shared transport, rather than a solo service.\n7. Different sources of hospital funding\nThe new budget is set to introduce two new funding methods for hospitals. One will be based on \u2018public health objectives\u2019 and the other on \u2018specific missions\u2019 (not yet revealed).\nThis reform will not begin to apply in full until January 1, 2025.\n8. Reimbursed physical activity sessions for cancer patients\nCancer patients will benefit from reimbursed physical activity sessions to help support their treatment journey. The scheme will initially be trialled for two years, on an experimental basis.\n9. Menstrual underwear and cups reimbursed\nReusable sanitary protection (menstrual pants and menstrual cups) will now be reimbursed for women under the age of 26, and all women covered by the Compl\u00e9mentaire sant\u00e9 solidaire scheme.\nCondoms will also be free for all insured persons under the age of 26.\n10. Systematic screening for pregnant women\nPregnant women will now be systematically screened for cytomegalovirus (CMV).This is a virus that can affect foetal development.\nIn addition, a three-year trial of a care pathway dedicated to post-partum depression - a serious condition that can range from \u2018baby blues\u2019 to severe psychosis - has also been added.\nRelated articles\nFrance\u2019s 2024 budget plans for healthcare: What could change for you?\nMore tax on alcohol, sick pay: what will France\u2019s 2024 budget change?\nWill sports sessions be reimbursable throughout France?\n\u2715\ngovernment funding government french news budget parliament health\nDel p\u00e5 Facebook Del p\u00e5 Twitter Del p\u00e5 e-post\nAd\ngovernment funding government french news budget parliament health\n\n#### People in France giving more to charity in 2024 than 2023 The most popular causes are medical research and animal protection\n #### When do the clocks change in France this month?

Power\nTroy, Mich.\u2014While customer satisfaction with the dealer service experience has rebounded this year, dealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments, according to the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) Study. Overall customer service satisfaction improves five points to 851 (on a 1,000-point scale).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an improvement in service satisfaction but, unfortunately, the capacity and wait time issues have gotten progressively worse since the pandemic and show no immediate signs of easing up,\u201d said\u00a0Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power. \u201cExcluding Tesla owners, the service experience for BEV owners is underwhelming. As sales of BEVs continue to grow and the industry moves out of the early-adopter phase, the typical owner will not be as willing to tolerate a less-than-stellar service and ownership experience.\n\n\u201cOn the manufacturer side, a higher rate of BEV recalls is also contributing to an inconsistent experience. This is an area that automakers and dealers need to address now to help make the transition to electrification as pain-free as possible for owners in the future.\u201d\nContributing to the poor service experience of non-Tesla BEV owners is a notable lack of trust with servicing dealers to perform complex repairs and provide useful guidance. Overall dealer trust among non-Tesla BEV owners is 5.62 (on a 7-point scale) but jumps to 6.00 among owners of gas-powered vehicles owners and 5.74 among plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners.\n\nThe study, now in its 44th\u00a0year, has grown to include emerging features such as valet service, mobile vehicle servicing and online/smartphone app payment options to gauge the effect these processes have on the service experience. The study measures satisfaction with service at franchised dealer or aftermarket service facilities for maintenance or repair work among owners and lessees of one- to three-year-old vehicles.\nIt also provides a numerical index ranking of the highest-performing automotive brands sold in the United States, which is based on the combined scores of five measures that comprise the vehicle owner service experience. These measures are (in order of importance): service quality; service advisor; vehicle pick-up; service facility; and service initiation. In 2023, model segment rankings were added to the study to differentiate between the service needs of cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans.\nFollowing are key findings of the 2024 study:\nHighest-Ranking Brands and Segments\n\u2022 Lexus\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among premium brands for a third consecutive year, with a score of 897.\u00a0Porsche\u00a0(894) ranks second and\u00a0Cadillac\u00a0(883) ranks third.\n\u2022 Buick\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among mass market brands with a score of 887.\u00a0MINI\u00a0(884) ranks second and\u00a0Subaru\u00a0(877) ranks third.\n\u2022 MINI (877) ranks highest in the mass market car segment, followed by Subaru (874) and\u00a0Mazda\u00a0(867).\n\u2022 Buick ranks highest among mass market SUVs/minivans with a score of 887.\u00a0Mitsubishi\u00a0(877) and Subaru (877) each rank second in a tie.\n\u2022 Porsche (902) ranks highest in the premium car segment, followed by\u00a0Infiniti\u00a0(900) and Lexus (892).\n\u2022 Lexus ranks highest in the premium SUV segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 898. Porsche (889) ranks second and Cadillac (882) ranks third.Nissan\u00a0ranks highest in the truck segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 873.\u00a0Chevrolet\u00a0(856) ranks second and\u00a0Toyota\u00a0(855) ranks third.\n\n\n\n\nNo results found.\nGet The Newsletter\ncontact a sales person\nSupport Center\nMOTOR Magazine\n\u00a9 2024 Hearst Business Publishing, Inc. | \r\n                         Privacy policy | \r\n                         MEDIA | \r\n                         Black Book\n",

This classification helps businesses prioritize their resources and focus on the most critical items.\nAn Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN), sometimes referred to as Advance Ship Notice, is a notification sent by a supplier or manufacturer to a customer or retailer to provide detailed information about a pending shipment. The ASN serves as an electronic document that outlines the contents of the shipment before it physically arrives at the destination. \nAn agile supply chain is a flexible and responsive approach to supply chain management that enables organizations to quickly adapt to changing market conditions, customer demands, and disruptions. It focuses on enhancing speed, efficiency, and adaptability throughout the entire supply chain process, from sourcing raw materials to delivering finished products to customers.\nAn air waybill (AWB) is a vital logistics document used in air freight transportation. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper (consignor) and the airline (carrier), detailing the terms and conditions of air transportation for the shipment. The air waybill contains essential information such as the origin and destination of the cargo, the description of goods, the weight, and the freight charges.\nAn arrival notice is a notification sent by a carrier or freight forwarder to inform consignees or recipients that a shipment has arrived at its destination port or facility. This notice serves as an important communication tool in the supply chain, providing recipients with essential information about the arrival of their goods and detailing the next steps for delivery or pickup.\nAn Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a tracking system used in the maritime industry to monitor the location and movement of ships. AIS provides real-time information about vessel identification, position, course, and speed. \n\u00e2\u0080\u008dBackhauling is a transportation logistics practice where trucks carry a return load on their way back from delivering goods to their destination. Instead of returning empty, trucks utilize their empty space to transport goods from the destination back to the point of origin or another destination along the route. \nIn supply chain management, \"backorder\" refers to a situation where a customer places an order for a product that is temporarily unavailable in the seller's inventory. When an item is on backorder, it means the customer's order cannot be fulfilled immediately due to insufficient stock levels.\n\nA bay plan is a diagram that details the stowage of containers on a vessel, specifying their exact position by bay, row, and tier to ensure efficient and safe loading and unloading operations.\nA Beneficial Cargo Owner (BCO) is the entity with ownership or a beneficial interest in transported goods. While not always the shipper, the BCO reaps the benefits of the cargo's arrival. \nA bill of lading (B/L) is a legal document issued by a carrier or its agent to acknowledge receipt of goods for shipment. It serves as a contract between the shipper (seller) and the carrier (transport provider), detailing the terms and conditions of transportation, including the type, quantity, and destination of the goods.\nBlank sailing is a term used to describe the situation when a shipping line cancels a scheduled port call or an entire voyage. This can happen for various reasons, such as low demand for shipping services, operational issues, or unforeseen circumstances like bad weather or port congestion.\nA blind shipment refers to a logistics practice where certain details about the shipment, such as the sender, receiver, or contents, are intentionally obscured or withheld from one or both parties involved in the transaction. This is typically done to maintain confidentiality or to prevent competitors from obtaining sensitive information about suppliers, customers, or pricing.\nA bonded warehouse is a secured facility authorized by customs authorities where imported goods can be stored, manipulated, or undergo manufacturing operations without payment of duty.\nA booking confirmation is a document that verifies the reservation of space for cargo on a carrier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vessel, flight, or truck, ensuring all shipping arrangements are approved and scheduled.\nA request for reservation of space and equipment for a particular vessel/voyage and possibly inland transport.\nBreak bulk cargo refers to goods that are individually packaged or bundled, rather than being transported in containers or in bulk. These items are often large or irregular in size and include products like machinery, vehicles, construction materials, or heavy equipment. \nBuffer stock, also known as inventory buffer or stock buffer, refers to the extra inventory held by a company to mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by uncertainties in supply and demand. It acts as a cushion against fluctuations in customer demand, supply chain disruptions, and variations in lead times.\nBulk cargo refers to commodities that are transported unpackaged in large quantities, typically stored and handled in bulk form, rather than in individual units or containers. This category of cargo is crucial in global trade, especially for goods that are homogeneous and not easily damaged during transportation.\nThe bullwhip effect, also known as demand amplification or whiplash effect, is a phenomenon that occurs in supply chains where small fluctuations in demand at the consumer level lead to exaggerated fluctuations in demand further upstream in the supply chain. This amplification of demand variability causes inefficiencies, such as excess inventory, stockouts, and increased costs, as supply chain partners overreact to perceived demand changes.\nCIF, or Cost, Insurance, and Freight, is an international shipping agreement used in the transportation of goods. In freight shipping, CIF means that the seller takes responsibility for the cost of transporting goods to the buyer's destination port. This includes paying for shipping, handling, and insurance. The seller's obligations end when the goods reach the destination port, at which point the buyer assumes responsibility for customs clearance, import duties, and any further transport to their final destination.\nA Capesize ship is a large bulk carrier vessel designed to transport heavy raw materials across long distances, too large to transit through canals like the Panama or Suez.\nThe action of allowing cargo to leave the container yard typically authorized by the carrier. This is often confused with gate-out, but cargo release is the authorization necessary before shipments can be allowed to gate-out.\nA cargo survey is an inspection process that assesses the condition and quantity of goods during transportation to ensure compliance with shipping terms and prevent disputes.\nA shipping carrier is an organization that provides transportation services for goods. They manage the logistics of moving cargo, which includes loading, transporting, and delivering goods to the specified location. Shipping carriers handle various types of shipments, from small packages to large freight consignments, using different modes of transportation such as maritime, air, rail, and road.\nCarrier haulage refers to a transportation arrangement where the carrier, typically the ocean shipping line or its designated transport provider, is responsible for arranging and paying for the inland transportation of containers. In this scenario, the carrier takes charge of moving the container from the port of discharge to the final destination or vice versa, using their own transportation assets or subcontracted carriers.\nA carrier scorecard is a performance measurement tool used by supply chain and logistics professionals to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of their freight carriers. It provides a standardized way to assess carriers based on various performance metrics, helping organizations make informed decisions about their logistics partners\nA certificate of origin is a document issued by an authorized body or organization that certifies the country in which the goods being shipped were manufactured, produced, or processed.

It serves as a formal request for payment from the buyer to the seller and is essential for customs clearance and regulatory compliance.\nIn shipping, a commodity refers to bulk goods or raw materials that are transported in large volumes as part of global trade.\nIn the realm of supply chain and logistics, the term \"Consignee\" refers to the individual, company, or entity to whom a shipment of goods is delivered. The consignee is the designated recipient or receiver of the goods, typically identified by name and address on shipping documents such as the bill of lading or delivery order.\nConsignment inventory is a supply chain arrangement where a supplier (consignor) retains ownership of goods while they are held at a customer's (consignee's) location. The consignee only pays for the goods when they are sold or consumed, and the supplier retains responsibility for managing and replenishing the inventory as needed.\nIn shipping and logistics, a consignor refers to the entity or person who is the sender or shipper of goods. The consignor is responsible for initiating the shipment of goods from one location to another, typically to a consignee or recipient.\nA container depot is a facility used for the storage, maintenance, and repair of empty shipping containers when they are not actively in use for transportation.\nContainer discharge is the process of unloading shipping containers from a vessel at a port, using cranes and other equipment, for onward transportation.\nA container freight station (CFS) is a designated facility where goods are received, sorted, and prepared for onward transportation, enhancing efficiency in logistics operations.\nShipping container grades classify containers based on their condition and suitability for transporting goods, ranging from cargo-worthy to as-is quality.\nA container packing certificate is a document that verifies the proper packing and loading of goods into a shipping container. It attests that the contents have been securely packed, arranged, and secured according to industry standards and regulatory requirements. Obtaining a container packing certificate is crucial for compliance with international shipping regulations and contractual obligations. It provides assurance that the goods have been properly prepared for transport, minimizing the risk of delays, damages, or disputes during the shipment process.\nA container rollover occurs when a shipping container is not loaded onto its scheduled vessel and is instead 'rolled over' to a subsequent vessel. This delay means the container misses its intended departure and must wait for the next available sailing, which can significantly impact lead times and delivery schedules.\nContainer stripping (devanning) is the process of unloading cargo from a shipping container at its destination for inspection, storage, or further distribution.\nContainer stuffing is the process of loading cargo into a shipping container in a safe and space-efficient manner for transportation.\nCross docking is a logistics strategy where incoming goods from suppliers are unloaded from incoming trucks or containers and directly loaded onto outbound trucks or trailers, with minimal or no storage time in between. Essentially, it involves transferring goods directly from the inbound dock to the outbound dock, bypassing the need for traditional warehousing storage.\nA customs broker is a licensed professional who specializes in facilitating the clearance of goods through customs barriers for importers and exporters. Acting as intermediaries between businesses and customs authorities, customs brokers ensure compliance with regulations and smooth passage of goods across international borders.\nCustoms clearance refers to the process of fulfilling the legal requirements necessary to facilitate the import or export of goods across international borders. This procedure ensures that shipments comply with local laws and regulations, allowing them to enter or leave a country legally. It involves various documentation, inspections, and payments of duties and taxes.\nA customs manifest lists in detail all the bills of lading issued by a carrier, its agent or master for a specific voyage and port call. It is a detailed summary of the total cargo of a vessel and is used principally for customs purposes. It acts as a declaration to customs authorities, ensuring compliance with regulations and facilitating smooth movement of goods through ports and checkpoints.\nThe latest point in time where a container has to be delivered to a terminal to be loaded on a vessel, or where certain documentation has to be provided by the Shipper.Example: CY cut-off, FCL cut-off, VGM cut-off, DG cut-off.\nCycle counting is a methodical approach to inventory management where a subset of inventory is counted on a continuous basis, typically throughout the year. Unlike traditional annual or periodic inventory counts that halt operations, cycle counting allows businesses to maintain regular operations while ensuring accurate stock levels.\nDAP, or Delivered At Place, is a term used in international trade that specifies the seller's obligation to deliver goods to a designated location in the buyer's country. In DAP terms, the seller is responsible for all costs and risks associated with delivering the goods to the agreed-upon destination. This includes arranging transportation, handling charges, and insurance up to the point of delivery. The buyer, however, is responsible for unloading the goods, handling customs clearance, and paying any import duties and taxes once the goods arrive at the destination.\nDDP (Delivered Duty Paid) shipping terms dictate that the seller assumes all responsibilities and costs associated with delivering the goods to the buyer's specified destination. This includes transportation, insurance, handling charges, and import duties and taxes. Essentially, the seller handles everything from the point of origin to the final delivery location, ensuring the goods arrive ready for use by the buyer without any additional costs or logistical burdens.\nDDU, or Delivered Duty Unpaid, is an international shipping term that defines the responsibilities of the seller and buyer. Under DDU terms, the seller delivers the goods to a specified destination in the buyer's country, covering all costs and risks associated with transportation, except for duties, taxes, and other import charges which are the responsibility of the buyer. The seller's obligations include arranging and paying for freight, insurance, and handling charges until the goods reach the agreed-upon place.\nDPU, or Delivered at Place Unloaded, is a term used in international trade that specifies the seller's responsibility to deliver and unload goods at a designated location in the buyer's country. Under DPU terms, the seller bears all costs and risks associated with transporting and unloading the goods at the agreed destination. This includes all transportation costs, including freight, insurance, and handling charges, up to and including the unloading of the goods at the destination. The buyer then takes over responsibility for import duties, taxes, customs clearance, and any further transport to the final destination. \nA dangerous goods declaration (DGD) is a legal document required for the transportation of hazardous materials or dangerous goods by air, sea, road, or rail. It provides detailed information about the nature, classification, packaging, and handling requirements of the dangerous goods being transported. The DGD helps ensure compliance with international regulations and facilitates the safe handling and transport of hazardous materials throughout the supply chain.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008dDeadheading is the practice of operating a commercial vehicle, such as a truck or a trailer, without any cargo or paying passengers. Essentially, it refers to the movement of a vehicle while it is empty, either on its way to pick up a load or after delivering a load to its destination.\nDeadweight tonnage (DWT) is a measure of a ship's carrying capacity, representing the total weight of cargo, fuel, crew, provisions, and other materials that the vessel can safely carry. \nDemurrage refers to the additional charges imposed on the owner or operator of a vessel, freight car, or truck for delaying the use of equipment or facilities beyond the agreed-upon time. In the context of maritime shipping, demurrage applies to the time that cargo remains at the port or terminal beyond the allotted free time for loading or unloading.\nDetention charges are fees incurred when a carrier's equipment, such as containers or trailers, is held beyond the agreed-upon free time at a facility, such as a port, terminal, or warehouse. These charges compensate the carrier for the additional time their equipment is detained and unavailable for other use.\nA supply chain digital twin replicates the entire supply chain network, including assets, facilities, products, and processes, in a digital environment. It enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and simulation of supply chain operations to improve efficiency, optimize decision-making, and mitigate risks.\nDimensional weight, also known as volumetric weight, is a pricing technique used by shipping carriers to calculate the cost of shipping packages based on their volume rather than just their actual weight. This method helps carriers account for the space that a package occupies in relation to its weight, ensuring fair pricing for shipping services.\nA dock receipt is a logistics document issued by a carrier or its agent to acknowledge the receipt of goods at a shipping dock or terminal for transportation. It serves as a temporary receipt until the goods are loaded onto a vessel or other mode of transportation for shipment to their destination. The dock receipt contains essential information about the cargo, such as the quantity, description, condition, and destination, along with details about the carrier, shipper, and consignee.\nA ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s draft (draught) measures the depth of the vessel below the waterline, which determines the minimum water depth required for safe navigation.\n\nDrayage refers to the transportation of goods over a short distance, typically within the same metropolitan area or between nearby facilities. It plays a crucial role in the logistics and supply chain industry, linking various points in the transportation network, such as ports, rail terminals, and distribution centers. Drayage often involves moving goods from a transportation hub like a port to a nearby warehouse or vice versa.\nDrop shipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product using the drop shipping model, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer.\nDry bulk cargo refers to unpackaged, loose commodities that are shipped in large quantities and typically consist of raw materials. These goods are usually loaded directly into the holds of a vessel without any packaging, making them different from containerized or break bulk cargo. \nA booking received via Electronic Data Interchange, a standard electronic format for exchanging business documents within the supply chain, such as purchase orders, invoices, shipping notices, and other transactional information.\nAn Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number is a unique identifier assigned to businesses engaged in international trade within the European Union (EU) and certain other countries. It serves as a means of tracking and identifying entities involved in import, export, and other customs-related activities.\nIn shipping, ETA refers to the anticipated arrival time of a vessel, truck, or aircraft at a specified port or delivery location. It is calculated based on various factors such as the departure time, transit duration, and any potential delays due to weather, customs, or other unforeseen circumstances. This prediction helps logistics professionals plan and coordinate the movement of goods, ensuring timely deliveries and efficient supply chain management.\nEXW, or Ex Works, is one of the Incoterms (International Commercial Terms) published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). It defines the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international transactions. Under EXW terms, the seller fulfills their obligation by making the goods available for pickup at their premises (factory, warehouse, etc.). The buyer assumes all risks and costs associated with transporting the goods from the seller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s location to the final destination.\nEconomic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a fundamental concept in inventory management that determines the optimal quantity of goods a company should order to minimize total inventory costs. It balances the costs of holding inventory (holding costs) and the costs of ordering inventory (ordering costs) to find the most cost-effective quantity to order at any given time.\nAn Electronic Product Code (EPC) is a unique identifier used to distinguish individual items, cases, or pallets in the supply chain. It serves as a digital identifier that provides a standardized way to track and manage products throughout their lifecycle, from manufacturing to distribution to retail.\nUsed for storing cargo in/on during transport. The equipment \"size/type\" is defined by the ISO 6346 code. The most common equipment size/type is 20'/40'/45' Dry Freight Container, but a number of different versions exist.\nConfirmation & receipt of the equipment loaded/discharged on a vessel during a port call. This information is recorded by the terminal operator and sent to the carrier. This is often done using the EDI message - COARRI. The COARRI message reports that the equipment specified have been discharged from a seagoing vessel (discharged as ordered, over landed or short landed), or have been loaded into a seagoing vessel.\nA shipping exception is an unexpected event or disruption that causes a shipment to deviate from its planned delivery schedule.\nExpedited freight refers to a specialized service in logistics and supply chain management aimed at transporting goods quickly and efficiently to meet tight delivery deadlines. It is used when standard shipping methods cannot meet the required delivery timeframe, typically due to urgent customer needs, production delays, or unforeseen circumstances.\n\nFAS, or Free Alongside Ship, is a shipping term used in international trade that specifies the seller's responsibilities and costs up to the point where goods are placed alongside the buyer's vessel at the designated port of shipment. The buyer then assumes all risks and costs from that point forward.\nFCA, or Free Carrier, is an Incoterm (International Commercial Term) used in international trade to define the point at which the seller's obligations are fulfilled and the buyer assumes responsibility for the goods. Under FCA, the seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, to the carrier or another party nominated by the buyer at a specified place. \nFCL (Full Container Load) freight involves shipping an entire container for a single shipper, offering faster and more secure transport, especially for large-volume cargo.\nFOB, or Free on Board, is a term used in international trade to indicate when ownership and liability for goods transfer from the seller to the buyer. It specifies the point at which the seller is no longer responsible for the goods. This term is crucial for determining who pays for shipping, insurance, and other logistics costs, as well as who bears the risk during transit.\nAn entity operating a feeder service - ref. Feeder vessel.\nA container feeder vessel, also known as a feeder ship, is a relatively small cargo vessel that is specifically designed for transporting containers between smaller ports or terminals to larger hub ports where mainline vessels operate. These vessels serve as a crucial link in the global shipping network by facilitating the distribution of cargo to and from regional ports that may not be accessible to larger ships due to navigational constraints or limited infrastructure.\n\nA Feedermax container ship is a medium-sized vessel used to transport containers between regional ports and major ports, connecting smaller markets to global shipping routes.\nFill rate in supply chain management refers to the measurement of how fully customer demand for a product or service is met through the availability of inventory. It indicates the percentage of customer orders or demand that can be fulfilled immediately from stock, without backorders or delays.\nA \"Flag of Convenience\" (FOC) refers to the practice of a ship's owner registering a merchant vessel in a country other than the owner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s country of origin to benefit from more favorable regulations, often related to taxes, labor laws, and safety standards. This practice allows shipowners to operate under less stringent regulations, often reducing operational costs and increasing profitability. However, FOC can also lead to concerns about safety, environmental standards, and working conditions for crew members, as the regulatory oversight in these flag states might not be as rigorous.\n4PL, or Fourth Party Logistics, refers to a logistics model where a single organization, known as the fourth-party logistics provider, takes on the responsibility of managing and coordinating the entire supply chain on behalf of the client. Unlike traditional third-party logistics (3PL) providers, who primarily handle specific logistics functions, 4PL providers offer comprehensive end-to-end supply chain management services. 4PL providers act as strategic partners, overseeing multiple 3PLs and other service providers to optimize supply chain operations, enhance efficiency, and achieve cost savings for their clients.\nA free trade zone (FTZ) is a designated area within a country where goods can be imported, stored, manufactured, or exported without being subject to the usual customs duties and tariffs. \nA freight forwarder is a vital link in the supply chain, specializing in the coordination and management of international shipments. Acting as an intermediary between shippers and carriers, freight forwarders handle various logistics tasks such as booking cargo space, arranging transportation, preparing documentation, and managing customs clearance.\nFreight visibility (also called shipment visibility) refers to the ability of supply chain professionals to track and monitor the movement of freight shipments throughout the supply chain. It involves gaining real-time insights into the location and status of goods as they move through various transportation modes and stages of the logistics process.\n\nFull truckload (FTL) freight refers to shipments that occupy the entire capacity of a truck trailer. Unlike less than truckload (LTL) shipments, FTL shipments do not share space with other cargo, allowing for direct transportation from the point of origin to the destination without intermediate stops.\nThe GLEC (Global Logistics Emissions Council) framework is a globally recognized standard developed to measure and report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from logistics activities. It provides guidelines and best practices for calculating emissions across various modes of transport, including road, rail, sea, and air. \nThe action of moving a container from a container yard, a terminal or another restricted/controlled area.\nThe German Supply Chain Act, also known as Lieferkettengesetz, is a landmark legislation enacted to promote corporate social responsibility and ensure ethical practices throughout global supply chains.

It provides a standardized method for identifying items globally, ensuring accurate inventory control, and enabling seamless transactions between trading partners.\n\nA Goods Receipt Note (GRN) is a document used in the process of confirming the receipt of goods from a supplier or vendor. It serves as an acknowledgment by the receiving party, typically a warehouse or a buyer, that the goods specified in the accompanying purchase order have been received in satisfactory condition. \nGreen logistics refers to the process of minimizing the environmental impact of logistics and supply chain activities, including transportation, warehousing, packaging, and distribution.\nA Handysize ship is a small to medium-sized bulk carrier designed for transporting various cargo types, capable of navigating smaller ports and shallow waters.\nGear used to do inland transportation of a container. This can include tools and apparatus used to load/discharge the container onto the intermodal type.\nSpecifications for a haulier set by a carrier in regards to a specific work order, e.g. timeline, capabilities.\nThe joint term for merchant and carrier haulage. It should be noted that a shipment can have several types of haulage throughout the transport from origin to destination.\nA haulier, also known as a trucking company or a carrier, is a business or individual that transports goods by road using trucks or lorries. Hauliers play a vital role in the transportation industry, moving goods between locations such as warehouses, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, ports, and retail stores. \nA House Bill of Lading (HBL) is a transportation document issued by a freight forwarder or Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC) to acknowledge receipt of goods for shipment. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper and the carrier and includes details such as the type, quantity, and destination of the goods being transported. \nIn supply chain logistics, a hub and spoke model refers to a system where goods or services are transported through a central hub to various spoke locations. The hub acts as a central point for collection, sorting, and distribution, while the spokes represent the routes connecting the hub to different destinations.\nPort Congestion Holds Steady at Major Hubs as Mid-Sized Ports Struggle \nPort congestion is an inevitable consequence of typhoons and hurricanes, geopolitical disruption in the Red Sea and USEC labor action.\nFollowing similar events in Bangladesh in August, both Ningbo and Shanghai ports were forced to halt operations due to Typhoon Bebinca in September. But XL ports (those with an annual throughput greater than 10M TEU) have proven their resilience and ability to absorb much of the impact of such events. Despite the weather related disruptions, both Ningbo and Shanghai ports recorded lower average vessel anchor and container dwell times in September compared to August.\nMedium sized ports, however, are more likely to be feeling the effects of the endless series of supply chain crises. Average anchor times at ports with annual throughput between 500,000 and 4,000,000 TEU consistently see average vessel anchor times in excess of their larger counterparts. In September, seven of the ten most congested ports (by anchor time) fall into this category. These ports also see more volatility in congestion levels. Looking at the difference between the min and max monthly average anchor times over the past six months, medium sized ports occupy the top three spots: Charleston (3.5 days), Chittagong (3.0 days) and Durban (2.8 days).\u00c2\u00a0\nVessel Anchor Times: September 2024\nNo XL ports reported average anchor times of more than half a day. Among the world's largest ports, Shanghai and Jebel Ali reported the longest average vessel waiting time at 0.4 days each.\u00c2\u00a0\nAmong large ports (4-10M\u00c2\u00a0TEU), Santos added nearly half a day to average anchor times, continuing a trend of worsening conditions at Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest container port. Manila registered a minor improvement but remains far more congested than competing Southeast Asian ports.\u00c2\u00a0\nVancouver (+1.1 days) was the only port to see average anchor times increase by more than a day in September. Houston (+0.5 days), Santos (+0.5 days), Charleston (+0.4 days) and Colombo (+0.4 days) registered the next biggest month-on-month increases. Notably, Chittagong shaved two days off average wait times following the floods and civic action that plagued operations in July and August.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average vessel anchor time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Santos (Brazil)\n\u00a02.5\n\u00a0 +0.5\n\u00a0Manila (Philippines)\n\u00a02.2\n\u00a0-0.1\n\u00a0Savannah (USA)\n\u00a01.1\n\u00a0-0.1\n\u00a0Piraeus (Greece)\n\u00a00.8\n\u00a0NC\n\u00a0Colombo (Sri Lanka)\n\u00a00.5\n\u00a0+0.4\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average vessel anchor time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Durban (South Africa)\n\u00a02.8\n\u00a0 +0.3\n\u00a0Chittagong (Bangladesh)\n\u00a01.9\n\u00a0-2.0\n\u00a0Vancouver (Canada)\n\u00a01.7\n\u00a0+1.1\n\u00a0Lom\u00e9 (Togo)\n\u00a00.9\n\u00a0-0.2\n\u00a0Tema (Ghana)\n\u00a00.9\n\u00a0NC\nContainer Dwell Times: September 2024\nLooking at congestion on the ground, average container dwell times exceeded seven days at 14 of 78 analyzed ports.\u00c2\u00a0\nMedium volume ports in Djibouti (10.0 days), Chittagong (9.3 days) and Guayaquil (8.6 days), took the top three spots. Long Beach recorded the longest container dwell times of North American ports at 8.6 days, while Piraeus topped European ports with 8.5 days.\nXL ports again showed their class with none of the 13 analyzed ports reporting average container dwell times in excess of five days. In fact, Singapore reported the third lowest container dwell times of all 78 ports, at 2.3 days. Shekou, Melbourne, Tanjung Perak and Sydney joined Singapore in the five ports with the lowest average container dwell times in September.\u00c2\u00a0\nOsaka (+4.5 days), Mombasa (+3.0 days), Kobe (+3.0 days), Tanger Med (+2.8 days) and Guayaquil (+2.4 days) recorded the largest month-on-month increases in average container dwell times.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average container dwell time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Long Beach (USA)\n\u00a08.6\n\u00a0+0.1\n\u00a0Piraeus (Greece)\n\u00a08.5\n\u00a0+1.5\n\u00a0Col\u00f3n (Panama)\n\u00a08.4\n\u00a0-0.3\n\u00a0Hai Phong (Vietnam)\n\u00a07.9\n\u00a0+1.6\n\u00a0Tanger Med (Morocco)\n\u00a07.8\n\u00a0+2.8\n\u00a0Port\n\u00a0Average container dwell time (days)\n\u00a0Change vs. August (days)\n\u00a0Djibouti (Djibouti)\n\u00a010.0\n\u00a0NC\n\u00a0Chittagong (Bangladesh)\n\u00a09.3\n\u00a0-3.4\n\u00a0Guayaquil (Ecuador)\n\u00a08.6\n\u00a0+2.4\n\u00a0Tema (Ghana)\n\u00a08.4\n\u00a0+0.1\n\u00a0Kingston (Jamaica)\n\u00a07.8\n\u00a0-0.1\nHow We Analyze Port Congestion\nOur port congestion index monitors three key indicators of port congestion. No single factor gives a complete picture of port congestion, but taken collectively these metrics can provide insight into how ports around the world are able to cope with supply chain pressures. \u00e2\u0080\u008d\nAnchor times provide insight into harbor congestion by measuring how long vessels are waiting, on average, before they are able to berth at a port. \n\u00e2\u0080\u008dBerth times provide insight into the time it takes for vessels to be unloaded and loaded. While larger ports typically have longer berth times due to handling larger vessels, looking at changes in berth times month over month can give insight into ports that may be dealing with operational issues. \nWhile the first two factors look at the time it takes for vessels to move through the port, container dwell times give insight into how well ports are facilitating the movement of goods out of the yard and onwards to their final destinations. \nContinue reading\nIn Numbers: The Impact of the Red Sea Crisis on European & Asian Port Congestion\nWebinar Recap: Enhancing Supply Chain Collaboration Through Visibility\nThe Busiest Container Ports in the World\nSubscribe for the latest in supply chain technology.\n",
