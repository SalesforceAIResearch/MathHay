[+] ofthe stock market. Tesla is listed in Nasdaq. The Nasdaq is the second-largest stock exchange in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. (Photo by Alexander Pohl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nDespite Tesla\u2019s\nTSLA\nstock having lost more than 60% of its value since November 2021, recent analyst reports from JPMorgan indicate that the stock would have to drop by at least 35% more from its current level to reach fundamental value. However, a behavioral analysis of the report\u2019s methodology suggests that the number might be closer to 75% than 35%.\nTwo psychological elements underlie the behavioral analysis of the report. Both were emphasized by the late psychologist Daniel Kahneman. The first is downplaying base rates, and the second is representativeness. Base rates refer to the rates at which relevant events have occurred in the past. Representativeness is the misuse of stereotypic thinking.\nBack Of The Envelope Calculation\nWhile some investors like to dig into the details of analyst reports, many do not. For those who do not, this section presents a brief back of the envelope calculation to register the point about Tesla\u2019s potential overvaluation. Readers who just want a quick sense of the issue can read this section and skip to the conclusion.\nDuring April 2024, the JPMorgan reports on Tesla estimate that at the end of 2024, Tesla\u2019s enterprise value will be $331,483 million. A key input in arriving at this value is an estimate of the minimum level of future profitability Tesla\u2019s investors would find acceptable.\nHere acceptable profitability is measured by a rate of return, the cost of capital. Actual profitability is measured by the return on invested capital. When they are equal, the firm is said to exactly earn its cost of capital.\nBillionaire Mark Cuban Issues Post Halving Bitcoin Warning Amid\nUnprecedented\nCrypto Fee Price\nChaos\nAEW Dynasty 2024 Results\nWinners And Grades As Swerve Makes History\nWho Is David Pecker\nWhy He s Testifying Against Trump In Hush Money Trial\nThe base rate issue is that in the long run, most companies do not earn more than their cost of capital. That is, return on invested capital does not exceed the cost of capital.\nIf the JPMorgan analysts expect that Tesla will exactly earn its cost of capital going forward, then there is a straightforward calculation to estimate its fundamental value at the end of 2024: Simply divide the estimate of Tesla\u2019s 2025 value of EBIT after tax, or EBI, by Tesla\u2019s weighted average cost of capital. The report also estimates Tesla\u2019s EBIT during 2025 to be $12,792 million and its WACC to be 11.8%. The result is $108,406 million, which is roughly one third of the JPMorgan estimate.\nI suggest a reason why the JPMorgan estimate of enterprise value could be three times the estimate from the simple formula: The JPMorgan analysts assume that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital going forward. Is the assumption reasonable? The evidence presented below suggests not.\nTesla\u2019s Return On Invested Capital\nPrior to 2020, Tesla\u2019s return on invested capital was negative. In 2020, it barely turned positive. However, in 2021, it rose to 14%, then to 23% in 2022 and then dropped slightly to 20% in 2023. Therefore, in the last three years, Tesla did indeed earn more than its cost of capital.\nHowever, Tesla\u2019s situation has changed. The JPMorgan analysts gave Tesla\u2019s stock a recommendation of Underweight, indicating that Tesla\u2019s deteriorating fundamentals relate to decreased demand for its vehicles, not decreased supply. The New York Times\nNYT\ndescribes how Tesla is now facing stiff competition for electric vehicles from American, Korean, Chinese and European automobile manufacturers, such as Ford, BYD, and BMW. These firms all have big EV product lines and growing sales. Indeed, during the fourth quarter of 2023, BYD briefly became the world\u2019s largest seller of EVs.\nStandard textbooks in economics and finance clearly state that for a company to earn more than its cost of capital in the long run, it must have some sustainable competitive advantage. Companies that earn more than their costs of capital attract competitors, and competition puts downward pressure on prices and profit margins. Tesla is now cutting prices and profit margins to compete with its competitors. Going forward, this decision will place significant pressure on the company\u2019s ROIC.\nReturn On Capital, Base Rates, And Representativeness\nComputing enterprise value requires a focus on the long run. Consider this question: Over the long run, what percentage of publicly traded companies earn more than Treasury bills? This is a question about a base rate.\nFinancial economist Hank Bessembinder\u2019s work provides the answer, which is 4%. Think of 4% as the base rate. Put another way, over the long run, 96% of publicly traded stocks fail to outperform the Treasury bill rate.\nAmazon\nAMZN\nand Apple\nAAPL\nearn more than Treasury bills. In May 2017, analysts at Morgan Stanley\nMS\nmade the following statement: \u201cThe bull case on Tesla is that it can become the next Amazon or Apple.\u201d The title of the report is \u201cThe Price of Ambition: Downgrade to EW.\u201d Keep in mind that the simple valuation formula refers to companies earning their cost of capital, not earning the rate on Treasury bills. So, the question for valuing Tesla becomes whether it is reasonable to expect that going forward, the firm\u2019s ROIC will match its 11.8% cost of capital. Given the base rate, the odds are against it.\nIn respect to representativeness, Amazon and Apple serve as stereotypes. Analysts and investors rely on representativeness for their judgments when they do two things. First, they view Amazon and Apple as emblematic of companies with the highest performing stocks. Second they make valuation judgements about Tesla based on their perceptions of how representative is Tesla of the class of companies having the highest performing stocks.\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Analysis\nThe analysts at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley do not use the simple valuation EBI/WACC-formula which I described above. Instead, they use a free cash flow counterpart, which applies a multiple to an estimate of a future free cash flow. For example, the JPMorgan analysts apply a multiple of 83 to their 2025-free cash flow estimate of $2,571 million for Tesla.\nAs a general matter, applying a multiple is fine, as long as the multiple is reasonable. The thing about using 83 is that it implies an expectation that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital going forward. That is why, I suggest, the JPMorgan estimate of $100 per share for Tesla\u2019s fundamental enterprise value is too high.\nIt is straightforward to ascertain the value of the multiple corresponding to any firm exactly earning its cost of capital. First, estimate the long-term growth rate for the company\u2019s free cash flow. Call this g. Compute the ratio (1+g)/(WACC-g). Now tie g to the assumption that the firm will exactly earn its cost of capital. The textbook formula for g in this case is g = retention rate x WACC. The retention rate is the ratio of a company\u2019s capital expenditures net of depreciation to the sum of its unlevered free cash flow and capex net of depreciation.\nAnalysts routinely assume values for free cash flow growth rates that are higher than the textbook formula. Moreover, these assumptions are buried in the multiples they use. If you do the math, you will discover that JPMorgan\u2019s implicit value of g is 11% per year. The textbook formula indicates that if Tesla is expected to earn its costs of capital exactly, the corresponding value of g would be 8.4%. Using 11% for g when 8.4% is warranted is a bias known as growth opportunities bias.\nUsing 8.4% will produce an estimate of enterprise value for Tesla that is in the neighborhood of what you get using the simple EBI/WACC formula. Try it.\nTesla\u2019s free cash flows were negative until 2018. Once positive, they grew quickly through 2021. In 2020, they grew at 128.6% and in 2021 at 19.7%. However, in 2022 growth turned negative at -25.5%, and in 2023 it dropped further to -175.9%.\nSentiment\nThe upshot of the Tesla\u2019s fundamental value being so far below its market price is that Tesla\u2019s price mostly reflects optimistic sentiment. On this point, the JPMorgan report establishes a December 2024 target price for Tesla\u2019s stock of $115, not $100. In this respect, the report\u2019s methodology arrives at $115 by taking a 50-50 combination of its $100 estimate of DCF-based fundamental value and a $130 estimate based on multiples such as price-to-earnings and price-to-sales. The multiples approach captures market-wide sentiment, but not sentiment unique to Tesla.\nBehavioral asset pricing theory focuses on the decomposition of market prices into a fundamental component and a sentiment component. The target price approach I favor would place a lower weight on fundamental value computed using the EBI/WACC formula, a higher weight on the multiples approach, and the addition of a component to account for Tesla-specific sentiment.\nThe Tesla-specific component is important. For years, the JPMorgan analysts have assigned Tesla\u2019s stock a recommendation of Underweight. This was the case in July 2020 when Tesla\u2019s stock was trading at $1,592. At the time, the JPMorgan analysts\u2019 target price was $325, 80% below the market price. Its estimate of fundamental value per share was $295 and its multiple-based counterpart was $356. Remember, 2020 was a time when Tesla\u2019s free cash flow growth was high, and its ROIC had just turned positive. In July 2021, a year, later, Tesla\u2019s stock increased by 140%, vividly demonstrating the power of sentiment. It is a mistake to think that prices revert to fundamental value quickly, or even move in the right direction.\nGeneral Takeaways\nSentiment refers to biased reactions to changing fundamentals. The history of Tesla\u2019s stock illustrates just how important sentiment can be in the short-to-medium terms.\nAnalysts might serve the investing public better, for all stocks, not just Tesla, by structuring the valuation portions of their reports to decompose target prices into fundamental and sentiment components. In doing so, they could also be transparent about base rates for ROIC and free cash flow growth rates. Specifically, they can exercise caution about giving due weight to base rates and avoiding representativeness bias, in an effort to mitigate growth opportunity bias. Doing so just might lead market prices to more accurately reflect their corresponding fundamental values.\nI contacted Media Relations at JPMorgan to offer the firm an opportunity to respond to the points in this post. However, the firm\u2019s policy is not to comment on the methodology in analyst reports.",

However, Tesla now faces stiff competition from other EV manufacturers, leading to price cuts and pressure on profit margins. This competition challenges the assumption that Tesla will continue to earn more than its cost of capital.\n\nFinancial economist Hank Bessembinder\u2019s work shows that only 4% of publicly traded companies earn more than Treasury bills in the long run. Given this base rate, it is unlikely that Tesla will continue to outperform. Analysts often use representativeness, comparing Tesla to high-performing companies like Amazon and Apple, which can lead to biased valuations.\n\nJPMorgan and Morgan Stanley analysts use a discounted free cash flow analysis, applying a multiple to future free cash flow estimates. JPMorgan\u2019s multiple of 83 implies an expectation that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital. However, using a more conservative growth rate of 8.4% instead of 11% would produce a lower enterprise value estimate.\n\nTesla\u2019s free cash flows were negative until 2018, grew quickly through 2021, but turned negative in 2022 and 2023. The JPMorgan report sets a December 2024 target price for Tesla\u2019s stock at $115, combining a $100 estimate of fundamental value and a $130 estimate based on market sentiment. Behavioral asset pricing theory suggests that Tesla\u2019s market price reflects optimistic sentiment rather than fundamental value.\n\nIn summary, sentiment plays a significant role in Tesla\u2019s stock price. Analysts should decompose target prices into fundamental and sentiment components, be transparent about base rates, and avoid representativeness bias to provide more accurate valuations.",

But which tech behemoth is better positioned for future growth?\nAmazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) are two of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands and Wall Street\u2019s most coveted stocks, and the long-term trajectory of each blue-chip stock is still decidedly up. Plus, it\u2019s estimated that roughly 40% of all web traffic is hosted by those two companies combined. But which looks like the better buy today, AMZN stock or GOOG stock?\nBoth stocks were beaten down by the growth stock sell-off of 2022. GOOG has suffered less damage from all the selling, down 6% since the start of 2022 vs. AMZN\u2019s 13% loss. Going back a bit further, to just after the March 2020 Covid crash, the performance of both stocks has been far more palatable, with GOOG up 126% in since March 13, 2020, vs. a 63% gain for AMZN. Over the last five years, GOOG is up 156% vs. an 83% gain in AMZN.\nThose are strong returns for GOOG, especially when compared to the 64% return in the S&P 500 in the last five years. Amazon though? Not so much. Now the question is: Can AMZN and GOOG repeat or beat that performance over the next five years?\n[text_ad]\nIt would be foolish to doubt either company at this point. That said, no stock continues to grow at a breakneck pace forever. Just ask anyone who bought General Electric (GE) 10 or 15 years ago, when it ranked among the 10 largest companies in the world by market cap. So chances are, one or both of these blue-chip tech stocks will start to slow in the years ahead.\nGiven that backdrop, I thought it might be a fun exercise to examine which tech giant stock is better positioned for future growth.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at AMZN stock and GOOG stock, broken into a few key numbers:\nTrailing P/Es: AMZN 76, GOOG 26\nForward P/Es: AMZN 42, GOOG 20\nEstimated 2023 revenue growth: AMZN 11%, GOOG 8.2%\nEstimated 2023 EPS growth: AMZN 1,089%, GOOG 51.4%\nCash per share: AMZN $6.21, GOOG $9.58\nInstitutional ownership: AMZN 61%, GOOG 62%\nThat comparison tells us that AMZN is still the more overvalued stock. However, until recently it had been the faster-growing company on both the top and bottom lines; and it had been since 2016. That was also the year Amazon first turned consistently profitable.\nThat said, Google has way more cash than Amazon - nearly double in terms of total cash, with roughly a fifth as much debt. Considering that Amazon brings in nearly twice as much revenue as Google annually (though that gap is closing), that means that Amazon has been way more willing to spend its cash on things that will grow the company - the Amazon Prime Video streaming service that is rivaling Netflix these days; a new foray into live sports with NFL broadcasts; the Amazon Echo, Amazon Web Services, etc. Google looks more like a cash hoarder. The result is that Amazon stock has grown much faster than GOOG stock in the last decade, though that has certainly changed in the last two years.\nThe guess here is that Google will start loosening its purse strings in the coming years, devoting it to new, exciting products like the long-anticipated and recently released Google Pixel Watch intended to rival the Apple Watch, a new Pixel smartphone, or perhaps Google will join Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Disney in the big-money streaming video wars (YouTube did make a splash buying the NFL broadcast rights). Regardless of what it comes up with, bet on Google spending more of its $120 billion cash stockpile soon. If it does, that could capture investors\u2019 attention the way Amazon did up until the last few years.\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with either of these growth stocks. If you bought both of them five, 10 or even 15 years ago, you\u2019ve made a LOT of money. But AMZN has been the better performer, at least up until recently. I think that might change in the years to come. Between its cash stockpile, untapped potential revenue streams, and cheaper valuation, I like GOOG stock to outperform AMZN in the next five years. In fact, that shift already seems to be taking place, as the last few years have shown. It could be the start of a longer-term role reversal between two of the biggest, baddest tech stocks on the block.\nFurthermore, after such extreme selling last year, both these stocks are still trading below their 2021 levels despite a furious run-up to start this year. You could buy both (or either, although I prefer GOOG); either way, an investment in GOOG stock will likely turn out quite well five years from now.\nFor a list of the stocks that actually have momentum after a tough earnings season, consider taking a trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Trader.

But which tech behemoth is better positioned for future growth?\nAmazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) are two of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands and Wall Street\u2019s most coveted stocks, and the long-term trajectory of each blue-chip stock is still decidedly up. Plus, it\u2019s estimated that roughly 40% of all web traffic is hosted by those two companies combined. But which looks like the better buy today, AMZN stock or GOOG stock?\nBoth stocks were beaten down by the growth stock sell-off of 2022. GOOG has suffered less damage from all the selling, down 6% since the start of 2022 vs. AMZN\u2019s 13% loss. Going back a bit further, to just after the March 2020 Covid crash, the performance of both stocks has been far more palatable, with GOOG up 126% in since March 13, 2020, vs. a 63% gain for AMZN. Over the last five years, GOOG is up 156% vs. an 83% gain in AMZN.\nThose are strong returns for GOOG, especially when compared to the 64% return in the S&P 500 in the last five years. Amazon though? Not so much. Now the question is: Can AMZN and GOOG repeat or beat that performance over the next five years?\n[text_ad]\nIt would be foolish to doubt either company at this point. That said, no stock continues to grow at a breakneck pace forever. Just ask anyone who bought General Electric (GE) 10 or 15 years ago, when it ranked among the 10 largest companies in the world by market cap. So chances are, one or both of these blue-chip tech stocks will start to slow in the years ahead.\nGiven that backdrop, I thought it might be a fun exercise to examine which tech giant stock is better positioned for future growth.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at AMZN stock and GOOG stock, broken into a few key numbers:\nTrailing P/Es: AMZN 76, GOOG 26\nForward P/Es: AMZN 42, GOOG 20\nEstimated 2023 revenue growth: AMZN 11%, GOOG 8.2%\nEstimated 2023 EPS growth: AMZN 1,089%, GOOG 51.4%\nCash per share: AMZN $6.21, GOOG $9.58\nInstitutional ownership: AMZN 61%, GOOG 62%\nThat comparison tells us that AMZN is still the more overvalued stock. However, until recently it had been the faster-growing company on both the top and bottom lines; and it had been since 2016. That was also the year Amazon first turned consistently profitable.\nThat said, Google has way more cash than Amazon - nearly double in terms of total cash, with roughly a fifth as much debt. Considering that Amazon brings in nearly twice as much revenue as Google annually (though that gap is closing), that means that Amazon has been way more willing to spend its cash on things that will grow the company - the Amazon Prime Video streaming service that is rivaling Netflix these days; a new foray into live sports with NFL broadcasts; the Amazon Echo, Amazon Web Services, etc. Google looks more like a cash hoarder. The result is that Amazon stock has grown much faster than GOOG stock in the last decade, though that has certainly changed in the last two years.\nThe guess here is that Google will start loosening its purse strings in the coming years, devoting it to new, exciting products like the long-anticipated and recently released Google Pixel Watch intended to rival the Apple Watch, a new Pixel smartphone, or perhaps Google will join Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Disney in the big-money streaming video wars (YouTube did make a splash buying the NFL broadcast rights). Regardless of what it comes up with, bet on Google spending more of its $120 billion cash stockpile soon. If it does, that could capture investors\u2019 attention the way Amazon did up until the last few years.\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with either of these growth stocks. If you bought both of them five, 10 or even 15 years ago, you\u2019ve made a LOT of money. But AMZN has been the better performer, at least up until recently. I think that might change in the years to come. Between its cash stockpile, untapped potential revenue streams, and cheaper valuation, I like GOOG stock to outperform AMZN in the next five years. In fact, that shift already seems to be taking place, as the last few years have shown. It could be the start of a longer-term role reversal between two of the biggest, baddest tech stocks on the block.\nFurthermore, after such extreme selling last year, both these stocks are still trading below their 2021 levels despite a furious run-up to start this year. You could buy both (or either, although I prefer GOOG); either way, an investment in GOOG stock will likely turn out quite well five years from now.\nFor a list of the stocks that actually have momentum after a tough earnings season, consider taking a trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Trader.

    "Document": "Facebook (FB) Market Cap (2014-2024) History\nThis report examines the historical market capitalization of FACEBOOK INC. The analysis covers the period between 2014 and 2024. We have incorporated essential data alongside visual charts depicting quarterly and annual market capitalization figures.\nThe report is organized into three main sections, outlined below for convenient navigation.\nWhile market capitalization significantly differs from a company's book value, this metric holds significant importance. Despite being a theoretical value, market cap helps gauge investor willingness to invest in shares. It reflects investors' confidence in both present and future actions of the organization.\n 1 Chart: FACEBOOK INC Market Capitalization\nTo begin, let's explore a chart displaying the historical market capitalization values of FB. The chart encompasses 30 quarters, spanning from Q1-2015 to Q2-2022.\nPlease Note: The chart below, created using quarterly values, provides a more smoothed-out representation compared to a daily chart.\nTo construct the above graph, we computed the market capitalization using the following formula:\nMarket capitalization for a quarter is determined by multiplying the number of outstanding shares, as reported during the quarter or the preceding quarter (or as disclosed in filings), by the share price on the closing day of the corresponding period. This calculation gives you a snapshot of the company's total market value for that specific timeframe.\nConcerning outstanding shares, we utilized the diluted shares metric. This choice is motivated by the fact that diluted shares encompass not only common shares, but also various convertible instruments (such as bonds, preferred stocks, employee options, etc.) that could potentially be converted into shares in the future. The value for diluted shares can be found in an organization's quarterly and annual filings.\n 2 FB Yearly Market Capitalization\nIn this segment, you'll find a chart depicting the historical market capitalization values of FB plotted by year. The diagram below encompasses 9 years, ranging from 2014 to 2022.\nPlease note that companies usually disclose the weighted average number of diluted shares for each quarter and year. In this section, we've used the weighted number of shares reported in their annual filings (10-K). To calculate market capitalization, we've taken the straightforward approach of multiplying the number of shares by the closing share price for the relevant period.\nDisplayed below is a table presenting annual market capitalization data for FACEBOOK INC. Each row corresponds to a year, with the second column showing the market capitalization value and the third column indicating whether the value has increased or decreased compared to the previous year.\nMarket Capitalization Increase for FB over 9 Years:\nThe market capitalization of FACEBOOK INC has increased by $250.117 Billion (54.615 %) between 2014 and 2024.\nHere are the steps and formula we used to calculate the figure presented above:\nThe formula for calculating the increase/decrease in market capitalization is:\nChange Percentage = [(M2 - M1) / M2] X 100%\nWhere,\nM1 - Market Cap of FB in 2014 = $207.845 Billion\nM2 - Market Cap of FB in 2024 = $457.962 Billion\nSubstituting the values in the formula gives:\nChange in market capitalization of FACEBOOK INC as a percentage =\n(457.962 - 207.845) / 457.962 X 100% = 54.615 %Please Note: A positive sign before the result indicates an increase, and a negative sign indicates a decrease.Insight: Many individuals are keen to understand the growth of share prices (and returns) over the past several years. They believe that analyzing past growth can offer insights into future expected growth. While share price growth is valuable, market cap growth provides additional perspective. This is because market cap growth not only tracks share growth but also reflects the financial health of a company based on the number of issued shares.What Was the Peak Annual Market Capitalization for FACEBOOK INC?FACEBOOK INC achieved its highest market capitalization of $961.625 Billion during 2021.Insight: The market capitalization of a healthy company typically grows over time. Therefore, it's not uncommon for the highest cap value over a 10-year period to occur in recent quarters. However, if you find that the peak value was reached several years ago, it's worth investigating the reasons before making investment decisions.  3 FACEBOOK INC Quarterly Market CapitalizationIn the previous section, you explored a quarterly market cap chart for FACEBOOK INC.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.68%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through August 5, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.68%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through August 5, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

The index includes Treasuries, government-related and corporate securities, MBS (agency fixed-rate pass-throughs), ABS and CMBS (agency and non-agency).\nThe S&P 500 Equal Weighted Index is the equal-weight version of the widely-used S&P 500.

    "Summarized_Document": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

Heart Disease, Stroke, and other Cardiovascular Diseases \u2022 Cardiovascular disease (CVD), listed as the underlying cause of death, accounted for 931,578 deaths in the United States in 2021. \u2022 Heart disease and stroke claimed more lives in 2021 in the United States than all forms of cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined. \u2022 Between 2017 and 2020, 127.9 million US adults (48.6%) had some form of CVD. Between 2019 and 2020, direct and indirect costs of total CVD were $422.3 billion ($254.3 billion in direct costs and $168.0 billion in lost productivity/mortality). \u2022 In 2017 to 2020 in the United States, 59.0% of non-Hispanic Black females and 58.9% of non-Hispanic Black males had some form of CVD. This race category had the highest prevalence of CVD. \u2022 In 2021 in the United States, coronary heart disease (CHD) was the leading cause of deaths (40.3%) attributable to CVD in the United States, followed by stroke (17.5%), other CVD (17.1%), high blood pressure (13.4%), heart failure (9.1%), diseases of the arteries (2.6%). \u2022 CVD accounted for 12% of total US health expenditures in 2019 to 2020, more than any major diagnostic group. \u2022 CVD accounted for approximately 19.91 million global deaths in 2021. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States.

Unauthorized use prohibited. Coronary Heart Disease \u2022 CHD caused 375,476 deaths in 2021. \u2022 According to data from 2005 to 2014, the estimated annual incidence of heart attack in the United States was 605,000 new attacks and 200,000 recurrent attacks. Average age at the first heart attack was 65.6 years for males and 72.0 years for females. \u2022 Approximately every 40 seconds, someone in the United States will have a myocardial infarction. \u2022 From 2011 to 2021 in the United States, the annual death rate attributable to CHD declined 15.0% and the actual number of deaths increased 0.05%. \u2022 The estimated direct and indirect cost of heart disease, in 2019 to 2020 (average annual) was $252.2 billion in the United States. This cost includes CHD, heart failure, part of hypertensive disease, cardiac dysrhythmias, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary heart disease, and other or ill-defined heart diseases. Stroke \u2022 In 2021, stroke accounted for approximately 1 of every 21 deaths in the United States. \u2022 On average in 2021, someone died of stroke every 3 minutes 14 seconds in the United States. \u2022 Stroke caused 162,890 deaths in the United States in 2021. \u2022 In 2021, the age-adjusted US stroke death rate as an underlying cause of death was 41.1 per 100,000, an increase of 8.4% from 2011, and the actual number of stroke deaths increased 26.3% during the same time period. \u2022 In 2021, there were 7.44 million deaths attributable to stroke worldwide (3.71 million deaths from ischemic stroke, 3.38 million deaths from intracerebral hemorrhage, and 0.36 million from subarachnoid hemorrhage). o Oceania and Southeast and Central Asia had the highest rates of overall stroke mortality. o Central Asia and Eastern Europe had the highest mortality rates attributable to ischemic stroke. o Intracerebral hemorrhage mortality was highest in Oceania, followed by Southeast Asia and central and eastern sub-Saharan Africa. o Mortality attributable to subarachnoid hemorrhage was highest in Oceania, followed by Andean Latin America, and Southeast and Central Asia. Sudden Cardiac Arrest \u2022 In 2021, underlying cause sudden cardiac arrest mortality in the United States was 20,114. \u2022 According to 2022 US data, the majority of adult Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrests (OHCA) occur at a home or residence (72.1%). Public settings (17.3%) and nursing homes (10.6%) were the second and third most common locations of adult OHCA. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States. Please refer to the complete Statistics Update for references and additional information for reported statistics. \u00a92024 American Heart Association, Inc. All rights reserved.

Bystander witnessed adult arrests had a 14.0% survival to hospital discharge and 9-1-1 responder witnessed arrests had a 17.0% survival to hospital discharge. Heart Disease, Stroke and CVD Risk Factors The AHA gauges the cardiovascular health of the nation by tracking eight key health factors and behaviors that increase risks for heart disease and stroke. These are called \u201cLife\u2019s Essential 8\u201d and the AHA measures them to track progress toward improving cardiovascular health for all Americans. Life\u2019s Essential 8 are: not-smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, healthy body weight, sleep health, and control of cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Here are some key facts related to these factors: Smoking \u2022 Worldwide, tobacco contributed to an estimated 7.43 million deaths in 2021. \u2022 In the United States, smoking was the leading risk factor for years of life lost to premature mortality and the third leading risk factor for years of life lived with disability or injury in 2019. \u2022 A meta-analysis of 23 prospective and 17 case-control studies of cardiovascular risks associated with secondhand smoke exposure demonstrated 18%, 23%, 23%, and 29% increased risks for total mortality, total CVD, CHD, and stroke, respectively, in those exposed to secondhand smoke. \u2022 According to the 2020 Surgeon General\u2019s report on smoking cessation, >480 000 Americans die as a result of cigarette smoking and >41 000 die of secondhand smoke exposure each year, \u22481 in 5 deaths annually. \u2022 In 2022, 16.5% of US high school students and 4.5% of middle school students reported current tobacco product use. Additionally, 2.0% of US high school students and 1.0% of middle school students smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days. In the past 30 days, 14.1% of US high school students and 3.3% of middle school students used e-cigarettes. \u2022 In 2022, 11.5% of US adults reported cigarette use every day or some days (13.1% of males and 10.1% of females). Physical Inactivity \u2022 In 2020, the overall prevalence of meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans for aerobic activity was 24.2% in US adults. \u2022 Among US high school students in 2019, 44.1% were physically active for 60 minutes or more on at least 5 days of the week. Nutrition \u2022 Using the AHA\u2019s Life\u2019s Essential 8 scoring metric, diet was among the 4 metrics with the lowest scores; the range for diet across demographic groups was 23.8 to 47.7 out of 100. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States. Please refer to the complete Statistics Update for references and additional information for reported statistics. \u00a92024 American Heart Association, Inc. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use prohibited. \u2022 Among children 2 to 5 years of age, a mean diet score of 61.1 out of 100 was observed. The score for children 12 to 19 years of age was 28.5 out of 100. \u2022 Using 2019 data, an estimated 7.9 million deaths and 188 million disability-adjusted life years were attributable to dietary risks. The leading dietary risk factors were high sodium intake, low whole grain intake, and low legume intake. Overweight/Obesity \u2022 In the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity among adults from 2017 to 2020 was 41.8% in males and 41.8% in females. \u2022 The age-adjusted prevalence of severe obesity in adults in the United States in 2017 to 2020 was 6.6% in males and 11.7% in females. \u2022 Worldwide, high body mass index was attributed to 3.69 million deaths in 2021, a change of 46.7% compared with 2010. \u2022 According to the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study, age-standardized mortality rates attributable to high body mass index were lowest in high-income Asia Pacific and highest in southern sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, and Oceania. Cholesterol \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 86.4 million, or 34.7% of US adults had total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL or higher. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020 about 24.7 million, or 10.0% of US adults had total cholesterol of 240 mg/dL or higher. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 63.1 million, or 25.5% of US adults had high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (130 mg/dL or higher). \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 41.3 million, or 16.9% of US adults had low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL). \u2022 Globally in 2021 there were 3.72 million deaths attributable to high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a 19.8% change from 2010. Sleep \u2022 Analysis of 2020 data indicates that the proportion of US adults reporting insufficient sleep (<7 hours) was 32.8% (females, 32.2%; males, 33.4%). Prevalence of reporting insufficient sleep was lowest among older adults (>65 years of age) with 27.3% of females and 24.7% of males in this older group reporting <7 hours of sleep per night. \u2022 Based on 2020 data, 43.7% of US adults self-report they wake up feeling well rested on some days or never (46.9% of females; 40.4% of males). \u2022 Based on 2020 data, during the last 30 days, 24.3% of US adults responded that they had trouble falling or staying asleep on most or all days (27.8% female; 20.6% male). 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States.

    "Summarized_Document": "This document provides key statistics about heart disease, stroke, other cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and their risk factors, based on the 2024 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update by the American Heart Association (AHA). The AHA is the largest non-profit funder of cardiovascular research in the US, having funded over $5 billion in research since 1949. In 2021, CVD was the underlying cause of 931,578 deaths in the US, more than cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined. Between 2017 and 2020, 127.9 million US adults (48.6%) had some form of CVD. The direct and indirect costs of CVD in 2019-2020 were $422.3 billion. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was the leading cause of CVD deaths in 2021, accounting for 40.3% of CVD deaths. Stroke accounted for 17.5% of CVD deaths, with 162,890 deaths in 2021. Sudden cardiac arrest caused 20,114 deaths in 2021. The AHA tracks eight key health factors and behaviors, known as Life\u2019s Essential 8, to gauge cardiovascular health: not smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, healthy body weight, sleep health, and control of cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Smoking contributed to 7.43 million deaths worldwide in 2021. In the US, 16.5% of high school students and 4.5% of middle school students reported current tobacco use in 2022. Physical inactivity was prevalent, with only 24.2% of US adults meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines in 2020. Nutrition scores were low, with children aged 2-5 scoring 61.1 out of 100 and those aged 12-19 scoring 28.5 out of 100. Obesity affected 41.8% of US adults from 2017 to 2020. High cholesterol was prevalent, with 34.7% of US adults having total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL or higher. Insufficient sleep was reported by 32.8% of US adults in 2020. Diabetes affected 10.6% of US adults from 2017 to 2020, with 103,294 deaths attributed to diabetes in 2021. High blood pressure affected 46.7% of US adults from 2017 to 2020, with 124,508 deaths in 2021.

Coronary Heart Disease \u2022 CHD caused 375,476 deaths in 2021. \u2022 According to data from 2005 to 2014, the estimated annual incidence of heart attack in the United States was 605,000 new attacks and 200,000 recurrent attacks. Average age at the first heart attack was 65.6 years for males and 72.0 years for females. \u2022 Approximately every 40 seconds, someone in the United States will have a myocardial infarction. \u2022 From 2011 to 2021 in the United States, the annual death rate attributable to CHD declined 15.0% and the actual number of deaths increased 0.05%. \u2022 The estimated direct and indirect cost of heart disease, in 2019 to 2020 (average annual) was $252.2 billion in the United States. This cost includes CHD, heart failure, part of hypertensive disease, cardiac dysrhythmias, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary heart disease, and other or ill-defined heart diseases. Stroke \u2022 In 2021, stroke accounted for approximately 1 of every 21 deaths in the United States. \u2022 On average in 2021, someone died of stroke every 3 minutes 14 seconds in the United States. \u2022 Stroke caused 162,890 deaths in the United States in 2021. \u2022 In 2021, the age-adjusted US stroke death rate as an underlying cause of death was 41.1 per 100,000, an increase of 8.4% from 2011, and the actual number of stroke deaths increased 26.3% during the same time period. \u2022 In 2021, there were 7.44 million deaths attributable to stroke worldwide (3.71 million deaths from ischemic stroke, 3.38 million deaths from intracerebral hemorrhage, and 0.36 million from subarachnoid hemorrhage). o Oceania and Southeast and Central Asia had the highest rates of overall stroke mortality. o Central Asia and Eastern Europe had the highest mortality rates attributable to ischemic stroke. o Intracerebral hemorrhage mortality was highest in Oceania, followed by Southeast Asia and central and eastern sub-Saharan Africa. o Mortality attributable to subarachnoid hemorrhage was highest in Oceania, followed by Andean Latin America, and Southeast and Central Asia. Sudden Cardiac Arrest \u2022 In 2021, underlying cause sudden cardiac arrest mortality in the United States was 20,114. \u2022 According to 2022 US data, the majority of adult Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrests (OHCA) occur at a home or residence (72.1%). Public settings (17.3%) and nursing homes (10.6%) were the second and third most common locations of adult OHCA. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States.

Unauthorized use prohibited. \u2022 According to 2022 US data for adult OHCA only, survival to hospital discharge was 9.3% for all EMS-treated non-traumatic OHCA cardiac arrests. Bystander witnessed adult arrests had a 14.0% survival to hospital discharge and 9-1-1 responder witnessed arrests had a 17.0% survival to hospital discharge. Heart Disease, Stroke and CVD Risk Factors The AHA gauges the cardiovascular health of the nation by tracking eight key health factors and behaviors that increase risks for heart disease and stroke. These are called \u201cLife\u2019s Essential 8\u201d and the AHA measures them to track progress toward improving cardiovascular health for all Americans. Life\u2019s Essential 8 are: not-smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, healthy body weight, sleep health, and control of cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Here are some key facts related to these factors: Smoking \u2022 Worldwide, tobacco contributed to an estimated 7.43 million deaths in 2021. \u2022 In the United States, smoking was the leading risk factor for years of life lost to premature mortality and the third leading risk factor for years of life lived with disability or injury in 2019. \u2022 A meta-analysis of 23 prospective and 17 case-control studies of cardiovascular risks associated with secondhand smoke exposure demonstrated 18%, 23%, 23%, and 29% increased risks for total mortality, total CVD, CHD, and stroke, respectively, in those exposed to secondhand smoke. \u2022 According to the 2020 Surgeon General\u2019s report on smoking cessation, >480 000 Americans die as a result of cigarette smoking and >41 000 die of secondhand smoke exposure each year, \u22481 in 5 deaths annually. \u2022 In 2022, 16.5% of US high school students and 4.5% of middle school students reported current tobacco product use. Additionally, 2.0% of US high school students and 1.0% of middle school students smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days. In the past 30 days, 14.1% of US high school students and 3.3% of middle school students used e-cigarettes. \u2022 In 2022, 11.5% of US adults reported cigarette use every day or some days (13.1% of males and 10.1% of females). Physical Inactivity \u2022 In 2020, the overall prevalence of meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans for aerobic activity was 24.2% in US adults. \u2022 Among US high school students in 2019, 44.1% were physically active for 60 minutes or more on at least 5 days of the week. Nutrition \u2022 Using the AHA\u2019s Life\u2019s Essential 8 scoring metric, diet was among the 4 metrics with the lowest scores; the range for diet across demographic groups was 23.8 to 47.7 out of 100. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States. Please refer to the complete Statistics Update for references and additional information for reported statistics. \u00a92024 American Heart Association, Inc. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use prohibited. \u2022 Among children 2 to 5 years of age, a mean diet score of 61.1 out of 100 was observed. The score for children 12 to 19 years of age was 28.5 out of 100. \u2022 Using 2019 data, an estimated 7.9 million deaths and 188 million disability-adjusted life years were attributable to dietary risks. The leading dietary risk factors were high sodium intake, low whole grain intake, and low legume intake. Overweight/Obesity \u2022 In the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity among adults from 2017 to 2020 was 41.8% in males and 41.8% in females. \u2022 The age-adjusted prevalence of severe obesity in adults in the United States in 2017 to 2020 was 6.6% in males and 11.7% in females. \u2022 Worldwide, high body mass index was attributed to 3.69 million deaths in 2021, a change of 46.7% compared with 2010. \u2022 According to the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study, age-standardized mortality rates attributable to high body mass index were lowest in high-income Asia Pacific and highest in southern sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, and Oceania. Cholesterol \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 86.4 million, or 34.7% of US adults had total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL or higher. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020 about 24.7 million, or 10.0% of US adults had total cholesterol of 240 mg/dL or higher. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 63.1 million, or 25.5% of US adults had high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (130 mg/dL or higher). \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 41.3 million, or 16.9% of US adults had low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL). \u2022 Globally in 2021 there were 3.72 million deaths attributable to high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a 19.8% change from 2010. Sleep \u2022 Analysis of 2020 data indicates that the proportion of US adults reporting insufficient sleep (<7 hours) was 32.8% (females, 32.2%; males, 33.4%). Prevalence of reporting insufficient sleep was lowest among older adults (>65 years of age) with 27.3% of females and 24.7% of males in this older group reporting <7 hours of sleep per night. \u2022 Based on 2020 data, 43.7% of US adults self-report they wake up feeling well rested on some days or never (46.9% of females; 40.4% of males). \u2022 Based on 2020 data, during the last 30 days, 24.3% of US adults responded that they had trouble falling or staying asleep on most or all days (27.8% female; 20.6% male). 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States.

    "Summarized_Document": "This document provides key statistics about heart disease, stroke, other cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and their risk factors, based on the 2024 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update by the American Heart Association (AHA). The AHA is the largest non-profit funder of cardiovascular research in the US, having funded over $5 billion in research since 1949. In 2021, CVD was the underlying cause of 931,578 deaths in the US, more than cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined. Between 2017 and 2020, 127.9 million US adults (48.6%) had some form of CVD. The direct and indirect costs of CVD in 2019-2020 were $422.3 billion. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was the leading cause of CVD deaths in 2021, accounting for 40.3% of CVD deaths. Stroke accounted for 17.5% of CVD deaths, with 162,890 deaths in 2021. Sudden cardiac arrest caused 20,114 deaths in 2021. The AHA tracks eight key health factors and behaviors, known as Life\u2019s Essential 8, to gauge cardiovascular health: not smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, healthy body weight, sleep health, and control of cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Smoking contributed to 7.43 million deaths worldwide in 2021. In the US, 16.5% of high school students and 4.5% of middle school students reported current tobacco use in 2022. Physical inactivity was prevalent, with only 24.2% of US adults meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines in 2020. Nutrition scores were low, with children aged 2-5 scoring 61.1 out of 100 and those aged 12-19 scoring 28.5 out of 100. Obesity affected 41.8% of US adults from 2017 to 2020. High cholesterol was prevalent, with 34.7% of US adults having total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL or higher. Insufficient sleep was reported by 32.8% of US adults in 2020. Diabetes affected 10.6% of US adults from 2017 to 2020, with 103,294 deaths attributed to diabetes in 2021. High blood pressure affected 46.7% of US adults from 2017 to 2020, with 124,508 deaths in 2021.

This At-a-Glance document is based on the association\u2019s 2024 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update: A Report of US and Global Data From the AHA, which is compiled annually by the AHA, the National Institutes of Health, and other collaborators. The years of data cited were the most recent available for each topic at the time the Update was written. American Heart Association Research \u2022 The AHA uses donations to fund research projects. Research applications are carefully weighed and selected by teams of scientists and healthcare professionals who volunteer for the association. \u2022 Ten investigators received Nobel Prizes for research wholly or partially supported by the AHA. \u2022 The AHA is the largest non-profit, non-governmental funder of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular research in the United States. \u2022 The AHA has funded more than $5 billion in research since 1949. Heart Disease, Stroke, and other Cardiovascular Diseases \u2022 Cardiovascular disease (CVD), listed as the underlying cause of death, accounted for 931,578 deaths in the United States in 2021. \u2022 Heart disease and stroke claimed more lives in 2021 in the United States than all forms of cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined. \u2022 Between 2017 and 2020, 127.9 million US adults (48.6%) had some form of CVD. Between 2019 and 2020, direct and indirect costs of total CVD were $422.3 billion ($254.3 billion in direct costs and $168.0 billion in lost productivity/mortality). \u2022 In 2017 to 2020 in the United States, 59.0% of non-Hispanic Black females and 58.9% of non-Hispanic Black males had some form of CVD. This race category had the highest prevalence of CVD. \u2022 In 2021 in the United States, coronary heart disease (CHD) was the leading cause of deaths (40.3%) attributable to CVD in the United States, followed by stroke (17.5%), other CVD (17.1%), high blood pressure (13.4%), heart failure (9.1%), diseases of the arteries (2.6%). \u2022 CVD accounted for 12% of total US health expenditures in 2019 to 2020, more than any major diagnostic group. \u2022 CVD accounted for approximately 19.91 million global deaths in 2021. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States. Please refer to the complete Statistics Update for references and additional information for reported statistics. \u00a92024 American Heart Association, Inc. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use prohibited. Coronary Heart Disease \u2022 CHD caused 375,476 deaths in 2021. \u2022 According to data from 2005 to 2014, the estimated annual incidence of heart attack in the United States was 605,000 new attacks and 200,000 recurrent attacks. Average age at the first heart attack was 65.6 years for males and 72.0 years for females. \u2022 Approximately every 40 seconds, someone in the United States will have a myocardial infarction. \u2022 From 2011 to 2021 in the United States, the annual death rate attributable to CHD declined 15.0% and the actual number of deaths increased 0.05%. \u2022 The estimated direct and indirect cost of heart disease, in 2019 to 2020 (average annual) was $252.2 billion in the United States. This cost includes CHD, heart failure, part of hypertensive disease, cardiac dysrhythmias, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary heart disease, and other or ill-defined heart diseases. Stroke \u2022 In 2021, stroke accounted for approximately 1 of every 21 deaths in the United States. \u2022 On average in 2021, someone died of stroke every 3 minutes 14 seconds in the United States. \u2022 Stroke caused 162,890 deaths in the United States in 2021. \u2022 In 2021, the age-adjusted US stroke death rate as an underlying cause of death was 41.1 per 100,000, an increase of 8.4% from 2011, and the actual number of stroke deaths increased 26.3% during the same time period. \u2022 In 2021, there were 7.44 million deaths attributable to stroke worldwide (3.71 million deaths from ischemic stroke, 3.38 million deaths from intracerebral hemorrhage, and 0.36 million from subarachnoid hemorrhage). o Oceania and Southeast and Central Asia had the highest rates of overall stroke mortality. o Central Asia and Eastern Europe had the highest mortality rates attributable to ischemic stroke. o Intracerebral hemorrhage mortality was highest in Oceania, followed by Southeast Asia and central and eastern sub-Saharan Africa. o Mortality attributable to subarachnoid hemorrhage was highest in Oceania, followed by Andean Latin America, and Southeast and Central Asia. Sudden Cardiac Arrest \u2022 In 2021, underlying cause sudden cardiac arrest mortality in the United States was 20,114. \u2022 According to 2022 US data, the majority of adult Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrests (OHCA) occur at a home or residence (72.1%). Public settings (17.3%) and nursing homes (10.6%) were the second and third most common locations of adult OHCA. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States. Please refer to the complete Statistics Update for references and additional information for reported statistics. \u00a92024 American Heart Association, Inc. All rights reserved.

Bystander witnessed adult arrests had a 14.0% survival to hospital discharge and 9-1-1 responder witnessed arrests had a 17.0% survival to hospital discharge. Heart Disease, Stroke and CVD Risk Factors The AHA gauges the cardiovascular health of the nation by tracking eight key health factors and behaviors that increase risks for heart disease and stroke. These are called \u201cLife\u2019s Essential 8\u201d and the AHA measures them to track progress toward improving cardiovascular health for all Americans. Life\u2019s Essential 8 are: not-smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, healthy body weight, sleep health, and control of cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Here are some key facts related to these factors: Smoking \u2022 Worldwide, tobacco contributed to an estimated 7.43 million deaths in 2021. \u2022 In the United States, smoking was the leading risk factor for years of life lost to premature mortality and the third leading risk factor for years of life lived with disability or injury in 2019. \u2022 A meta-analysis of 23 prospective and 17 case-control studies of cardiovascular risks associated with secondhand smoke exposure demonstrated 18%, 23%, 23%, and 29% increased risks for total mortality, total CVD, CHD, and stroke, respectively, in those exposed to secondhand smoke. \u2022 According to the 2020 Surgeon General\u2019s report on smoking cessation, >480 000 Americans die as a result of cigarette smoking and >41 000 die of secondhand smoke exposure each year, \u22481 in 5 deaths annually. \u2022 In 2022, 16.5% of US high school students and 4.5% of middle school students reported current tobacco product use. Additionally, 2.0% of US high school students and 1.0% of middle school students smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days. In the past 30 days, 14.1% of US high school students and 3.3% of middle school students used e-cigarettes. \u2022 In 2022, 11.5% of US adults reported cigarette use every day or some days (13.1% of males and 10.1% of females). Physical Inactivity \u2022 In 2020, the overall prevalence of meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans for aerobic activity was 24.2% in US adults. \u2022 Among US high school students in 2019, 44.1% were physically active for 60 minutes or more on at least 5 days of the week. Nutrition \u2022 Using the AHA\u2019s Life\u2019s Essential 8 scoring metric, diet was among the 4 metrics with the lowest scores; the range for diet across demographic groups was 23.8 to 47.7 out of 100. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States.

    "Summarized_Document": "This document provides key statistics about heart disease, stroke, other cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and their risk factors, based on the 2024 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update by the American Heart Association (AHA). The AHA is the largest non-profit funder of cardiovascular research in the US, having funded over $5 billion in research since 1949. In 2021, CVD was the underlying cause of 931,578 deaths in the US, more than cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined. Between 2017 and 2020, 127.9 million US adults (48.6%) had some form of CVD. The direct and indirect costs of CVD in 2019-2020 were $422.3 billion. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was the leading cause of CVD deaths in 2021, accounting for 40.3% of CVD deaths. Stroke accounted for 17.5% of CVD deaths, with 162,890 deaths in 2021. Sudden cardiac arrest caused 20,114 deaths in 2021. The AHA tracks eight key health factors and behaviors, known as Life\u2019s Essential 8, to gauge cardiovascular health: not smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, healthy body weight, sleep health, and control of cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Smoking contributed to 7.43 million deaths worldwide in 2021. In the US, 16.5% of high school students and 4.5% of middle school students reported current tobacco use in 2022. Physical inactivity was prevalent, with only 24.2% of US adults meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines in 2020. Nutrition scores were low, with children aged 2-5 scoring 61.1 out of 100 and those aged 12-19 scoring 28.5 out of 100. Obesity affected 41.8% of US adults from 2017 to 2020. High cholesterol was prevalent, with 34.7% of US adults having total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL or higher. Insufficient sleep was reported by 32.8% of US adults in 2020. Diabetes affected 10.6% of US adults from 2017 to 2020, with 103,294 deaths attributed to diabetes in 2021. High blood pressure affected 46.7% of US adults from 2017 to 2020, with 124,508 deaths in 2021.

There was a maximum 45.4% reduction in admissions in 2020, associated with a 27.7% reduction in hospital charges, with significant reductions in all examined diagnoses except for birth.\nMeaning\nIn this study, inpatient pediatric admissions in 2020 were reduced across a heterogeneous range of diagnoses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAbstract\nImportance\nIn early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear.\nObjective\nTo determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nNumber of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter.\nResults\nOf 5\u2009424\u2009688 inpatient encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2\u2009823\u2009748 [52.1%] boys; 3\u2009171\u2009224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213\u2009571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43\u2009550 [42\u2009110-43\u2009946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 [$5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$6\u2009324\u2009978\u2009456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020.\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States in January 2020.1 In response, the United States declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, expanded airport screenings, required quarantines for travelers, and undertook public information efforts.2,3 Case counts and fatalities increased slowly in January and February 2020 before achieving exponential growth in March 2020.4 Individual states began additional mitigation strategies in the spring, including stay-at-home orders, which took effect from early March through June 2020.5,6 These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality.6,7 Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for the use of face coverings on April 3, 2020, although enforcement varied by state.3,8 Although COVID-19 has resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations,1,9,10 early reports indicate that it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the United States11 and worldwide.12,13 A 2020 study from Brazil,14 in which regional differences contributed to peak bronchiolitis between February and August, showed a 78% to 85% reduction in hospitalization in infants younger than 1 year for acute bronchiolitis in 2020 compared with previous years.\nMany pediatric diagnoses warranting inpatient admission exhibit seasonal variation; prior work has characterized winter predominance in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 and Kawasaki syndrome18; autumn predominance in asthma16,19,20; and summer predominance in trauma.21 These fluctuations in disease pattern are likely influenced by population susceptibility and behavior as well as various environmental factors. However, to our knowledge, the seasonal patterns in other pediatric admissions remain unexplored. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database22 to determine the seasonal patterns of a variety of common pediatric admission diagnoses and compare data from the previous decade with 2020 admissions. Given the changes in population behavior in 2020,6,7 we hypothesized that pediatric admissions for a variety of diagnoses would be decreased in 2020 compared with prior years, except for admissions for birth.23,24\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 51 children\u2019s hospitals across the United States participating in PHIS, an online, quality-controlled, anonymized, administrative database maintained by the Children\u2019s Hospital Association.22,25 To ensure that changes in admission rates over time were reflective of changes in caseload, rather than expansion of the database by inclusion of new hospitals, the present study was limited to the 49 hospitals that have been providing data since 2010. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were no exclusion criteria. Patients were filtered according to their primary admission diagnoses based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 codes, depending on whether their admission was before or after October 1, 2015. Selected diagnoses were determined according to the percentage of total admissions in PHIS, disease pathophysiology, and seasonal distribution between 2010 and 2019. The full list of included ICD codes for each diagnosis group is included in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. This study was granted exemption by the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board; because the data were anonymous, informed consent could not be obtained. This manuscript follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies.26\nStatistical Analysis\nEncounter-level clinical and administrative data were extracted from PHIS (admission and discharge dates, age, sex, race, ethnicity, diagnostic codes, insurance status, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, complex chronic conditions,27 mechanical ventilation, abstracted charges, and cost). Admissions were described with summary statistics. Hospital charges were adjusted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index according to hospital zip code in PHIS.22 Charge-over-time analyses were adjusted for the quarterly gross domestic product, provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and expressed in quarter 1, 2010, dollars.28 Admission dates were grouped into month and year. Admission numbers were transformed into time series, databased on date of admission, and displayed graphically. Seasonality testing was performed with the Webel and Ollech method.29 Seasonal trends in admission rates between 2010 and 2019 were displayed with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. For visual comparison, the number of admissions in 2020 was displayed against the aforementioned models. For each diagnosis group, ensemble machine-learning forecasting models were created with autoregressive integrated moving average,30 neural network,31 and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms,32 each weighted on time-series cross-validation.33 Time-series data were arranged such that each model was trained on data from January 1, 2010, until June 30, 2019. Model forecasts were tested against actual admission numbers from July 1, 2019, until June 30, 2020. Model predictions were assessed with mean absolute percentage error,33 and the error rates for July 2019 to December 2019 were compared against those for January 2020 to June 2020. To quantify whether social distancing had a statistically significant association with pediatric admission rates, the actual admission rate in 2019 vs 2020 was compared against the ensemble algorithm\u2019s 95% CI.33 We conducted 2 exploratory analyses by repeating the aforementioned steps for patients with any diagnostic code for acute respiratory failure and for in-hospital mortality. All statistical analyses were performed with R Studio version 1.3.1073 and R versions 4.0.2 and 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing) with the following packages: Metrics, forecastHybrid, thief, forecast, cowplot, lubridate, forcats, stringr, dplyr, purrr, readr, tidyr, tibble, ggplot2, and tidyverse.34 An \u03b1 value of .05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance, and all tests were 2-tailed. The code used to create the manuscript is publicly available.35\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nThere were 49 hospitals with admission data in PHIS between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients beginning in 2010, of which 213\u2009571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. As shown in the Table, the cohort had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 5.1 (0.7-13.3) years and included 2\u2009823\u2009748 (52.1%) boys, 3\u2009171\u2009224 (58.5%) White individuals, 994\u2009915 (18.3%) Black individuals, and 1\u2009111\u2009025 (20.5%) Hispanic individuals. A total of 2\u2009977\u2009372 patients (54.9%) had government insurance, and 2\u2009481\u2009647 (45.7%) had a preexisting complex chronic condition. As shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement, the median (IQR) length of stay was 3 (2-5) days. A total of 186\u2009238 admissions (3.4%) had a length of stay of 30 days or more. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2% (5\u2009380\u2009125 encounters). There were 16 selected diagnoses, encompassing 1\u2009446\u2009376 encounters (26.7%). The number of encounters for each selected diagnosis is shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement; birth, bronchiolitis, and trauma were the most common diagnoses.\nTable. \nAbbreviations: CMS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; ECMO, extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; PHIS, Pediatric Health Information Systems.\nSeasonal Patterns in PHIS Admissions\nOverall admissions in PHIS between 2010 and 2019 are shown in Figure 1. There was an increase in the total number of admissions in winter months compared with summer months between 2010 and 2019. There were significantly fewer admissions in July vs January in 2010 to 2019 (median [IQR], 40\u2009726 [40\u2009063-41\u2009839] vs 47\u2009116 [45\u2009472-48\u2009298]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). As shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement, there was a significantly lower median (IQR) number of intensive care unit admissions and admissions requiring mechanical ventilation in July vs January 2010 to 2019 (7097 [6754-7483] vs 8002 [7222-8501]; P\u2009=\u2009.04 and 4140 [3962-4234] vs 4525 [4213-4776]; P\u2009=\u2009.02, respectively). There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23\u2009798 compared with a median (IQR) of 43\u2009550 (42\u2009110-43\u2009946) in April 2010 to 2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years, with 26\u2009089 in June 2020 compared with a median (IQR) of 40\u2009824 (40\u2009302-41\u2009583) in June 2010 to 2019.\nA, Number of monthly admissions in Pediatric Health Information Systems between January 2010 and June 2020, represented as a bar chart. B, Number of monthly admissions between January 2010 and June 2020 represented as a line chart. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nAdmissions by diagnoses are shown in Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. Several distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Because bronchiolitis coding changed in ICD-10 to include separate diagnostic codes for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, the seasonality of individual pathogens is shown in eFigure 4 in the Supplement for 2016 to 2019. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance, associated with the school-year calendar. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance, inversely associated with the school-year calendar in children aged 5 years and older, as shown in eFigure 5 in the Supplement. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. In the case of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, summer predominance was associated with admissions in children older than 1 year, as shown in eFigure 6 in the Supplement. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\nEach panel shows the number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (denoted in red). Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected. Changes in seasonal patterns identified with ensemble time-series forecasting models are shown in Figure 3 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement. Overall, models accurately predicted admission rates from July until December 2019 but not from January to June 2020 (mean absolute percentage error range, 3% to 21.2% vs 8.5% to 1111.7%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.06). A total of 70 of 72 monthly admission (97.2%) rates between July and December 2019 fell within the 95% CI of the models. The admission rates for atrial septal defect and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were below the 95% CI predicted by the models in August and December 2019, respectively. All other conditions remained within the model 95% CIs between July and December 2019. Admissions for birth remained within the model 95% CI between January and June 2020. Every other condition decreased below the model 95% CI between January and June 2020.\nEach panel shows the estimated number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020, according to ensemble forecasting models including autoregressive integrated moving average, neural network, and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms weighted on time-series cross-validation. All models were trained on data from January 2010 through June 2019, and the testing window for each model is shown. The blue line is the model estimate, and the dark and light blue shaded regions are the model 80% and 95% CIs, respectively. The red line is the actual number of admissions for each month. The vertical line represents January 2020. MAPE indicates mean absolute percentage error.\nHospital Charges\nOverall, 5\u2009377\u2009745 of 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters (99.1%) among 3\u2009356\u2009656 patients had hospital charge data available. The quarterly total hospital charges, adjusted for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index and quarterly gross domestic product, are shown in eFigure 8 in the Supplement. The per-admission charges with the same adjustments are shown in eFigure 9 in the Supplement. The total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6\u2009024\u2009735\u2009078 compared with a median (IQR) of $6\u2009229\u2009556\u2009859 ($5\u2009951\u2009083\u2009755-$6\u2009551\u2009134\u2009282) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 compared with a median (IQR) of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 ($5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$5\u2009991\u2009085\u2009056) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. However, the median (IQR) per-admission charge in 2020 was $24\u2009358 ($12\u2009631-$51\u2009740) compared with a median (IQR) of $20\u2009352 ($10\u2009781-$43\u2009604) in 2010 to 2019 (P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nExploratory Analyses\nDiagnoses including any cause of acute respiratory failure displayed significant winter predominance. In-hospital mortality did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation. Seasonal trends and machine-learning models for respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality are shown in eFigure 10 in the Supplement. There were annual increases in admissions for acute respiratory failure from 2010 through February 2020, with a decline in spring 2020. There were 3517 admissions for acute respiratory failure in December 2019 compared with 2143 admissions in December 2018, and 2894 in January 2020 compared with 2050 in January 2019. Acute respiratory failure decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in April 2020. There were no significant changes in admissions with in-hospital mortality between 2010 and 2019. Admissions with in-hospital mortality decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in March 2020.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to use a large database to model pediatric admission volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic for various diagnoses compared with prior years. Using this approach, we identified seasonal patterns in a diverse group of pediatric conditions. Before 2020, pediatric admissions overall displayed winter predominance, associated with an increase in infectious respiratory conditions, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Summer-predominant conditions included trauma and admissions for semielective surgical conditions (eg, atrial septal defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children aged >1 year). The present study is in agreement with several prior studies documenting seasonality in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 asthma,16,19,20 Kawasaki syndrome,18 and trauma.21 However, we additionally noted novel seasonality for diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health admissions and the absence of seasonality in admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta. The seasonality of diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with children aged 5 years or older and may be reflective of the efforts of the American Diabetes Association to incorporate school personnel in the diabetes medical management plans for these patients.36\nAlthough COVID-19 has resulted in few pediatric admissions and mortalities compared with those for adults,1,9,10 the present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 vs a median of 43\u2009550 in April 2010-2019). Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. There was a premature termination of winter-predominant conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia and a reduction in admissions for asthma in 2020 compared with previous years. In exploratory analyses, this was coupled with a decrease in all acute respiratory failure diagnoses. Given the infectious nature of these conditions and their spread by respiratory droplets,37,38,39 this may have been associated with the effects of social distancing and possibly was even fortunate, given evidence of a potentially severe respiratory virus season in 2019 to 2020, with the highest number of respiratory failure admissions recorded in the past decade. A recent Australian study corroborates our findings, with more than 95% reduction in respiratory syncytial virus and influenza detection in Western Australia through winter 2020.40 Taken together, these studies suggest that rates of infectious pediatric respiratory conditions are potentially modifiable by changes in human behavior. Similarly, pediatric trauma admissions are often sports related,41 and the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with decreased childhood physical activity; thus, reductions in trauma admissions were anticipated.42 However, reductions in mental health admissions are surprising, given limited literature suggesting that pandemic-related stressors may worsen mental health in both the general population and those with preexisting psychiatric conditions.43,44 This may represent an opportunity for changes in the delivery of mental health care.45\nThe present study cannot delineate which changes in admission rates represent decreases in incidence, hospital avoidance, or unmet care needs. One inpatient survey suggested that greater than one-third of parents delayed seeking medical care for their child because of fears surrounding COVID-19,46 and case series have reported delayed presentations leading to harm.47,48 Similarly, although admissions for repair of atrial septal defects or later-stage repairs of hypoplastic left heart syndrome may safely be deferred for a short period, it is unclear whether reductions in admission rates represent purely elective surgical delays or the possibility of decreased recognition of congenital heart disease because of decreased contact with health care; small case series of increases in sudden death in adults with congenital heart disease without contact with health care institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported.49 Taken together, these findings are worrisome, although not definitive, in that unmet health care needs may be accumulating in the pediatric population as a result of decreased health care interactions.\nReduced patient volumes during early 2020 have reportedly contributed to financial instability for many hospitals and health systems.50 The reduction in charges observed in the present study suggests a proportionate decline in operating income. Although children\u2019s hospitals generally maintain better operating margins compared with other nonprofit hospitals, the 45.4% reduction in inpatient admissions at children\u2019s hospitals observed during the first 6 months of 2020 and 27.7% reduction in charges observed in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years has an influence on financial security.50,51 Leaders of children\u2019s hospitals could face unique challenges in the coming months as patient volumes eventually recover and are potentially coupled with the destabilizing financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCharacterizing alterations in usual patient admission patterns aids in anticipating the potential ramifications of recent national policies and can also help in crafting responses in a variety of areas. The present study highlights the strengths of an ensemble machine-learning approach to model complex time-series data displaying a variety of seasonal relationships. As complexity in medical information has increased, there has been progressive interest in the application of machine learning to facilitate clinical decision-making. Such algorithms have been studied in a diverse array of applications, including sepsis prediction,52 COVID-19 prognosis,53 population health,54 and cyberbullying.55 In the present study, before the COVID-19 pandemic,6,7 ensemble time-series forecasting models accurately predicted 70 of 72 monthly pediatric admission rates (97.2%) between July 2019 and December 2019. Quantification of the seasonality of various admission types in pediatrics has applicability for hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator capacity planning as well as trainee education. According to the present study, pediatricians and trainees assigned to inpatient wards in the winter will experience higher-than-average case burden and gain greater experience in managing pneumonia and bronchiolitis, whereas those assigned to emergency departments in the summer will achieve greater experience in the management of pediatric trauma. Such knowledge can be harnessed in the development of training curricula that support experience across the spectrum of pediatric illness.\nLimitations\nThis study has important limitations. As with any retrospective database analysis, admission diagnoses are vulnerable to misclassification owing to coding error. Although including greater than 5\u2009000\u2009000 inpatient encounters, this study is limited to 49 hospitals that consistently provided data to PHIS between January 2010 and June 2020 and may not be representative of national pediatric admission trends. Because of data availability, data from some admissions from late June 2020 are not yet available. This may have resulted in undercounting of admissions from June. However, hospitalizations for birth did not decrease below the 95% CIs for the forecasting model. It is also possible that some hospitals have been delayed in reporting admissions to PHIS because of the pandemic, although this is not a known data quality issue. Owing to data availability, only admissions between January and June 2020 were analyzed regarding the effects of social distancing. Further study is warranted as additional data become available.\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. These trends were effectively modeled with ensemble time-series forecasting algorithms. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotes\neFigure 1.

    "Summarized_Document": "Trends in US Pediatric Hospital Admissions in 2020 Compared With the Decade Before the COVID-19 Pandemic\nJonathan H. Pelletier, Jaskaran Rakkar, Alicia K. Au, Dana Fuhrman, Robert S. B. Clark, Christopher M. Horvat\nUPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nAccepted for Publication: December 21, 2020. Published: February 12, 2021. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37227\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\n\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the US in January 2020. In response, the US declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, and implemented various social distancing measures. These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality. Although COVID-19 resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations, early reports indicate it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the US and worldwide.\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 49 children\u2019s hospitals across the US participating in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database. Patients were eligible if discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. Statistical analyses were performed using R Studio and R Project for Statistical Computing.\n\nResults\nThere were 5,424,688 encounters among 3,372,839 patients, of which 213,571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The cohort had a median age of 5.1 years and included 52.1% boys, 58.5% White individuals, 18.3% Black individuals, and 20.5% Hispanic individuals. A total of 54.9% had government insurance, and 45.7% had a preexisting complex chronic condition. The median length of stay was 3 days. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2%. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23,798 compared with a median of 43,550 in April 2010-2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years.\n\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nSeveral distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\n\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020. Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected.\n\nHospital Charges\nThe total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6,024,735,078 compared with a median of $6,229,556,859 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4,327,580,511 compared with a median of $5,983,142,102 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. The median per-admission charge in 2020 was $24,358 compared with a median of $20,352 in 2010 to 2019.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years. Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

There was a maximum 45.4% reduction in admissions in 2020, associated with a 27.7% reduction in hospital charges, with significant reductions in all examined diagnoses except for birth.\nMeaning\nIn this study, inpatient pediatric admissions in 2020 were reduced across a heterogeneous range of diagnoses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAbstract\nImportance\nIn early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear.\nObjective\nTo determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nNumber of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter.\nResults\nOf 5\u2009424\u2009688 inpatient encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2\u2009823\u2009748 [52.1%] boys; 3\u2009171\u2009224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213\u2009571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43\u2009550 [42\u2009110-43\u2009946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 [$5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$6\u2009324\u2009978\u2009456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020.\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States in January 2020.1 In response, the United States declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, expanded airport screenings, required quarantines for travelers, and undertook public information efforts.2,3 Case counts and fatalities increased slowly in January and February 2020 before achieving exponential growth in March 2020.4 Individual states began additional mitigation strategies in the spring, including stay-at-home orders, which took effect from early March through June 2020.5,6 These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality.6,7 Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for the use of face coverings on April 3, 2020, although enforcement varied by state.3,8 Although COVID-19 has resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations,1,9,10 early reports indicate that it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the United States11 and worldwide.12,13 A 2020 study from Brazil,14 in which regional differences contributed to peak bronchiolitis between February and August, showed a 78% to 85% reduction in hospitalization in infants younger than 1 year for acute bronchiolitis in 2020 compared with previous years.\nMany pediatric diagnoses warranting inpatient admission exhibit seasonal variation; prior work has characterized winter predominance in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 and Kawasaki syndrome18; autumn predominance in asthma16,19,20; and summer predominance in trauma.21 These fluctuations in disease pattern are likely influenced by population susceptibility and behavior as well as various environmental factors. However, to our knowledge, the seasonal patterns in other pediatric admissions remain unexplored. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database22 to determine the seasonal patterns of a variety of common pediatric admission diagnoses and compare data from the previous decade with 2020 admissions. Given the changes in population behavior in 2020,6,7 we hypothesized that pediatric admissions for a variety of diagnoses would be decreased in 2020 compared with prior years, except for admissions for birth.23,24\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 51 children\u2019s hospitals across the United States participating in PHIS, an online, quality-controlled, anonymized, administrative database maintained by the Children\u2019s Hospital Association.22,25 To ensure that changes in admission rates over time were reflective of changes in caseload, rather than expansion of the database by inclusion of new hospitals, the present study was limited to the 49 hospitals that have been providing data since 2010. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were no exclusion criteria. Patients were filtered according to their primary admission diagnoses based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 codes, depending on whether their admission was before or after October 1, 2015. Selected diagnoses were determined according to the percentage of total admissions in PHIS, disease pathophysiology, and seasonal distribution between 2010 and 2019. The full list of included ICD codes for each diagnosis group is included in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. This study was granted exemption by the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board; because the data were anonymous, informed consent could not be obtained. This manuscript follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies.26\nStatistical Analysis\nEncounter-level clinical and administrative data were extracted from PHIS (admission and discharge dates, age, sex, race, ethnicity, diagnostic codes, insurance status, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, complex chronic conditions,27 mechanical ventilation, abstracted charges, and cost). Admissions were described with summary statistics. Hospital charges were adjusted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index according to hospital zip code in PHIS.22 Charge-over-time analyses were adjusted for the quarterly gross domestic product, provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and expressed in quarter 1, 2010, dollars.28 Admission dates were grouped into month and year. Admission numbers were transformed into time series, databased on date of admission, and displayed graphically. Seasonality testing was performed with the Webel and Ollech method.29 Seasonal trends in admission rates between 2010 and 2019 were displayed with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. For visual comparison, the number of admissions in 2020 was displayed against the aforementioned models. For each diagnosis group, ensemble machine-learning forecasting models were created with autoregressive integrated moving average,30 neural network,31 and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms,32 each weighted on time-series cross-validation.33 Time-series data were arranged such that each model was trained on data from January 1, 2010, until June 30, 2019. Model forecasts were tested against actual admission numbers from July 1, 2019, until June 30, 2020. Model predictions were assessed with mean absolute percentage error,33 and the error rates for July 2019 to December 2019 were compared against those for January 2020 to June 2020. To quantify whether social distancing had a statistically significant association with pediatric admission rates, the actual admission rate in 2019 vs 2020 was compared against the ensemble algorithm\u2019s 95% CI.33 We conducted 2 exploratory analyses by repeating the aforementioned steps for patients with any diagnostic code for acute respiratory failure and for in-hospital mortality. All statistical analyses were performed with R Studio version 1.3.1073 and R versions 4.0.2 and 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing) with the following packages: Metrics, forecastHybrid, thief, forecast, cowplot, lubridate, forcats, stringr, dplyr, purrr, readr, tidyr, tibble, ggplot2, and tidyverse.34 An \u03b1 value of .05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance, and all tests were 2-tailed. The code used to create the manuscript is publicly available.35\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nThere were 49 hospitals with admission data in PHIS between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients beginning in 2010, of which 213\u2009571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. As shown in the Table, the cohort had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 5.1 (0.7-13.3) years and included 2\u2009823\u2009748 (52.1%) boys, 3\u2009171\u2009224 (58.5%) White individuals, 994\u2009915 (18.3%) Black individuals, and 1\u2009111\u2009025 (20.5%) Hispanic individuals. A total of 2\u2009977\u2009372 patients (54.9%) had government insurance, and 2\u2009481\u2009647 (45.7%) had a preexisting complex chronic condition. As shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement, the median (IQR) length of stay was 3 (2-5) days. A total of 186\u2009238 admissions (3.4%) had a length of stay of 30 days or more. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2% (5\u2009380\u2009125 encounters). There were 16 selected diagnoses, encompassing 1\u2009446\u2009376 encounters (26.7%). The number of encounters for each selected diagnosis is shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement; birth, bronchiolitis, and trauma were the most common diagnoses.\nTable. \nAbbreviations: CMS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; ECMO, extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; PHIS, Pediatric Health Information Systems.\nSeasonal Patterns in PHIS Admissions\nOverall admissions in PHIS between 2010 and 2019 are shown in Figure 1. There was an increase in the total number of admissions in winter months compared with summer months between 2010 and 2019. There were significantly fewer admissions in July vs January in 2010 to 2019 (median [IQR], 40\u2009726 [40\u2009063-41\u2009839] vs 47\u2009116 [45\u2009472-48\u2009298]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). As shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement, there was a significantly lower median (IQR) number of intensive care unit admissions and admissions requiring mechanical ventilation in July vs January 2010 to 2019 (7097 [6754-7483] vs 8002 [7222-8501]; P\u2009=\u2009.04 and 4140 [3962-4234] vs 4525 [4213-4776]; P\u2009=\u2009.02, respectively). There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23\u2009798 compared with a median (IQR) of 43\u2009550 (42\u2009110-43\u2009946) in April 2010 to 2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years, with 26\u2009089 in June 2020 compared with a median (IQR) of 40\u2009824 (40\u2009302-41\u2009583) in June 2010 to 2019.\nA, Number of monthly admissions in Pediatric Health Information Systems between January 2010 and June 2020, represented as a bar chart. B, Number of monthly admissions between January 2010 and June 2020 represented as a line chart. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nAdmissions by diagnoses are shown in Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. Several distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Because bronchiolitis coding changed in ICD-10 to include separate diagnostic codes for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, the seasonality of individual pathogens is shown in eFigure 4 in the Supplement for 2016 to 2019. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance, associated with the school-year calendar. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance, inversely associated with the school-year calendar in children aged 5 years and older, as shown in eFigure 5 in the Supplement. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. In the case of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, summer predominance was associated with admissions in children older than 1 year, as shown in eFigure 6 in the Supplement. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\nEach panel shows the number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (denoted in red). Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected. Changes in seasonal patterns identified with ensemble time-series forecasting models are shown in Figure 3 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement. Overall, models accurately predicted admission rates from July until December 2019 but not from January to June 2020 (mean absolute percentage error range, 3% to 21.2% vs 8.5% to 1111.7%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.06). A total of 70 of 72 monthly admission (97.2%) rates between July and December 2019 fell within the 95% CI of the models. The admission rates for atrial septal defect and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were below the 95% CI predicted by the models in August and December 2019, respectively. All other conditions remained within the model 95% CIs between July and December 2019. Admissions for birth remained within the model 95% CI between January and June 2020. Every other condition decreased below the model 95% CI between January and June 2020.\nEach panel shows the estimated number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020, according to ensemble forecasting models including autoregressive integrated moving average, neural network, and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms weighted on time-series cross-validation. All models were trained on data from January 2010 through June 2019, and the testing window for each model is shown. The blue line is the model estimate, and the dark and light blue shaded regions are the model 80% and 95% CIs, respectively. The red line is the actual number of admissions for each month. The vertical line represents January 2020. MAPE indicates mean absolute percentage error.\nHospital Charges\nOverall, 5\u2009377\u2009745 of 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters (99.1%) among 3\u2009356\u2009656 patients had hospital charge data available. The quarterly total hospital charges, adjusted for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index and quarterly gross domestic product, are shown in eFigure 8 in the Supplement. The per-admission charges with the same adjustments are shown in eFigure 9 in the Supplement. The total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6\u2009024\u2009735\u2009078 compared with a median (IQR) of $6\u2009229\u2009556\u2009859 ($5\u2009951\u2009083\u2009755-$6\u2009551\u2009134\u2009282) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 compared with a median (IQR) of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 ($5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$5\u2009991\u2009085\u2009056) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. However, the median (IQR) per-admission charge in 2020 was $24\u2009358 ($12\u2009631-$51\u2009740) compared with a median (IQR) of $20\u2009352 ($10\u2009781-$43\u2009604) in 2010 to 2019 (P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nExploratory Analyses\nDiagnoses including any cause of acute respiratory failure displayed significant winter predominance. In-hospital mortality did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation. Seasonal trends and machine-learning models for respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality are shown in eFigure 10 in the Supplement. There were annual increases in admissions for acute respiratory failure from 2010 through February 2020, with a decline in spring 2020. There were 3517 admissions for acute respiratory failure in December 2019 compared with 2143 admissions in December 2018, and 2894 in January 2020 compared with 2050 in January 2019. Acute respiratory failure decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in April 2020. There were no significant changes in admissions with in-hospital mortality between 2010 and 2019. Admissions with in-hospital mortality decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in March 2020.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to use a large database to model pediatric admission volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic for various diagnoses compared with prior years. Using this approach, we identified seasonal patterns in a diverse group of pediatric conditions. Before 2020, pediatric admissions overall displayed winter predominance, associated with an increase in infectious respiratory conditions, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Summer-predominant conditions included trauma and admissions for semielective surgical conditions (eg, atrial septal defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children aged >1 year). The present study is in agreement with several prior studies documenting seasonality in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 asthma,16,19,20 Kawasaki syndrome,18 and trauma.21 However, we additionally noted novel seasonality for diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health admissions and the absence of seasonality in admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta. The seasonality of diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with children aged 5 years or older and may be reflective of the efforts of the American Diabetes Association to incorporate school personnel in the diabetes medical management plans for these patients.36\nAlthough COVID-19 has resulted in few pediatric admissions and mortalities compared with those for adults,1,9,10 the present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 vs a median of 43\u2009550 in April 2010-2019). Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. There was a premature termination of winter-predominant conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia and a reduction in admissions for asthma in 2020 compared with previous years. In exploratory analyses, this was coupled with a decrease in all acute respiratory failure diagnoses. Given the infectious nature of these conditions and their spread by respiratory droplets,37,38,39 this may have been associated with the effects of social distancing and possibly was even fortunate, given evidence of a potentially severe respiratory virus season in 2019 to 2020, with the highest number of respiratory failure admissions recorded in the past decade. A recent Australian study corroborates our findings, with more than 95% reduction in respiratory syncytial virus and influenza detection in Western Australia through winter 2020.40 Taken together, these studies suggest that rates of infectious pediatric respiratory conditions are potentially modifiable by changes in human behavior. Similarly, pediatric trauma admissions are often sports related,41 and the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with decreased childhood physical activity; thus, reductions in trauma admissions were anticipated.42 However, reductions in mental health admissions are surprising, given limited literature suggesting that pandemic-related stressors may worsen mental health in both the general population and those with preexisting psychiatric conditions.43,44 This may represent an opportunity for changes in the delivery of mental health care.45\nThe present study cannot delineate which changes in admission rates represent decreases in incidence, hospital avoidance, or unmet care needs. One inpatient survey suggested that greater than one-third of parents delayed seeking medical care for their child because of fears surrounding COVID-19,46 and case series have reported delayed presentations leading to harm.47,48 Similarly, although admissions for repair of atrial septal defects or later-stage repairs of hypoplastic left heart syndrome may safely be deferred for a short period, it is unclear whether reductions in admission rates represent purely elective surgical delays or the possibility of decreased recognition of congenital heart disease because of decreased contact with health care; small case series of increases in sudden death in adults with congenital heart disease without contact with health care institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported.49 Taken together, these findings are worrisome, although not definitive, in that unmet health care needs may be accumulating in the pediatric population as a result of decreased health care interactions.\nReduced patient volumes during early 2020 have reportedly contributed to financial instability for many hospitals and health systems.50 The reduction in charges observed in the present study suggests a proportionate decline in operating income. Although children\u2019s hospitals generally maintain better operating margins compared with other nonprofit hospitals, the 45.4% reduction in inpatient admissions at children\u2019s hospitals observed during the first 6 months of 2020 and 27.7% reduction in charges observed in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years has an influence on financial security.50,51 Leaders of children\u2019s hospitals could face unique challenges in the coming months as patient volumes eventually recover and are potentially coupled with the destabilizing financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCharacterizing alterations in usual patient admission patterns aids in anticipating the potential ramifications of recent national policies and can also help in crafting responses in a variety of areas. The present study highlights the strengths of an ensemble machine-learning approach to model complex time-series data displaying a variety of seasonal relationships. As complexity in medical information has increased, there has been progressive interest in the application of machine learning to facilitate clinical decision-making. Such algorithms have been studied in a diverse array of applications, including sepsis prediction,52 COVID-19 prognosis,53 population health,54 and cyberbullying.55 In the present study, before the COVID-19 pandemic,6,7 ensemble time-series forecasting models accurately predicted 70 of 72 monthly pediatric admission rates (97.2%) between July 2019 and December 2019. Quantification of the seasonality of various admission types in pediatrics has applicability for hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator capacity planning as well as trainee education. According to the present study, pediatricians and trainees assigned to inpatient wards in the winter will experience higher-than-average case burden and gain greater experience in managing pneumonia and bronchiolitis, whereas those assigned to emergency departments in the summer will achieve greater experience in the management of pediatric trauma. Such knowledge can be harnessed in the development of training curricula that support experience across the spectrum of pediatric illness.\nLimitations\nThis study has important limitations. As with any retrospective database analysis, admission diagnoses are vulnerable to misclassification owing to coding error. Although including greater than 5\u2009000\u2009000 inpatient encounters, this study is limited to 49 hospitals that consistently provided data to PHIS between January 2010 and June 2020 and may not be representative of national pediatric admission trends. Because of data availability, data from some admissions from late June 2020 are not yet available. This may have resulted in undercounting of admissions from June. However, hospitalizations for birth did not decrease below the 95% CIs for the forecasting model. It is also possible that some hospitals have been delayed in reporting admissions to PHIS because of the pandemic, although this is not a known data quality issue. Owing to data availability, only admissions between January and June 2020 were analyzed regarding the effects of social distancing. Further study is warranted as additional data become available.\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. These trends were effectively modeled with ensemble time-series forecasting algorithms. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotes\neFigure 1.

Au, Dana Fuhrman, Robert S. B. Clark, Christopher M. Horvat\nUPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nAccepted for Publication: December 21, 2020. Published: February 12, 2021. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37227\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\n\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the US in January 2020. In response, the US declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, and implemented various social distancing measures. These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality. Although COVID-19 resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations, early reports indicate it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the US and worldwide.\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 49 children\u2019s hospitals across the US participating in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database. Patients were eligible if discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. Statistical analyses were performed using R Studio and R Project for Statistical Computing.\n\nResults\nThere were 5,424,688 encounters among 3,372,839 patients, of which 213,571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The cohort had a median age of 5.1 years and included 52.1% boys, 58.5% White individuals, 18.3% Black individuals, and 20.5% Hispanic individuals. A total of 54.9% had government insurance, and 45.7% had a preexisting complex chronic condition. The median length of stay was 3 days. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2%. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23,798 compared with a median of 43,550 in April 2010-2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years.\n\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nSeveral distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\n\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020. Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected.\n\nHospital Charges\nThe total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6,024,735,078 compared with a median of $6,229,556,859 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4,327,580,511 compared with a median of $5,983,142,102 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. The median per-admission charge in 2020 was $24,358 compared with a median of $20,352 in 2010 to 2019.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years. Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

We sought to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes.\nMethods:\nWe used data from the General Internal Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) study, a retrospective cohort study, of all patients admitted to a general internal medicine service at 7 Toronto hospitals between 2010 and 2015. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Most Responsible Diagnosis code was used to identify the 10 most frequent reasons for admission in patients with diabetes. Cost of hospital admission was estimated using the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight. Comparisons were made between patients with or without diabetes using the Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free confidence intervals (CIs) for median cost.\nResults:\nAmong the 150 499 hospital admissions in our study, 41 934 (27.8%) involved patients with diabetes. Compared with patients without diabetes, hospital admissions because of soft tissue and bone infections were most frequent (2.5% v. 1.9%; prevalence ratio [PR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37) and costly (Can$8794 v. Can$5845; cost ratio [CR] 1.50, 95% CI 1.37\u20131.65) among patients with diabetes. This was followed by urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22; CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19; CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25) and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20; CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34).\nInterpretation:\nSoft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders are associated with a greater frequency and cost of hospital admissions in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing hospital admissions secondary to these disorders may be beneficial in patients with diabetes.\n\nDiabetes inflicts a heavy burden on health care systems globally.1 In Canada and the United States, nearly 1 in 10 people are diagnosed with diabetes,2,3 and this figure has been projected to increase to 1 in 5 people by 2050.4 In 2008, diabetes cost Canada $2.18 billion in the form of hospital admissions, physician care and medications. 5 By 2022, new cases of diabetes have been estimated to cost an additional $15.36 billion.6 In the US, one-quarter of all health care expenditures in 2017 were incurred by people with diabetes.3\nAcute inpatient hospital admissions are the primary driver of health care costs related to diabetes in Canada and the US. In many jurisdictions, including Ontario, more than 50% of attributable costs in incident diabetes are ascribed to acute inpatient hospital admissions.3,7 Research has shown diabetes to portend a higher likelihood of heart failure,8 stroke9 and renal failure.10 However, there is a paucity of data describing the specific medical conditions that drive the increased frequency and cost of hospital admission among people with diabetes. Such population-level data could specifically guide public policy in strengthening support for greater outpatient services among people with diabetes.\nThe objectives of this study were to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes.\nMethods\nStudy design and setting\nThis is a retrospective cohort study using data collected by the General Internal Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) study. A full description of the design and methods of the study has been presented previously.11 The GEMINI study involves 7 large hospital sites affiliated with the University of Toronto: St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Credit Valley Hospital and Mississauga Hospital. The latter 2 hospitals are large community teaching hospitals serving the neighbouring city of Mississauga. The remaining GEMINI hospitals are academic health centres in Toronto (Appendix 1, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1). All GEMINI hospitals are publicly funded, independently operated and provide tertiary or quaternary care.\nStudy population\nWe included all patients admitted to or discharged from the general internal medicine service at each hospital between Apr. 1, 2010, and Mar. 31, 2015. This included patients who required an intensive care unit (ICU) admission at any point during their hospital admission and those who were transferred to surgical services (e.g., for an amputation). There were no exclusion criteria.\nGeneral internal medicine admissions accounted for a substantial proportion of hospital admissions, including 39% of all emergency admissions.11 The most responsible care providers on the general internal medicine wards were predominantly internists. A separate inpatient cardiology ward was ubiquitous among all hospitals, but access to respirology, nephrology, hematology, gastroenterology, oncology and stroke wards varied. There were no separate endocrinology inpatient wards at any centres.\nData sources and collection\nWe collected patient-level characteristics for each admission, including demographic characteristics, diagnoses, interventions and discharge destination as reported by participating hospitals to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database (DAD). Each individual-level record included age, sex, place of residence at time of admission and discharge, most responsible discharge diagnosis, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, laboratory and radiology test results, blood transfusions, medications and intensive care unit admissions (Appendix 2, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1). Unique identifiers were used to link all data, and analyses on a subset of data showed 98%\u2013100% accuracy compared with chart review.12 Patients with diabetes were identified using CIHI Diagnosis Code (Group 10, Field 02) which conveys International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes as recorded in hospital administrative databases.\nFor each admission, we identified the primary discharge diagnosis using ICD-10 codes. Diseases were then classified into clinically relevant categories using Clinical Classifications Software, which organizes individual diagnoses into 285 mutually exclusive categories.11\nTo estimate the cost of each hospital admission comparably across sites and years, we used the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight (RIW) for each admission13 and multiplied this by the annual cost per weighted case for acute inpatient cases that was reported for each hospital using the Ontario Cost Distribution Methodology.14 The RIW is determined by CIHI using information collected in the DAD, which captures administrative, clinical and demographic information on hospital discharges from all acute inpatient separations (i.e., transfer, death, discharge or the patient leaving against advice) in Canada, with the exception of Quebec. Based on individual factors affecting medical complexity, including most responsible discharge diagnosis, age and comorbidities, every inpatient case is assigned an RIW by CIHI. This approach allows for the estimation of a nationally comparable cost for each hospital stay, including costs related to administration, staff, supplies, technology and equipment, but does not include fee-for-service physician billing costs.15 Data from CIHI have been validated previously16,17 and have reliably formed the basis for a substantial body of clinical and health services research.18,19\nAll costs were reported in Canadian dollars.\nStatistical analysis\nThe study population was described using means and standard deviations (SDs) or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), as appropriate for continuous or interval variables, and frequencies for categorical variables. We compared patients with or without diabetes using a Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free confidence intervals (CIs) for median cost.20 For the top 10 most frequent reasons for admission among patients with diabetes, we compared frequency and cost of admission using prevalence ratios (PRs) and cost ratios (CRs). We computed PRs and CRs as the ratio of frequency or cost in patients with diabetes to the frequency or cost in patients without diabetes.21 Given large sample sizes, we determined differences to be meaningful if they were both statistically significant (p < 0.05) and relative differences were greater than 10%.\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses using only the first hospital admission for all included patients and stratifying results by sex. We accounted for inflation by standardizing fiscal year cost of hospital stay to April 2015 using Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health guidance and used the general consumer price index as a deflator.22 All analyses were conducted using R statistical software, version 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\nEthics approval\nResearch ethics board approval was obtained from all participating hospitals (Clinical Trials Ontario Study ID 1394). An exception from informed consent was obtained because this was a large retrospective study with minimal risk of re-identification for any individual patient.\nResults\nThere were 150 499 admissions to general internal medicine wards across all hospital sites during the study period (Table 1). There were 97 316 unique patients. Overall, 41 934 (27.8%) of all hospital admissions occurred in patients with diabetes, and most hospital admissions (94.1%) were among patients with type 2 diabetes. Among all patients admitted to hospital, the median age was 73 years, 50.2% were female and the median number of comorbidities, including diabetes, was 6.\nTable 1:\nCharacteristics of study participants, stratified by diabetes status\nNote: IQR = interquartile range, SD = standard deviation.\nFrequency of admissions\nThe most frequent reasons for admission to general internal medicine (Table 2, Table 3) among patients with diabetes were heart failure (7.7%), urinary tract infection (5.1%), stroke (4.8%), pneumonia (4.6%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4.4%), delirium (3.2%), acute renal failure (2.9%), sepsis (2.8%), soft tissue and bone infections (2.5%) and electrolyte disorders (2.4%). Based on the Clinical Classifications Software group of electrolyte disorders, the most common were hyponatremia (57.2%), dehydration (14.1%), hypernatremia (10.2%), hyperkalemia (6.0%) and hypokalemia (4.0%).\nTable 2:\nPrevalence and cost of admission for most common reasons for hospital admissions, stratified by diabetes status\nNote: COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nTable 3:\nMost common reasons for hospital admission, stratified by increase in prevalence and cost of hospital admission\nNote: COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nThe PRs for these conditions (Figure 1, Table 3) showed that acute renal failure (PR 2.02, 95% CI 1.87\u20132.17), heart failure (PR 1.88, 95% CI 1.80\u20131.96), soft tissue and bone infections (PR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37), sepsis (PR 1.22, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.31), urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22), delirium (PR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.23), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19) and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20) were the more common reasons for hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with those without.\nPrevalence ratios with error bars of most responsible reasons for diagnosis.

The proportional difference in cost of admission for heart failure, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were statistically significant but were not greater than our threshold of 10%.\nCost ratios with error bars of most responsible reasons for diagnosis. Note: CI = confidence interval, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CR = cost ratio.\nStratifying by sex did not significantly change our results, with the exception of acute renal failure (CR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.26 in females; not statistically significant in males), urinary tract infection (CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.28 in females; not statistically significant in males) and sepsis (CR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15\u20131.35 in males; not statistically significant in females) (Appendix 3).\nSensitivity analyses\nSensitivity analyses that used only the first hospital admission for each patient (n = 96 073) did not significantly change our results. Adjustment for age is included in the CIHI RIW methodology used for cost estimation, and adjustment for inflation did not significantly change our results14 (Appendices 4 and 5, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1).\nInterpretation\nIn our study of patients admitted to the general internal medicine services at 7 Toronto hospitals, nearly one-third had diabetes. Soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders were more frequent and costly among patients with diabetes than among patients without. In addition, hospital admissions for acute renal failure, heart failure, sepsis and delirium occurred at a greater frequency in the diabetes population, but not at an increased cost.\nDiabetes is a highly prevalent and potential driver of illness among patients admitted to hospital. A recent study found hypertension to be the most common comorbid condition among patients admitted to hospital with diabetes as the primary reason for admission.23 However, as we have shown, diabetes itself is rarely a reason for admission; rather, its associated morbidities frequently lead to hospital admissions owing to complications including soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders. This study provides essential information for clinicians and policy makers to understand the broader impact of diabetes on hospital admissions.\nOur findings on stroke add to existing knowledge: patients with diabetes have about twice the risk of stroke as those without diabetes.24 Rates of stroke have fallen substantially over the last few decades in response to the growing evidence in support of cardioprotective therapies and their adoption in clinical practice.25 Yet, based on our evidence, admissions for stroke remain more common in patients with diabetes.\nCompared with stroke prevention, the prevention of soft tissue and bone infections has received less attention in the research literature, potentially at the expense of increased morbidity and mortality.26 In Canada and the US, decades of improvements in rates of nontraumatic lower-extremity amputations in patients with diabetes have recently reversed, especially among younger adults.27\u201329 A 2017 international meta-analysis comparing the prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers across 33 countries has found Canada (14.8%) to have the second highest rate, after Belgium (16.6%).30 Foot care is one of the most neglected components of standard diabetes care practices, with only 51% of Canadian patients with diabetes having their feet checked as recommended.31 With the exception of recent coverage in Ontario, offloading devices are not currently covered for Canadians with diabetes who have foot ulcers.32 In addition, the prevalence of diabetes is higher in lower-income households,33 providing real-life context to the 57% of Canadians with diabetes who cannot afford their necessary medications, devices and supplies.34\nTo curb such trends in soft tissue and bone infections, proven preventive measures, including regular foot examination, debridement, mechanical offloading devices and chiropody, must not only be available, but also easily accessible for patients with diabetes who often lack economic or social capital. As part of increasing efforts to integrate information technology into medicine,35 the use of telemedicine36 and social media37 in diabetes foot care may help fill in gaps in accessibility and knowledge dissemination. Given the projected increase in the burden of diabetic foot ulcers, including frequent and costly admissions to hospital as shown in our study, increased primary care efforts and public funding should be directed specifically toward proven preventive strategies and modernized approaches.38\nMost of the diabetes-related conditions identified in our study were vascular in nature, except for urinary tract infections, delirium and electrolyte disorders. The increased burden of hospital admission secondary to urinary tract infections in patients with diabetes is consistent with existing knowledge. 39 Diabetes is associated with a higher risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, urinary tract infections and severe complications. Whether patients with diabetes should be treated if they have asymptomatic bacteriuria is unknown and may be an important focus of future research. In addition, ongoing review of the safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, which are gaining prominence in diabetes care, is needed to understand its impact on urinary tract infections among patients with diabetes.40\nAlthough delirium may be caused by any of the identified comorbid conditions, there is limited literature on how diabetes itself can predispose an individual to delirium. Diabetes has been associated with both Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia,41 yet studies on its association with delirium have yielded mixed results and have been conducted primarily in an intensive care setting.42 One plausible hypothesis is that the generation of microvascular malformations in the central nervous system from persistent metabolic derangements leads to endothelial damage and deregulated angiogenesis.43 Given that the prevalence of delirium among our patients with diabetes was 15% greater than among those without, further studies are warranted to understand the mechanism behind this increased prevalence.\nElectrolyte disorders were one of the most frequent and costly reasons for admission in patients with diabetes, yet preventive strategies are lacking. The multifactorial nature of its pathophysiology in diabetes, likely including poor nutrition, impaired gastrointestinal absorption, acid\u2013base abnormalities and pharmacological agents, makes electrolyte abnormalities a challenging condition to prevent.44 Further studies that aim to elucidate the individual pathophysiologic mechanisms of electrolyte disorders in patients with diabetes will be necessary to develop outpatient strategies for monitoring and prevention.\nFinally, heart failure was the most common reason for hospital admission among patients with diabetes, a relation that has been well established.45 New treatment options for this particular demographic have been emerging. For instance, a meta-analysis evaluating cardiovascular outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors found that these medications have shown promising effects of reducing hospital admissions secondary to heart failure by about 30%, regardless of presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heart failure at baseline.46\nLimitations\nThere are several limitations to our study. Our patients with diabetes were restricted to those who were admitted to a general internal medicine service for some portion of their hospital admission and did not include patients admitted to surgical, psychiatric or subspecialty medical services. Thus, the frequency of admissions secondary to diabetes-related complications or severe complications may be underestimated. However, more than one-third of emergency department admissions are to a general internal medicine service; therefore, our data capture the largest group of patients requiring hospital admission and represent a crucial health services group on which to focus.11\nOur cost estimates did not take physician billing and outpatient expenses into account; therefore, the costs of admission may have been underestimated, which may have affected the CR methods we adopted. Using the RIW, we were able to estimate the cost of hospital admission, but not out-of-pocket costs such as mechanical offloading devices. However, RIW has been used previously in similar studies7,47 and provides a reasonable and comparable estimation of the direct health care costs attributable to diabetes.\nThere remains a residual risk of clustering at the hospital, physician and admission levels. We conducted sensitivity analyses using only the first hospital admission, and the results were robust. Our patient population came from only 2 cities in Canada. However, our inclusion of the 5 largest hospitals in Toronto and the only 2 hospitals in Mississauga, Canada\u2019s first and ninth most populous municipalities respectively, adds to the generalizability of our findings. Lastly, the number of comorbid conditions in the comparison of patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes was not adjusted.\nConclusion\nA substantial portion of acute hospital admissions are associated with diabetes. Our study characterizes the frequency and costs associated with acute inpatient hospital admissions to a general internal medicine service from various diabetes-related conditions. Based on our findings, a preventive strategy focused on reducing hospital admissions secondary to soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders in patients with diabetes may be beneficial in this high-risk group.\nSupplementary Material\nFootnotes\nCompeting interests: Amol Verma and Fahad Razak report that they are part-time employees of Health Quality Ontario.

The CIHI Most Responsible Diagnosis code identified the 10 most frequent reasons for admission in patients with diabetes. Cost was estimated using the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight. Results: Out of 150,499 hospital admissions, 41,934 (27.8%) involved patients with diabetes.

This was followed by urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22; CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19; CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25), and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20; CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34). Interpretation: Soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke, and electrolyte disorders are associated with greater frequency and cost of hospital admissions in patients with diabetes.

The most frequent reasons for admission were heart failure (7.7%), urinary tract infection (5.1%), stroke (4.8%), pneumonia (4.6%), COPD (4.4%), delirium (3.2%), acute renal failure (2.9%), sepsis (2.8%), soft tissue and bone infections (2.5%), and electrolyte disorders (2.4%). The median costs of admission for these conditions ranged from $4422 to $12,916. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusion: A substantial portion of acute hospital admissions are associated with diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing admissions for soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke, and electrolyte disorders may benefit this high-risk group.",

We sought to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes.\nMethods:\nWe used data from the General Internal Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) study, a retrospective cohort study, of all patients admitted to a general internal medicine service at 7 Toronto hospitals between 2010 and 2015. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Most Responsible Diagnosis code was used to identify the 10 most frequent reasons for admission in patients with diabetes. Cost of hospital admission was estimated using the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight. Comparisons were made between patients with or without diabetes using the Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free confidence intervals (CIs) for median cost.\nResults:\nAmong the 150 499 hospital admissions in our study, 41 934 (27.8%) involved patients with diabetes. Compared with patients without diabetes, hospital admissions because of soft tissue and bone infections were most frequent (2.5% v. 1.9%; prevalence ratio [PR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37) and costly (Can$8794 v. Can$5845; cost ratio [CR] 1.50, 95% CI 1.37\u20131.65) among patients with diabetes. This was followed by urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22; CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19; CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25) and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20; CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34).\nInterpretation:\nSoft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders are associated with a greater frequency and cost of hospital admissions in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing hospital admissions secondary to these disorders may be beneficial in patients with diabetes.\n\nDiabetes inflicts a heavy burden on health care systems globally.1 In Canada and the United States, nearly 1 in 10 people are diagnosed with diabetes,2,3 and this figure has been projected to increase to 1 in 5 people by 2050.4 In 2008, diabetes cost Canada $2.18 billion in the form of hospital admissions, physician care and medications. 5 By 2022, new cases of diabetes have been estimated to cost an additional $15.36 billion.6 In the US, one-quarter of all health care expenditures in 2017 were incurred by people with diabetes.3\nAcute inpatient hospital admissions are the primary driver of health care costs related to diabetes in Canada and the US. In many jurisdictions, including Ontario, more than 50% of attributable costs in incident diabetes are ascribed to acute inpatient hospital admissions.3,7 Research has shown diabetes to portend a higher likelihood of heart failure,8 stroke9 and renal failure.10 However, there is a paucity of data describing the specific medical conditions that drive the increased frequency and cost of hospital admission among people with diabetes. Such population-level data could specifically guide public policy in strengthening support for greater outpatient services among people with diabetes.\nThe objectives of this study were to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes.\nMethods\nStudy design and setting\nThis is a retrospective cohort study using data collected by the General Internal Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) study. A full description of the design and methods of the study has been presented previously.11 The GEMINI study involves 7 large hospital sites affiliated with the University of Toronto: St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Credit Valley Hospital and Mississauga Hospital. The latter 2 hospitals are large community teaching hospitals serving the neighbouring city of Mississauga. The remaining GEMINI hospitals are academic health centres in Toronto (Appendix 1, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1). All GEMINI hospitals are publicly funded, independently operated and provide tertiary or quaternary care.\nStudy population\nWe included all patients admitted to or discharged from the general internal medicine service at each hospital between Apr. 1, 2010, and Mar. 31, 2015. This included patients who required an intensive care unit (ICU) admission at any point during their hospital admission and those who were transferred to surgical services (e.g., for an amputation). There were no exclusion criteria.\nGeneral internal medicine admissions accounted for a substantial proportion of hospital admissions, including 39% of all emergency admissions.11 The most responsible care providers on the general internal medicine wards were predominantly internists. A separate inpatient cardiology ward was ubiquitous among all hospitals, but access to respirology, nephrology, hematology, gastroenterology, oncology and stroke wards varied. There were no separate endocrinology inpatient wards at any centres.\nData sources and collection\nWe collected patient-level characteristics for each admission, including demographic characteristics, diagnoses, interventions and discharge destination as reported by participating hospitals to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database (DAD). Each individual-level record included age, sex, place of residence at time of admission and discharge, most responsible discharge diagnosis, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, laboratory and radiology test results, blood transfusions, medications and intensive care unit admissions (Appendix 2, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1). Unique identifiers were used to link all data, and analyses on a subset of data showed 98%\u2013100% accuracy compared with chart review.12 Patients with diabetes were identified using CIHI Diagnosis Code (Group 10, Field 02) which conveys International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes as recorded in hospital administrative databases.\nFor each admission, we identified the primary discharge diagnosis using ICD-10 codes. Diseases were then classified into clinically relevant categories using Clinical Classifications Software, which organizes individual diagnoses into 285 mutually exclusive categories.11\nTo estimate the cost of each hospital admission comparably across sites and years, we used the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight (RIW) for each admission13 and multiplied this by the annual cost per weighted case for acute inpatient cases that was reported for each hospital using the Ontario Cost Distribution Methodology.14 The RIW is determined by CIHI using information collected in the DAD, which captures administrative, clinical and demographic information on hospital discharges from all acute inpatient separations (i.e., transfer, death, discharge or the patient leaving against advice) in Canada, with the exception of Quebec. Based on individual factors affecting medical complexity, including most responsible discharge diagnosis, age and comorbidities, every inpatient case is assigned an RIW by CIHI. This approach allows for the estimation of a nationally comparable cost for each hospital stay, including costs related to administration, staff, supplies, technology and equipment, but does not include fee-for-service physician billing costs.15 Data from CIHI have been validated previously16,17 and have reliably formed the basis for a substantial body of clinical and health services research.18,19\nAll costs were reported in Canadian dollars.\nStatistical analysis\nThe study population was described using means and standard deviations (SDs) or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), as appropriate for continuous or interval variables, and frequencies for categorical variables. We compared patients with or without diabetes using a Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free confidence intervals (CIs) for median cost.20 For the top 10 most frequent reasons for admission among patients with diabetes, we compared frequency and cost of admission using prevalence ratios (PRs) and cost ratios (CRs). We computed PRs and CRs as the ratio of frequency or cost in patients with diabetes to the frequency or cost in patients without diabetes.21 Given large sample sizes, we determined differences to be meaningful if they were both statistically significant (p < 0.05) and relative differences were greater than 10%.\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses using only the first hospital admission for all included patients and stratifying results by sex. We accounted for inflation by standardizing fiscal year cost of hospital stay to April 2015 using Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health guidance and used the general consumer price index as a deflator.22 All analyses were conducted using R statistical software, version 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\nEthics approval\nResearch ethics board approval was obtained from all participating hospitals (Clinical Trials Ontario Study ID 1394). An exception from informed consent was obtained because this was a large retrospective study with minimal risk of re-identification for any individual patient.\nResults\nThere were 150 499 admissions to general internal medicine wards across all hospital sites during the study period (Table 1). There were 97 316 unique patients. Overall, 41 934 (27.8%) of all hospital admissions occurred in patients with diabetes, and most hospital admissions (94.1%) were among patients with type 2 diabetes. Among all patients admitted to hospital, the median age was 73 years, 50.2% were female and the median number of comorbidities, including diabetes, was 6.\nTable 1:\nCharacteristics of study participants, stratified by diabetes status\nNote: IQR = interquartile range, SD = standard deviation.\nFrequency of admissions\nThe most frequent reasons for admission to general internal medicine (Table 2, Table 3) among patients with diabetes were heart failure (7.7%), urinary tract infection (5.1%), stroke (4.8%), pneumonia (4.6%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4.4%), delirium (3.2%), acute renal failure (2.9%), sepsis (2.8%), soft tissue and bone infections (2.5%) and electrolyte disorders (2.4%). Based on the Clinical Classifications Software group of electrolyte disorders, the most common were hyponatremia (57.2%), dehydration (14.1%), hypernatremia (10.2%), hyperkalemia (6.0%) and hypokalemia (4.0%).\nTable 2:\nPrevalence and cost of admission for most common reasons for hospital admissions, stratified by diabetes status\nNote: COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nTable 3:\nMost common reasons for hospital admission, stratified by increase in prevalence and cost of hospital admission\nNote: COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nThe PRs for these conditions (Figure 1, Table 3) showed that acute renal failure (PR 2.02, 95% CI 1.87\u20132.17), heart failure (PR 1.88, 95% CI 1.80\u20131.96), soft tissue and bone infections (PR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37), sepsis (PR 1.22, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.31), urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22), delirium (PR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.23), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19) and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20) were the more common reasons for hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with those without.\nPrevalence ratios with error bars of most responsible reasons for diagnosis.

The proportional difference in cost of admission for heart failure, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were statistically significant but were not greater than our threshold of 10%.\nCost ratios with error bars of most responsible reasons for diagnosis. Note: CI = confidence interval, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CR = cost ratio.\nStratifying by sex did not significantly change our results, with the exception of acute renal failure (CR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.26 in females; not statistically significant in males), urinary tract infection (CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.28 in females; not statistically significant in males) and sepsis (CR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15\u20131.35 in males; not statistically significant in females) (Appendix 3).\nSensitivity analyses\nSensitivity analyses that used only the first hospital admission for each patient (n = 96 073) did not significantly change our results. Adjustment for age is included in the CIHI RIW methodology used for cost estimation, and adjustment for inflation did not significantly change our results14 (Appendices 4 and 5, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1).\nInterpretation\nIn our study of patients admitted to the general internal medicine services at 7 Toronto hospitals, nearly one-third had diabetes. Soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders were more frequent and costly among patients with diabetes than among patients without. In addition, hospital admissions for acute renal failure, heart failure, sepsis and delirium occurred at a greater frequency in the diabetes population, but not at an increased cost.\nDiabetes is a highly prevalent and potential driver of illness among patients admitted to hospital. A recent study found hypertension to be the most common comorbid condition among patients admitted to hospital with diabetes as the primary reason for admission.23 However, as we have shown, diabetes itself is rarely a reason for admission; rather, its associated morbidities frequently lead to hospital admissions owing to complications including soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders. This study provides essential information for clinicians and policy makers to understand the broader impact of diabetes on hospital admissions.\nOur findings on stroke add to existing knowledge: patients with diabetes have about twice the risk of stroke as those without diabetes.24 Rates of stroke have fallen substantially over the last few decades in response to the growing evidence in support of cardioprotective therapies and their adoption in clinical practice.25 Yet, based on our evidence, admissions for stroke remain more common in patients with diabetes.\nCompared with stroke prevention, the prevention of soft tissue and bone infections has received less attention in the research literature, potentially at the expense of increased morbidity and mortality.26 In Canada and the US, decades of improvements in rates of nontraumatic lower-extremity amputations in patients with diabetes have recently reversed, especially among younger adults.27\u201329 A 2017 international meta-analysis comparing the prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers across 33 countries has found Canada (14.8%) to have the second highest rate, after Belgium (16.6%).30 Foot care is one of the most neglected components of standard diabetes care practices, with only 51% of Canadian patients with diabetes having their feet checked as recommended.31 With the exception of recent coverage in Ontario, offloading devices are not currently covered for Canadians with diabetes who have foot ulcers.32 In addition, the prevalence of diabetes is higher in lower-income households,33 providing real-life context to the 57% of Canadians with diabetes who cannot afford their necessary medications, devices and supplies.34\nTo curb such trends in soft tissue and bone infections, proven preventive measures, including regular foot examination, debridement, mechanical offloading devices and chiropody, must not only be available, but also easily accessible for patients with diabetes who often lack economic or social capital. As part of increasing efforts to integrate information technology into medicine,35 the use of telemedicine36 and social media37 in diabetes foot care may help fill in gaps in accessibility and knowledge dissemination. Given the projected increase in the burden of diabetic foot ulcers, including frequent and costly admissions to hospital as shown in our study, increased primary care efforts and public funding should be directed specifically toward proven preventive strategies and modernized approaches.38\nMost of the diabetes-related conditions identified in our study were vascular in nature, except for urinary tract infections, delirium and electrolyte disorders. The increased burden of hospital admission secondary to urinary tract infections in patients with diabetes is consistent with existing knowledge. 39 Diabetes is associated with a higher risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, urinary tract infections and severe complications. Whether patients with diabetes should be treated if they have asymptomatic bacteriuria is unknown and may be an important focus of future research. In addition, ongoing review of the safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, which are gaining prominence in diabetes care, is needed to understand its impact on urinary tract infections among patients with diabetes.40\nAlthough delirium may be caused by any of the identified comorbid conditions, there is limited literature on how diabetes itself can predispose an individual to delirium. Diabetes has been associated with both Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia,41 yet studies on its association with delirium have yielded mixed results and have been conducted primarily in an intensive care setting.42 One plausible hypothesis is that the generation of microvascular malformations in the central nervous system from persistent metabolic derangements leads to endothelial damage and deregulated angiogenesis.43 Given that the prevalence of delirium among our patients with diabetes was 15% greater than among those without, further studies are warranted to understand the mechanism behind this increased prevalence.\nElectrolyte disorders were one of the most frequent and costly reasons for admission in patients with diabetes, yet preventive strategies are lacking. The multifactorial nature of its pathophysiology in diabetes, likely including poor nutrition, impaired gastrointestinal absorption, acid\u2013base abnormalities and pharmacological agents, makes electrolyte abnormalities a challenging condition to prevent.44 Further studies that aim to elucidate the individual pathophysiologic mechanisms of electrolyte disorders in patients with diabetes will be necessary to develop outpatient strategies for monitoring and prevention.\nFinally, heart failure was the most common reason for hospital admission among patients with diabetes, a relation that has been well established.45 New treatment options for this particular demographic have been emerging. For instance, a meta-analysis evaluating cardiovascular outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors found that these medications have shown promising effects of reducing hospital admissions secondary to heart failure by about 30%, regardless of presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heart failure at baseline.46\nLimitations\nThere are several limitations to our study. Our patients with diabetes were restricted to those who were admitted to a general internal medicine service for some portion of their hospital admission and did not include patients admitted to surgical, psychiatric or subspecialty medical services. Thus, the frequency of admissions secondary to diabetes-related complications or severe complications may be underestimated. However, more than one-third of emergency department admissions are to a general internal medicine service; therefore, our data capture the largest group of patients requiring hospital admission and represent a crucial health services group on which to focus.11\nOur cost estimates did not take physician billing and outpatient expenses into account; therefore, the costs of admission may have been underestimated, which may have affected the CR methods we adopted. Using the RIW, we were able to estimate the cost of hospital admission, but not out-of-pocket costs such as mechanical offloading devices. However, RIW has been used previously in similar studies7,47 and provides a reasonable and comparable estimation of the direct health care costs attributable to diabetes.\nThere remains a residual risk of clustering at the hospital, physician and admission levels. We conducted sensitivity analyses using only the first hospital admission, and the results were robust. Our patient population came from only 2 cities in Canada. However, our inclusion of the 5 largest hospitals in Toronto and the only 2 hospitals in Mississauga, Canada\u2019s first and ninth most populous municipalities respectively, adds to the generalizability of our findings. Lastly, the number of comorbid conditions in the comparison of patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes was not adjusted.\nConclusion\nA substantial portion of acute hospital admissions are associated with diabetes. Our study characterizes the frequency and costs associated with acute inpatient hospital admissions to a general internal medicine service from various diabetes-related conditions. Based on our findings, a preventive strategy focused on reducing hospital admissions secondary to soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders in patients with diabetes may be beneficial in this high-risk group.\nSupplementary Material\nFootnotes\nCompeting interests: Amol Verma and Fahad Razak report that they are part-time employees of Health Quality Ontario.

This was followed by urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22; CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19; CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25), and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20; CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34). Interpretation: Soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke, and electrolyte disorders are associated with greater frequency and cost of hospital admissions in patients with diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing these admissions may be beneficial. Diabetes is a significant burden on healthcare systems globally, with nearly 1 in 10 people diagnosed in Canada and the US. Acute inpatient hospital admissions are the primary driver of diabetes-related healthcare costs. This study provides population-level data to guide public policy in strengthening outpatient services for people with diabetes. Methods: The GEMINI study involved 7 large hospital sites in Toronto. Data included patient characteristics, diagnoses, interventions, and discharge destinations. Costs were estimated using CIHI RIW and the Ontario Cost Distribution Methodology. Statistical analysis used Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free CIs for median cost. Results: Among 150,499 admissions, 41,934 (27.8%) were in patients with diabetes. The most frequent reasons for admission were heart failure (7.7%), urinary tract infection (5.1%), stroke (4.8%), pneumonia (4.6%), COPD (4.4%), delirium (3.2%), acute renal failure (2.9%), sepsis (2.8%), soft tissue and bone infections (2.5%), and electrolyte disorders (2.4%). The median costs of admission for these conditions ranged from $4422 to $12,916. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusion: A substantial portion of acute hospital admissions are associated with diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing admissions for soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke, and electrolyte disorders may benefit this high-risk group.",

We sought to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes.\nMethods:\nWe used data from the General Internal Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) study, a retrospective cohort study, of all patients admitted to a general internal medicine service at 7 Toronto hospitals between 2010 and 2015. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Most Responsible Diagnosis code was used to identify the 10 most frequent reasons for admission in patients with diabetes. Cost of hospital admission was estimated using the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight. Comparisons were made between patients with or without diabetes using the Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free confidence intervals (CIs) for median cost.\nResults:\nAmong the 150 499 hospital admissions in our study, 41 934 (27.8%) involved patients with diabetes. Compared with patients without diabetes, hospital admissions because of soft tissue and bone infections were most frequent (2.5% v. 1.9%; prevalence ratio [PR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37) and costly (Can$8794 v. Can$5845; cost ratio [CR] 1.50, 95% CI 1.37\u20131.65) among patients with diabetes. This was followed by urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22; CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19; CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25) and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20; CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34).\nInterpretation:\nSoft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders are associated with a greater frequency and cost of hospital admissions in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing hospital admissions secondary to these disorders may be beneficial in patients with diabetes.\n\nDiabetes inflicts a heavy burden on health care systems globally.1 In Canada and the United States, nearly 1 in 10 people are diagnosed with diabetes,2,3 and this figure has been projected to increase to 1 in 5 people by 2050.4 In 2008, diabetes cost Canada $2.18 billion in the form of hospital admissions, physician care and medications. 5 By 2022, new cases of diabetes have been estimated to cost an additional $15.36 billion.6 In the US, one-quarter of all health care expenditures in 2017 were incurred by people with diabetes.3\nAcute inpatient hospital admissions are the primary driver of health care costs related to diabetes in Canada and the US. In many jurisdictions, including Ontario, more than 50% of attributable costs in incident diabetes are ascribed to acute inpatient hospital admissions.3,7 Research has shown diabetes to portend a higher likelihood of heart failure,8 stroke9 and renal failure.10 However, there is a paucity of data describing the specific medical conditions that drive the increased frequency and cost of hospital admission among people with diabetes. Such population-level data could specifically guide public policy in strengthening support for greater outpatient services among people with diabetes.\nThe objectives of this study were to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes.\nMethods\nStudy design and setting\nThis is a retrospective cohort study using data collected by the General Internal Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) study. A full description of the design and methods of the study has been presented previously.11 The GEMINI study involves 7 large hospital sites affiliated with the University of Toronto: St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Credit Valley Hospital and Mississauga Hospital. The latter 2 hospitals are large community teaching hospitals serving the neighbouring city of Mississauga. The remaining GEMINI hospitals are academic health centres in Toronto (Appendix 1, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1). All GEMINI hospitals are publicly funded, independently operated and provide tertiary or quaternary care.\nStudy population\nWe included all patients admitted to or discharged from the general internal medicine service at each hospital between Apr. 1, 2010, and Mar. 31, 2015. This included patients who required an intensive care unit (ICU) admission at any point during their hospital admission and those who were transferred to surgical services (e.g., for an amputation). There were no exclusion criteria.\nGeneral internal medicine admissions accounted for a substantial proportion of hospital admissions, including 39% of all emergency admissions.11 The most responsible care providers on the general internal medicine wards were predominantly internists. A separate inpatient cardiology ward was ubiquitous among all hospitals, but access to respirology, nephrology, hematology, gastroenterology, oncology and stroke wards varied. There were no separate endocrinology inpatient wards at any centres.\nData sources and collection\nWe collected patient-level characteristics for each admission, including demographic characteristics, diagnoses, interventions and discharge destination as reported by participating hospitals to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database (DAD). Each individual-level record included age, sex, place of residence at time of admission and discharge, most responsible discharge diagnosis, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, laboratory and radiology test results, blood transfusions, medications and intensive care unit admissions (Appendix 2, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1). Unique identifiers were used to link all data, and analyses on a subset of data showed 98%\u2013100% accuracy compared with chart review.12 Patients with diabetes were identified using CIHI Diagnosis Code (Group 10, Field 02) which conveys International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes as recorded in hospital administrative databases.\nFor each admission, we identified the primary discharge diagnosis using ICD-10 codes. Diseases were then classified into clinically relevant categories using Clinical Classifications Software, which organizes individual diagnoses into 285 mutually exclusive categories.11\nTo estimate the cost of each hospital admission comparably across sites and years, we used the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight (RIW) for each admission13 and multiplied this by the annual cost per weighted case for acute inpatient cases that was reported for each hospital using the Ontario Cost Distribution Methodology.14 The RIW is determined by CIHI using information collected in the DAD, which captures administrative, clinical and demographic information on hospital discharges from all acute inpatient separations (i.e., transfer, death, discharge or the patient leaving against advice) in Canada, with the exception of Quebec. Based on individual factors affecting medical complexity, including most responsible discharge diagnosis, age and comorbidities, every inpatient case is assigned an RIW by CIHI. This approach allows for the estimation of a nationally comparable cost for each hospital stay, including costs related to administration, staff, supplies, technology and equipment, but does not include fee-for-service physician billing costs.15 Data from CIHI have been validated previously16,17 and have reliably formed the basis for a substantial body of clinical and health services research.18,19\nAll costs were reported in Canadian dollars.\nStatistical analysis\nThe study population was described using means and standard deviations (SDs) or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), as appropriate for continuous or interval variables, and frequencies for categorical variables. We compared patients with or without diabetes using a Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free confidence intervals (CIs) for median cost.20 For the top 10 most frequent reasons for admission among patients with diabetes, we compared frequency and cost of admission using prevalence ratios (PRs) and cost ratios (CRs). We computed PRs and CRs as the ratio of frequency or cost in patients with diabetes to the frequency or cost in patients without diabetes.21 Given large sample sizes, we determined differences to be meaningful if they were both statistically significant (p < 0.05) and relative differences were greater than 10%.\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses using only the first hospital admission for all included patients and stratifying results by sex. We accounted for inflation by standardizing fiscal year cost of hospital stay to April 2015 using Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health guidance and used the general consumer price index as a deflator.22 All analyses were conducted using R statistical software, version 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\nEthics approval\nResearch ethics board approval was obtained from all participating hospitals (Clinical Trials Ontario Study ID 1394). An exception from informed consent was obtained because this was a large retrospective study with minimal risk of re-identification for any individual patient.\nResults\nThere were 150 499 admissions to general internal medicine wards across all hospital sites during the study period (Table 1). There were 97 316 unique patients. Overall, 41 934 (27.8%) of all hospital admissions occurred in patients with diabetes, and most hospital admissions (94.1%) were among patients with type 2 diabetes. Among all patients admitted to hospital, the median age was 73 years, 50.2% were female and the median number of comorbidities, including diabetes, was 6.\nTable 1:\nCharacteristics of study participants, stratified by diabetes status\nNote: IQR = interquartile range, SD = standard deviation.\nFrequency of admissions\nThe most frequent reasons for admission to general internal medicine (Table 2, Table 3) among patients with diabetes were heart failure (7.7%), urinary tract infection (5.1%), stroke (4.8%), pneumonia (4.6%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4.4%), delirium (3.2%), acute renal failure (2.9%), sepsis (2.8%), soft tissue and bone infections (2.5%) and electrolyte disorders (2.4%). Based on the Clinical Classifications Software group of electrolyte disorders, the most common were hyponatremia (57.2%), dehydration (14.1%), hypernatremia (10.2%), hyperkalemia (6.0%) and hypokalemia (4.0%).\nTable 2:\nPrevalence and cost of admission for most common reasons for hospital admissions, stratified by diabetes status\nNote: COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nTable 3:\nMost common reasons for hospital admission, stratified by increase in prevalence and cost of hospital admission\nNote: COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nThe PRs for these conditions (Figure 1, Table 3) showed that acute renal failure (PR 2.02, 95% CI 1.87\u20132.17), heart failure (PR 1.88, 95% CI 1.80\u20131.96), soft tissue and bone infections (PR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37), sepsis (PR 1.22, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.31), urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22), delirium (PR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.23), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19) and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20) were the more common reasons for hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with those without.\nPrevalence ratios with error bars of most responsible reasons for diagnosis. Note: CI = confidence interval, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, PR = prevalence ratio.\nStratifying by sex did not significantly change our results, with the exception of electrolyte disorders (PR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09\u20131.38 in males but not statistically significant in females) and pneumonia (PR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82\u20130.94 in males; PR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86\u20131.00 in females) (Appendix 3, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1).\nCost of admissions\nThe median costs of admission (Table 2) for each of the most common reasons for admission among patients with diabetes were $12 916 for delirium, $10 722 for sepsis, $8794 for soft tissue and bone infections, $8270 for stroke, $6821 for heart failure, $6301 for acute renal failure, $6278 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, $6183 for pneumonia, $5442 for urinary tract infection and $4422 for electrolyte disorders.\nThe CRs for these conditions (Figure 2, Table 3) showed that admission for soft tissue and bone infections (CR 1.50, 95% CI 1.37\u20131.65), urinary tract infection (CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), electrolyte disorders (CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34) and stroke (CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25) were more costly among patients with diabetes compared with those without. The proportional difference in cost of admission for heart failure, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were statistically significant but were not greater than our threshold of 10%.\nCost ratios with error bars of most responsible reasons for diagnosis. Note: CI = confidence interval, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CR = cost ratio.\nStratifying by sex did not significantly change our results, with the exception of acute renal failure (CR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.26 in females; not statistically significant in males), urinary tract infection (CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.28 in females; not statistically significant in males) and sepsis (CR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15\u20131.35 in males; not statistically significant in females) (Appendix 3).\nSensitivity analyses\nSensitivity analyses that used only the first hospital admission for each patient (n = 96 073) did not significantly change our results. Adjustment for age is included in the CIHI RIW methodology used for cost estimation, and adjustment for inflation did not significantly change our results14 (Appendices 4 and 5, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1).\nInterpretation\nIn our study of patients admitted to the general internal medicine services at 7 Toronto hospitals, nearly one-third had diabetes. Soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders were more frequent and costly among patients with diabetes than among patients without. In addition, hospital admissions for acute renal failure, heart failure, sepsis and delirium occurred at a greater frequency in the diabetes population, but not at an increased cost.\nDiabetes is a highly prevalent and potential driver of illness among patients admitted to hospital. A recent study found hypertension to be the most common comorbid condition among patients admitted to hospital with diabetes as the primary reason for admission.23 However, as we have shown, diabetes itself is rarely a reason for admission; rather, its associated morbidities frequently lead to hospital admissions owing to complications including soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders. This study provides essential information for clinicians and policy makers to understand the broader impact of diabetes on hospital admissions.\nOur findings on stroke add to existing knowledge: patients with diabetes have about twice the risk of stroke as those without diabetes.24 Rates of stroke have fallen substantially over the last few decades in response to the growing evidence in support of cardioprotective therapies and their adoption in clinical practice.25 Yet, based on our evidence, admissions for stroke remain more common in patients with diabetes.\nCompared with stroke prevention, the prevention of soft tissue and bone infections has received less attention in the research literature, potentially at the expense of increased morbidity and mortality.26 In Canada and the US, decades of improvements in rates of nontraumatic lower-extremity amputations in patients with diabetes have recently reversed, especially among younger adults.27\u201329 A 2017 international meta-analysis comparing the prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers across 33 countries has found Canada (14.8%) to have the second highest rate, after Belgium (16.6%).30 Foot care is one of the most neglected components of standard diabetes care practices, with only 51% of Canadian patients with diabetes having their feet checked as recommended.31 With the exception of recent coverage in Ontario, offloading devices are not currently covered for Canadians with diabetes who have foot ulcers.32 In addition, the prevalence of diabetes is higher in lower-income households,33 providing real-life context to the 57% of Canadians with diabetes who cannot afford their necessary medications, devices and supplies.34\nTo curb such trends in soft tissue and bone infections, proven preventive measures, including regular foot examination, debridement, mechanical offloading devices and chiropody, must not only be available, but also easily accessible for patients with diabetes who often lack economic or social capital. As part of increasing efforts to integrate information technology into medicine,35 the use of telemedicine36 and social media37 in diabetes foot care may help fill in gaps in accessibility and knowledge dissemination. Given the projected increase in the burden of diabetic foot ulcers, including frequent and costly admissions to hospital as shown in our study, increased primary care efforts and public funding should be directed specifically toward proven preventive strategies and modernized approaches.38\nMost of the diabetes-related conditions identified in our study were vascular in nature, except for urinary tract infections, delirium and electrolyte disorders. The increased burden of hospital admission secondary to urinary tract infections in patients with diabetes is consistent with existing knowledge. 39 Diabetes is associated with a higher risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, urinary tract infections and severe complications. Whether patients with diabetes should be treated if they have asymptomatic bacteriuria is unknown and may be an important focus of future research. In addition, ongoing review of the safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, which are gaining prominence in diabetes care, is needed to understand its impact on urinary tract infections among patients with diabetes.40\nAlthough delirium may be caused by any of the identified comorbid conditions, there is limited literature on how diabetes itself can predispose an individual to delirium. Diabetes has been associated with both Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia,41 yet studies on its association with delirium have yielded mixed results and have been conducted primarily in an intensive care setting.42 One plausible hypothesis is that the generation of microvascular malformations in the central nervous system from persistent metabolic derangements leads to endothelial damage and deregulated angiogenesis.43 Given that the prevalence of delirium among our patients with diabetes was 15% greater than among those without, further studies are warranted to understand the mechanism behind this increased prevalence.\nElectrolyte disorders were one of the most frequent and costly reasons for admission in patients with diabetes, yet preventive strategies are lacking. The multifactorial nature of its pathophysiology in diabetes, likely including poor nutrition, impaired gastrointestinal absorption, acid\u2013base abnormalities and pharmacological agents, makes electrolyte abnormalities a challenging condition to prevent.44 Further studies that aim to elucidate the individual pathophysiologic mechanisms of electrolyte disorders in patients with diabetes will be necessary to develop outpatient strategies for monitoring and prevention.\nFinally, heart failure was the most common reason for hospital admission among patients with diabetes, a relation that has been well established.45 New treatment options for this particular demographic have been emerging. For instance, a meta-analysis evaluating cardiovascular outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors found that these medications have shown promising effects of reducing hospital admissions secondary to heart failure by about 30%, regardless of presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heart failure at baseline.46\nLimitations\nThere are several limitations to our study. Our patients with diabetes were restricted to those who were admitted to a general internal medicine service for some portion of their hospital admission and did not include patients admitted to surgical, psychiatric or subspecialty medical services. Thus, the frequency of admissions secondary to diabetes-related complications or severe complications may be underestimated. However, more than one-third of emergency department admissions are to a general internal medicine service; therefore, our data capture the largest group of patients requiring hospital admission and represent a crucial health services group on which to focus.11\nOur cost estimates did not take physician billing and outpatient expenses into account; therefore, the costs of admission may have been underestimated, which may have affected the CR methods we adopted. Using the RIW, we were able to estimate the cost of hospital admission, but not out-of-pocket costs such as mechanical offloading devices. However, RIW has been used previously in similar studies7,47 and provides a reasonable and comparable estimation of the direct health care costs attributable to diabetes.\nThere remains a residual risk of clustering at the hospital, physician and admission levels. We conducted sensitivity analyses using only the first hospital admission, and the results were robust. Our patient population came from only 2 cities in Canada. However, our inclusion of the 5 largest hospitals in Toronto and the only 2 hospitals in Mississauga, Canada\u2019s first and ninth most populous municipalities respectively, adds to the generalizability of our findings. Lastly, the number of comorbid conditions in the comparison of patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes was not adjusted.\nConclusion\nA substantial portion of acute hospital admissions are associated with diabetes. Our study characterizes the frequency and costs associated with acute inpatient hospital admissions to a general internal medicine service from various diabetes-related conditions. Based on our findings, a preventive strategy focused on reducing hospital admissions secondary to soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders in patients with diabetes may be beneficial in this high-risk group.\nSupplementary Material\nFootnotes\nCompeting interests: Amol Verma and Fahad Razak report that they are part-time employees of Health Quality Ontario.

    "Summarized_Document": "Background: Acute inpatient hospital admissions account for over half of all healthcare costs related to diabetes. This study aimed to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. Methods: Data from the GEMINI study, involving 7 Toronto hospitals between 2010 and 2015, was used. The CIHI Most Responsible Diagnosis code identified the 10 most frequent reasons for admission in patients with diabetes. Cost was estimated using the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight. Results: Out of 150,499 hospital admissions, 41,934 (27.8%) involved patients with diabetes. Soft tissue and bone infections were the most frequent (2.5% vs. 1.9%; PR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37) and costly (Can$8794 vs. Can$5845; CR 1.50, 95% CI 1.37\u20131.65) among patients with diabetes. This was followed by urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22; CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19; CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25), and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20; CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34). Interpretation: Soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke, and electrolyte disorders are associated with greater frequency and cost of hospital admissions in patients with diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing these admissions may be beneficial. Diabetes is a significant burden on healthcare systems globally, with nearly 1 in 10 people diagnosed in Canada and the US. Acute inpatient hospital admissions are the primary driver of diabetes-related healthcare costs. This study provides population-level data to guide public policy in strengthening outpatient services for people with diabetes. Methods: The GEMINI study involved 7 large hospital sites in Toronto. Data included patient characteristics, diagnoses, interventions, and discharge destinations. Costs were estimated using CIHI RIW and the Ontario Cost Distribution Methodology. Statistical analysis used Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free CIs for median cost. Results: Among 150,499 admissions, 41,934 (27.8%) were in patients with diabetes. The most frequent reasons for admission were heart failure (7.7%), urinary tract infection (5.1%), stroke (4.8%), pneumonia (4.6%), COPD (4.4%), delirium (3.2%), acute renal failure (2.9%), sepsis (2.8%), soft tissue and bone infections (2.5%), and electrolyte disorders (2.4%). The median costs of admission for these conditions ranged from $4422 to $12,916. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusion: A substantial portion of acute hospital admissions are associated with diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing admissions for soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke, and electrolyte disorders may benefit this high-risk group.",

The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.\n1Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.\n\"Our first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations on both the top and bottom line, tracking the trajectory we outlined for this year and setting up a return to growth in the second quarter,\" said Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation. \"Our topline performance improved for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in our digital business led by strength in our same-day fulfillment services. Consumers continue to respond to the newness and value that we offer across our shopping experience, and we're pleased with early results from the relaunch of Target Circle. Looking ahead, our team will deliver for our guests through lower prices, a seasonally relevant assortment, ease and convenience, as we keep investing in our strategy and efficiency initiatives to get back to growth and deliver on our longer-term financial goals.\"\nGuidance\nFor the second quarter, the Company expects a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.95 to $2.35.\nFor the full year, the Company continues to expect a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60.\nOperating Results\nComparable sales declined 3.7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a comparable store sales decline of 4.8 percent partially offset by a comparable digital sales increase of 1.4 percent. Total revenue of $24.5 billion was 3.1 percent lower than last year, reflecting a total sales decline of 3.2 percent and a 3.9 percent increase in other revenue. First quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was 2.4 percent lower than last year, driven by lower sales volume.\nFirst\u00a0quarter operating income margin rate was 5.3 percent in 2024, compared with 5.2 percent in 2023. First quarter gross margin rate was 27.7 percent, compared with 26.3 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of merchandising activities, including cost improvements that more than offset higher promotional markdown rates, combined with favorable category mix and lower book to physical inventory adjustments as compared to the prior year.\u00a0 First quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.1 percent in 2024, compared with 19.8 percent in 2023, reflecting the combined impact of lower sales and higher costs, including continued investments in pay and benefits and marketing, partially offset by disciplined cost management.\nInterest Expense and Taxes\nThe Company's first quarter 2024 net interest expense was $106 million, compared with $147 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in interest income reflecting higher cash balances year-over-year.\nFirst\u00a0quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.7 percent, compared with the prior year rate of 21.1 percent, reflecting lower discrete benefits as compared to the prior year.\nCapital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital\nThe Company paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, compared with $497 million last year, reflecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.\nThe Company did not repurchase any stock in the first quarter.\u00a0 As of the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by Target's Board of Directors in August 2021.\nFor the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2024, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.4 percent, compared with 11.4 percent for the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2023. The increase in ROIC reflects higher operating income, partially offset by higher average invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information about the Company's ROIC calculation.\nWebcast Details\nTarget will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call at 7:00 a.m. CT today.

The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.\n1Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.\n\"Our first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations on both the top and bottom line, tracking the trajectory we outlined for this year and setting up a return to growth in the second quarter,\" said Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation. \"Our topline performance improved for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in our digital business led by strength in our same-day fulfillment services. Consumers continue to respond to the newness and value that we offer across our shopping experience, and we're pleased with early results from the relaunch of Target Circle. Looking ahead, our team will deliver for our guests through lower prices, a seasonally relevant assortment, ease and convenience, as we keep investing in our strategy and efficiency initiatives to get back to growth and deliver on our longer-term financial goals.\"\nGuidance\nFor the second quarter, the Company expects a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.95 to $2.35.\nFor the full year, the Company continues to expect a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60.\nOperating Results\nComparable sales declined 3.7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a comparable store sales decline of 4.8 percent partially offset by a comparable digital sales increase of 1.4 percent. Total revenue of $24.5 billion was 3.1 percent lower than last year, reflecting a total sales decline of 3.2 percent and a 3.9 percent increase in other revenue. First quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was 2.4 percent lower than last year, driven by lower sales volume.\nFirst\u00a0quarter operating income margin rate was 5.3 percent in 2024, compared with 5.2 percent in 2023. First quarter gross margin rate was 27.7 percent, compared with 26.3 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of merchandising activities, including cost improvements that more than offset higher promotional markdown rates, combined with favorable category mix and lower book to physical inventory adjustments as compared to the prior year.\u00a0 First quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.1 percent in 2024, compared with 19.8 percent in 2023, reflecting the combined impact of lower sales and higher costs, including continued investments in pay and benefits and marketing, partially offset by disciplined cost management.\nInterest Expense and Taxes\nThe Company's first quarter 2024 net interest expense was $106 million, compared with $147 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in interest income reflecting higher cash balances year-over-year.\nFirst\u00a0quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.7 percent, compared with the prior year rate of 21.1 percent, reflecting lower discrete benefits as compared to the prior year.\nCapital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital\nThe Company paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, compared with $497 million last year, reflecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.\nThe Company did not repurchase any stock in the first quarter.\u00a0 As of the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by Target's Board of Directors in August 2021.\nFor the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2024, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.4 percent, compared with 11.4 percent for the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2023. The increase in ROIC reflects higher operating income, partially offset by higher average invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information about the Company's ROIC calculation.\nWebcast Details\nTarget will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call at 7:00 a.m. CT today. Investors and the media are invited to listen to the meeting at Corporate.Target.com/Investors (click on \"Q1 2024 Target Corporation Earnings Conference Call\" under \"Events & Presentations\").

The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.\n1Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.\n\"Our first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations on both the top and bottom line, tracking the trajectory we outlined for this year and setting up a return to growth in the second quarter,\" said Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation. \"Our topline performance improved for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in our digital business led by strength in our same-day fulfillment services. Consumers continue to respond to the newness and value that we offer across our shopping experience, and we're pleased with early results from the relaunch of Target Circle. Looking ahead, our team will deliver for our guests through lower prices, a seasonally relevant assortment, ease and convenience, as we keep investing in our strategy and efficiency initiatives to get back to growth and deliver on our longer-term financial goals.\"\nGuidance\nFor the second quarter, the Company expects a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.95 to $2.35.\nFor the full year, the Company continues to expect a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60.\nOperating Results\nComparable sales declined 3.7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a comparable store sales decline of 4.8 percent partially offset by a comparable digital sales increase of 1.4 percent. Total revenue of $24.5 billion was 3.1 percent lower than last year, reflecting a total sales decline of 3.2 percent and a 3.9 percent increase in other revenue. First quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was 2.4 percent lower than last year, driven by lower sales volume.\nFirst\u00a0quarter operating income margin rate was 5.3 percent in 2024, compared with 5.2 percent in 2023. First quarter gross margin rate was 27.7 percent, compared with 26.3 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of merchandising activities, including cost improvements that more than offset higher promotional markdown rates, combined with favorable category mix and lower book to physical inventory adjustments as compared to the prior year.\u00a0 First quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.1 percent in 2024, compared with 19.8 percent in 2023, reflecting the combined impact of lower sales and higher costs, including continued investments in pay and benefits and marketing, partially offset by disciplined cost management.\nInterest Expense and Taxes\nThe Company's first quarter 2024 net interest expense was $106 million, compared with $147 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in interest income reflecting higher cash balances year-over-year.\nFirst\u00a0quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.7 percent, compared with the prior year rate of 21.1 percent, reflecting lower discrete benefits as compared to the prior year.\nCapital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital\nThe Company paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, compared with $497 million last year, reflecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.\nThe Company did not repurchase any stock in the first quarter.\u00a0 As of the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by Target's Board of Directors in August 2021.\nFor the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2024, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.4 percent, compared with 11.4 percent for the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2023. The increase in ROIC reflects higher operating income, partially offset by higher average invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information about the Company's ROIC calculation.\nWebcast Details\nTarget will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call at 7:00 a.m. CT today. Investors and the media are invited to listen to the meeting at Corporate.Target.com/Investors (click on \"Q1 2024 Target Corporation Earnings Conference Call\" under \"Events & Presentations\").

Once inventory dips below the calculated reorder point, replenishment is triggered through a new purchase order.\nRegularly calculating reorder points removes the mystery from inventory cost control and helps your business maintain optimal service levels.\nWhy should your business know your reorder points?\nReorder points help to ensure products and cash flow in the right direction, at the right time. With accurate reorder points for all of your product SKUs, you can meet customer demand in a timely fashion to improve cash flow and avoid the bloated costs of overstock.\nPrimary business benefits of using reorder points include the following:\nCost control\nInventory\u00a0carrying costs\u00a0typically account for 15-30% of total inventory costs. This affects the profit margin on goods sold. By using the most optimal reorder levels, businesses can keep storage and warehousing costs low to protect profits. \nOptimal inventory levels\nBy reordering a predetermined amount of replenishment inventory according to demand forecasts, you can avoid sunk costs from inventory shrinkage and obsolescence.\nSupply chain optimization\n The reorder point calculation takes into account delivery lead time from suppliers. By keeping track of average delivery lead time, you can identify your most reliable and least reliable suppliers and make more informed\u00a0procurement decisions.\nImproved forecasting\nTo accurately calculate reorder points, you\u2019ll need to have strong records on sales volume and trends over a certain time period. As you build this body of data, you can improve forecasting to better meet customer demand.\nNow, let\u2019s see how to find the reorder point.\nHow does the reorder point formula work?\nThe reorder point formula takes into account three factors: average daily sales or usage, average delivery lead time, and safety stock.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nFirst, let\u2019s define all of the components that make up this equation.\nComponents of the reorder equation\nAverage daily sales or usage\n Average daily sales is the average number of units sold or used per day over a defined time period. Three months or 90 days is a good starting increment to use. A retailer would measure the average number of units sold, while a manufacturer would calculate the average number of components used per day. \nLet\u2019s say you sold 40 units of an item in March, 60 in April, and 46 in May.\nOver those three months (or 92 days) that averages out to 1.5 units sold on average per day.\nAverage delivery lead time\n Average delivery lead time is the average amount of time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the time the order was placed. Average delivery lead time changes with fluctuations in seasonal demand, the quantity ordered, and distance from the up-chain supplier. For a reasonable measure, take an average of the past three months of POs for the SKU item you want to set a reorder point for. If your sales cycle is longer or shorter, adjust accordingly. \nSafety stock\nSafety stock\u00a0is the amount of inventory a business holds to mitigate the risk of shortages or stockouts. The safety stock calculation is the difference between the maximum daily sales/usage and lead time, and the average daily usage and lead time. \n(Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time)\n Let\u2019s say a manufacturer used 10 units of a component on their busiest day of production. The longest time it would take the supplier to deliver this component is 15 days. And let\u2019s assume that the average daily use is 1.5 units, and the average lead time is 12 days. \n(10 x 15) \u2013 (1.5 x 12)\n150 \u2013 18 = 132\u00a0\nThe manufacturer should hold 132 safety stock units to avoid bottlenecks in production.\nThe reorder point formula in action\nNow we\u2019ve got all reorder point sub-metrics ready. Let\u2019s continue with the manufacturer example and calculate the reorder point.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nAverage daily usage = 1.5 units\nAverage lead team = 12 days\nSafety stock = 132 units\n(1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150\nTherefore, the manufacturer should reorder this component when stock falls to 150 units. By doing so, the company can prevent stockouts and avoid dipping into safety stock while they wait for new stock to arrive.\nHow to start using the reorder point formula in your business\nIf you have at least one procurement cycle and one sales cycle worth of data, you can start using the reorder point formula to improve your inventory operations.\nBusinesses with a limited number of products can start with excel spreadsheets and format cells to turn red when inventory levels reach the reorder point.\nFor growing\u00a0retailers,\u00a0manufacturers, or\u00a0wholesalers, working with dozens or hundreds of spreadsheets can be time-consuming and error-prone. If your business falls into this category, consider the benefits of\u00a0inventory management software.\n A modern inventory management system can bring greater efficiency to inventory processes through automation and digital tools. For example, real-time inventory tracking allows staff to see what\u2019s in stock, what\u2019s on order, and where each item is located. Software tools can also collect and present data on purchase orders, sales fulfillment, and demand forecasting on a single user dashboard. \n With this information readily available, inventory managers can avoid wasting time manually searching through spreadsheets and crunching numbers. Some inventory management tools also enable businesses to generate customized reports on inventory stock by item, vendor, delivery date, assembly, and more. Rich inventory insights like these empower businesses to fine-tune their reorder points and overall inventory management processes. \nFinal thoughts\nKeep in mind, reorder points are not static. Sales volumes fluctuate, and supply delivery times vary. Demand for certain product lines may grow or fall.\nTo maintain an accurate reorder point, check the underlying metrics \u2014 average daily sales/usage and average lead time \u2014 at least once per quarter. If you have a high season and low season, or seasonal bad weather that slows down deliveries, factor this in.\nAn effective reorder point ensures that your business keeps flowing\u2014 it helps you fulfill orders quickly, protects your margins, and keeps customers happy.\nRecommended for you\nMidsize business\nWhat is the safety stock formula?

    "Summarized_Document": "Holding too much inventory ties up capital and increases carrying costs, while not enough stock can lead to slow order fulfillment and lost revenue. The reorder point (ROP) is a technique in supply chain management to balance these issues by determining the minimum number of units needed in stock to meet sales orders or production targets. When inventory falls below this point, a new purchase order is triggered. Calculating reorder points helps maintain optimal service levels and improve cash flow.The reorder point formula is: Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock. Components of the formula include:- Average daily sales or usage: The average number of units sold or used per day over a defined period, typically three months.- Average delivery lead time: The average time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the order date, which can vary with seasonal demand and other factors.- Safety stock: Extra inventory held to mitigate the risk of shortages, calculated as (Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time).For example, if a manufacturer uses 1.5 units daily on average, with an average lead time of 12 days and a safety stock of 132 units, the reorder point would be (1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150 units. This means the manufacturer should reorder when stock falls to 150 units to avoid stockouts.Businesses can start using the reorder point formula with at least one procurement and sales cycle worth of data. Small businesses might use spreadsheets, while larger operations may benefit from inventory management software for greater efficiency and accuracy. These tools can automate processes, provide real-time tracking, and generate detailed reports to fine-tune inventory management.Reorder points should be reviewed at least quarterly to account for fluctuations in sales volumes and delivery times. An effective reorder point helps fulfill orders quickly, protect margins, and keep customers satisfied.",

    "Summarized_Document": "Holding too much inventory ties up capital and increases carrying costs, while not enough stock can lead to slow order fulfillment and lost revenue. The reorder point (ROP) is a technique in supply chain management to balance these issues by determining the minimum number of units needed in stock to meet sales orders or production targets. When inventory falls below this point, a new purchase order is triggered. Calculating reorder points helps maintain optimal service levels and improve cash flow.The reorder point formula is: Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock. Components of the formula include:- Average daily sales or usage: The average number of units sold or used per day over a defined period, typically three months.- Average delivery lead time: The average time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the order date, which can vary with seasonal demand and other factors.- Safety stock: Extra inventory held to mitigate the risk of shortages, calculated as (Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time).For example, if a manufacturer uses 1.5 units daily on average, with an average lead time of 12 days and a safety stock of 132 units, the reorder point would be (1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150 units. This means the manufacturer should reorder when stock falls to 150 units to avoid stockouts.Businesses can start using the reorder point formula with at least one procurement and sales cycle worth of data. Small businesses might use spreadsheets, while larger operations may benefit from inventory management software for greater efficiency and accuracy. These tools can automate processes, provide real-time tracking, and generate detailed reports to fine-tune inventory management.Reorder points should be reviewed at least quarterly to account for fluctuations in sales volumes and delivery times. An effective reorder point helps fulfill orders quickly, protect margins, and keep customers satisfied.",

Authored by USApple Vice President of Insights and Analytics, Chris Gerlach, the report takes an in-depth look at the trends and forces \u2013 from political headwinds to weather events \u2013 that shape the U.S. apple industry.\n*The Outlook Report is based on recently released United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates. After the presentation of those numbers, USApple members met in-person to discuss current growing conditions to formulate a more up-to-date production estimate. The final USApple 2024/25 crop year forecast is an adjustment of the USDA numbers based on those conversations.\nU.S. Production\nAccording to USApple\u2019s analysis, total U.S. apple production for the 2024/25 crop year (CY) will be 259,517,252 bushels. This represents a 10.1% decrease compared to last year\u2019s final production figure.\n\u201cGrowers from across the U.S. are reporting the crop quality is excellent,\u201d said Gerlach.\nThese figures are more comprehensive than USDA data, which only look at the top seven apple-producing states. USApple analyzes the production from states outside of the top seven and adds that back into USDA\u2019s figure. It also incorporates feedback from growers based on what they\u2019re seeing in the field every day.\n\u201cDespite various challenges, the resilience and dedication of our growers have led to another promising year for apple production,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cThe data we\u2019ve gathered not only highlights the strength of our industry, but also underscores the importance of innovation and adaptability in ensuring a bountiful harvest.\u201d\nVarietal Mix\nAt the varietal level, Gala is expected to retain the top spot with more than 48 million bushels produced, accounting for around 17% of the U.S. apple market. After Gala, rounding out the top five are Red Delicious (12.3%), Granny Smith (10%), Honeycrisp (9.8%) and Fuji (9.4%).\nIn general, the varieties on the rise include Honeycrisp, Pink Lady/Cripps Pink and Cosmic Crisp\u00ae. Fuji, Rome and \u201cother\u201d varieties have remained relatively consistent compared to 2019/20 production volumes. Varieties on the decline include Gala and Red Delicious.\n\u201cWe still see strong Honeycrisp production, but it\u2019s tempered this year,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cWith volumes aligning more closely with Gala and Red Delicious, we may see production levels stabilize rather than increase dramatically in the future.\u201d\nTrade\nAccording to USDA trade data, fresh apple exports totaled 46.4 million bushels in the 2023/24 CY (July to June). This is around 14 million bushels higher than 2022/23 export levels \u2013 an astonishing 44% year-over-year increase.\nDuring the same period, fresh apple imports dropped by around one million bushels, a 15% decline. The joint effects of increasing exports and decreasing imports caused the already net positive fresh apple trade balance to grow to more than 42 million bushels.\nThe surge in fresh apple exports is largely attributed to the abundant domestic supply, competitive pricing abroad, and favorable positive trade policies.\n\u201cThanks to the removal of previously imposed tariffs on our apples, exports to India are up nearly 4,000% year over year. We are optimistic that this critical market will continue to grow in volume and value,\u201d said Gerlach.\nGlobal ProductionAccording to United Nations (UN) data, worldwide apple production surpassed 5 billion bushels for the first time in 2022 (the latest available datapoint). In 2022, China alone was responsible for producing 2.5 billion bushels, around half of the world\u2019s total supply. In 2021, Turkey overtook the U.S. to become the world\u2019s second largest apple producer and maintained that spot in 2022, even widening the gap between us (with 253 million bushels, 5% of world production). The U.S., in the third spot, was credited with 232 million bushels and 4.6% of world production.

    "Document": "2024 Manufacturing Outlook for Sourcing & Supply Chain Resiliency\nKey Takeaways:\nThe Full Article:\nResilience remains a top priority for manufacturers, who continue to increase their operational visibility and transparency and become more agile to proactively address potential supply chain disruptions. To remain competitive in 2024, digital transformation solutions enabling organizations to achieve supply chain resiliency, profitability, and sustainability goals are crucial.\nAccording to KPMG, \u201csmart\u201d supply chain management and sourcing initiatives will make waves powered by advanced technologies such as automation, data analytics, digital twins, and more.\nThis article explores six main priorities that manufacturers are navigating to stay ahead of the competition in 2024:\n1. Increase Supply Chain Speed and Performance with Digitalization\nDigital transformation (DX) can significantly benefit manufacturing sourcing and procurement teams. A growing body of work shows that successful DX initiatives require effective planning and a detailed implementation plan that addresses new technology, employee training, and operational guidelines (workflows) to drive value.\nA 10-year Deloitte study of publicly traded companies worldwide finds that DX tied to an effective strategy and a comprehensive deployment and onboarding process can yield a market capitalization increase of up to 5%. By contrast, DX programs executed without the same level of rigor can cause value erosion.\nHere are two areas of strategic sourcing to consider enhancing:\nI) Streamline Supplier Communications and Revisit Strategic Sourcing Operations\nManufacturers and suppliers want to streamline their sourcing and procurement processes in the current business landscape. A survey conducted by IndustryWeek in collaboration with aPriori found that 70% of respondents want to accelerate the quoting process, and 79% prefer a 24-hour to two-week completion window.\nDigital tools like aPriori provide a centralized solution for real-time supplier collaboration and information exchange. These automated platforms eliminate the need for traditional request for quotation (RFQ) processes that are time-consuming and prone to delays.\nInstead, today\u2019s digital technologies deliver \u201cZero RFQ\u201d or automated procurement capabilities that enable manufacturing companies to:\nII) Accelerate the Product Design and Production Process\nDigital automation-driven solutions help innovators bring together teams spread across different departments. These teams can combine their efforts on a single solution covering design, manufacturing, and sourcing operations.\nWith access to real-time data and visibility into the design and production process, sourcing professionals can get involved early in product development. This helps them identify potential component shortages and recommend design alternatives and changes to an existing bill of materials (BOM). This way, manufacturing companies can avoid supply chain risks and mitigate any negative impacts that may emerge.\naPriori\u2019s real-time co-working application, aP Workspace, expedites task management and provides data audibility for decision-making. Users can access links to the application from their product lifecycle management (PLM) systems to gain actionable insights. These capabilities allow teams to collaborate seamlessly and communicate effectively, achieving their profitability and sustainability goals without reinventing existing business processes.\n2. Build a Solid Foundation for Artificial Intelligence\nManufacturers continue to make digital investments to automate processes, manage data, strengthen internal resources, and facilitate cross-functional collaboration. The result is faster and more informed business decisions for forward-thinking manufacturers.\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most alluring digital tools. S&P\u2019s 2024 Supply Chain Outlook states, \u201cWhile AI cannot prevent supply chain disruptions, if deployed in the correct manner, it could provide predictive probabilities of future disruptions.\u201d\nAI cannot work in a vacuum: It needs robust, accurate data to analyze and address specific manufacturing challenges. But as the MIT Sloan Management Review points out, \u201cManufacturing data is often localized or specific to a particular industry domain or a company\u2019s operations. As a result, there isn\u2019t a lot of relevant data available for building reliable AI models.\u201d\nAdditionally, product design, sourcing, and manufacturing data often reside in individual departments (either in systems that are not integrated or personalized spreadsheets filled with supplier information that is not easily accessible).\nCentralizing and providing access to data across the product development life cycle is central to making data-driven insights (with or without AI). Adding weight, carbon emissions, and other information to a PLM system \u2013 which already stores a bill of materials (BOM) \u2013 makes it easier for product development and sourcing teams to make decisions confidently and anticipate potential issues throughout the development process.\nManufacturers can also use automated analysis solutions like aPriori\u2019s aP Generate, which integrates with the PLM to centralize critical manufacturing information. aP Generate links to aP Design and aP Workspace in the PLM, enabling users to take further steps or ask questions for up-to-date decision-making.\nSome manufacturers are already gaining end-to-end insights using digital twins to connect product design, manufacturing processes, and individual factory capabilities. This data-driven insight is powerful on its own. And it can serve as part of a digital platform that AI can use to make additional analysis quickly.\nPrioritizing data quality is key to unlocking the full potential of AI in the manufacturing industry. With data-driven insights, manufacturers can evaluate alternatives, improve scenario planning operations, transform business models, and enhance supply chain resiliency.\n3. De-Risk Supply Chains and Evaluate Reshoring\nMaintaining a diverse supplier base and reducing overreliance on specific supplier locations mitigates risks associated with geopolitical issues, natural disasters, and other unprecedented events like the 2020 pandemic. Diversified supply chains improve resilience and ensure business continuity in today\u2019s dynamic global environment.\nOne tool that can help manufacturers with this is aPriori\u2019s Regional Data Libraries (RDLs). These digital libraries provide real-world and timely variable material and supplier production costs across 87 global regions. By utilizing this feature, innovators can assess manufacturing alternatives effectively, consider the impact of region-specific tariffs, and avoid an overreliance on specific regions with potential risks. This often leads to significant cost savings and reduced lead times.\nManufacturers can also consider the benefits of reshoring specific manufacturing operations. This can lead to a reduction in shipping costs and taking advantage of valuable tax credits. For instance, automotive manufacturers can use reshoring to redirect the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain to the U.S. This helps eliminate their dependency on semiconductors produced in China and capitalize on a $7,500 tax credit.\nIn its annual Reshoring Index report, the global consulting firm Kearney provides further insight into U.S. reshoring initiatives. Its findings include:\nRead our insights on why reshoring U.S. manufacturing could be right for you.\n4. Offset Labor Shortages via Automation\nAccording to Deloitte\u2019s 2024 Manufacturing Industry Outlook survey, nearly 80% of respondents consider labor market shortages a critical threat. To address this challenge, approximately 50% of manufacturing executives equip their production workforce with advanced digital technologies and flexible schedules. This approach aims to:\nLeading innovators like Woodward leverage aPriori\u2019s automation, simulation capabilities, and actionable insights to counteract the shortage of skilled workers. By employing aPriori, the company can achieve more with fewer resources, such as:\n5. Capitalize on Economic Tailwinds to Accelerate U.S. Manufacturing Growth\nProduct innovators can take advantage of positive economic factors supporting business growth in the upcoming year. These economic trends include:\nI) Federal Investments in Manufacturing Innovation\nThe Biden administration has introduced new measures to strengthen North America\u2019s supply chains and reduce costs. One of the measures implemented is the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act, which aims to reduce America\u2019s reliance on foreign-produced chips.\nThis federal initiative includes $231 billion to build semiconductor factories in the U.S. The program also includes a 25% tax credit for capital investments in semiconductor production to spur innovation and manufacturing in this area.\nAlongside the U.S. CHIPS initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) aims to propel clean energy and sustainable manufacturing domestically. The IRA provides more than $1.7 billion in funding and additional tax credits to incentivize manufacturers. This initiative primarily targets consumers, empowering them to purchase green products like EVs.\nCompanies across multiple industries can take advantage of the incentives offered by federal programs. For instance, the building and construction industry can capitalize on these incentives by developing energy-efficient buildings with sustainable insulation, lighting, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Similarly, federal investments to advance the clean energy sector range from EV production in the automotive industry to zero-emissions battery materials.\n6. Use the Green Supply Chain as a Competitive Advantage\nProduct manufacturers increasingly recognize the growing demand from customers and stakeholders for sustainable, green innovations. Manufacturers can achieve a net-zero future by selecting the appropriate raw materials and production processes to decarbonize their product portfolios.\nAcross the globe, several regulations have been implemented to increase sustainable manufacturing and sourcing operations. These measures include:\nThe financial impact of sustainability requires manufacturers to assign a cost to carbon as they design new products and initiate value engineering on older products. Internal Carbon Pricing (ICP) is an approach that manufacturers and other organizations use internally to assign a cost for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted. This enables manufacturing and sourcing teams to understand the cost of carbon and to compare it to traditional manufacturing costs (e.g., material, labor, and manufacturing overhead costs).\nWith an \u201capples-to-apples\u201d comparison, sourcing teams can easily evaluate carbon and other manufacturing costs. Then, they can select the suppliers that will enable them to reach their key performance indicators for cost, CO2e, and other goals.\nGain the Ability to Navigate Global Supply Chain Uncertainty\nThe ongoing process of digital transformation shapes the 2024 manufacturing outlook. This encompasses trends like Generative AI, automation, and digital twin technologies for supply chain resiliency. Advanced digital solutions like aPriori provide real-time advantages, from accelerating product design to counteracting critical labor market shortages.\nIn addition to investing in digital technologies, economic tailwinds, fueled by initiatives like the CHIPS Act, provide sustainable growth opportunities and promote reshoring.\nAt its core, this post highlights the various obstacles, opportunities, and trends that manufacturing companies can expect to face in the upcoming year.\nGet the State of Procurement Report\nSubscribe to the aPriori Blog!\nListen to Our Most Popular Manufacturing Podcasts of 2023\n13 Must-Read Manufacturing Sourcing & Procurement Posts of 2023\nRead Our 7 Best Product Sustainability and Innovation Posts of 2023\nWhat Is Design to Cost?
