Shares of Nvidia were up 189% year to date as of Friday, easily outpacing any of the company\u2019s chip rivals. AMD (AMD), Nvidia\u2019s closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink nearly 8% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge 51%.\nNvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion.\nNvidia\u2019s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That\u2019s a 100% increase versus the $14.5 billion the company reported in Q3 last year.\nGaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year when the segment brought in $2.8 billion.\nAnalysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%.\nInvestors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, but if it raises its outlook for Q4 as well. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to announce Q4 guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the coming quarter.\nEven if it delivers a stellar report and outlook, shares could still fall following the earnings announcement. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results.\nThat could have been a sign that some investors weren\u2019t impressed with Nvidia\u2019s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains at the time.\nInvestors will also be on the lookout for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company\u2019s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production will pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips.\n (NVDA)\nAt the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he expects that to continue in the year ahead. What\u2019s more, he said the company\u2019s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, is expected to continue selling well into the coming quarter.\nNvidia, however, is also facing an uncertain future, with president-elect Trump threatening to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. He\u2019s also raised the specter of tariffs for chips made in Taiwan as a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US.\nThe vast majority of Nvidia\u2019s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers. Investors are sure to be looking for any guidance Huang has to offer on the topic.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.

It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

      "The essential resource for\u00a0\nthe global Bio/Pharmaceutical\nmanufacturing value chain\nMaking the Innovation Cut: New Drug Approvals Thus Far in 2024\nMaking the Innovation Cut: New Drug Approvals Thus Far in 2024\nHow is product innovation faring in the bio/pharma industry thus far in 2024? Through the end of October, FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has approved 38 new drugs. Which companies \u00a0and products have made the cut, and which may be best poised for market success?\nBy Patricia Van Arnum, Editorial Director, DCAT, pvanarnum@dcat.org\nNew drug approvals thus far in 2024Although not following a strictly chronological path, examining the pace of new drug approvals is an important measure of product innovation in the bio/pharma industry. Through the end of October (as of October 31, 2024), the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) had approved 38 new molecular entities (NMEs) and biological therapeutics, compared to 46 new drugs approved through October 2023.\nLast year (2023) saw an uptick in new drug approvals compared to 2022, which was a recent dip in new drug approvals. In 2023, FDA\u2019s CDER approved 55 NMEs and new biological therapeutics, a 49% increase in the number of new drug approvals compared to 2022, when 37 new drugs were approved. The 55 new drugs approved in 2023 by FDA\u2019s CDER was in line with recent years. In 2021, 50 NMEs and new biological therapeutics were approved and 53 in 2020. The 55 new drugs approved in 2023 represented the second highest level of approvals in the past decade, except for 2018 when 59 new drugs were approved (see Figure 1).\nSmall molecules versus biologicsAnother important trend to look at is the product mix of new drug approvals. Of the 38 new drug approvals thus far in 2024 (as of October 31, 2024), 26, or 68%, were small molecules (24 drugs and two diagnostic/imaging agents), and 12, or 32%, were biologics. That is on par with the mix in 2023, when FDA\u2019s CDER approved 17 new biological therapeutics, which represented 31% of new drug approvals, and 38 small-molecule products or 69% of new drug approvals (see Figure 2).\nThe percentage of small-molecule approvals in 2023 was in line with recent years, except in 2022, which represented a recent low. In 2022, 59% of the new drug approvals by FDA\u2019s CDER were small molecules or 22 of the 37 new drug approved. Between 2018 and 2021, small molecules averaged 74% of new drug approvals. In 2021, small molecules represented 72% of new drug approvals, 75% in 2020,\u00a0 79% in 2019, and 71% in 2018.\nThe decrease in small molecules\u2019 share of new drug approvals in 2022 was largely due to the overall decline in new drug approvals in 2022 and a corresponding decline in small-molecule drug approvals and a rise in new biologic drug approvals. In 2022, FDA\u2019s CDER approved 22 new small-molecule drugs and 15 new biologics. The 17 new biologics approved in 2023 surpassed 2022 levels and matched a recent high in 2018, when 17 new biologics were approved by FDA\u2019s CDER, far exceeding biologic approvals of 14 in 2021, 13 in 2020, and 10 in 2019.\nLarge bio/pharma companies versus mid-tier/small companiesThe quantity of new drug approvals, alone, is not a singular measure of product innovation, but tracking it show some interesting trends, notably the increasing contribution of small bio/pharma companies, particularly in the small-molecule drug space. \u00a0\nOf the 38 new drugs approved thus far in 2024, 13, or 34%, were from large companies (defined as the top 25 bio/pharma companies based on 2023 revenues and one large medical technology company with approval of a diagnostic agent), and 25, or 66%, were from mid-sized or small companies. In looking at product mix, biologics accounted for more than half (54%) of new drug approvals by the large companies, but only 20% from mid-sized-to-small companies.\nThe large bio/pharma companies have had seven new biological therapeutics approved thus far in 2024 and five small-molecule drugs. For purposes of this analysis, new biological therapeutics only include those approved by FDA\u2019s CDER, which reviews and approves new molecular entities and new biological therapeutics. Other biologic-based products, including blood products, vaccines, allergenics, tissues, and cellular and gene therapies, are reviewed and approved by a separate center within FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\nSo which companies made the cut in biologics? The seven biologics approved from the large bio/pharma companies were: Amgen\u2019s Imdelltra (tarlatamab-dlle) for treating extensive-stage small cell lung cancer; Astellas\u2019 Vyloy (zolbetuximab-clzb) for treating gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, a rare type of cancer of the esophagus; Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Ebglyss (lebrikizumab-lbkz) for treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema); Lilly\u2019s Kisunla (donanemab-azbt) for treating early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease;\u00a0 Merck & Co.\u2019s Winrevair (sotatercept-csrk) for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare disease in which blood vessels in the lungs thicken and narrow, causing strain on the heart; \u00a0Pfizer\u2019s Hympavzi (marstacimab-hncq) for preventing or reducing bleeding episodes related to hemophilia A or B; and Roche\u2019s Piasky (crovalimab-akkz) for treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare blood disorder.\nThe five small-molecule drug approvals from the large bio/pharmaceutical companies were: AstraZeneca\u2019s Voydeya (danicopan) for treating extravascular hemolysis with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disease; Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Cobenfy (xanomeline and trospium chloride) for treating schizophrenia; Gilead Sciences\u2019 Livdelzi (seladelpar) for treating primary biliary cholangitis, a chronic autoimmune disease that damages the liver\u2019s bile ducts, causing a buildup of bile and toxins;\u00a0 Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Lazcluze (lazertinib) for treating non-small cell lung cancer; Roche\u2019s Itovebi (inavolisib) for treating locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In addition, GE Healthcare gained FDA approval for Flyrcado (flurpiridaz F 18), a radioactive diagnostic drug to evaluate for myocardial ischemia and infarction.\nMid-tier & small bio/pharma companies: new drug approvalsSmall-molecules by far dominated new approvals from mid-sized to small companies, with many of the drugs indicated for rare diseases. Below is a roundup of small-molecule drug approvals from mid-sized and small companies thus far this year (as of October 31, 2024):\nOn the biologics side, small-to-mid-sized bio/pharma companies have had five biologics approved thus far in 2024. These are: BeiGene\u2019s Tevimbra (tislelizumab-jsgr) for treating unresectable or metastatic esophageal cancer; Galderma\u2019s Nemluvio\u00a0(nemolizumab-ilto) for treating prurigo nodularis, a chronic skin disorder with itchy nodules; Hugel-Aesthetics\u2019 Letybo (letibotulinumtoxinA-wlbg) for temporarily improving the appearance of moderate-to-severe glabellar lines (i.e., so-called \u201cfrown lines\u201d); ImmunityBio\u2019s Anktiva (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept-pmln) for treating bladder cancer; and Incyte\u2019s Niktimvo (axatilimab-csfr) for treating chronic graft-versus-host disease.\n\n\nBio/Pharma\u2019s Rising Stars: The Companies Emerging on the Industry\u2019s Radar\nA Shortage of Inspectors Curtailing FDA Inspections: The Impact on Pharma\nA Look Ahead: Bio/Pharma\u2019s Top Policy Issues in US Elections Aftermath\nA Strong Contract ADC Market Drives Expansions in High-Potency Manufacturing\nOne Washington Blvd., Suite 6\nRobbinsville, NJ 08691, USA\n+1-609-208-1888\nToll Free: +1-800-640-DCAT (3288)\n\u00a9 2024 DCAT | Privacy Policy\nDCAT Value Chain Insights is produced by the Drug, Chemical &\nAssociated Technologies Association, a not-for-profit business\ndevelopment association for companies engaged in the global bio/pharmaceutical manufacturing value chain.

Why has the society not made faster progress on cancer front? Why do discoveries in biotechnology sector occur in fits and spurts? We claim that this slow and sporadic progress has a lot to do with the vagaries of capital markets. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s begin with a success story. There is little doubt that BioNTech (Pfizer), Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines had a profound impact on the developed world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Without them, countless more lives and trillions of dollars of economic value would have been further lost. The stock prices of these companies reached dramatic peaks after the world learned about their success. However, as of this week, they have already shed 50% of their peak market values, while we are still in the midst of the pandemic. This rapid rise and fall of these biotechnology stocks is not just about the Covid-vaccine stocks but also about the fortunes of the biotechnology sector as a whole. We describe this roller-coaster phenomenon in this post and claim that this phenomenon is not healthy for the society, particularly given the aging population and increasing need for new healthcare solutions.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\nContrary to popular beliefs, most of the new drugs or vaccines are not discovered by big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer or Merck. The development chain of a new life-science product can be divided into several phases: synthesis (discovery of a molecule or formulation), initial research (preclinical tests in lab and trials on animals), and development (human trials). The initial steps are typically taken by individual scientists, biotechnology start-ups, and research labs of universities. Those early-stage discoveries, their patents, or the discovering companies themselves, are then bought by the big pharmaceutical companies. The later steps in the development chain require numerous approvals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is numerous long and costly processes, that can only be done by big pharma. The next steps after FDA approval can also be undertaken only by big pharma: creation of brands through massive advertising campaigns, putting and scaling up manufacturing capabilities, and distribution of drugs using extensive vendor network. Small companies can try, but the likelihood of success is low given their lack of experience and capabilities in these areas. For example, Novavax is yet to be launched in the US, despite a claim that is it a better vaccine than the currently available ones.\nConsider two of Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest drugs from before Covid period: Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Palbociclib (Ibrance). They were discovered by Northwestern University and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blockbuster product, infliximab (Remicade), was synthesized at New York University in collaboration with a small biotechnology company Centocor. More recently, BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s synthesized the Covid Vaccine. It then entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to \u00e2\u0080\u009cleverage Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broad expertise in vaccine research and development, regulatory capabilities, and global manufacturing and distribution network.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biohaven, a small biotech company, relied on Pfizer for the commercialization of its migraine drug Rimegepant.\nIt must be clear from the above discussion that small biotech firms or research labs play the foundational role in innovation of drugs and vaccines. That innovation must benefit the society, evident from the progress in healthcare, physical well being, and increasing longevity of human beings over the last century. Yet, synthesis and discovery are not straightforward activities. Behind each successful product lie millions of research hours and thousands of synthesized products that never see the light of the day. Out of thousands of synthesized molecules, only few reach what is called Phase 1 success, and just 10% of those receive FDA approval. Even after FDA approval, only a few products are launched in the market, because a launching firm must reassess market potential before spending additional billions of dollars in creating manufacturing, branding, and distribution network. So, only a few start-ups, even among those that successfully synthesized products, are finally rewarded by big pharma. Why would a small company, or a group of scientists and doctors, devote their precious time, give up their careers, and spend their meager resources to develop something that has less than a lottery like chance to succeed? The answer is lottery like payoffs.\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider a few examples. From market value of just $5 billion at the end of 2018, Moderna reached a valuation of $181 billion dollars in Sept 2021.\u00c2\u00a0 BioNTech, which got listed in October 2019, reached a peak value of $108 billion in Aug 2021. This phenomenon is not just about Covid vaccines. Axsome Therapeutics, which traded for just $2 per share by the end of 2018, reached $108 dollars by the end of 2019. More important, big pharma pays large premiums to acquire listed companies and unlisted start-ups. For example, in 2017, Gilead acquired a small biotech Kite Pharma, for $11.9 billion, and in 2020, Bayer acquired Asklepios, a gene-therapy startup, for a total cost of $4 billion. Acquisition by Big Pharma is typically the endgame for most biotech start-ups.\nBut the efforts and cost spent on drug development, after adjusting for inflation, keep doubling every nine years. This phenomenon is described in Eroom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law. (For curious people, Eroom is opposite of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law, which describes the decreasing costs of discovering new products in electronics.) Given the rising costs, only rising lottery payoffs can keep up the incentives for small biotechnology start-ups to bet it all on their ventures. Indeed, announcement of each new multibillion dollar acquisition lifts both valuations and innovation efforts across the industry.\nHowever, the purpose of this post is not to describe that small, biotechnology firms have lottery like payoffs, but to emphasize that any drop in lottery type payoffs could have an opposite impact on the society. The valuations of biotechnology companies have recently declined rather rapidly. Moderna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $64 billion and BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $38 billion, both more than 50% off their recent peaks. And it is not just about a few, isolated stocks. Diversified funds, that invest in hundreds of biotechnology stocks, are also off their recent peaks. For example, XBI, an S&P Exchange Traded Fund investing in biotechnology companies, is down 50% of its peak in less than twelve months. Neither the tech-heavy Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 index have declined by that much over the past one year, on the contrary, both have increased.\nWhy should one worry about sudden decline in valuations of biotechnology firms, or the vagaries in their fortunes? Well, they have a real impact on the society because an elaborate system of multi-stage and risky financing drives new drug discovery. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider this chain of thought. Now big pharma would pay a lower price for successful innovation, and a successful biotech firm now has a lower chance of doing the initial public offering or being acquired at an astounding price. Lowering of lottery like payoffs, in conjunction with the rising costs of discoveries, means that venture capitalists would pull out investments from risky biotech projects and doctors and researchers will spend less hours in synthesizing new drugs. Importantly, some promising research would not progress further, and their discoveries would be prematurely lost. Thus, the roller coaster in the fortunes of biotechnology sector now means lower chance of developing new drugs and vaccines, as well as loss of promising research effort. This is not just like putting off another steel plant, which can increase the steel prices, and increase the costs of automobiles. Not discovering a drug or a vaccine means prolonged illness, pain, or even more deaths. It may sound macabre, but fluctuating stock market fortunes of biotech firms would impact the health and wellbeing of citizens, something that personally touches us all, even if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invest in stock markets.\nIn sum, the rapid rise and fall of biotechnology sector adversely impact society. How to solve this problem? One proposed solution by MIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Andrew Lo, is to pool the risks of multiple cancer projects and fund it using a superfund. We strongly endorse this idea. However, it is unclear how a superfund can better allocate seed capital to individual small projects than can capital markets or venture funds which are known for their speed and efficiency. Another idea is that such important research should not be left to private ventures but should instead be done by government sponsored and not-for-profit research institutions. Indeed, health-sector research is the largest avenue for government R&D funding, sponsored through National Institute of Health. Recall that government research funding was instrumental in development of Covid vaccines. Furthermore, the benefits from public R&D spill over to many more public and private projects that do benefit from private R&D. This point is enforced by President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent announcement on cancer research.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe key takeaway from this post is that there is a need for a new model to fund grassroot research in biotechnology sector. On one hand, the current model, based on venture funding, unleashes entrepreneurial energies and efforts, and attracts the best talent to biotechnology sector. On the other hand, the vagaries of biotechnology stocks in capital markets lead to fits and starts in biotechnology discoveries and cause frequent loss of promising research. Society must find a happy balance between the two forces and find a new way to address this problem, a problem that cannot be simply left to free markets.\n\n   Volume 66, Issue 4\n   Summer 2024\n   \nTo Be or Not to Be: Will Virtual Worlds and the Metaverse Gain Lasting Traction?\nThe Metaverse Flywheel: Creating Value across Physical and Virtual Worlds\nThe Diffusion of the Metaverse: How YouTube Influencers Shape Mass Adoption\nMetaverse Management as Urban Planning: Lessons from Paradise (Nevada)\nGreen Innovation Games\nCalifornia Management Review\nBerkeley-Haas's Premier Management Journal\nPublished at Berkeley Haas for more than sixty years, California Management Review seeks to share knowledge that challenges convention and shows a better way of doing business.\nHaas School of Business\n                University of California, Berkeley\nCalifornia Management Review\n                F465 Berkeley Haas School of Business\n\t\t\t\t2220 Piedmont Ave. Berkeley, CA 94720-1900\n\t\t\t\t(510) 725-7826 |\n\t\t\t\tcmr@haas.berkeley.edu\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2024 UC Regents | UC Berkeley | Privacy Policy\n",

Results from Phase I, II and III clinical studies, and FDA or European approvals (and rejections), can send stocks soaring.\nEveryone is familiar with these monster moves. Recent examples include Amarin Corp's (AMRN) 3X move in one day, or Zosano Pharma Corporations' (ZSAN) 100% rip on recent study results. Now, a new entrant in the large neurological market, NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC), could be on the eve of their first FDA approval, and few investors are paying attention to this small company because it's so new and quiet about what they're doing.\nNevertheless, NMTC is 10% owned by the Mayo Clinic and has a stable of veteran physicians and researchers on their board and advisory board. With the possibility of two FDA clearances in 2019 for their first planned medical devices, the company could have a breakout year if they execute and move from unknown to mainstream.\nNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2019 / Small healthcare stocks are known for making heroic moves, often when their development-phase drugs or devices move closer to going commercial. Completion of Phase I, II, and III trials can all send stocks rallying, as can approvals from European and U.S. regulators.\nCase in point, Zosano Pharma's (ZSAN) recent monster 100% move recently when they announced success in a Trial of their drug for migraines. Amarin Corp (AMRN) saw their stock price triple after their drug Vascepa succeeded in a large Phase III study.\nThe largest moves tend to happen when most investors aren't paying much attention, and that could be the setup for a newer neuro company that recently made their way to the public markets. NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC) is a small developer of electrode technology that just quietly submitted their first product to the U.S. FDA for a possible clearance early in 2019. NeuroOne's technologies - sometimes known as ''neurostimulation'' devices - have been tested at the Mayo Clinic, which is also a 10% owner of the company's public stock. Now that the company is headed towards their first possible FDA clearance, and with a second possible clearance for another device right on its heels, NMTC is a healthcare company to be aware of before it gets discovered.\nNeuroOne Operates In An $8B And Growing Device Market\nThe emerging field of neurostimulation refers to technologies that electrically stimulate or monitor the nervous system to treat and diagnose disorders. Though humans have learned much about the nervous system in the last twenty years, it remains a mysterious organ and technology has only recently begun to unlock some new treatment options. These devices are now helping in a variety of difficult neurological disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, Dystonia, Epilepsy and even in the treatment of pain and some nerve damage.\nIt's an exciting time as this industry takes off. In 2019 the research firm Global Markets Insights expect this to be a $8.196 billion industry across the globe, and $6.5 billion in North America and Europe alone.\nOne of the earliest successes for neurostimulation devices was in Epilepsy and Parkinson's using Deep Brain Stimulation, or DBS and ablation. After identifying brain tissue that may be causing Epileptic seizures or movement problems as in severe Parkinson's, neurologists can selectively modulate or destroy this tissue with a DBS or ablation device, reducing or sometimes eliminating symptoms of the disorder. In fact, ablation can cure about 50% of Epileptic patients.\nThe hangup for many Parkinson's, Dystonia, or Epilepsy patients who are eligible for DBS or ablation is the traumatic surgical requirements, not only for treatment but also to diagnose and pinpoint the affecting brain tissue. It can take weeks in the hospital, sometimes with wires protruding from a patient's skull!\nHere's where NeuroOne hopes to make its mark on the industry. The company's initial devices are high-fidelity electrodes designed to enhance and possibly shorten this diagnostic/treatment process. These thin-film electrodes, used in a procedure called an EEG (electroencephalogram), may provide more accurate detection of irregular brain activity over currently available technology. In limited clinical testing so far, doctors at the Mayo Clinic have been able to document pre-seizure activity (called micro-seizures) during clinical research with their patients using NeuroOne's technology. The electrodes are being developed as strips and depth electrodes, and they've already demonstrated an improvement in inflammatory response compared to existing products when used on some brain tissue. With better diagnostic process, NeuroOne hopes that their products can shorten the diagnostic time and improve safey for Epileptics and patients suffering from movement disorders.\nCombined, this first technology addresses a demand for improved diagnostic options among neurologists, and NeuroOne is now racing to market with their first medical devices for approval.\nNMTC Quietly Made Their First FDA Clearance Application\nNeuroOne has been mostly quiet on the investor front, but in a recent SEC filing they revealed that they filed their first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) application on January 28, 2019. The application covers their cortical and strip electrodes for temporary (less than 30 day) use with recording, monitoring, and acute stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring and stimulation of electrical signals on the surface of the brain.\nIn the case of this 510(k) process, which is used when the device holds a low risk to the patient, the FDA will aim to complete its review within 90 days of receiving the notification.\nThis is the biggest gating event for NeuroOne since the company went public, and it could take them from a development stage company to commercial and their first revenue. An FDA clearance could launch the into the mainstream of healthcare companies, and investors will undoubtedly take notice of this tiny company.\nThe company also plans to file a FDA 510(k) marketing clearance for their first depth electrode during the second quarter. Following that, they're working on a unique diagnostic/ablation device that could further shorten and simplify the treatment time for patients.\nNMTC could have two value-driving events in the next 5-6 months, and the markets are barely paying attention.\nStrong Advisory Board Backs NeuroOne, And Mayo Owns 10% Of The Company\nThe breadth of expertise involved in NeuroOne is impressive. The company has strong advisors and executives, and their technology has been tested over the years by both the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the Mayo Clinic, the latter of which is also a 10% holder of NMTC's public stock.\nSince going public, NeuroOne has been building a team of experienced medical tech and neurology advisory members: Mayo Clinic's Greg Worrell MD, PhD and Gregory J. Esper, MD, MBA of Emory University both sit on the company's scientific advisory board. More recently, Dr. Kip Ludwig, former Program Director for Neural Engineering at the NIH, became chair of the company's new \"artificial intelligence\" advisory board, which will focus on deploying NeuroOne's electrode technology in artificial intelligence and bioelectronics applications. Dr. Cristin Welle of the Univ. of Colorado joined, a founder of the Neural Interfaces Program at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of Science and Engineering Labs; plus Dr. Doug Weber, a Program Manager in the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) at DARPA.\nEvaluating AI opens up some unique possible opportunities as more researchers have considered the potential for electrode/brain interfaces. The possibility for some kind of translational work in this space is intriguing.\n2019 Should Be A Big Year For NMTC Shareholders\nNeuroOne has been operating in stealth mode for the last year, but 2019 could be when investors start to pay attention. The company will likely have 2 FDA clearances in the next 6 months if the FDA signs off on their cortical and depth electrode 510(k) filings. As this stock has been mostly flat since going public, these events may be the first time that investors stand up and take notice. Additionally, NMTC plans to apply for a listing on the Nasdaq, another catalyst that could create significant value for shareholders if NMTC can qualify. With CEO Dave Rosa's successful track record building venture stage healthcare companies, multiple value creating catalysts on the horizon, and an awesome technology with blue sky potential, investors long NMTC could be handsomely rewarded for a patient long position in this relatively unknown healthcare company.\nAbout One Equity Stocks\nOne Equity Stocks is a provider of paid-for research on publicly traded emerging growth companies.

      "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 (Week 16) using Drought Monitor Data Gregg Ibendahl April 19, 2024 Week 16 prediction1 Kansas wheat estimate for 4/19/24 Using Drought Monitor Data Yield range from 39.1 to 46.2 Predicted yield of 42.6 Abstract This paper uses data from the U.S. drought monitor website (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu2) to predict yields on a crop reporting district (CRD) level for Kansas. These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F. A. 2017.\nDrought Severity and Cover- age Index.\nUnited States Drought Monitor.\ndroughtmoni-tor.unl.edu/About/AbouttheData/ DSCI.aspx 4Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available. In other words, the drought index only shows moisture deficit levels and not excess moisture levels.\nWhile this report currently indicates a below average wheat year, the wide confidence intervals indicate these predictions could improve with timely rains. It is still early spring after all. The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5",
      "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 (4/14/24) Gregg Ibendahl April 16, 2024 Week #15 prediction Kansas wheat estimate for 4/14/24 Yield range from 41.5 to 45.9 Predicted yield of 43.7 Introduction1 The USDA collects weekly crop conditions throughout the growing season. The crop is rated as either: very poor, poor, fair, good, or excellent. For wheat, these estimates are reported for a few weeks in late fall and then the estimates start again in the spring. As shown by Ibendahl in previous reports on AgManager.com, these crop reports can be used to build a model to predict final crop yields. In this publication, Ibendahl estimates Kansas wheat yields based on the week #15 (April 14, 2004) crop condition report from NASS.\nAs of week 15 in Kansas, for the winter wheat crop, 6% was rated very poor, 13% was poor, 38% was fair, 38% was good, and 5% was excellent. While it is still very early in the wheat season, this paper explains the model process and projects a possible yield. This paper is the first estimate of wheat yields for 2024 in Kansas.\nBackground The USDA has historical state wheat yields going back to 1866. Figure 1 plots these as a line graph.\nWhat is interesting about this graph is that wheat yields were flat until 1950. Since then, yields have been steadily increasing. As shown in Figure 1, a regression of the last 30 years (the blue line) shows a 0.22 bushel increase in yield each year. The lowest yield in any year since 1970 has been 25% higher than the highest year before 1950. Figure 1 also shows the state average wheat yield has a large amount of variability. Yields were only 28 bushels per acre in 2014 while in 2016, yields were 57 bushels per acre.\n1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu 1 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Estimate of Crop Condition The weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report issued by the USDA National Agricultural Statis-tics Service, includes temperature, precipitation, and progress of crop planting, development and harvesting. This report is issued weekly, except during winter months when it is entered monthly.\nWhile this report gives the current crop condition, it doesn\u2019t make any projections about wheat yields. Predicting yields for wheat can be di\ufb00icult as the crop often does better than it looks in the field and can quickly improve with timely rains.\nThere has been some research that has attempted to match the crop condition report back to yields. Bain and Fortenbery (Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO.\n[http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134]) presented a paper that used an index of the crop con-dition report to estimate crop yields. Their procedure, described below, is used in this paper to show the relationship between crop conditions and wheat yields.\nProcedure Bain and Fortenbery construct an index of weekly crop conditions: CCIndex = (% acreage Excellent) * 1 +\uffff (% acreage Good) * 0.75 +\uffff (% acreage Fair) * 0.50 +\uffff (% acreage Poor) * 0.25 +\uffff (% acreage Very poor) * 0 The index ranges from [0, 100]. An index value of 100 corresponds to 100 percent of the surveyed crop being reported in excellent condition, and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop is in very poor condition. A value of 50 indicates the average crop condition for the state is in fair condition.\nWeekly crop condition reports are available from NASS and go back to 1988. The start of the weakly wheat report in Kansas varies but for all the years since 1988, there is a weekly crop report available by either the last week of March or the first week in April. There is also a series of crop reports in the fall before a break occurs. The last 20 years of the wheat crop condition for week #14 in Kansas is shown in Figure 2.\nIn this analysis, the April 14, 2024 crop condition reports (week #15) are used to construct a CCI index for the last 30 years. These CCI indexes are then used in a regression analysis to estimate the wheat yield per acre where the yield is a function of the CCI index. To account for the yield trend, the actual model is an estimation of the deviation from the yield trend as a function of the CCI index. Figure 3 plots the deviation from the state average wheat yield tend line on the left axis and the CCI index on the bottom axis. The dark gray band represents the standard error.\nThe standard error of the regression is the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line.\n@ibendahl 2 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Results As might be expected for a wheat crop condition report the second week of April, the model doesn\u2019t predict very well. Based on week #15 scores, the model predicts wheat yields with an R-squared of 0.38. The estimated yield equation is Yield = 0.381 * CCI_score - 21.2 That is, an improvement of 1% in the CCI score can increase the average state yield by nearly 0.4 bushels per acres. However, the low R-squared value is the result of large variations in the final wheat yield for a given CCI score. In other words, the CCI index is far from a perfect indicator of final wheat yields in the state, especially with the winter report on crop conditions. The large variability can easily be seen in Figure 3. A model that was able to predict yield perfectly would have all the individual points aligning along the blue regression line. Thus the model presented here should be looked at as more of an initial impression of wheat yields in the state.\nAs of week #15 for 2024, the trend line yield is 43.7 bu/ac. The CCI score of 55.8 has the model predicting a yield 0.03 bu/ac above trend. Thus the estimated yield for 7/14/24 is 43.7 bu/ac with a range from 41.5 to 45.9 bu/ac. Figure 4 shows the history of yield estimates since 4/7/24. This latest estimate is half a bushel lower from last week.\nImplications Producers should look at these results as only a guide. In Kansas, moisture is key and timely rainfall or the lack of rainfall will make a big difference in yields. Ibendahl plans to regularly this model. The reliability of the model will improve as harvest gets closer.\n@ibendahl 3 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 10 20 30 40 50 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025 Year Yield (bu/ac) Historical Kansas Wheat Yields Figure 1: Historical State Wheat Yields from Kansas @ibendahl 4 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 19% 60% 31% 16% 15% 10% 46% 16% 12% 28% 30% 33% 7% 42% 5% 19% 20% 27% 23% 4% 30% 43% 14% 33% 55% 50% 59% 12% 51% 49% 28% 26% 30% 69% 25% 71% 37% 45% 36% 38% 76% 38% 38% 26% 36% 29% 35% 31% 42% 33% 39% 44% 44% 37% 24% 33% 24% 44% 35% 37% 39% 20% 32% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Condition Very poor Poor Fair Good Excellent Condition of Kansas Wheat as of WEEK #15 4/14/24 Figure 2: Historical Crop Conditions for Wheat in Kansas for Specific Week @ibendahl 5 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 \u221210 0 10 30 40 50 60 70 CCI Score Deviation from Trend \u2212 Bu/Ac WEEK #15 Yield Prediction Based on CCI Score Figure 3: Expected Yield (Trend Deviation) for Various CCI Index Values for Specific Week @ibendahl 6 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Apr 07 Apr 09 Apr 11 Apr 13 Apr 15 Date of prediction Bu/ac Estimate Expected High Low Expected Wheat Yield for Kansas by Date of Estimation Figure 4: Weekly Model Predictions Since 4/7/24 @ibendahl 7",

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means\u00a0a significant increase in accumulated heat.\nThat extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals\u2014expanding some and shrinking others.\u00a0 As the map below shows, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions.\nTrends in global average surface temperature between 1993 and 2022 in degrees Fahrenheit per decade. Most of the planet is warming (yellow, orange, red). Only a few locations, most of them in Southern Hemisphere oceans, cooled over this time period. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from NOAA Centers for Environmental Information.\nAbout surface temperature\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100\u00b0F (55\u00b0C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget\u2014how much sunlight\u00a0Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat\u2014over time.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute\u00a0temperature readings\u00a0to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple\u00a0independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate\u00a0the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nGlobal temperature in 2022\nAccording to the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2022 ranked among the ten warmest for that month, despite the cooling influence from the La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The \"coolest\" month was November, which was 1.35 \u02daF (0.75 \u02daC) warmer than average.\n(map) Global average surface temperature in 2022 compared to the 1991-2020 average, with places that were warmer than average colored red, and places that were cooler than average colored blue. (graph) The bars on the graph show global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average each year from 2022 (right) back to 1976 (left)\u2013the last year the world was cooler than average. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to NCEI,\nThe year 2022 was the sixth warmest year since global records began in 1880 at 0.86\u00b0C (1.55\u00b0F) above the 20th century average of 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F). This value is 0.13\u00b0C (0.23\u00b0F) less than the record set in 2016 and it is only 0.02\u00b0C (0.04\u00b0F) higher than the last year's (2021) value, which now ranks as the seventh highest. The 10 warmest years in the 143-year record have all occurred since 2010, with the last nine years (2014\u20132022) ranking as the nine warmest years on record.\nFor more regional details and 2022 climate statistics, see the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nPast and future change in global temperature\nThough warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA's\u00a02021 Annual Climate Report the combined\u00a0land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of\u00a00.14 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.08 degrees\u00a0Celsius)\u00a0per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 has been more than twice as fast: 0.32 \u00b0F (0.18 \u00b0C) per decade.\nThe amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activities\u2014burning fossil fuels and clearing forests\u2014add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon (equivalent to a little over 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide increases each year.\n(left) Hypothetical pathways of carbon emissions (\"representative concentration pathways,\" or RCPs) throughout the twenty-first century based on different possible energy policies and economic growth patterns. (right)\u00a0 Projected temperature increase relative to the 1901-1960 average depending on which RCP we eventually follow. Image by Katharine Hayhoe, from the 2017 Climate Science Special Report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program.\nAccording to the 2017 U.S. Climate Science Special Report, if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and possibly as much as 10.2 degrees warmer. If annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050,\u00a0 models project temperatures would still be at least 2.4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20th century, and possibly up to 5.9 degrees warmer.\nReferences\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (2023).

      "\nMain Menu\nBreadcrumb\nU.S. climate outlook for September 2024\nAfter a very hot early and middle part of summer, August provided a welcome relief across much of the nation, with much-above-normal temperatures largely confined to the Deep South. The summer as a whole did average much warmer than average across the western and eastern parts of the nation, with only the central part of the nation having an average summer.\nSummer precipitation was generally below normal across most of the country, with only those areas that were hit by tropical systems (Beryl in the middle of the nation during July, Debby in the East during August) seeing above-average rainfall for the summer. Those summer precipitation deficits contributed to a large increase in drought, with the amount of the country experiencing drought more than doubling between early June and late August.\nAs we head into fall, will temperatures remain moderate, or will summer (in the form of hot weather) make a return? Will drought continue to expand across the nation or will beneficial rains start to reduce drought? Here\u2019s the outlook from NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) for September.\nThe U.S. temperature outlook for September 2024, showing where the monthly temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red) for September or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average September.\u00a0Much warmer\u00a0or\u00a0much cooler than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of average September temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nOn August 31, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for September 2024. The temperature outlook in general favors well above average temperatures across most of the western and central parts of the nation, along the Gulf Coast and in New England. Below-average temperatures are favored in the Mid-Atlantic, with no tilt in odds toward any category for locations in between. The precipitation outlook favors well above average precipitation along the Pacific Northwest Coast and in a region extending from the Southern Plains, through the Southeast, to the southern mid-Atlantic. Well below average precipitation is favored across much of the North, from the Northern Rockies eastward to parts of the Northeast and also in the central Rockies and the Southwest.\nThe precipitation outlook for September 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens) or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average September.\u00a0Much higher\u00a0or\u00a0much lower than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total September precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nIn addition to providing more specifics about the outlooks and their basis, I\u2019ll discuss the current state of drought, changes in drought observed during August, and the drought outlook for September. Finally, here\u2019s my monthly reminder that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the most likely outcome, but that other outcomes are always possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found here.\nThe updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC\u2019s own Week 2 and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. With the expected arrival of La Ni\u00f1a somewhat delayed, it did not play a role in the September outlooks. Recent boundary conditions such as coastal sea surface temperatures (which can impact temperatures along the coast) and observed soil moisture (extremes in soil moisture (both wet and dry) can influence temperatures and precipitation during the warm part of the year) were also considered for these outlooks.\nTemperature outlook favors more heat in the West, uncertainty in much of the East\nThe September temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across much of the western half of the nation, along the Gulf Coast into Florida, and in parts of the Northeast. (Well above average means \u201cin the warmest third of all Septembers in the recent climate record.\u201d) Well below normal temperatures are slightly favored for parts of the Mid-Atlantic region with equal chance odds found (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average) in the remainder of the eastern half of the country and along the Pacific coastal regions.\nThe best odds for a warmer-than-normal September are in southern Florida and out West in a region extending from the Northern Plains southward to the desert Southwest, with probabilities exceeding 60%. Temperatures are forecast to be above average in the western region in all CPC outlooks (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4), as well as in Florida, where well above normal sea surface temperatures surround the peninsula. Above-average temperatures are favored early in the month along the West Coast, but troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) is predicted during the latter half of the month, which injects enough uncertainty into the monthly average that the forecast is \u201cequal chances\u201d along the coast.\nIt\u2019s a much different story in the eastern half of the nation, as September looks to begin with below-average temperatures during the first half of the month. Longer range outlooks (Weeks 3-4) do favor above-average temperatures, so \u201cequal chances\u201d is the outlook for much of this region. The exception is the mid-Atlantic, where the cooler temperatures early in the month are likely to outweigh the warmer temperatures later in the month.\nPrecipitation outlook tilts wet in across the South, mainly dry across the North\nThe precipitation outlook for September once again has a fairly large amount of the country with a non-\u201cequal chances\u201d forecast. Above-average rainfall is favored across much of the South, from West Texas eastward across the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic and also in the coastal Pacific Northwest. The tilt in the odds is largest in Texas, where heavy rainfall is anticipated during the first week of the month and in Florida where above-average rainfall is favored during most of the month. Finally, although the month is predicted to start dry in the Northwest, forecasts for Week-2 and Weeks 3-4 favor above-average rainfall with the approaching trough.\nBelow-average precipitation is slightly favored from parts of the Southwest northward across the Central Rockies into Montana, consistent with a dry start to the month and longer-range guidance favoring either below normal or equal chances. Throughout the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes, confidence for below-average September precipitation is higher, as below-normal rainfall is favored during all time periods.\nU. S. Drought area increases further during August\nThe amount of drought increased during August across the continuous United States, from about 20% to almost 28%, with another 35% of the nation in the DO category (abnormally dry) as we begin September. The percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing extreme and exceptional drought) also increased during the month to almost 2.5%, although that is still fairly low by historical standards.\nThe summer of 2024 has been relatively hot and dry across much of the contiguous United States, and the area that is either abnormally dry (yellow) or in some level of drought (moderate, light orange; severe, orange; extreme, bright red; exceptional, dark red) expanded considerably between June 4 (left) and August 27 (right). Areas of exceptional drought appeared in Montana, Texas, West Virginia, and Ohio. Moderate to severe drought was in place in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and the Deep South. NOAA Climate.gov map from our\u00a0Data Snapshots Collection,\u00a0based on data from the U.S. Drought Monitor project.\u00a0\nRegionally, much of the nation saw drought degradation, particularly from the Southern Plains into the Deep South. Much of this region recorded 2-3 class changes. Mainly 1 class degradation was observed over parts of the West, central and northern Great Plains (up to 2 class changes) and in parts of Ohio and West Virginia, where despite modest changes (1-2 classes), exceptional drought (D4) developed for the first time in the 25-year Drought Monitor history. In contrast, significant drought improvement (often drought removal) was observed in parts of the East, mainly along the path of Debby, where upwards of 10 inches of rain eliminated drought in most of South Carolina and lesser amounts of rainfall improved drought conditions by 1-2 classes farther north.\nDrought outlook mainly predicts persistence and development, but improvement across parts of the South\nU.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in September 2024. Across Texas and the Deep South, drought is likely to end (green) or at least improve (tan). But significant parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Rockies, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and northern West Virginia and the Ohio River valley are likely to see drought develop (yellow) or persist or worsen (dark brown).

See\u00a0CPC version\u00a0for Alaska and Hawaii.\nWith above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation favored during September over much of the western half of the nation, drought persistence with some new development is most likely. The exception is in parts of eastern New Mexico and Texas, where improvement or removal is likely, consistent with the expectation of above-normal rainfall, particularly during the beginning of the month. The eastern half of the nation is more of a mixed bag, with improvement and removal likely in regions where above-normal rainfall is favored across much of the South and persistence and some development (over parts of the Midwest) where the odds favor either below-average rainfall or there is no tilt in the odds towards any category.\nTo read the entire discussion of the monthly climate outlooks from the Climate Prediction Center, check out their\u00a0website.\nWe value your feedback\nHelp us improve our content\nRelated Content\nNEWS & FEATURES\nMAPS & DATA\nTEACHING CLIMATE\nCLIMATE RESILIENCE TOOLKIT\nStay Connected\n",

Corn is no exception and to ensure a future supply we must begin to understand how climate impacts both the phenological development of corn and the productivity. Temperature and precipitation are the two climate factors that will have a major benefit on corn phenology and productivity. The warming climate will accelerate the phenological development because the number of thermal units required for leaf appearance is relatively constant in the vegetative stage. Productivity of corn is reduced when extreme temperature events occur during pollination and is further exaggerated when there are water deficits at pollination. During the grain-filling period, warm temperatures above the upper threshold cause a reduction in yield. Model estimates suggest that for every 1\u00b0C increase in temperature there is nearly a 10% yield reduction. To meet world demand, new adaptation practices are needed to provide water to the growing crop and avoid extreme temperature events during the growing season. Climate change will continue to affect corn production and understanding these effects will help determine where future production areas exist and innovative adaptation practices to benefit yield stability could be utilized.\nKeywords\nAuthor Information\n*Address all correspondence to: jerry.hatfield@ars.usda.gov\n1. Introduction\nCorn (Zea mays L.) is grown throughout the world and as such is subject to a wide variety of climates and potential scenarios of climate change. Production area continues to increase in response to the increased demand for corn grain and the production per unit area (yield) has continued to increase due to enhanced technology (Figure 1). What is imperative to stability and increases in future production is understanding how climate change will impact this trend in corn production and the areas of the world where corn is produced. Corn is a grain crop with both food and feed uses and variation in production at the local scale can have major impact on local economies and local food supplies as well as world food security.\nWorld corn yield and area harvested since 1960 (data obtained from FAO stat, http://www.fao.org/faostat/en, downloaded March 8, 2018).\nWorld corn yield and area harvested since 1960 (data obtained from FAO stat, http://www.fao.org/faostat/en, downloaded March 8, 2018).\nThe trend line for corn yield has shown a steady increase and a small amount of variation among the years; however, at the local scale is where the impacts of seasonal weather and trends in climate become more noticeable. Across the United States, there have been large deviations from the trend line in years in which weather events have caused yield reductions (Figure 2). Throughout this chapter, we will focus on the impacts of climate on corn phenology and production to provide an understanding of the potential for adaptation strategies. In this chapter we will focus on three components critical to corn production: the changing climate, impact of climate on corn phenology and phenological models, and impact of climate on corn productivity.\nDeviations from the yield trend line for corn production in the United States from 1950 to 2017.

Projections of climate change\nProjections of climate change are a result of a combined set of simulation models using various scenarios of changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and the associated forcing functions [1]. The current CO2 concentrations are at nearly 400\u00a0ppm in 2018 and are projected to increase to a range of 794\u20131142\u00a0ppm by 2100 without any abatement scenarios [1]. The result of these efforts can be summarized as [1, 2]:Global mean temperatures will continue to increase throughout the twenty-first century if CO2 concentrations continue to increase and under the highest emission scenario would range from 2.6 to 4.8\u00b0C.These temperatures changes will not be uniform across regions with increases over land surfaces being larger than over the oceans.As the global temperatures increase there will be more hot extremes and fewer cold extremes at both daily and seasonal time scales.Precipitation will increase with increases in global mean surface temperature and could increase 1 to 3% \u00b0C\u22121; however, there will be substantial spatial variation in these changes.The water holding capacity of air increases by 7% \u00b0C\u22121. The air can take up more water, and water vapor inclines. That leads to higher intensity of precipitation, i.e. higher amount of rainfall per rain event.Annual surface evaporation will increase as the temperatures increases; however, over land, evaporation will be linked to precipitation.\nGlobal mean temperatures will continue to increase throughout the twenty-first century if CO2 concentrations continue to increase and under the highest emission scenario would range from 2.6 to 4.8\u00b0C.\nThese temperatures changes will not be uniform across regions with increases over land surfaces being larger than over the oceans.\nAs the global temperatures increase there will be more hot extremes and fewer cold extremes at both daily and seasonal time scales.\nPrecipitation will increase with increases in global mean surface temperature and could increase 1 to 3% \u00b0C\u22121; however, there will be substantial spatial variation in these changes.\nThe water holding capacity of air increases by 7% \u00b0C\u22121.

A general summary of climate impacts on crops was prepared by Hatfield et al. [3] and reveal for corn that temperature and precipitation are the two critical factors. Since corn is a C4 plant, the response to increasing CO2 will be minimal. Leakey et al. [4] found that leaf photosynthetic response was 3% to a doubling of CO2 concentrations while total biomass and grain yield increased by 4%. They did observe that leaf stomatal conductance was decreased by 34% under these same experiments. These differences in physiological activity due to increased CO2 are small compared to C3 species and will not the most evident response to the changing climate. Therefore, in this chapter we will focus on temperature and precipitation impacts on corn.\n3. Phenology of corn\nThe phenology of corn has been described as the appearance of leaves or leaf collars during the vegetative stage and accumulation of material in the grain during the reproductive stage. The developmental stages of corn has been recently described by Abendroth et al. [5] and similar guidelines are used to quantify the phenological stage of corn during the growth cycle. What is important for assessing the effect of climate on corn is to explore what role climate variables have on corn phenology. The most critical variable in phenological development is temperature and each plant has a specific range of temperatures for growth as defined as the upper and lower limit (threshold) and an optimum [3]. For corn during the vegetative stage this has been identified as 8 to 38\u00b0C with an optimum of 34\u00b0C [6, 7] while the range for the reproductive stage is 8\u201330\u00b0C [8]. Typically, the lower temperature limit in growth models has assumed to be 10\u00b0C. Survival of pollen are sensitive to temperature, e.g., temperatures exceeding 35\u00b0C have been proven detrimental to pollen viability [9, 10]. There is a strong interaction of temperature with vapor pressure deficit and the viability in the time of movement from the tassel to the silk has been shown to decrease with decreasing moisture content [11]. These results would suggest that as the temperature increases and vapor pressure deficit increases that disruption of the pollination process could become more likely especially with the potential for more extreme temperature events. Quantifying the impact of episodes of temperature extremes on pollen viability and the disruption of reproductive processes will become more important with the projection that extreme temperature events will increase under climate change (Tebabldi et al. [12]). These temperature ranges and the potential for extreme events will become important for corn growth and production because of the projection that temperatures will increase in the future.\nThe relationship of corn phenology to temperature has been described through the use of growing degree days with a growing degree day (GDD) calculated as (Tmax\u00a0+\u00a0Tmin)/2 \u2013 Tbase, where Tmax is the maximum daily temperature, Tmin is the daily minimum temperature and Tbase is the temperature at which growth stops. Kumudini et al. [13] evaluated eight different thermal models for the estimation of corn phenological development. These thermal models were classified into empirical linear typical of the GDD model first shown by Gilmore and Rogers [14] with the most robust model having a Tbase of 10\u00b0C and an optimum of 30\u00b0C. Another class of thermal models is the empirical nonlinear model described by Brown and Bootsma [15] where the following relationships were used to estimate crop heat units (CHU): if Tmin\u00a0<\u00a04.4\u00b0C then Tmin\u00a0=\u00a04.4\u00b0C to derive CHUmin\u00a0=\u00a01.8(Tmin \u2013 4.4\u00b0C); if Tmax\u00a0<\u00a010\u00b0C then Tmax\u00a0=\u00a010\u00b0C; to derive CHUmax\u00a0=\u00a03.33(Tmax \u2013 10\u00b0C) \u2013 0.084(Tmax \u2013 10\u00b0C)2 and CHU\u00a0= (CHUmax\u00a0+\u00a0CHUmin)/2. Stewart et al. [16] used a non-linear empirical model and separated the vegetative and reproductive stages of growth with different functions. The third class of thermal models can be classified as the process-based models similar to the thermal functions used in Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) as described by Wilson et al. [17] which are based on estimates of air temperature at 3 hour intervals throughout the day and given as: if T\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b0C then T\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0C and if T\u00a0>\u00a044\u00b0C then T\u00a0=\u00a044\u00b0C and calculated for different temperature ranges as 0\u00b0C\u00a0=\u00a0< T\u00a0<\u00a010\u00b0C: IR\u00a0=\u00a0T(10/18\u00b0C); 18\u00b0C\u00a0=\u00a0< T\u00a0<\u00a034\u00b0C: IR\u00a0=\u00a0T \u2013 8\u00b0C; and 34\u00b0C\u00a0=\u00a0< T\u00a0<\u00a044\u00b0C: IR\u00a0=\u00a026\u00b0C \u2013 (T \u2013 34\u00b0C)2.6 and thermal units are given as \u2211(IR/8), where IR\u00a0=\u00a0instantaneous rates or measurements. In comparing these different approaches, Kumudini et al. [13] found that the precision in terms of goodness of fit was calendar days < empirical linear < process-based < empirical non-linear.\nAn application of the GDD approach was developed by Neild and Richman [18] where they combined thermal units with precipitation in an agroclimatic index to determine where different corn hybrids could be grown around the world. Currently, this type of model has been replaced with simulation models similar to APSIM [19] to determine climate impacts on corn growth and production. If the thermal units per leaf appearance rate is constant for the vegetative stage of growth then as the temperature increases there will be a more rapid accumulation of leaves in the crop. This effect as observed by Hatfield [20] and Hatfield and Prueger [21] for corn grown under climatic normal (1980\u20132010) for Ames, Iowa and normal +4\u00b0C temperatures throughout the complete growing season for three different corn hybrids. There was no difference in the total number of leaf collars and cumulative leaf area between temperature regimes; however, there was a large difference in yield with the higher temperatures greatly reducing grain yield (Figure 4). Analysis revealed there was no difference in the GDD\u2019s for leaf collar appearance between the two temperature regimes suggesting that as temperatures increase there will be a more rapid rate of advancement in the phenological development with no effect on the size of the corn plant at the end of the vegetative stage. There was a large difference in grain yield between temperature regimes with a faster rate of maturity with a subsequent reduction in grain production.\nDifferences in total leaf collars, cumulative leaf area, and grain yield of three corn hybrids grown under normal Ames, Iowa temperatures and normal +4\u00b0C temperatures.

Effects of increased temperatures have shown a large degree of variation with projections of reduced production by less than 5% with temperature increases of 1\u00b0C [3] to over 50% with 4\u00b0C increases [22]. Productivity of corn is affected by temperatures exceeding 35\u00b0 C during pollination due to dehydration of the pollen [3]. Controlled environment studies have confirmed the effect of high temperatures on corn with temperatures greater than or equal to 3\u00b0C above normal temperatures showing maize yield reductions of over 50% in grain yield [20, 21]. They observed an increased rate of phenology with increased temperatures; however, the largest effect on productivity was attributed to the increase in minimum temperatures during the grain-filling period. Field studies on corn have shown under field conditions yield reductions from 13 to 88% due to increased temperature 6\u00b0C above normal temperatures [23]. The negative effects of high temperatures during the grain-filling period were attributed to pollen survivability and the efficiency of the grain-filling process. Increasing temperatures likely to be experienced under climate change demonstrate several negative effects plant growth and phenology. Lizaso et al. [24] recorded a reduction of corn yield under field and controlled conditions owing to reduced pollen viability as impacted by increased temperatures. A critical knowledge gap under future climate scenarios will be to evaluate the interaction of high temperature and increased humidity on pollen survivability and the efficiency of the pollination process. Lobell and Field [25] found maize yields decreased 8.3% per 1\u00b0C rise without any additional effect due to water stress which was confirmed by Mishra and Cherkauer [26] for Midwest corn grain yields. Challinor et al. [27] compiled a meta-analysis of over 1700 published simulations for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), and corn. They found that without implementing adaptation strategies there would be a loss in yield in both temperate and tropical regions with only 2\u00b0C of warming. They also found that adaptation practices could increase simulated yields by 7\u201315% with this same temperature increase; however, the practices were more effective in wheat and rice than for corn. There was consensus among the simulation models that yield decreases were be greater in the second half of the century with the greater declines in the tropical areas compared to the temperate regions. They estimated that corn yields would decrease by nearly 15% in temperate regions with a 4\u00b0C increase and no adaptation but showed no decrease with adaptation practices [27].\nTemperature and precipitation interact to affect corn productivity. Short-term water deficits and drought reduce growth and grain yield and are often the largest cause of crop losses. In the United States, drought was related to 41% of crop losses, while excess water was attributed to 16% of the yield loss [28]. Drought stress during the early and middle reproductive stages affected grain yields and these phenological stages were found to be the most sensitive to water stress [29]. Increases in spring precipitation can cause yield reductions due to aeration stress caused by flooded soils; however, drought stress remained the primary factor linked with reduced grain production [29]. In rainfed environments where corn is primarily grown, temperature and precipitation changes under climate change will negatively impact grain production and these interactions need to be more fully understood. In an analysis of wheat production in Europe, Semenov et al. [30], stated that understanding of the effects of higher temperatures and drought stresses during the booting and flowering periods would potentially lead to adaptation practices with the potential to reduce losses in grain numbers and grain weight. With both short-term water stress and drought as major factors affecting grain yield, improved water availability through more extensive root system and changes in root architecture would benefit yield stability [31]. The excess soil moisture in the root zone will require improved soil structure to facilitate gas exchange between the root system and the atmosphere [32]. The impact of precipitation is a combination of the precipitation amount and the soil water holding capacity. This was illustrated in an analysis by Egli and Hatfield [33] where they found average county level corn yields were a function of the soils ability to supply water.\nEvaluation of corn yield response to climate is complex because of the interactions of the impacts of temperature and precipitation. To provide a more robust framework for evaluating yield response the utilization of the yield gap as the difference between potential yield and actual yield has been utilized ([34]; van Bussel et al. [35]). This concept has been discussed and utilized for several decades but recently has been extended to create a yield gap atlas for the world. The yield gap approach allows for a quantitative assessment of the ability of the crop to achieve its potential yield and the inability of closing the yield gap can often be ascribed to climatic stress. Potential yield has been defined as \u201cthe yield of a cultivar when grown in environments to which it is adapted; with nutrients and water not limiting; and with pests, diseases, weeds, and other stresses effectively controlled\u201d [36]. Potential yield (YP) is an expression of the ability of a crop canopy to convert solar radiation into dry matter with no stress during the growth cycle and radiation use efficiency can be used as a measure of this efficiency [37]. The goal of agronomic science is the evaluate practices and increasing the farmer yield (YF) may prove to be more fruitful than increasing potential yield (YP) ([38]; Lobell et al. [39]. Utilizing the yield gap approach provides a framework for evaluating the factors which affect crop yields and the phenological stage which these factors are having the most significant impact during the growing season. These studies are not simple analyses, because of the interactions of multiple factors affecting yield, and Sinclair and Ruffy [40] argue that nitrogen and water limit crop yield more than plant genetics and should be considered as the primary factors limiting yield. Understanding the yield gap requires being able to quantify both potential and actual yield and comparison among studies is often limited by the lack of consistent data and to advance our understanding of yield gaps will require standardized method for yield comparisons [41]. Fischer et al. [41] introduced attainable yield (YA) as a metric between YF and YP defined as the yield achieved by a producer under near optimum weather and management inputs. Hatfield et al. [42] utilized this approach on county level corn yields in the Midwest United States and defined the attainable yield as the years with the highest yield in the long-term record as illustrated in Figure 5. The values for attainable yield are derived by statistically fitting a line through the frontier of the yield observations and then computing the yield gap as the difference between the attainable and actual observed yield for each year. In this analysis, data from 1950 through the present are used because this represents the period of time with corn hybrids and enhanced production technology. This approach has been used for different crops and regions of the world to obtain yield gaps.\nYield gap analysis for Story County, Iowa, USA using attainable yields derived from annual production values. (data obtained from the National Agricultural Statistics Service, www.nass.usda.gov, accessed March 8, 2018).\nYield gap analysis for Story County, Iowa, USA using attainable yields derived from annual production values. (data obtained from the National Agricultural Statistics Service, www.nass.usda.gov, accessed March 8, 2018).\nHatfield et al. [42] utilized the yield gap approach for the Midwestern US to quantify the effects of climate variability on corn production and found three dominant climatic factors related to the yield gap. These were July maximum temperatures, August minimum temperatures, and July\u2013August total precipitation. Yield gaps increased when July maximum temperatures exceeded 32\u00b0C, August minimum temperatures exceeded 20\u00b0C, and July\u2013August precipitation totals decreased below 150\u00a0mm. The physiological reasons for these variables are related to the disruption of pollination (July temperatures), increased rate of senescence and reduced efficiency of grain-fill (August minimum temperatures), and water deficits during a period of the year with high crop water requirements (July\u2013August precipitation). These relationships were observed for each county in the Midwest and utilized to project the impact of future climate change on the yield gap on corn production. They found that with the trends in temperature for the summer in the Midwest US that yield gaps would exceed 50% by the year 2075 in the southern portion of the Corn Belt. There were some counties in the Midwest in which excess moisture in the spring was related to the yield gap but these relationships were not robust enough for use in projections of future climates. The yield gap framework provides a robust method for assessing the impact of climate on yield variation over time and when combined with efforts similar to those used by Challinor et al. [27] could be used to quantify the impact of adaptation practices.\n5. Agroclimatic indices to define corn production regions\nCorn is produced around the world and within these areas there may be shifts in production areas due to the changing climate. Green et al. [43] have quantified the changes in the US Corn Belt and provided a geographic analysis to depict these shifts in distribution. Development and utilization of agroclimatic indices has value in being able to assess these shifts because they are related to temperature and precipitation. Neild and Richman [18] were among the first to use the GDD concept to define potential differences among corn hybrids. Development of tools to define where crops can be produced is critical to understand crop distribution and productivity [44]. Estimation of crop distribution within arable areas is necessary to determine whether a species can thrive in an agroclimatic zone and will become more critical with the projected increases in temperature. Zomer et al. [45] extended this concept to demonstrate how climate zones could be used to evaluate technologies that would enhance the ability of management practices to offset the impacts of climate change on crop production. There have continued to be advances in the development of agroclimatic indices to evaluate the suitability of a location for a particular crop since Neild and Richman [18]. Siddons et al. [46] cautioned that development of robust agroclimatic indices requires observations collected over long time periods and extensive observations from experimental locations. There has been an evolution in agroclimatic indices to include more factors affecting plant growth and development to derive values that characterize the environment and the potential for crop production. Typical factors are: average daily minimum temperatures below 0\u00b0C; daily mean temperature to estimate crop development rates; average daily maximum temperature above 35\u00b0C to estimate exposure to heat stress, especially during pollination; average daily soil water availability (precipitation\u2013reference evapotranspiration (ET)); and length of specific phenological periods to estimate the effects of changing phenological development on biomass accumulation and crop yield [47]. They found a positive relationship between productivity and their suitability index [47]. This approach is a refinement of the effort by Neild and Richman [18] and incorporated more factors to more link crop physiological responses with phenological development.\nAgroclimatic zones are a combination of factors affecting plant growth to evaluate the potential for grain or forage crop production (e.g., [18, 44, 48?51]). The form of the index depends upon the assumption of the factors limiting growth. Soil water availability is often the determining factor in crop production in all ecosystems and the application has ranged from determination of irrigation water requirements or potential impacts on production caused by water deficits. Daccache et al. [49] incorporated soil water variability to evaluate the need for irrigation for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production in England and Wales. Their index was based on the potential soil moisture deficit (PSMD) index defined as:\nwhere PSMDi is the value in month i and PSMDi\u22121 is the value for the previous month, ETi is the reference ET for the current month calculated with the Penman-Monteith equation formulated by Allen et al. [52], and Pi the precipitation in the current month. They found increased variation in precipitation decreased potato production in an area currently suited for production, unless supplemental water was provide through irrigation. This type of analyses could be utilized to determine the need for supplemental irrigation to ensure crop production.\nAnother form of this type of framework was developed by Moeletsi and Walker [51] to quantify climate risk for corn production in South Africa. They based their index, Poone AgroClimatic Suitability Index (PACSI), on three climatic parameters; onset of rains, frost risk, and drought risk utilized a weighed distribution of climate parameters as\nwhere O is the probability planting conditions are met, FF is the probability of a frost-free growing period, and the water requirements satisfaction index (WRSI). These indices require sufficient data over a long period of record to develop the probability of the different indices to develop reliable probability assessments [46]. An aspect of this index is the assessment of drought risk which is a complex interaction by soil water holding capacity and any change in the soil affecting water availability (Eq. 2).\nPrecipitation effects on crop productivity are defined by the occurrence of the water deficits in the soil profile which fail to meet the evaporative demand. Agroclimatic indices for arid and semiarid regions are often based on precipitation amounts adequate to exceed the ET rate at the time of planting in order to ensure crop establishment [18, 47, 48, 49, 51]. Moeletsi and Walker [51] evaluated soil water dynamics based on the WRSI to determine the potential to meet crop water requirements at any phenological stage as\nwhere WRi is the water requirements for a decadal period during growing season, PETi is the potential ET during this decadal period, and kci the crop coefficient for this corresponding phenological period. For any decadal period during the growing season, the soil water balance can be used to estimate plant available water (WAi) as\nand Preci is the precipitation in a given decadal period and SWi-1 is the profile soil water content for the previous decadal period. Soil water holding capacity (WHC) becomes a critical component of this method because available SW is a function of WHC. They computed the WRSI as\nwith WDi the water deficit for decadal period i, defined as\nOr\nIn this process soil water in the profile is quantified as\nUsing this methodology, Moeletsi and Walker [51] were able to evaluate the suitability for maize production for various planting dates with a correlation of 0.8 between the PACSI and grain yields.\nPrecipitation is changing in intensity and frequency, and directly affect WAi (Eq. 3). Precipitation patterns are projected to increase in annual totals, with decreasing summer precipitation amounts over the US [1, 53]. If we link these precipitation patterns with the PACSI (Eq. 2), then corn production could become more variable among years because of soil water availability.\nUtilization of agroclimatic indices as a tool for the assessment of climate impacts on corn production areas will provide a quantitative view of shifts in production areas but potential risks to production within areas where corn is currently produced. The continued development of these tools will benefit corn production because we can evaluate the potential role of management and genetic resources on increasing yield stability over time.\n6. Simulation models to quantify climate effects\nSimulation models have been extensively used to estimate the impact of a changing climate on productivity. In 2014, Challinor et al. [27] summarized 1700 published reports using simulation models and the number of papers has increased rapidly since that time. Simulation models provide the capability of assessing the potential impacts of the change in temperature and precipitation under a given CO2 regime and often models using the different emission scenarios to determine the expected temperature and precipitation parameters which are then placed into crop simulation models [54, 55]. It has been found that an ensemble of crop models provides a more rigorous approach to estimating crop responses to climate. This is being conducted under the Agricultural Model Implementation and Improvement Project (AgMIP) framework as described by Rosenzweig et al. [56]. Bassu et al. [57] used this framework to compare 23 different corn models and found temperature decreased yield by approximately \u22120.5\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121\u00b0C\u22121 while doubling the CO2 from 360 to 720\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0mol\u22121 increased yield by 7.5% across all models and sites. They concluded that temperature increases would be the dominant factor affecting corn yields. Zhao et al. [58] summarized a number of published results and found for each 1\u00b0C increase, corn yields decreased by 7.4%. Jin et al. [59] used the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model to evaluate the effect of different CO2 scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for corn production in the US and found drought will be the largest factor affecting production. However, they stated that combined impacts of temperature and water stress need to be evaluated in breeding programs and adaptation strategies [59]. Earlier, Jin et al. [60] evaluated the algorithms in 16 different corn models and concluded that heat and drought stress was best simulated when models used event-based heat and water stress descriptions, accounted for nighttime temperature stresses, and evaluated the interactions of multiple stresses. Crop models allow for an assessment of the role of genetics and management on productivity for a range of present and future environmental conditions. Hatfield and Walthall [31] utilized this concept as the G x E x M (genetics \u00d7 environment \u00d7 management) framework to determine how these interactions would need to be understood to provide food security for the future population growth.\nThere have been efforts to combine observations with crop simulation models to evaluate changes in yield and yield stability. Leng [61] found yield variability across the US Corn Belt has decreased from 1980 to 2010 with climatic variability the major factor affected variability among years and regions. He found that statistical models explained more of the yield variation than crop simulation models. Bhattarai et al. [62] used the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model with the combined results for eight general circulation models to show that under low and medium carbon scenarios, corn yields during the period 2080\u20132099 increased compared to the 2015\u20132034 period, while under the high carbon scenario yields during these same periods decreased. Lychuk et al. [63]) also used EPIC for the southeastern United States and found in the near-term corn yields increased, but from 2066 to 2070 yields decreased 5\u201313% because of the increased temperature stress. Huang et al. [64] combined field experiments with crop simulation models to evaluate the potential effect of different growing season length corn hybrids and found the longer growing season hybrid did not yield as high as the medium length hybrid. These results suggest that efforts be placed in evaluating the efficiency of plant growth relative to the changes in temperature and the accumulation of growing degree days.\nThe Global Agro-ecological zones model (GAEZ) categorizes areas suitable for crop production by climate, soil, terrain, management, and the specific growth limitations of crops, among others [65, 66]. One essential concept of GAEZ climate module is the temperature growing period (LGPt), where air temperature is used as a proxy to estimate days of the growing period with optimal, sub-optimal, and no suitable crop production conditions for a specific crop. The growing period L is defined as the number of days with average daily temperature\u00a0>\u00a05\u00b0C (i.e., LGPt5). The corn-specific LGPt\u2019s are summarized in Table 1. For example, assume a temperate corn cultivar for grain production with a total growing period between 90 and 180\u00a0days. During this period average daily air temperature shall not decrease below 5\u00b0C, and the number of days with daily average air temperature between 10 and 15\u00b0C shall be below \u215f5 of the total growing period to reach optimum growing conditions. In addition to air temperature, the length of the growing period is further limited by the moisture regime, defined as actual ET\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.5 * reference ET.\nTable 1.\nCorn growing period L (LGPt5), optimum, and sub-optimum conditions of tropical lowland, tropical highland, and subtropical and temperature cultivars for grain production, as well as subtropical and temperate cultivars for silage production.\nAdapted and simplified from [66]\nThe GAEZ model also estimates potential yield of a specific crop in a specific agro-ecological zone, and applies constraint factors, such as heat or water stress, to calculate actual yield and yield gap. For example, periods of potential water stress occur when actual ET is below the total water requirement of a crop, maximum ET, and the difference between both cannot be compensated by precipitation, plant available water, or irrigation. Maximum ET is calculated as reference ET multiplied by crop coefficient kc. Maximum ET is crop specific and changes during crop development by applying crop-development specific kc values (Figure 6). The derived water stress data is then used to calculate yield constraining factors. The GAEZ model also determines which production areas are threatened by climatic changes by applying different climatic scenarios. Using this approach, Teixeira et al. [67] estimated that 5 Mha of cropland suitable for corn production are at risk due to climate change induced heat stress, and that yield declines are expected especially in the Northern hemisphere between 40 and 60\u00b0N latitudes.\nCrop development specific kc values for corn: kc1, kc2, kc3, and kc4 applies for the initial (d1), vegetative (d2), reproductive (d3), and maturation (d4) development period, respectively. Crop coefficient kc5 applies to the end of the growing period. Corn kc2 and kc4 data are linearly interpolated between kc1, kc3, and kc5. The four corn development stages make up 15, 30, 35, and 20% of the total growing period. Data, equations, and redrawn graph according to IIASA/FAO [66]. In this example, total growing period (day of planting until harvest) was 173\u00a0days, for two corn fields nearby Ames, IA, USA from 2006 to 2017.\nCrop development specific kc values for corn: kc1, kc2, kc3, and kc4 applies for the initial (d1), vegetative (d2), reproductive (d3), and maturation (d4) development period, respectively.

In this example, total growing period (day of planting until harvest) was 173\u00a0days, for two corn fields nearby Ames, IA, USA from 2006 to 2017.\nOne of the large challenges and opportunities for simulation models will be to incorporate the expected changes in insect and disease populations affecting corn production and link this with the production models. Integration of these two aspects into a single framework will allow for a more complete assessment of the corn production system being experienced by producers.\n7. Conclusions\nClimate impacts on corn production due to the changing temperature and precipitation regimes in the corn growing areas. The largest impact of these changes will be at the local scale where within season weather induced by the change in climate will become more noticeable. Increasing temperatures will increase the rate of phenological development during the vegetative and reproductive stages; however, the most negative effects will be exposure to high temperatures during the pollination and grain-filling stages. The largest impact on corn production will remain linked to the availability of soil water through precipitation and variation in precipitation during the grain-filling period will have the most detrimental impact on corn production. To overcome the effects of climate change there will be shifts in areas where corn is produced; however, these shifts may not be into areas with the capacity of the soil to support high production or have large variation in yield among years due to the variation in within season weather [33]. What will be critical is to increase our understanding of the G \u00d7 E \u00d7 M interactions as suggested by Hatfield and Walthall [31] in order to reduce the risk in production from a changing climate. What will be critical will be to use our current knowledge base (i.e. genetic resources (G) and management techniques (M)) to determine the viability of potential adaptation strategies to overcome climate changes (E). Combining experimental studies with crop simulation models will advance our understanding of the complex interactions occurring between the biological system and the physical environment and guide us toward viable adaptation practices with the potential to offset the negative impacts of climate change.\nReferences\nSections\nCite this chapter\nThere are two ways to cite this chapter:\nNext chapter\nBy Amanullah and Shah Fahad\n1,343 downloads  | 4 cites\nWritten By\nSubmitted: 06 February 2018 Reviewed: 02 April 2018 Published: 10 October 2018\nCite this chapter\nThere are two ways to cite this chapter:\n\u00a9 2018 The Author(s).

March temperatures were above average across much of the contiguous U.S., while below-average temperatures were observed in small pockets of the West and Southwest.\nThe Alaska statewide March temperature was 14.1\u00b0F, 3.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the 100-year period of record for the state. Above-average temperatures were observed across much of the state with near-normal temperatures in parts of the North Slope, Interior, Southwest and parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\n\n\nFor January\u2013March, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 39.4\u00b0F, 4.2\u00b0F above average, ranking fifth warmest on record for this period. Temperatures were above average across most of the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast. Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine each ranked second warmest for the January\u2013March period.\nThe Alaska January\u2013March temperature was 9.4\u00b0F, 3.5\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Much of the state was above normal for the three-month period while temperatures were near average across the eastern portions of the state and in parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\nPrecipitation\n\n\nMarch precipitation for the contiguous U.S. was 2.85 inches, 0.34 inch above average, ranking in the wettest third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average across much of the West, in the Great Lakes and along the Gulf and East coasts and in parts of the northern Plains. Conversely, precipitation was below normal across much of the Ohio Valley, the Plains, and in parts of the Northwest and Florida. Maine and Rhode Island each had their second-wettest March on record.\nAlaska\u2019s average monthly precipitation ranked in the middle third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior, south-central Alaska and in parts of the Panhandle during the month.\n\n\nThe January\u2013March precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 8.15 inches, 1.19 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across much of the contiguous U.S., with Rhode Island having its second-wettest year-to-date period on record. Conversely, precipitation was below average across much of the northern Plains and in small parts of the Northwest, central and southern Plains, Ohio Valley and Southeast during the January\u2013March period.\nThe January\u2013March precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record, with above-average precipitation observed in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior and south-central Alaska, as well as southern portions of the Panhandle during this period.\nBillion-Dollar Disasters\nOne new billion-dollar weather and climate disaster was confirmed in March 2024 after a severe weather event impacted the central and southern U.S. during mid-March, with the most severe weather occurring on March 13\u201315.\u00a0The U.S. has sustained 378 separate weather and climate disasters since 1980 where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (including CPI adjustment to 2024). The total cost of these 378 events exceeds $2.675 trillion.\nOther Notable Events\nFive wildfires, including the Smokehouse Creek wildfire, were finally contained in the Texas Panhandle, the largest cattle-producing region in the world. The wildfires resulted in approximately 1.1 million acres scorched, hundreds of destroyed structures, hundreds of miles of ruined fencing and more than 7,000 dead cattle.Winter did not bring heavy snowfall to Wisconsin nor the temperatures necessary to maintain the snow, allowing fires to begin early and in high numbers. Between January\u2013March 2024, there have been more than 220 fires across Wisconsin.A 5.25-inch diameter hail stone fell in Ada, Oklahoma on March 14, which is the largest stone reported in Pontotoc County since 1950, as well as the largest to fall in the state in nearly 13 years.\nA state of emergency was declared for Ohio as several tornadoes struck the state, resulting in 3 fatalities on March 14 when an EF-3 tornado crossed Auglaize and Logan Counties.\nDrought\nAccording to the April 2 U.S. Drought Monitor report, about 18% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought, down about 3.6% from the end of February. Drought conditions expanded or intensified in portions of the Plains and in parts of the Northwest, central Mississippi Valley, northern Great Lakes and Hawaii this month. Drought contracted or was reduced in intensity across much of the Mississippi Valley, Puerto Rico and the West, and in parts of the Plains, Great Lakes and Carolinas.\nMonthly Outlook\nAbove-average temperatures are favored to impact much of the central U.S., Northwest and Northeast in April while above-average precipitation is likely from much of the Plains to parts of the East Coast and in much of the Southwest. Drought is likely to persist along portions of the Northern Tier, the Southwest, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Visit the Climate Prediction Center\u2019s Official 30-Day Forecasts and U.S. Monthly Drought Outlook website for more details.\nSignificant wildland fire potential for April is above normal across much of the Upper Midwest and in parts of the central and southern Plains. For additional information on wildland fire potential, visit the National Interagency Fire Center\u2019s One-Month Wildland Fire Outlook.\nThis monthly summary from NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making.

Each participant\u2019s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u2014including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u2014and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u201cAppropriate monetary policy\u201d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u2019s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 11\u201312, 2024.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n3.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants\u2019 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nThe confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\u2019 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.\n* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.\nTable 2.

For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.\n1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. Return to table\n2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. Return to table\n3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. Return to table\nForecast Uncertainty\nThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur.\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second and third years, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \u201cfan charts\u201d that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants\u2019 projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants' current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.\nBack to Top\nLast Update: September 18, 2024\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nAbout the Fed\nNews & Events\nMonetary Policy\nSupervision & Regulation\nFinancial Stability\nPayment Systems\nEconomic Research\nData\nConsumers & Communities\nConnect with the Board\n\nTools and Information\n\nContact\nPublications\nFreedom of Information (FOIA)\nOffice of Inspector General\nBudget & Performance | Audit\nNo FEAR Act\nEspa\u00f1ol\nWebsite Policies | Privacy Program\nAccessibility\n\nStay Connected\nFederal Reserve Facebook Page Federal Reserve Instagram Page Federal Reserve YouTube Page Federal Reserve Flickr Page Federal Reserve LinkedIn Page Federal Reserve Threads Page Link to Federal Reserve Twitter Page Subscribe to RSS Subscribe to Email\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551",
      "L.A. County faces $12.5 billion in climate costs through 2040, study says\nA first-of-its-kind report has estimated  that Los Angeles County must invest billions of dollars through 2040 to protect residents from worsening climate hazards, including extreme heat, increasing precipitation, worsening wildfires, rising sea levels and climate-induced public health threats.\nThe report, published this week by the nonprofit Center for Climate Integrity, identified  14 different climate adaptation measures that authors calculated would  cost L.A. taxpayers at least $12.5 billion over the next 15 years, or approximately $780 million per year. The vast majority of those costs \u2014 more than $9 billion \u2014 will be incurred by local municipal governments, including the cities of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Santa Clarita, the report said.\n\u201cThese numbers don\u2019t include the costs of recovering from disasters \u2014 from extreme weather events that knock out power or damage infrastructure or do all the kinds of things they do,\u201d said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity. \u201cSo it\u2019s a very conservative estimate, and yet it\u2019s a really big number.\u201d \nAggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health and science.\nWiles said the costs for L.A. County are nearly as high as for the entire state of Pennsylvania, which faces about $15 billion in climate adaptation costs over roughly the same  period. \n\u201cThis is a big number, but this is going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThese costs will be incurred at some point, and it\u2019s just much better to pay now than it is to pay later. I can\u2019t emphasize that enough.\u201d\nThe most expensive adaptation categories are related to precipitation and heat, including an estimated $4.3 billion for improved stormwater management, $2.5 billion for cool pavement investments and $1.4 billion for tree canopies to combat urban heat islands, the report found. Other costs include wildfire mitigation; coastal defense and infrastructure protection; building upgrades for cooling and air conditioning; and responses to vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus.\nCounty officials said the findings weren\u2019t surprising and agreed that they may even be conservative given the scale of the threats. \n\u201cThe impacts of climate have become more and more visible over the past few years in particular,\u201d said Rita Kampalath, L.A. County\u2019s chief sustainability officer. \u201cWe know that we\u2019re facing really, really huge needs in terms of how we prepare our communities to face those, and to be resilient in the face of increased climate impacts. It\u2019s only going to increase from here.\u201d\nStormwater capture in particular has been on the minds of many Angelenos this winter as record-breaking rainfall pounded the region. A monster storm in February saw the Los Angeles River roar to life and funnel millions of gallons  into the Pacific Ocean.\nBut the  river \u2014 which was encased in concrete nearly a hundred years ago \u2014 and other local  flood channels will be no match for climate change-enhanced storms of the future. Though the long-term trend in the West is toward hotter and drier conditions, Los Angeles will still see bouts of severe storms and extreme wet years that will increase flood risk significantly, according to the state\u2019s fourth climate change assessment. \nTo mitigate these impacts, the county must expand its stormwater drainage infrastructure by installing bioswales, porous pavement and other opportunities for stormwater to seep into the ground, the report found. It noted that these \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d upgrades are the least expensive option to cope with extreme rainfall events, as opposed to increasing the size and scale of hard infrastructure such as drain pipes. \n Climate & Environment \n The unloved L.A. River just prevented a flood disaster. Can more of its water be saved? \nCapturing rainfall is only one part of the L.A. River\u2019s job. It is also a flood control channel that is critical to protecting lives and properties when stormwaters surge. \nFeb. 8, 2024\nThe county is making progress on this work through its Safe Clean Water Program, passed by voters as Measure W in 2018, Kampalath said. The program allocates about $280 million annually to stormwater capture projects, although recent reports have found that progress to date has been slow. \n\u201cWhile it is a big need, I do actually feel like the county has been investing, and our residents and voters in particular have shown that this is a high priority,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not as far as we would like to be \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say that about much of anything when it comes to climate \u2014 but I do think that we have resources available to try to address some of these needs.\u201d \nMeanwhile, extreme heat continues to pose a significant threat to L.A. County residents, and it is  predicted to only get worse in the years and decades ahead. The region is expected to experience an average of 48.5 days above 90 degrees per year between 2024 and 2040, the report says. That\u2019s about 12.5 more hot days per year than communities experienced between 1994 and 2013. \nSome of the best methods to combat the dangers of rising heat include installing cool pavements, expanding urban green space, painting railway  tracks with reflective paint to keep them at operable temperatures, and upgrading cooling systems for public buildings such as schools, the report says. Converting public parking lots to cool pavements that reflect instead of absorb sunlight can also help lower ambient temperatures.\nHeat is \u201cthe impact that affects communities of color the most, and people less able to adapt themselves and their personal lives,\u201d Wiles said. He noted that some urban areas can simmer up to 20 degrees hotter than surrounding neighborhoods with heavy tree canopies. \n\u201cFrom a public health perspective, these types of adaptations are increasingly critical just to make neighborhoods livable,\u201d he said.\nThe report comes at a moment when the state is facing a significant $37.9-billion budget deficit, which has prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom to slash $2.9 billion from California climate programs, delay an additional $1.9 billion and shift $1.8 billion to other funds. \nKampalath said it\u2019s too soon to say whether those cuts will trickle down to L.A. County\u2019s climate efforts, but that they could potentially affect  funds officials were hoping to take advantage of through grants and other programs.\nHowever, she noted that many of the county\u2019s climate adaptation strategies can have multiple benefits, such as tree canopy programs that help combat heat and improve stormwater management simultaneously.\n\u201cAs we\u2019re looking at how to address these impacts, we do need to think about a multi-benefit approach, and what kind of strategies we can put in place that are really going to address a wide range of things \u2014 not only climate, but biodiversity and health impacts and the well-being of our communities as well,\u201d she said.\n Climate & Environment \n As climate hazards converge, more Californians are living in harm\u2019s way \nWhen wildfire smoke and extreme heat combine, they create a \u201csynergistic effect\u201d or an additional burden on people\u2019s health, researchers say.\nFeb. 3, 2024\nUltimately, funding for the projects outlined in the report will come from taxpayers, whether at the municipal, state or federal level, Wiles said. But he also hopes that oil and gas companies will be held accountable for their role in the worsening climate crisis, as fossil fuel emissions are by far the largest driver of global warming.\nLast year, California filed a bombshell lawsuit against five of the largest oil and gas companies for their alleged \u201cdecades-long campaign of deception\u201d about the risks posed by fossil fuels, which have forced the state to spend billions of dollars to address environmental-related damages. State Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta is seeking to create a nuisance abatement fund to finance climate mitigation and adaptation efforts, among other outcomes. \n\u201cEach and every community in Los Angeles County should consider bringing similar legal actions to hold climate polluters accountable and ensure that taxpayers aren\u2019t left to pay the bill alone,\u201d the report says. \nIndeed, there are other climate hazards that will cost Angelenos billions in adaptation expenses over the next decade and a half, the report found. \nThey include an increase in vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus as more mosquitoes are drawn to the area\u2019s changing temperatures and precipitation patterns. About 500,000 new cases of the virus are expected in the county through 2040, which will cost an estimated $993 million to treat. Climate change will also lead to more pediatric asthma cases due to an increase in pollen, with about 160,000 new cases expected through 2040. \nThe county also needs about $680 million in road improvements as heat and rain contribute to more cracks, erosion and soft surfaces. A foot of sea level rise along the coast of L.A. County  will require at least $576 million for berms, flood walls, bank stabilization and other infrastructure measures to prevent flooding and to avoid infrastructure damage by 2040. \nWildfires, already getting larger, faster and more frequent across California, will necessitate nearly $1 billion  just to clear vegetation and other fuels from land around the county\u2019s infrastructure, the report found. It noted that L.A. County will face an average of 36 more high-fire days through 2040 when compared to the 1994-to-2013 baseline. \nThe estimated $919-million wildfire cost does not account for fighting fires or repairing damage from blazes. The 2018 Woolsey fire racked up an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion in insured losses alone. \nWiles said the expenses outlined in the report won\u2019t solve climate change but will help \u201chold things where they are today,\u201d or least prevent the hazards from getting worse. \nHe said he hoped the report would help guide county officials as they face difficult choices about where, how and to what limited funds should be allocated. Investing in climate adaptations now can save money \u2014 and lives \u2014 later, he said. \n\u201cThese costs are still coming,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cThe next disaster will happen. This is just what it\u2019s going to cost to prepare.\u201d\nToward a more sustainable California\nGet Boiling Point, our newsletter exploring climate change, energy and the environment, and become part of the conversation \u2014 and the solution.\n You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. \nMore to Read \n Endorsement: Yes on Proposition 4.

Over the past 12 months, the increase in the CPI has surpassed the median estimate in 5 months, matched the median estimate in 2 months, and fallen short of the median estimate in 5 months. It is interesting to note that actual CPI number has been below the estimate over the past four months (May 2024 through August 2024). Over the past 5 years (60 months), the increase in the CPI has surpassed the median estimate 52% of the time, matched the median estimate 15% of the time, and fallen short of the median estimate 33% of the time.\nThe median estimate of 2.3% is based on 17 estimates collected by FactSet. These CPI estimates range from a low of 2.20% to a high of 2.40%, for a spread of 20 bps. This spread is smaller than the trailing 12-month average spread between the low and high estimate of 27 bps and smaller than the 5-year (60 month) average spread between the low and high estimate 49 bps.\nThe median estimate (year-over-year, not seasonally adjusted) for the consumer price index excluding food & energy (Core CPI) is 3.2%.\nTomorrow (October 10) the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release the CPI and Core CPI numbers for September.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThis blog post is for informational purposes only.

Police find a homeless woman dead on the sidewalk,\u201d the news anchor said.  \nAt this, Howard dropped what he was doing and hurried closer to the TV. \n\u201cThe cause is believed to be from the extreme heat.\u201d \nHoward knew that was likely because a high-pressure system known as a heat dome had recently moved over South Texas. The meteorological phenomenon acts like a closed oven door, trapping a roiling mass of hot air below. The official temperature that day had reached 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41\u00b0C) \u2013 12 degrees higher than average for that date. The dead woman was later identified as 46-year-old Jessica Witzel.\nAlthough Howard didn\u2019t know her, Witzel\u2019s death hit him hard.\n\u201cIt was right here in San Antonio,\u201d he said. \u201cA specific person gives the numbers a name and a face.\u201d\nHoward is a numbers guy by profession. An associate professor of public health at the University of Texas at San Antonio \u2013 a 15-minute drive from where Witzel died \u2013 Howard specializes in using large data sets to understand acute and long-term health consequences from exposure to traumas of all sorts. \nHeat-related deaths were already uppermost on his mind that evening. He was the lead author of a study about to be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cTrends of Heat-Related Deaths in the US, 1999\u20132023\u201d was the first scientific paper to document an abrupt, steep rise in heat-related deaths across the country, one that is likely linked to climate change.\nThe study found that between 1999 and 2023, the heat-related mortality rate \u2013 the number of deaths per 100,000 people \u2013 rose by 63%. But the data showed something even more disturbing: The trend is rapidly accelerating. \n\u201cThe death rate,\u201d Howard said, \u201chas risen 117% in the last seven years.\u201d\nSara Meerow is an urban heat expert at Arizona State University in Tempe, a city just to the east of Phoenix in Maricopa County. Last year, 645 heat-related deaths were recorded in the county. Heat deaths have long been considered a problem largely confined to the Phoenix metro area, Meerow said.  \nBut Howard\u2019s research \u201csuggests that increases in the number of heat-related deaths over the past few years in Phoenix, Arizona, are part of a national trend,\u201d she said.\nThe climate is changing, and our journalists are here to help you make sense of it. Sign up for our weekly email newsletter and never miss a story.\nMeerow, an associate professor in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning at ASU, was herself the lead author of a journal article published only days before Howard\u2019s. Hers looked at what officials are doing \u2013 and failing to do \u2013 to reduce heat-related deaths in the U.S.\nAlthough heat kills more U.S. residents than any other form of extreme weather, Meerow pointed out that \u201ccompared with other hazards like flooding, heat is less visible and largely unregulated.\u201d\nFor example, Meerow noted in the paper, the federal government maps flood zones, builds levees, subsidizes flood insurance, and provides financial and other aid to people who have suffered a flooding disaster. But there are no similar measures to help U.S. residents likely to experience deadly heat waves.\nJessica Witzel\u2019s death is a tragically typical example of how officials at all levels of government are failing to protect Americans from extreme heat.\nWitzel was unhoused and had been diagnosed with severe mental disorders. Living on the street, without access to a cool shelter, people are far more likely to suffer heat-related illnesses, from temporary heat cramps to potentially lethal heat stroke. Mental disorders can interfere with a person\u2019s ability to recognize when their body temperature is rising to dangerous levels. In rural and urban America, there is a chronic shortage of shelter beds for unhoused people, air-conditioned spaces that are open to the public when needed, and mental health care for vulnerable populations that can\u2019t afford health insurance.\nRead: For unhoused people in America\u2019s hottest large city, heat waves are a merciless killer\nWitzel died at what could be considered ground zero in San Antonio\u2019s urban heat island, where the combination of vast stretches of concrete and lack of vegetation and shade sends already high temperatures skyrocketing. Waste heat from gas-powered vehicles is a significant contributor to urban heat islands, and Interstate 10 is less than 1,000 feet south of where Witzel was found. To the north, and even closer, is an enormous concrete parking lot servicing the city\u2019s 500-bus transit system.\nExactly how hot it was at the time and place Witzel was found isn\u2019t known, but Greg Harman has a pretty good idea. Harman is the founder of Deceleration, a nonprofit online journal in San Antonio that describes its beat as \u201cthe intersection of environment and justice.\u201d During the scorching San Antonio summers, Harman travels to different neighborhoods to document and write about the disparate impact of heat on residents based on location.\nThe day before Witzel died, Harman had used an extremely accurate tool to measure the temperature and humidity in downtown San Antonio. The official high that day was 108 degrees (42\u00b0C), but that reading was taken at the airport, several miles from the city\u2019s hotter urban core.\n\u201cDowntown, the air temperature was 119 degrees [48\u00b0C],\u201d Harman said. \u201cThe heat index, which combines heat and humidity to determine how hot it feels to the human body, was 129 degrees [54\u00b0C].\u201d\nWitzel\u2019s death also underscores what experts agree is a fundamental problem in working to reduce heat mortalities.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for decades that the official numbers of heat-related deaths are massive underestimates,\u201d said Kristie Ebi, professor of global health at the University of Washington. Without knowing the true size and other details of the problem, she added, it\u2019s hard to set priorities for action.\nEbi pointed to several factors that lead to these undercounts, beginning with the fact that there is no nationwide standard for reporting heat deaths. Bexar County, Texas, for example, which includes San Antonio, doesn\u2019t track deaths caused by heat, which means that Witzel is unlikely to be included in state or national counts of heat mortalities, regardless of what cause of death is listed on her death certificate.\nWhich points to another problem: Death certificates are not necessarily reliable indicators of heat deaths.\n\u201cExtreme heat can cause a heart attack,\u201d Ebi explained. \u201cIf somebody comes into an emergency room having a heart attack, the people working there may not know whether the person had been exposed to extreme heat.\u201d \nIf the patient dies, the cause of death is recorded simply as a heart attack.\nAnother reason a death certificate may not mention heat is that there\u2019s no state or federal standard for who can issue death certificates.\nRead: Climate change played a role in killing tens of thousands of people in 2023 \nIn Texas, large metropolitan areas are likely to have professional medical examiners. \u201cBut in smaller cities and in rural areas,\u201d Howard said, \u201cthe person filling out the death certificate might be a justice of the peace who has no medical training at all.\u201d\nThat may partly explain why metro Phoenix reports such a disproportionately large share of heat deaths (in addition to its being a sprawling, car-centric desert city).\n\u201cThe medical examiner\u2019s office in Phoenix has a rigorous protocol in place for determining heat-related deaths,\u201d Howard said. \nSimply put, if you\u2019re actively looking for heat-related deaths, you\u2019ll likely get a more accurate count than if you\u2019re not looking.

See Guide to this Report for more on\nassessments of likelihood and confidence.\n6.0: Introduction\nTemperature is among the most important climatic elements used in\ndecision-making. For example, builders and insurers use temperature\ndata for planning and risk management while energy companies and\nregulators use temperature data to predict demand and set utility\nrates. Temperature is also a key indicator of climate change: recent\nincreases are apparent over the land, ocean, and troposphere, and\nsubstantial changes are expected for this century. This chapter\nsummarizes the major observed and projected changes in near-surface\nair temperature over the United States, emphasizing new data sets\nand model projections since the Third National Climate Assessment\n(NCA3). Changes are depicted using a spectrum of observations,\nincluding surface weather stations, moored ocean buoys, polar-orbiting\nsatellites, and temperature-sensitive proxies. Projections are based\non global models and downscaled products from CMIP5 (Coupled Model\nIntercomparison Project Phase 5) using a suite of Representative\nConcentration Pathways (RCPs; see Ch. 4: Projections for more on\nRCPs and future scenarios).\n6.1: Historical Changes\n6.1.1 Average Temperatures\nChanges in average temperature are described using a suite of\nobservational datasets. As in NCA3, changes in land temperature are\nassessed using the nClimGrid dataset.1\n,2\nAlong U.S. coastlines,\nchanges in sea surface temperatures are quantified using a new\nreconstruction3\nthat forms the ocean component of the NOAA Global Temperature\ndataset.4\nChanges in middle tropospheric temperature are examined using updated\nversions of multiple satellite datasets.5\n,6\n,7\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States has\nrisen since the start of the 20th century. In general, temperature\nincreased until about 1940, decreased until about 1970, and increased\nrapidly through 2016. Because the increase was not constant over\ntime, multiple methods were evaluated in this report (as in NCA3)\nto quantify the trend. All methods yielded rates of warming that\nwere significant at the 95% level. The lowest estimate of 1.2\u00b0F\n(0.7\u00b0C) was obtained by computing the difference between the average\nfor 1986\u20132016 (i.e., present-day) and the average for 1901\u20131960\n(i.e., the first half of the last century). The highest estimate\nof 1.8\u00b0F (1.0\u00b0C) was obtained by fitting a linear (least-squares)\nregression line through the period 1895\u20132016. Thus, the temperature\nincrease cited in this assessment is 1.2\u00b0\u20131.8\u00b0F (0.7\u00b0\u20131.0\u00b0C).\nThis increase is about 0.1\u00b0F (0.06\u00b0C) less than presented in NCA3,\nand it results from the use of slightly different periods in each\nreport. In particular, the decline in the lower bound stems from\nthe use of different time periods to represent present-day climate\n(NCA3 used 1991\u20132012, which was slightly warmer than the 1986\u20132016\nperiod used here). The decline in the upper bound stems mainly from\ntemperature differences late in the record (e.g., the last year of\ndata available for NCA3 was 2012, which was the warmest year on\nrecord for the contiguous United States).\nEach NCA region experienced a net warming through 2016 (Table 6.1).\nThe largest changes were in the western United States, where average\ntemperature increased by more than 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) in Alaska, the\nNorthwest, the Southwest, and also in the Northern Great Plains.\nAs noted in NCA3, the Southeast had the least warming, driven by a\ncombination of natural variations and human influences.8\nIn most regions, average\nminimum temperature increased at a slightly higher rate than average\nmaximum temperature, with the Midwest having the largest discrepancy,\nand the Southwest and Northwest having the smallest. This differential\nrate of warming resulted in a continuing decrease in the diurnal\ntemperature range that is consistent with other parts of the globe.9\nAnnual average\nsea surface temperature also increased along all regional coastlines\n(see Figure 1.3), though changes were generally smaller than over\nland owing to the higher heat capacity of water. Increases were\nlargest in Alaska (greater than 1.0\u00b0F [0.6\u00b0C]) while increases\nwere smallest (less than 0.5\u00b0F [0.3\u00b0C]) in coastal areas of the\nSoutheast.\nMore than 95% of the land surface of the contiguous United States\nhad an increase in annual average temperature (Figure 6.1). In\ncontrast, only small (and somewhat dispersed) parts of the Southeast\nand Southern Great Plains experienced cooling. From a seasonal\nperspective, warming was greatest and most widespread in winter,\nwith increases of over 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) in most areas. In summer,\nwarming was less extensive (mainly along the East Coast and in the\nwestern third of the Nation), while cooling was evident in parts\nof the Southeast, Midwest, and Great Plains.\nFigure 6.1\nObserved changes in annual, winter, and summer temperature (\u00b0F). Changes are the difference\nbetween the average for present-day (1986\u20132016) and the average for the first half of\nthe last century (1901\u20131960 for the contiguous United States, 1925\u20131960 for Alaska and Hawai\u2018i).\nEstimates are derived from the nClimDiv dataset.\n1\n,2\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nThere has been a rapid increase in the average temperature of the\ncontiguous United States over the past several decades. There is\ngeneral consistency on this point between the surface thermometer\nrecord from NOAA1\nand the middle tropospheric satellite records from Remote Sensing\nSystems (RSS),5\nNOAA\u2019s Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR),7\nand the University\nof Alabama in Huntsville (UAH).6\nIn particular, for the\nperiod 1979\u20132016, the rate of warming in the surface record was\n0.512\u00b0F (0.284\u00b0C) per decade, versus trends of 0.455\u00b0F (0.253\u00b0C),\n0.421\u00b0F (0.234\u00b0C), and 0.289\u00b0F (0.160 \u00b0C) per decade for RSS version\n4, STAR version 3, and UAH version 6, respectively (after accounting\nfor stratospheric influences). All trends are statistically significant\nat the 95% level. For the contiguous United States, the year 2016\nwas the second-warmest on record at the surface and in the middle\ntroposphere (2012 was the warmest year at the surface, and 2015 was\nthe warmest in the middle troposphere). Generally speaking, surface\nand satellite records do not have identical trends because they do\nnot represent the same physical quantity; surface measurements are\nmade using thermometers in shelters about 1.5 meters above the\nground whereas satellite measurements are mass-weighted averages\nof microwave emissions from deep atmospheric layers. The UAH record\nlikely has a lower trend because it differs from the other satellite\nproducts in the treatment of target temperatures from the NOAA-9\nsatellite as well as in the correction for diurnal drift.10\nRecent paleo-temperature evidence confirms the unusual character\nof wide-scale warming during the past few decades as determined\nfrom the instrumental record. The most important new paleoclimate\nstudy since NCA3 showed that for each of the seven continental\nregions, the reconstructed area-weighted average temperature for\n1971\u20132000 was higher than for any other time in nearly 1,400 years,11\nalthough with\nsignificant uncertainty around the central estimate that leads to\nthis conclusion. Recent (up to 2006) 30-year smoothed temperatures\nacross temperate North America (including most of the continental\nUnited States) are similarly reconstructed as the warmest over the\npast 1,500 years12\n(Figure 6.2). Unlike the PAGES 2k seven-continent result mentioned\nabove, this conclusion for North America is robust in relation to\nthe estimated uncertainty range. Reconstruction data since 1500 for\nwestern temperate North America show the same conclusion at the\nannual time scale for 1986\u20132005. This time period and the running\n20-year periods thereafter are warmer than all possible continuous\n20-year sequences in a 1,000-member statistical reconstruction\nensemble.13\n6.1.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.2\nPollen-based temperature reconstruction for temperate North America.\nThe blue curve depicts the pollen-based reconstruction of 30-year\naverages (as anomalies from 1904 to 1980) for the temperate region\n(30\u00b0\u201355\u00b0N, 75\u00b0\u2013130\u00b0W). The red curve shows the corresponding tree\nring-based decadal average reconstruction, which was smoothed and\nused to calibrate the lower-frequency pollen-based estimate. Light\n(medium) blue zones indicate 2 standard error (1 standard error)\nuncertainty estimations associated with each 30-year value. The\nblack curve shows comparably smoothed instrumental temperature\nvalues up to 1980. The dashed black line represents the average\ntemperature anomaly of comparably smoothed instrumental data for\nthe period 2000\u20132006. (Figure source: NOAA NCEI).\nShifts in temperature extremes are examined using a suite of\nsocietally relevant climate change indices14\n,15\nderived from long-term\nobservations of daily surface temperature.16\nThe coldest and warmest\ntemperatures of the year are of particular relevance given their\nwidespread use in engineering, agricultural, and other sectoral\napplications (for example, extreme annual design conditions by the\nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning;\nplant hardiness zones by the U.S. Department of Agriculture). Cold\nwaves and heat waves (that is, extended periods of below or above\nnormal temperature) are likewise of great importance because of\ntheir numerous societal and environmental impacts, which span from\nhuman health to plant and animal phenology. Changes are considered\nfor a spectrum of event frequencies and intensities, ranging from\nthe typical annual extreme to the 1-in-10 year event (an extreme\nthat only has a 10% chance of occurrence in any given year). The\ndiscussion focuses on the contiguous United States; Alaska, Hawai\u2018i,\nand the Caribbean do not have a sufficient number of long-term\nstations for a century-scale analysis.\nCold extremes have become less severe over the past century. For\nexample, the coldest daily temperature of the year has increased\nat most locations in the contiguous United States (Figure 6.3). All\nregions experienced net increases (Table 6.2), with the largest\nrises in the Northern Great Plains and the Northwest (roughly 4.5\u00b0F\n[2.5\u00b0C]), and the smallest in the Southeast (about 1.0\u00b0F [0.6\u00b0C]).\nIn general, there were increases throughout the record, with a\nslight acceleration in recent decades (Figure 6.3). The temperature\nof extremely cold days (1-in-10 year events) generally exhibited\nthe same pattern of increases as the coldest daily temperature of\nthe year. Consistent with these increases, the number of cool nights\nper year (those with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile\nfor 1961\u20131990) declined in all regions, with much of the West having\ndecreases of roughly two weeks. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile for\n1961\u20131990) has fallen over the past century (Figure 6.4). The\nfrequency of intense cold waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) peaked\nin the 1980s and then reached record-low levels in the 2000s.17\nFigure 6.3\nObserved changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures (\u00b0F) of the year in the contiguous United States.\nMaps (top) depict changes at stations; changes are the difference between the average for present-day (1986\u20132016)\nand the average for the first half of the last century (1901\u20131960). Time series (bottom) depict the area-weighted\naverage for the contiguous United States. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with minimal missing data\nin the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily dataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nFigure 6.4\nObserved changes in cold and heat waves in the contiguous United States. The top panel depicts changes\nin the frequency of cold waves; the middle panel depicts changes in the frequency of heat waves; and the\nbottom panel depicts changes in the intensity of heat waves. Cold and heat wave frequency indices are\ndefined in Zhang et al.,15\nand the heat wave\nintensity index is defined in Russo et al.14\nEstimates are\nderived from long-term stations with minimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in warm extremes are more nuanced than changes in cold\nextremes. For instance, the warmest daily temperature of the year\nincreased in some parts of the West over the past century (Figure\n6.3), but there were decreases in almost all locations east of the\nRocky Mountains. In fact, all eastern regions experienced a net\ndecrease (Table 6.2), most notably the Midwest (about 2.2\u00b0F [1.2\u00b0C])\nand the Southeast (roughly 1.5\u00b0F [0.8\u00b0C]). The decreases in the\neastern half of Nation, particularly in the Great Plains, are mainly\ntied to the unprecedented summer heat of the 1930s Dust Bowl era,\nwhich was exacerbated by land-surface feedbacks driven by springtime\nprecipitation deficits and land mismanagement.18\nHowever, anthropogenic\naerosol forcing may also have reduced summer temperatures in the\nNortheast and Southeast from the early 1950s to the mid-1970s,19\nand agricultural\nintensification may have suppressed the hottest extremes in the\nMidwest.20\nSince the mid-1960s, there has been only a very slight increase in\nthe warmest daily temperature of the year (amidst large interannual\nvariability). Heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile for 1961\u20131990) increased in frequency\nuntil the mid-1930s, became considerably less common through the\nmid-1960s, and increased in frequency again thereafter (Figure 6.4).\nAs with warm daily temperatures, heat wave magnitude reached a\nmaximum in the 1930s. The frequency of intense heat waves (4-day,\n1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most\nregions except the Midwest and the Great Plains.17\n,21\nSince the early 1980s\n(Figure 6.4), there is suggestive evidence of a slight increase in\nthe intensity of heat waves nationwide14\nas well as an increase\nin the concurrence of droughts and heat waves.22\nFigure 6.5\nObserved changes in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures\nin the contiguous United States. Red bars indicate a year with more\ndaily record highs than daily record lows, while blue bars indicate\na year with more record lows than highs. The height of the bar\nindicates the ratio of record highs to lows (red) or of record lows\nto highs (blue). For example, a ratio of 2:1 for a blue bar means\nthat there were twice as many record daily lows as daily record\nhighs that year. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with\nminimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network\u2013Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures are\nalso apparent. Very generally, the number of record lows has been\ndeclining since the late-1970s while the number of record highs has\nbeen rising.23\nBy extension, there has been an increase in the ratio of the\nnumber of record highs to record lows (Figure 6.5). Over the past\ntwo decades, the average of this ratio exceeds two (meaning that\ntwice as many high-temperature records have been set as low-temperature\nrecords). The number of new highs has surpassed the number of new\nlows in 15 of the last 20 years, with 2012 and 2016 being particularly\nextreme (ratios of seven and five, respectively).\n6.2: Detection and Attribution\n6.2.1\nAverage Temperatures\nWhile a confident attribution of global temperature increases to\nanthropogenic forcing has been made,24\ndetection and attribution\nassessment statements for smaller regions are generally much weaker.\nNevertheless, some detectable anthropogenic influences on average\ntemperature have been reported for North America and parts of the\nUnited States (e.g., Christidis et al. 2010;25\nBonfils et al. 2008;26\nPierce et al.\n200927\n).\nFigure 6.6 shows an example for linear trends for 1901\u20132015,\nindicating a detectable anthropogenic warming since 1901 over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States for\nthe CMIP5 multimodel ensemble\u2014a condition that was also met for\nmost of the individual models.28\nThe Southeast stands out\nas the only region with no \u201cdetectable\u201d warming since 1901; observed\ntrends there were inconsistent with CMIP5 All Forcing historical\nruns.28\nThe\ncause of this \u201cwarming hole,\u201d or lack of a long-term warming trend,\nremains uncertain, though it is likely a combination of natural and\nhuman causes. Some studies conclude that changes in anthropogenic\naerosols have played a crucial role (e.g., Leibensperger et al.\n2012a,b;29\n,30\nYu et al. 201431\n), whereas other studies infer a possible large role for atmospheric\ncirculation,32\ninternal climate variability (e.g., Meehl et al. 2012;8\nKnutson et al.\n2013a28\n), and\nchanges in land use (e.g., Goldstein et al. 2009;33\nXu et al. 201534\n). Notably, the\nSoutheast has been warming rapidly since the early 1960s.35\n,36\nIn summary, there\nis medium confidence for detectable anthropogenic warming over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States.\nFigure 6.6\nDetection and attribution assessment of trends in annual average\ntemperature (\u00b0F). Grid-box values indicate whether linear trends\nfor 1901\u20132015 are detectable (that is, distinct from natural\nvariability) and/or consistent with CMIP5 historical All-Forcing\nruns. If the grid-box trend is found to be both detectable and\neither consistent with or greater than the warming in the All-Forcing\nruns, then the grid box is assessed as having a detectable anthropogenic\ncontribution to warming over the period. Gray regions represent\ngrid boxes with data that are too sparse for detection and attribution.\n(Figure source: updated from Knutson et al. 2013;28\n\u00a9 American Meteorological\nSociety. Used with permission.)\n6.2.2\nTemperature Extremes\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC\u2019s) Fifth\nAssessment Report (AR5)24\nconcluded that it is very likely that human influence has\ncontributed to the observed changes in frequency and intensity of\ntemperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century.\nThe combined influence of anthropogenic and natural forcings was\nalso detectable (medium confidence) over large subregions of North\nAmerica (e.g., Zwiers et al. 2011;37\nMin et al. 201338\n). In general,\nhowever, results for the contiguous United States are not as\ncompelling as for global land areas, in part because detection of\nchanges in U.S. regional temperature extremes is affected by extreme\ntemperature in the 1930s.17\nTable 6.3 summarizes\navailable attribution statements for recent extreme U.S. temperature\nevents. As an example, the recent record or near-record high March\u2013May\naverage temperatures occurring in 2012 over the eastern United\nStates were attributed in part to external (natural plus anthropogenic)\nforcing;39\nthe century-scale trend response of temperature to external forcing\nis typically a close approximation to the anthropogenic forcing\nresponse alone. Another study found that although the extreme March\n2012 warm anomalies over the United States were mostly due to natural\nvariability, anthropogenic warming contributed to the severity.40\nSuch statements\nreveal that both natural and anthropogenic factors influence the\nseverity of extreme temperature events. Nearly every modern analysis\nof current extreme hot and cold events reveals some degree of\nattributable human influence.\n6.3: Projected Changes\n6.3.1 Average Temperatures\nTemperature projections are based on global model results and\nassociated downscaled products from CMIP5 using a suite of\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). In contrast to NCA3,\nmodel weighting is employed to refine projections of temperature\nfor each RCP (Ch. 4: Projections; Appendix B: Model Weighting).\nWeighting parameters are based on model independence and skill over\nNorth America for seasonal temperature and annual extremes. Unless\nstated otherwise, all changes presented here represent the weighted\nmultimodel mean. The weighting scheme helps refine confidence and\nlikelihood statements, but projections of U.S. surface air temperature\nremain very similar to those in NCA3. Generally speaking, extreme\ntemperatures are projected to increase even more than average\ntemperatures.41\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States is\nprojected to rise throughout the century. Increases for the period\n2021\u20132050 relative to 1976\u20132005 are projected to be about 2.5\u00b0F\n(1.4\u00b0C) for a lower scenario (RCP4.5) and 2.9\u00b0F (1.6\u00b0C) for the\nhigher scenario (RCP8.5); the similarity in warming reflects the\nsimilarity in greenhouse gas concentrations during this period\n(Figure 4.1). Notably, a 2.5\u00b0F (1.4\u00b0C) increase makes the near-term\naverage comparable to the hottest year in the historical record\n(2012). In other words, recent record-breaking years may be \u201ccommon\u201d\nin the next few decades. By late-century (2071\u20132100), the RCPs\ndiverge significantly, leading to different rates of warming:\napproximately 5.0\u00b0F (2.8\u00b0C) for RCP4.5 and 8.7\u00b0F (4.8\u00b0C) for RCP8.5.\nLikewise, there are different ranges of warming for each scenario:\n2.8\u00b0\u20137.3\u00b0F (1.6\u00b0\u20134.1\u00b0C) for RCP4.5 and 5.8\u00b0\u201311.9\u00b0F (3.2\u00b0\u20136.6\u00b0C) for\nRCP8.5. (The range is defined here as the difference between the\naverage increase in the three coolest models and the average increase\nin the three warmest models.) For both RCPs, slightly greater\nincreases are projected in summer than winter (except for Alaska),\nand average maximums will rise slightly faster than average minimums\n(except in the Southeast and Southern Great Plains).\nFigure 6.7\nProjected changes in annual average temperatures (\u00b0F). Changes are\nthe difference between the average for mid-century (2036\u20132065; top)\nor late-century (2070-2099, bottom) and the average for near-present\n(1976\u20132005). Each map depicts the weighted multimodel mean. Increases\nare statistically significant in all areas (that is, more than 50%\nof the models show a statistically significant change, and more\nthan 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nStatistically significant warming is projected for all parts of the\nUnited States throughout the century (Figure 6.7). Consistent with\npolar amplification, warming rates (and spatial gradients) are\ngreater at higher latitudes. For example, warming is largest in\nAlaska (more than 12.0\u00b0F [6.7\u00b0C] in the northern half of the state\nby late-century under RCP8.5), driven in part by a decrease in snow\ncover and thus surface albedo. Similarly, northern regions of the\ncontiguous United States have slightly more warming than other\nregions (roughly 9.0\u00b0F [5.5\u00b0C] in the Northeast, Midwest, and\nNorthern Great Plains by late-century under RCP8.5; Table 6.4). The\nSoutheast has slightly less warming because of latent heat release\nfrom increases in evapotranspiration (as is already evident in the\nobserved record). Warming is smallest in Hawai\u2018i and the Caribbean\n(roughly 4.0\u00b0\u20136.0\u00b0F [2.2\u00b0\u20133.3\u00b0C] by late century under RCP8.5)\ndue to the moderating effects of surrounding oceans. From a\nsub-regional perspective, less warming is projected along the coasts\nof the contiguous United States, again due to maritime influences,\nalthough increases are still substantial. Warming at higher elevations\nmay be underestimated because the resolution of the CMIP5 models\ndoes not capture orography in detail.\nRCP4.5\nMid-Century\n(2036\u20132065)\nRCP8.5\nMid-Century\n(2036\u20132065)\nRCP4.5\nLate-Century\n(2071\u20132100)\nRCP8.5\nLate-Century\n(2071\u20132100)\n6.3.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.8\nProjected changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures\n(\u00b0F) of the year in the contiguous United States. Changes are the\ndifference between the average for mid-century (2036\u20132065) and the\naverage for near-present (1976\u20132005) under the higher scenario\n(RCP8.5). Maps in the top row depict the weighted multimodel mean\nwhereas maps on the bottom row depict the mean of the three warmest\nmodels (that is, the models with the largest temperature increase).\nMaps are derived from 32 climate model projections that were\nstatistically downscaled using the Localized Constructed Analogs\ntechnique.51\nIncreases are\nstatistically significant in all areas (that is\u00ad\u00ad,\nmore than 50% of the models show a statistically significant change,\nand more than 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nDaily extreme temperatures are projected to increase substantially\nin the contiguous United States, particularly under the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5). For instance, the coldest and warmest daily\ntemperatures of the year are expected to increase at least 5\u00b0F\n(2.8\u00b0C) in most areas by mid-century,42\nrising to 10\u00b0F (5.5\u00b0C)\nor more by late-century.43\nIn general, there will\nbe larger increases in the coldest temperatures of the year,\nespecially in the northern half of the Nation, whereas the warmest\ntemperatures will exhibit somewhat more uniform changes geographically\n(Figure 6.8). By mid-century, the upper bound for projected changes\n(i.e., the average of the three warmest models) is about 2\u00b0F (1.1\u00b0C)\ngreater than the weighted multimodel mean. On a regional basis,\nannual extremes (Table 6.5) are consistently projected to rise\nfaster than annual averages (Table 6.4). Future changes in \u201cvery\nrare\u201d extremes are also striking; by late century, current 1-in-20\nyear maximums are projected to occur every year, while current\n1-in-20 year minimums are not expected to occur at all.44\nThe frequency and intensity of cold waves is projected to decrease\nwhile the frequency and intensity of heat waves is projected to\nincrease throughout the century. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile) will\ndecrease the most in Alaska and the least in the Northeast while\nthe frequency of heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile) will increase in all regions, particularly\nthe Southeast, Southwest, and Alaska. By mid-century, decreases in\nthe frequency of cold waves are similar across RCPs whereas increases\nin the frequency of heat waves are about 50% greater in the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5) than the lower scenario (RCP4.5).45\nThe intensity of cold\nwaves is projected to decrease while the intensity of heat waves\nis projected to increase, dramatically so under RCP8.5. By mid-century,\nboth extreme cold waves and extreme heat waves (5-day, 1-in-10 year\nevents) are projected to have temperature increases of at least\n11.0\u00b0F (6.1\u00b0C) nationwide, with larger increases in northern regions\n(the Northeast, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, and Northwest; Table\n6.5).\nFigure 6.9\nProjected changes in the number of days per year with a maximum\ntemperature above 90\u00b0F and a minimum temperature below 32\u00b0F in the\ncontiguous United States. Changes are the difference between the\naverage for mid-century (2036\u20132065) and the average for near-present\n(1976\u20132005) under the higher scenario (RCP8.5). Maps in the top row\ndepict the weighted multimodel mean whereas maps on the bottom row\ndepict the mean of the three warmest models (that is, the models\nwith the largest temperature increase). Maps are derived from 32\nclimate model projections that were statistically downscaled using\nthe Localized Constructed Analogs technique.51\nChanges are statistically\nsignificant in all areas (that is, more than 50% of the models show\na statistically significant change, and more than 67% agree on the\nsign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC and NOAA NCEI).\nThere are large projected changes in the number of days exceeding\nkey temperature thresholds throughout the contiguous United States.\nFor instance, there are about 20\u201330 more days per year with a maximum\nover 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) in most areas by mid-century under RCP8.5, with\nincreases of 40\u201350 days in much of the Southeast (Figure 6.9). The\nupper bound for projected changes is very roughly 10 days greater\nthan the weighted multimodel mean. Consistent with widespread\nwarming, there are 20\u201330 fewer days per year with a minimum temperature\nbelow freezing in the northern and eastern parts of the nation,\nwith decreases of more than 40\u201350 days in much the West. The upper\nbound for projected changes in freezing events is very roughly 10\u201320\ndays fewer than the weighted multimodel mean in many areas.\nReferences\nModal\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n1800 G Street, NW, Suite 9100, Washington, DC 20006 USA\nTel: +1 202.223.6262 | Fax: +1 202.223.3065\nContact Us \u2022\nCredits \u2022\nPrivacy Policy \u2022\nSite Map\nSome figures and images are copyright protected.\nPermission of the copyright owner must be obtained\nbefore making use of copyrighted material."

The average temperature for October 2024 was recorded at around 11 degrees Celsius, compared to 11.9 degrees a year before. In the broader context of climate change, average monthly temperatures are indicative of where the national climate is headed and whether attempts to control global warming are successful.\u00a0\nSummer and winter\nAverage summer temperature in Germany fluctuated in recent years, generally between 18 to 19 degrees Celsius. The seasons remain generally warm, and while there may not be as many hot and sunny days as in other parts of Europe, heat waves have occurred. In fact, 2023 saw 11.5 days with a temperature of at least 30 degrees, though this was a decrease compared to the year before. Meanwhile, average winter temperatures also fluctuated, but were higher in recent years, rising over four degrees on average in 2024. Figures remained in the above zero range since 2011. Numbers therefore suggest that German winters are becoming warmer, even if individual regions experiencing colder sub-zero snaps or even more snowfall may disagree.\u00a0\nRain, rain, go away\nAverage monthly precipitation varied depending on the season, though sometimes figures from different times of the year were comparable. In 2024, the average monthly precipitation was highest in May and September, although rainfalls might increase in October and November with the beginning of the cold season. In the past, torrential rains have led to catastrophic flooding in Germany, with one of the most devastating being the flood of July 2021. Germany is not immune to the weather changing between two extremes, e.g. very warm spring months mostly without rain, when rain might be wished for, and then increased precipitation in other months where dry weather might be better, for example during planting and harvest seasons. Climate change remains on the agenda in all its far-reaching ways.\u00a0\n\n                        Average monthly temperature in Germany from October 2023 to October 2024 \n                    \n                            (in Celsius)\n                        \n\n                                    Additional Information\n                                \n\n                                Show sources information\n                            \n                                Show publisher information\n                            \n                                Use Ask Statista Research Service\n                            \nOctober 2024\nGermany\nOctober 2023 to October 2024\nFigures for the months preceding October 2024 were retrieved from previous report editions of the German Meteorological Service.According to the source, figures are preliminary.

      "First half of 2024: Renewable electricity generation continues to rise significantly  | Umweltbundesamt\nFirst half of 2024: Renewable electricity generation continues to rise significantly \nHeating and transport sectors remain almost unchanged \nCurrent figures from the German Environment Agency (UBA) for the first half of 2024 show that electricity generation from renewable energies increased by nine per cent compared to the same period last year. However, capacity expansion must be further accelerated to meet climate and energy targets. In the heating sector, mild weather led to lower demand for heating. In the mobility sector, the use of renewable electricity in transport increased slightly.\n\"It is a success that the renewable share of electricity continues to grow. At the same time, the growth figures make it clear that considerable efforts are still required. In the photovoltaic sector alone, we need an increase of around 50 per cent in order to meet the targets of the Renewable Energy Sources Act,\u201d says Dirk Messner, President of the German Environment Agency. \u201cPlanning reliability and careful further development of the subsidy mechanisms are important for success. In addition, distribution grid areas in which a particularly large number of renewable energy systems are connected should not be burdened further by rising grid fees.\u201d\nRenewables account for around 57 per cent of gross electricity econsumption\u2060 \u00a0 \nApproximately 147 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity were generated from renewable sources, representing an increase of about nine percent compared to the same period in the previous year (135 TWh). Two factors played a decisive role in this. Firstly, windy winter months and the addition of new plants led to a 10 per cent increase in wind power generation. In addition, the large increase in output in the photovoltaic (PV) sector led to an increase of 13 per cent compared to the same period of the previous year, despite the lack of sunshine. In the hydropower sector, rainy \u2060weather\u2060 led to an increase of 12 per cent. Over the entire first half of 2024, wind power generation accounted for the largest share of renewable electricity generation at around 51 per cent. Photovoltaics followed with 24 per cent, electricity generation from\u2060 biomass with around 15 per cent and hydropower with around 8 per cent of renewable electricity. As demand for electricity in the current year was roughly the same as in the previous year, the share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption rose significantly in the first half of 2024. According to calculations by the Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics (AGEE-Stat), the share was already around 57 per cent. A projection for the entirety of 2024 is not possible at this stage, as renewable electricity generation depends on weather conditions and the development of electricity consumption throughout the rest of the year. The increase in output in the first half of 2024 was once again heavily dominated by the expansion of PV. \u00a0For example, net additions in the first two quarters totalled 7.5 gigawatts (GW), while the addition of onshore wind energy systems only reached 0.9 GW. Around 0.4 GW of net new capacity was added to the installed capacity of offshore wind energy plants in the second quarter. With total installed capacity exceeding 88 GW, the 2024 expansion target for PV of 84 GW, as set by the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), has been achieved six months ahead of schedule. The installed capacity of onshore wind turbines currently stands at just under 62 GW, which means that the target of 69 GW set by the EEG in 2024 is unlikely to be reached\nDecline in renewable heat production \nTotal heat production from renewable sources amounted to 111 TWh in the first half of 2024. Compared to the first half of 2023, the heat provided from renewable sources fell by seven per cent overall. The main reason for this was warmer weather than in the same period of the previous year, which reduced the overall demand for heat. This decline was mitigated by an increase in the number of heat pumps. As a result of this dynamic growth in heat pumps, particularly as a result of installations in the second half of 2023, around 3.5 per cent more heat was generated from near-surface geothermal energy and environmental heat compared to the same period last year.\nHowever according to the latest reports from industry associations, sales of heat pumps have fallen sharply by around 50 per cent compared to the previous year. In order to achieve the German government\u2019s target of 500,000 installed heat pumps per year, this trend needs to be reversed. Three quarters of renewable heat still comes from biomass, around 6 per cent from biogenic waste and around 4 per cent from solar thermal systems.\nSlight increase in the transport sector \nIn the first half of the year, around 21.9 TWh from renewable sources was used in the transport sector. This is an increase of 3 per cent compared to the first half of 2023. Based on current information, the total amount of biofuels used was at the same level as in the first half of the previous year. In contrast, the use of renewable electricity in the transport sector increased by 16 per cent, as not only did the renewable share in the electricity sector grow, but so did the number of electrically powered vehicles. The amount of renewable electricity used in the transport sector corresponds to just under three per cent of the green electricity used in Germany.

The inflation adjustment factor for calendar-year 2024 is 1.9499. The 2024 reference price for facilities producing electricity from wind is 3.15 cents per kilowatt hour; because this price does not exceed the 8 cents multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor in IRC Section 45(b)(1), the phaseout of the credit under IRC Section 45(b)(1) does not apply for calendar 2024. Reference prices for facilities producing electricity from closed-loop biomass, open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, municipal solid waste, qualified hydropower production, and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy have not been determined for 2024.\nFor facilities placed in service before January 1, 2022, the PTC is:\nFor facilities placed in service on or after January 1, 2022, the PTC for electricity is 0.6 cents per kilowatt hour on the sale of electricity from all eligible technologies (3.0 cents if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met).\nImplications\nThe Inflation Reduction Act made life slightly more complicated as there are now two different PTC rates to track: a rate of 2.9 cents per kilowatt hour for older projects and a rate of 3.0 cents per kilowatt hour for newer projects (assuming the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met allowing for the 5X bonus). While these two numbers may often be the same, taxpayers will need to make sure they are using the right rate for their various projects in 2024.\nFor additional information concerning this Alert, please contact:\nTax Credit Investment Advisory Services\nThe information contained herein is general in nature and is not intended, and should not be construed, as legal, accounting or tax advice or opinion provided by Ernst & Young LLP to the reader.

      "Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of March 2024 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $16.2 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 593 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $11.1 billion has been announced for transportation \u2013 to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports \u2013 and roughly $995 million has been announced for clean water and water infrastructure. Florida received $2.1 billion to connect everyone in the state to reliable high-speed internet and, as of today, more than 1,708,000 Florida households are already saving on their monthly internet bill due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida \u2013 including rural communities and historically underserved populations \u2013 the law makes critical investments that will improve the lives of Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $8.5 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $7.7 billion in highway formula funding and $158 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges to date. o $117.1 million through the RAISE program to date. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $207 million through the INFRA program to date. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet over 272,962 homes and small businesses in Florida do not have access to high-speed internet infrastructure. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to everyone in America. The Biden-Harris Administration worked with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. Now, the Biden-Harris Administration is calling on Congress to extend this program through 2024. Without action from Congress, millions of Americans will lose their internet connection and the economic opportunities that come with it. See ACP enrollment for every state and territory here. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received $2.1 billion for high-speed internet. Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program to provide access to high-speed internet to everyone in Florida. Florida also received $2.8 million in funding to expand middle-mile infrastructure in the state. In addition, about 1,708,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in water infrastructure in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $995 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $995 million available to date to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $229.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation and 19% of transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $1.3 billion to improve public transportation options across the state. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Announced funding to date will double the number of clean transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Schools in Florida have been awarded $45 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. Communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $113.7 million has been announced in Florida to date to build out a network of EV chargers in the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy about $150 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $392.4 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power. This includes: o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; o $162.8 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received approximately $1 billion for airports. Ports and Waterways: Our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received roughly $128.3 million for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $24.9 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $1.5 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience, including $51.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $123 million has been allocated to cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites. Approximately $25 million has been allocated to Florida for capping orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaiming abandoned mine lands.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nSeptember 2024 Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks\n\nNOAA and its partners have released the latest Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks, which recap summer conditions and provide insight into what might be expected this fall.\nSummer Temperature Recap\nThe meteorological summer (June\u2013August) average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 73.8\u00b0F, 2.5\u00b0F above average, which is the fourth-warmest summer in the 130-year record. Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.The Alaska summer temperature was 51.7\u00b0F, 1.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.For the January\u2013August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9\u00b0F, 3.0\u00b0F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January\u2013August period on record.\nThe Alaska January\u2013August temperature was 31.2\u00b0F, 2.4\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June\u2013August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.For summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.The January\u2013August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January\u2013August period.The January\u2013August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month\u2019s consolidation.\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October. Precipitation consolidation guidance has trended wetter across the northern tier of the CONUS, resulting in an expansion of elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the northern High Plains and Great Lakes relative to last month. Above-normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska.\u00a0\n\n\nImpacts and Outlooks for Your Region\nMap of the United States depicting the Seasonal Precipitation Outlook for October\u2013December 2024.\u00a0\nCreating These Quarterly Summaries\u00a0\nNOAA\u2019s Regional Climate Services lead the production of these quarterly summaries of climate impacts and outlooks for various regions of the United States as well as parts of Canada along the border.

This includes: o $5.1 billion in highway formula funding and $105.3 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges in 2022 and 2023. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 o $117.1 million through the RAISE program and $27 million through the INFRA program in 2022 and 2023. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet nearly 22% of Floridians do not have an internet subscription. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to every American. Additionally, experts estimate that as many as 3,283,000 households in Florida are eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which cuts internet bills by up to $30 per month, or $75 for households on Tribal lands, and provides a one-time $100 discount off a connected device. The Biden-Harris Administration is providing further cost savings by working with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. \u25cf Progress to date: To date, Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) to help provide access to high-speed internet across the state. In addition, about 1,389,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program, with more signing up every day. Households can check their eligibility, sign up, and find fully covered internet plans at GetInternet.gov. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, $800 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $800 million available in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $146.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 more likely to commute via public transportation and 20% transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has been allocated $529.4 million to improve public transportation options across the state in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This year alone, funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help double the number of clean public transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, schools in Florida have been awarded $11.8 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. In addition, communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $71.5 million in 2022 and 2023 to build out a network of EV chargers across the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy more than $70 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $168.5 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power in 2022 and 2023. This includes: Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; and o $31.5 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Additional grid funding will be made available in the coming months. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received approximately $658.6 million in 2022 and 2023 for airports. Ports and Waterways: Like airports, our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received roughly $143.6 million in 2022 and 2023 for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $43.2 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $1.4 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience in 2022 and 2023 including $32.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $120.4 million has been allocated to cleaning up brownfield sites in Florida.

In the North Sea, fish have been comprehensively monitored throughout this period and resulting data provide a unique record of changes in distribution and abundance in response to climate change2,3. We use these data to demonstrate the remarkable power of generalized additive models (GAMs), trained on data earlier in the time series, to reliably predict trends in distribution and abundance in later years. Then, challenging process-based models that predict substantial and ongoing poleward shifts of cold-water species4,5, we find that GAMs coupled with climate projections predict future distributions of demersal (bottom-dwelling) fish species over the next 50 years will be strongly constrained by availability of habitat of suitable depth. This will lead to pronounced changes in community structure, species interactions and commercial fisheries, unless individual acclimation or population-level evolutionary adaptations enable fish to tolerate warmer conditions or move to previously uninhabitable locations.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\n        Receive 12 print issues and online access\n      \n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nShifting fish distributions in warming sub-Arctic oceans\n                                        \n\n\nFuture trends of marine fish biomass distributions from the North Sea to the Barents Sea\n                                        \n\n\nMarine fish traits follow fast-slow continuum across oceans\n                                        \n\nReferences\nSherman, K. & Hempel, G.

INTRODUCTION The dynamics of marine fish populations are typi-cally categorized as regulated primarily by top-down processes (i.e. predation) or by bottom-up processes (i.e. resource production) (Wollrab et al. 2012, Heath et al. 2014, Vinueza et al. 2014). For example, fish population dynamics in the North Sea were long thought to be driven by bottom-up processes (Lynam et al. 2017). In bottom-up regulated systems, the lowest-level driver is formed by abiotic factors (e.g.\ntemperature, salinity, etc.) and their influence on plankton biomass. The available plankton biomass in turn leads to cascades upwards through the food web (Gregory et al. 2009, Kirby & Beaugrand 2009, Olsen et al. 2011). Top-down interactions, represented by predation pressure from predators and fisheries ex -ploitation, have also been shown to have a large impact on the dynamics of several North Sea fish populations (Fauchald et al. 2011, Engelhard et al.\n2014). Furthermore, the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes in the North Sea eco-system can give rise to highly complex and non-linear dynamics in fish populations (Lynam et al.\n\u00a9 The authors 2021.

Smallegange2, Anieke van Leeuwen1 1NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, Department of Coastal Systems, and Utrecht University, 1797 SZ Texel, The Netherlands 2Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, 1012 WX Amsterdam, The Netherlands ABSTRACT: Distinct areas of seabed, called seascapes, are known to shape benthic habitats and communities, yet little is known about the extent to which they affect the dynamics of marine fish populations. We explored the relationship between seascapes and trends in the biomass density of several North Sea fish species. We divided the North Sea into 10 seascapes using standardized methods. Time series of fish biomass density were derived from the North Sea International Bottom-Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) and aggregated to the seascape level. We analysed the inter -dependencies between these time series using a causal association network and found independ-ent biomass density trends between adjacent seascapes at a time interval of 0 yr in all species as -sessed. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density occurred at time lags of 1\u22122 yr across different gradients of exchange: (1) both directions from North to South; (2) unidirectional, North\u2212South; (3) unidirectional, South\u2212North; (4) unidirectional, East\u2212West; and (5) no clear direc-tion. Our findings indicate that the separation in (a)biotic conditions between North Sea seascapes can represent relevant barriers to the processes determining the observed fish biomass density.\nWe found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat preferences best explained short-term causal dependencies. This combination is particular to the flatfish and ray species included in the present study. Contrarily, the movement of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species best explained long-term causal dependencies. Our work highlights how causal association networks can be used to study the temporal dependencies between spatial time series in ecology.\nKEY WORDS: IBTS \u00b7 International Bottom-Trawl Survey \u00b7 PCMCI \u00b7 Seascapes \u00b7 Spatiotemporal analysis \u00b7 Time series \u00b7 Bottom-trawl OPEN PEN ACCESS CCESS Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 2017). To attain a better understanding of the com-plexity emerging from such interactions, it is impor-tant to have a complete overview of the bottom-up and top-down processes acting upon fish populations in the North Sea.\nOne potentially important bottom-up process that is often overlooked in regulating fish populations is seabed morphology. Physically distinct areas of sea -bed, also called seascapes, can act as a bottom-up controlling mechanism by shaping abiotic conditions, leading to the formation of different types of benthic habitat and associated species assemblages (Harris & Baker 2012). Due to the strong link between seabed morphology and community structure of benthic in -vertebrates (Beaman et al. 2005, Kaskela et al. 2017), seascapes are often used as a proxy for mapping marine benthic habitats (Kostylev et al. 2001, Brown & Collier 2008). Yet, we know little about the extent to which seascapes affect the dynamics of fish popu-lations, despite the fact that the few case studies available show it could help explain the spatial dis-tribution of fish resources (Pittman & Brown 2011, Getsiv-Clemons et al. 2012). Recent research revealed that the central and lower part of the North Sea com-prises 8 distinct seascapes excluding the coastal zone (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018), and that these were selectively targeted by commercial fishing vessels.\nAlthough this preferential selection provides some indirect link to the availability and distribution of fish resources, a more complete study exploring the rela-tionship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish is missing. If seascapes are important, this changes the commonly held perspec-tive on the types of bottom-up processes affecting North Sea fish populations.\nTo understand the relationship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish, we in -vestigated the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes. We hypothesized that if seascapes are not related to trends in fish pop-ulations in the North Sea, biomass densities in sepa-rate seascapes will be directly dependent on each other. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the \u2018borders\u2019 between separate seascapes being dif-fuse, i.e. not relevant, to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed. In contrast, if seascapes define distinct abiotic environments that are important for the distribution of fish populations, we expect biomass densities in different seascapes to be unrelated to each other, although they can still be related across longer time lags. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the separation in conditions between seascapes representing relevant barriers to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed.\nTo examine the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes, we used a re cently developed causal association network ap -proach (Runge et al. 2019a). The advantage of this data-driven method is that it learns causal associa-tions at various time lags directly from aggregated sets of time series, rather than establishing causality through computer simulation experiments on correl-ative relationships found in observational data (Runge et al. 2019b). As such, our study also tests a new ap -proach to examine intraspecific dependencies in the biomass trends of North Sea fish.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study area The North Sea is a semi-enclosed shelf extending from 4\u00b0 W and 62\u00b0 N (Fig. 1a) (Daan et al. 2005). In this study, we focussed on the region that includes International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) statistical rectangles 4a, b and c. We excluded the Norwegian trench, the Skagerrak and the waters south of the English Channel, as their distinctiveness is well recognized (Bergstad 1990, ICES 2018). Ex -tending the method of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018), we derived 10 separate seascapes (Fig. 1b). These seascapes were identified based on the weighted sum of 5 bathymetry positioning indices (BPIs), which express the depth of a pixel relative to the depth of its surroundings. The specific weighted-sum BPI used (Eq. 1) highlights large-scale patterns in seabed mor-phology and is strongly linked to benthic communities (Reiss et al. 2010). A full description of the weighted BPI can be found in van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018).\nBPI 75 km + (0.9 \u00d7 BPI 50 km) + (0.8 \u00d7 BPI 30 km) + (0.7 \u00d7 BPI 10 km) + (0.6 \u00d7 BPI 5 km) (1) 2.2. Data preparation We extracted data on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 9 species of fish collected in the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) from 1978 to 2019 (ICES 2019) (Table 1). We chose 1978 as the starting year of the time series as all seascapes were systematically sampled within the NS-IBTS from this year onward. The 9 selected species cov-ered a variety of different life history strategies and 130 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed had sufficient positive catch data available in all sea-scapes across selected years. To minimize bias from potential variability in sampling gear and timing, we only included observations that had been sampled in the same quarter of the year and using the GOV trawl. Next, we determined in which seascape each haul was performed based on the shoot longitude and latitude. We estimated the biomass in kg for a given species for each haul by multiplying the num-ber of individuals of a given length class by their length\u2212weight relationship, as derived from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019), and summing over all length classes present in the haul. We then aggregated the data to a single time series per seascape and species, representing the average biomass in kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121.\nWe refer to this metric as biomass density.\n2.3.

Fish species, records and length to weight conversion used in the study. All length\u2212weight (L\u2212W) relationships were taken directly from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019). Slight differences in the number of filtered (unique) hauls between spe-cies originate from small differences in the raw North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey CPUE-length-per-hour datasets pulled from the ICES/DATRAS online database (ICES 2019) for each species (mean \u00b1 SD:13 667.2 \u00b1 104.9 filtered hauls, range 13 430\u221213 760 filtered hauls) Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 dependencies in fish biomass density between sea-scapes. If seascapes are not related to fish popula-tions in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities between separate seascapes are causally related to each other at the time interval of zero. Contrarily, if seascapes are related to fish populations in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities in separate seascapes are independent of each other at the time interval of zero, although they can be causally dependent across longer time scales.\nWe applied a causal association network approach recently developed by Runge et al. (2019a), to evalu-ate the underlying causal dependency structure be -tween the fish biomass density time series from dif-ferent seascapes (Fig. 2). The linear and non-linear time-lagged dependencies between sets of time series can cause inflated or spurious associations to be included when analysing their interdependence (Pearl 2009). These need to be accounted for in order to arrive at an approximation of the \u2018true\u2019 underlying dependency structure. The causal association net-work utilizes the PCMCI algorithm, as implemented in the package \u2018TIGRAMITE\u2019 in Python (Runge 2019), that arrives at a solution of the underlying depend-ency structure through iterative conditional inde-pendence testing. Internally, the PCMCI algorithm takes 2 processing steps. First, given a set of time se-ries, the PC1 algorithm constructs a graphical model in which all time series and their time-lagged compo-nents form separate nodes. For each of these nodes or time series variables, the PC1 algorithm then identi-fies all relevant conditions or \u2018preliminary parents\u2019 in the set , through iterative con-ditional independence testing. This conditional de-pendence can be interpreted as the relation between time series variables 1 and 2, after accounting for the relations existing between all time series variables within the set. The time series variables with signifi-cant relations to the focal time series after accounting for all relationships in the set form the preliminary parents of that focal time series. This first step reduces dimensionality, i.e. it identifies all relevant connections in the graph for a given time series vari-able and a first estimation of their strength, and will thereby increase the detection power for underlying causal relations. In the second step, the MCI algo-rithm addresses the false positives, i.e. spurious or inflated links found between the time series variables.\nIt does so by repeating the iterative conditional inde-pendence tests, but now conditioning on both the preliminary parents of and the time-shifted parents of (Runge et al. 2019b). Thus the graphi-cal model contains the focal time series variable, its preliminary parents and their preliminary parents.\nThis second step is therefore well suited to identifying spurious or in flated relationships originating from common drivers. Those time series variables with sig-nificant relations to the focal time series variable after this second iterative testing phase are included in the final causal association network. The final causal association network thus represents the algorithm\u2019s approximation of the underlying causal dependency structure existing between the set of time series.\nOur time series covered 42 yr, which is extensive in ecology, but relatively limited in data science. We therefore used the linear partial correlation test, a maximum time lag of 2 yr, and let the PC1 algorithm choose the optimal \u03b1 level for condition selection. As the linear partial correlation test is sensitive to out-liers, we applied a 95% winsorization to the data prior to analysis (Reifman & Keyton 2010). Confi-dence intervals were generated using bootstrapping, and inferences on the conditional dependence be -,..., 1 X X X t j t t N { } \u03b5 \u02c6 P Xt j ( ) Xt j Xt i \u2212\u03c4 132 Fig. 2. (a) Each of the 10 seascapes (green circles) has (b) an associated time series of fish biomass density, e.g. S1\u2212S4, of which we estimate the underlying causal dependency structure in (c) a causal association network. Common drivers and in direct ef-fects can yield spurious associations that are accounted for in our approach. The dots in panel b represent observed biomass density values, the blue line is a fitted trend with 95% confidence bounds indicated in gray shading. Figure adapted from Runge et al. (2019a) Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed tween time series were made using a shuffle test with 3000 trials. We further corrected the results for the total number of pairwise tests performed by ap -plying the false discovery rate procedure of Benja -mini & Hochberg (1995). The final causal association network included those links between time series significant at an \u03b1 level of 0.05. If links occurred between 2 time series at multiple lags, the strongest link was included in the network. Rather than print-ing the full causal association network found for each species, which would result in a cluttered and un -clear overview, we report the results as follows: (1) For each species, we report the number of seascapes with biomass density trends independent of their adjacent seascapes at time lag zero. This provides a link back to our initial hypothesis that the contrasting conditions in seascapes are reflected in contrasting biomass density trends. (2) We produce a species-specific map where relationships at time lag zero are indicated by the borders between adjacent seascapes, and relationships over longer time lags between all seascapes are indicated by arrows.\n2.3.2. Post-hoc test to link life histories to causal relationships We conducted a post-hoc test to better understand the variables driving the observed dependencies in biomass density between seascapes at different time lags. More specifically, we used a random forest clas-sifier (RFC) model to predict the presence of causal relationships between seascapes based on a set of 17 variables pertaining to life history, the biomass den-sity of different life stages and environmental condi-tions (see Table S1 in the Supplement at www. int-res. com/ articles/ suppl/ m677 p129 _ supp .pdf).\n2.3.3. Variable collection We extracted 9 features related to life-history strate-gies from the marine fish trait database of Beukhof et al. (2019). Next, for every year and seascape combi-nation, we calculated the absolute dif ference in bio-mass density of small and large size classes in the juvenile and adult life stages. To do this, we first determined the length at maturation to split the IBTS data between adult and juvenile biomass density.\nNext, for each of these groups, we made an equal split between the 50% largest and 50% smallest individuals in terms of length. We then aggregated the data into a single data frame listing the biomass density of the 4 groups (small juveniles, large juve-niles, small adults, large adults) in each haul. Next, we computed the mean biomass density of each group per haul per year. Finally, we calculated the difference in mean biomass density per haul per year between different seascapes for each group. This dataframe was combined with the life-history trait dataframe to produce the final feature dataset for training. As there was a class imbalance in the label data between the number of samples with and with-out causal lag, we used a cost-sensitive learning ap -proach and weighted the classes according to their representation in the dataset (Weiss et al. 2007).\n2.3.4. Model training and performance We further optimised hyperparameters of the RFC through a grid search on the maximum depth, mini-mum samples per split, minimum samples per leaf and the number of trees. The final RFC model with causal lag zero as the label feature included 300 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits, a minimum 10 samples per leaf and split. The final RFC model with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature consisted of 500 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits and a minimum of 10 samples per leaf and 15 per split.\nBefore training, we split 50% of the data into a vali-dation set, and, during training, we used stratified K-fold cross validation with 5 splits (Refaeilzadeh et al.\n2009). We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values and a confusion matrix, from which we could calculate recall and pre-cision, to evaluate model performance. The model was run twice, once with causal lag zero as the label feature, and once with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature. The model performed well on the validation set in both runs, with an AUC of 98.0 and 98.2%, a recall of 95.2 and 97.1% and precision of 93.0 and 91.6%, respectively. This is further illustrated in the confusion matrixes in Fig. S1.\n2.3.5. Variable importance We calculated the importance of each of the 17 variables in predicting the presence of a causal de - pendency between seascapes at various time lags using the \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 function in the \u2018SHAP\u2019 pack-age (Lundberg et al. 2020). \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 is based on game theory and approximates Shapley values to compute the contribution of a target variable to the predicted output of tree-based machine learning 133 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 models (Shapley 1953, Lundberg & Lee 2017). It does so by re-running model predictions on the test data-set using all different combinations between vari-ables excluding the target variable, and then repeats this process, now including the target variable. The algorithm then computes the contribution of the tar-get variable based on the average difference in pre-dicted outcomes (Molnar 2020).\n3. RESULTS 3.1. Causal associations The final causal association networks of all 9 spe-cies indicated the existence of independent trends in fish biomass between adjacent seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr. The mean number of seascapes with bio-mass density trends that were independent of adja-cent seascapes at a time lag of zero was 4.7 \u00b1 2.4 SD.\nThis level of independence in biomass density trends at a time lag of zero was highest for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua (8 out of 10 seascapes), European plaice Pleuronectes platessa (7 out of 10 seascapes) and Atlantic herring Clupea harengus (7 out of 10 sea -scapes). It was lowest for starry ray Amblyraja radi-ata (1 out of 10 seascapes) and dragonet Callionymus lyra (2 out of 10 seascapes). This result was inter-preted as the separation between seascapes repre-senting relevant barriers to the processes determin-ing the observed biomass density of Atlantic cod, European plaice and Atlantic herring, but not to those of the starry ray and dragonet. In the remaining 4 species, independence in fish biomass density trends be tween adjacent sites at a time lag of zero ranged be tween 3 and 6 out of 10 seascapes. In these cases, only certain seascapes represented relevant borders to the processes determining the ob -served biomass density, whereas the biomass density trends were directly dependent on each other in the re -maining ad jacent seascapes. An addi-tional type of relationship observed was a temporal dependency at a time lag of zero be tween non-adjacent sea-scapes (Table 2).\nSpecies could be further subdivided based on the level of causal depend-encies in biomass density trends be -tween seascapes at longer time lags of 1\u22122 yr, and the directional gradient in these dynamics. Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting Merlangius merlangus and starry ray were characterized by time-lagged causal dependencies be tween distant seascapes in both directions along the North\u2212South gradient (Fig. 3). In grey gurnard Eu trigla gurnardus and At -lantic herring, exchanges were predominantly uni-directional from South to North (Fig. 4a,b). In drag-onet, ex changes occurred from East to West and from North to South (Fig. 4c). Finally, there was only a sin-gle time-lagged ex change in European sprat Sprat-tus sprattus (Fig. 5a), and no time-lagged ex changes in common dab Limanda limanda (Fig. 5b).\n3.2. Post-hoc test The RFC found that species with a non-fusiform body type, that are strictly demersal, with low to inter-mediate fecundity and maximum age, were most im -portant in predicting the presence of a causal relation-ship between seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr (Fig. 6a).\nThis is opposite to those variables best explaining longer-term causal dependencies at time lags of 1\u2212 2 yr (Fig. 6b). In that case, long-lived, benthopelagic species of large maximum size best predict the pres-ence of causal relationships between seascapes. Fur-thermore, the probability of long-term causal depend-encies between seascapes was positively impacted by small differences in juvenile biomass density and negatively impacted by large differences.\n4. DISCUSSION We found evidence for relationships between the spatial organisation of the seabed structure, i.e. sea-scapes, and population trends of several fish species in the North Sea. The relationship was expressed as 134 S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7 S8 S9 S10 S1 P, E A L, Cl P L, M Cl G, A, L S2 E G, L S P S3 A, Cl E S, Cl S4 E P, S L G S5 S6 L L, A, Cl E, A, Cl S7 M, Cl S8 S9 S10 Table 2.

This finding provides the insight that seascapes can function as a bottom-up driver of North Sea fish population dynamics. However, a con-siderable level of caution is warranted in interpreting 135 Fig. 3. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes for (a) Atlantic cod, (b) whiting, (c) starry ray and (d) European plaice. In all 4 species, time-lagged exchanges occur predominantly in both directions between more northern and southern seascapes. Arrow colour and width represent the type and strength of the relationship (red = positive, blue = negative, thin = weak, thick = strong) between different areas. The associated time-lag is listed on the arrow, and if a contemporaneous relationship was present, the border between the areas was removed Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 the results, as the relative standard error in estimated biomass density over time frequently exceeded 30% for species and seascape combinations (Table S2).\nWe further found both positive and negative causal dependencies between seascapes at time lags of 1\u22122 yr in most species. Species such as Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting and starry ray dis-played clear directional gradients in these longer-term dependencies along a North\u2212South gradient.\nPositive long-term dependencies can potentially be explained by both movement of adult biomass to, and recruitment of juvenile biomass in, the depend-ent seascapes. Negative long-term dependencies cannot be explained by the process of recruitment.\nHowever, they can still be explained by movement of biomass away from a dependent seascape to sur-136 Fig. 4. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. In (a) grey gurnard and (b) Atlantic herring, a few time-lagged exchanges occur from southern to northern seascapes, whereas in (c) drago -net, exchanges went from northern to southern and eastern to western seascapes. Other details as in Fig. 3 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed rounding areas following accumulation of biomass in the driving seascape. The dependent seascape could in this case be considered suboptimal, and the driv-ing seascape more optimal. This would be the in -verse process of that described by the basin model theory (McCall 1990), in which there is adult move-ment away from optimal basins, or seascapes in this case, to suboptimal surrounding basins following the buildup of biomass in the former (Bertrand et al. 2008, Hintzen et al. 2014).\nOur post-hoc test provided a deeper understanding of the ecological meaning of the observed depend-encies at different time lags. We found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat prefer-ences best explained short-term causal dependencies.\nThis combination is particular to the flatfish and ray included in the present study. This might be due to multiple factors. Flatfish such as European plaice ex -hibit more restricted movement patterns and stronger selection of small-scale variations in sediment type compared to benthopelagic species such as Atlantic cod (Gibson & Robb 2000, Hinz et al. 2006, Griffiths et al. 2018). Therefore, smaller-scale processes than those delineated by the seascapes might be more important in these species at the 0 yr time lag. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density be -tween seascapes were best explained by the adults of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species. In these species, the recruitment of juveniles is unlikely to drive the observed dynamics because differences in juvenile biomass negatively affected the probability of long-term causal dependencies.\nIn this study, we also addressed a missing link be -tween seascape-specific fisheries activities in the North Sea (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018) and the bio-mass of harvested stocks. van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018, their Fig. 3) showed fishing intensity with a beam trawl to target plaice was highest in seascapes 10 and 7, and the northern part of seascape 6, while otter-mix fishing was highest in the centre of seascape 9 and along the northern and southern borders of sea-scape 8. If these fishing activities affect the distribu-tion of fish biomass, we might have expected to see some effect of this in the post-hoc test. An example would be that short-term ex changes in (adult) bio-mass between intensively and less intensively fished adjacent seascapes are important in explaining the observed causal dependencies. However, no specific combination of seascape pairs was found to be im -portant in explaining the ob served dependencies.\nAlthough it might be tentative to place an explicit link between seascape-specific fisheries activities and exchanges in fish biomass, separate quantitative analysis, including North Sea-wide fishing intensity, 137 Fig. 5. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. (a) In European sprat, there is a single time-lagged exchange and (b) in common dab, there is no time-lagged exchange; both species therefore lack a clear gradient of exchange. Other details as in Fig. 3 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 would be required to provide more conclusive evi-dence. The study of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018) was based on Dutch fishing fleet data. Consequently, sea-scapes that are assumed to be free from high fishing pressure, based on Dutch data, might turn out to be intensively used by the fleets of other nations.\nThe methodological novelty of our study lies in the application of a causal association network for hypo -thesis testing using ecological time series. These types of data are typical of long-term monitoring programmes, and causal association networks there-fore have a potentially wide applica-bility in ecology. The advantage of this specific causality-based approach is that it explicitly accounts for in -flated or spurious correlations be -tween time series (Pearl 2009). Using a method that accounts for this con-founding effect differentiates our work from other, recent research examin-ing dependencies between time series of fish populations and the environ-ment. For example, Milligan et al.\n(2020) examined time-lagged depend-encies between resource productiv-ity and abundances in deep-sea fish using additive models in combination with cross-correlation analysis. Addi-tive models are a popular tool in ecol-ogy because they can include the effects of categorical and continuous covariates in fitting statistical trends to population time series (Zuur et al.\n2017, Pedersen et al. 2019). Cross-correlating such fitted statistical trends to extract time-lagged dependencies increases the risk of finding spurious relationships inherent to time series analysis (Yule 1926, Olden & Neff 2001, Runge et al. 2014). Although causal association networks explicitly account for this confounding effect, they are not able to include both cat-egorical and continuous covariates a priori. Additional insights can be gained indirectly through post-hoc testing as was done in the present study. However, this approach does not provide the explanatory power on the effects of environmental covariates that additive modelling provides. Therefore, a decision on which combination of methods to apply in future ecological 138 Fig. 6.

The presence of causal dependencies between seascapes was best explained by different types of life history traits at different time lags. In a qualitative comparison with previous research, we did not find a clear link be -tween seascape-specific fishery activities and bio-mass trends. Finally, the suitability of using causal association networks to model spatial time series in ecology will depend both on the types of effects a researcher wants to include and the need to model time-lagged dependencies.\nAcknowledgements.

What is budget trend analysis and why is it important?\nbudget trend analysis is a method of examining the past and future performance of a budget by comparing actual results with planned or projected ones. It can help identify the causes and effects of changes in the budget over time, as well as the opportunities and challenges for improvement. Budget trend analysis is important for several reasons, such as:\n1. It can help monitor and evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of budget allocation and spending. By analyzing the trends of revenues and expenditures, one can assess whether the budget is aligned with the strategic goals and objectives of the organization or project, and whether the resources are used optimally and appropriately.\n2. It can help forecast and plan for future budget needs and adjustments. By analyzing the trends of external and internal factors that affect the budget, such as inflation, market demand, customer behavior, competitor actions, regulatory changes, etc., one can anticipate the potential impacts and risks on the budget, and prepare contingency plans or corrective actions accordingly.\n3. It can help communicate and justify the budget decisions and results to stakeholders. By analyzing the trends of key performance indicators (KPIs) and benchmarks, such as return on investment (ROI), cost-benefit analysis (CBA), variance analysis, etc., one can demonstrate the value and impact of the budget, and explain the reasons and rationale behind the budget choices and outcomes.\nFor example, suppose a company wants to analyze its budget trend for the past three years and project its budget for the next year. It can use the following steps:\n- Collect and organize the historical and projected data of the budget, such as revenues, expenses, profits, etc., for each year, quarter, month, or other period of interest.\n- Calculate and compare the percentage changes, growth rates, averages, ratios, and other metrics of the budget data, and identify the patterns and variations of the budget over time.\n- analyze the causes and effects of the budget changes, and evaluate the performance and progress of the budget against the planned or expected targets and standards.\n- identify the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats, and challenges and solutions of the budget, and formulate recommendations and action plans for improvement.\n- Present and report the budget trend analysis results and findings, using charts, graphs, tables, and other visual aids, and highlight the key insights and implications for the budget decision-making and management.\n2. How to collect and prepare historical and projected data for budget trend analysis?\nOne of the most important steps in budget trend analysis is to collect and prepare the data that will be used to identify and explain the budget patterns and changes over time. The data sources and methods for this task may vary depending on the scope, purpose, and context of the analysis. However, some general principles and best practices can be followed to ensure the quality and reliability of the data. In this section, we will discuss how to select, obtain, and process historical and projected data for budget trend analysis. We will also provide some examples of data sources and methods that can be used for different types of budget analysis.\nThe following are some of the main aspects to consider when collecting and preparing data for budget trend analysis:\n1. Data selection: The first step is to determine what kind of data is needed for the analysis. This depends on the level of detail, the time period, and the budget categories that are of interest. For example, if the analysis aims to compare the budget allocations of different departments or programs, then the data should include the breakdown of the budget by these categories. If the analysis focuses on the changes in the budget over time, then the data should cover a sufficiently long time period to capture the trends and fluctuations. Some possible data sources for budget data are:\n- Official budget documents: These are the official records of the budget approved by the government or the legislature. They usually provide the most comprehensive and authoritative information on the budget, but they may not be easily accessible or updated.\n- Budget databases: These are online platforms that store and display budget data in a user-friendly format. They may offer more flexibility and functionality than budget documents, such as allowing users to download, filter, and visualize the data. However, they may not have the same level of detail or accuracy as budget documents.\n- Budget reports: These are publications that analyze and summarize the budget data and provide additional information and insights. They may be produced by the government, civil society organizations, or research institutions. They can be useful for understanding the context and rationale behind the budget decisions, but they may not have the same level of objectivity or completeness as budget documents or databases.\n2. Data acquisition: The next step is to obtain the data from the selected sources. This may involve different methods depending on the availability and format of the data. For example, if the data is available online, then it can be downloaded or scraped from the website. If the data is in a PDF or an image file, then it may need to be converted or extracted using optical character recognition (OCR) or other tools. If the data is not available online, then it may need to be requested from the data provider or obtained from other sources. Some possible methods for data acquisition are:\n- Downloading: This is the simplest and fastest method for obtaining data that is available online in a downloadable format, such as Excel, CSV, or JSON. It involves saving the data file to the local computer or a cloud storage service.\n- Scraping: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but not in a downloadable format, such as HTML, XML, or JavaScript. It involves writing a script or using a tool that can extract the data from the web page and save it in a structured format.\n- Converting: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but in a non-machine-readable format, such as PDF or image. It involves using a tool that can convert the data into a machine-readable format, such as Excel, CSV, or JSON.\n- Extracting: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but in a partially machine-readable format, such as PDF or image with tables or charts. It involves using a tool that can extract the data from the tables or charts and save it in a structured format.\n- Requesting: This is a method for obtaining data that is not available online or in a machine-readable format, such as paper documents or proprietary formats. It involves contacting the data provider and requesting the data in a suitable format.\n- Obtaining: This is a method for obtaining data that is not available from the original source or in a suitable format, such as unofficial or alternative sources. It involves finding and accessing the data from other sources, such as third-party websites, media reports, or personal contacts.\n3. Data processing: The final step is to prepare the data for the analysis. This may involve different tasks depending on the quality and consistency of the data. For example, if the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated, then it may need to be verified, corrected, or updated. If the data is inconsistent, incompatible, or incomparable, then it may need to be harmonized, standardized, or normalized. If the data is too complex, large, or noisy, then it may need to be simplified, aggregated, or filtered. Some possible tasks for data processing are:\n- Verifying: This is a task for ensuring the validity and reliability of the data. It involves checking the data for errors, inconsistencies, or anomalies, and comparing the data with other sources or references.\n- Correcting: This is a task for improving the accuracy and completeness of the data. It involves fixing the errors, inconsistencies, or anomalies in the data, and filling the gaps or missing values in the data.\n- Updating: This is a task for enhancing the timeliness and relevance of the data. It involves adding the latest or most recent data to the existing data, and removing the outdated or obsolete data from the existing data.\n- Harmonizing: This is a task for ensuring the compatibility and comparability of the data. It involves aligning the data with a common definition, classification, or format, and resolving the differences or discrepancies in the data.\n- Standardizing: This is a task for ensuring the consistency and uniformity of the data. It involves applying a common rule, method, or procedure to the data, and converting the data into a common unit, scale, or measure.\n- Normalizing: This is a task for ensuring the fairness and equity of the data. It involves adjusting the data for the effects of external factors, such as inflation, population, or geography, and expressing the data in relative terms, such as percentages, ratios, or indexes.\n- Simplifying: This is a task for reducing the complexity and size of the data. It involves summarizing the data with descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, range, or standard deviation, and grouping the data into categories, clusters, or segments.\n- Aggregating: This is a task for increasing the level of detail and granularity of the data. It involves combining the data from multiple sources, dimensions, or variables, and calculating the total, average, or other aggregate functions for the data.\n- Filtering: This is a task for removing the noise and irrelevance from the data. It involves selecting the data that meets certain criteria, conditions, or thresholds, and excluding the data that does not meet them.\nBy following these steps, the data can be collected and prepared for budget trend analysis. The data sources and methods may vary depending on the specific needs and objectives of the analysis, but the general principles and best practices can be applied to any type of budget data. The quality and reliability of the data can have a significant impact on the results and conclusions of the analysis, so it is important to ensure that the data is valid, accurate, complete, consistent, compatible, comparable, fair, and relevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to collect and prepare historical and projected data for budget trend analysis - Budget trend analysis: How to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes\n3. How to define and measure the key aspects of your budget performance and goals?\nBudget performance\nPerformance Against Goals\nOne of the most important steps in budget trend analysis is to identify the budget categories and indicators that will help you track and evaluate your budget performance and goals. Budget categories are the broad groups of expenses or revenues that you want to analyze, such as personnel, supplies, utilities, sales, grants, etc. Budget indicators are the specific metrics or ratios that you want to measure, such as spending per employee, revenue growth rate, profit margin, etc. By defining and measuring these key aspects of your budget, you can gain insights into your budget patterns and changes over time, and compare them with your targets or benchmarks. In this section, we will discuss how to choose the appropriate budget categories and indicators for your budget trend analysis, and how to use them effectively. Here are some tips and examples to guide you:\n1. Choose budget categories that are relevant and meaningful for your organization or project. Depending on the size, scope, and nature of your budget, you may have different levels of budget categories, such as major, minor, or sub-categories. For example, a large corporation may have major categories such as operating expenses, capital expenditures, and income taxes, and minor categories such as marketing, research and development, and interest payments. A small nonprofit organization may have major categories such as program expenses, administrative expenses, and fundraising expenses, and minor categories such as salaries, travel, and rent. You should choose budget categories that reflect the main sources and uses of your funds, and that align with your strategic goals and objectives.\n2. Choose budget indicators that are relevant and measurable for your budget categories. Budget indicators are the numerical values that you use to assess your budget performance and goals. They can be absolute numbers, such as total revenue or total expenses, or relative numbers, such as percentages, ratios, or averages. You should choose budget indicators that are meaningful and informative for your budget categories, and that can be easily calculated and compared over time. For example, if you want to analyze your personnel expenses, you may use indicators such as headcount, payroll, benefits, turnover rate, or productivity. If you want to analyze your sales revenue, you may use indicators such as sales volume, sales price, market share, or customer satisfaction.\n3. Use a combination of budget indicators to get a comprehensive and balanced view of your budget performance and goals. Budget indicators can be classified into different types, such as input, output, outcome, efficiency, or effectiveness indicators. Input indicators measure the resources or inputs that you use for your budget, such as money, time, or staff. Output indicators measure the products or services that you produce or deliver with your budget, such as units, customers, or events. Outcome indicators measure the results or impacts that you achieve or influence with your budget, such as quality, satisfaction, or change. Efficiency indicators measure how well you use your inputs to produce outputs, such as cost per unit, time per customer, or staff per event. Effectiveness indicators measure how well you achieve your outcomes with your outputs, such as quality per unit, satisfaction per customer, or change per event. You should use a mix of these types of indicators to capture the different dimensions of your budget performance and goals, and to avoid focusing on only one aspect. For example, if you want to analyze your program expenses, you may use input indicators such as budget allocation, output indicators such as number of beneficiaries, outcome indicators such as impact evaluation, efficiency indicators such as cost per beneficiary, and effectiveness indicators such as impact per beneficiary.\n4. How to use projected data to create and compare different budget scenarios and outcomes?\nscenario analysis is a powerful tool that allows organizations to assess the potential impact of different budget scenarios and make informed decisions. By utilizing historical and projected data, businesses can gain valuable insights into their budget patterns and changes. In this section, we will explore the process of conducting scenario analysis and its significance in budget trend analysis.\n1. Understanding Scenario Analysis:\nScenario analysis involves creating multiple hypothetical scenarios based on different assumptions and variables. These scenarios help organizations evaluate the potential outcomes and risks associated with each scenario. By considering various factors such as market conditions, economic trends, and internal factors, businesses can gain a comprehensive understanding of their budget's performance.\n2. Creating Budget Scenarios:\nTo begin the scenario analysis, organizations need to identify the key variables that impact their budget. These variables can include factors like revenue growth, cost fluctuations, market demand, and regulatory changes. By adjusting these variables within different scenarios, businesses can simulate various budget scenarios and assess their potential impact.\n3. Comparing Budget Scenarios:\nOnce the budget scenarios are created, organizations can compare them to understand the differences in outcomes. This comparison helps in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each scenario and enables decision-makers to make informed choices. By analyzing the variations in revenue, expenses, profitability, and cash flow, businesses can evaluate the financial implications of each scenario.\n4. Assessing Risks and Opportunities:\nScenario analysis also allows organizations to assess the risks and opportunities associated with each budget scenario. By considering different market conditions and external factors, businesses can identify potential risks that may impact their budget performance. Additionally, scenario analysis helps in identifying opportunities for growth and optimization within the budget.\n5. Using Examples to Highlight Ideas:\nTo provide a better understanding, let's consider an example. Imagine a retail company planning its budget for the upcoming year. They create two scenarios: Scenario A assumes a moderate increase in sales due to market growth, while Scenario B considers a decline in sales due to increased competition. By comparing these scenarios, the company can assess the potential impact on revenue, expenses, and profitability. This analysis helps them make strategic decisions to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities.\nScenario analysis using projected data is a valuable technique for budget trend analysis. By creating and comparing different budget scenarios, organizations can gain insights into their budget patterns, assess risks and opportunities, and make informed decisions. It empowers businesses to adapt to changing market conditions and optimize their financial performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use projected data to create and compare different budget scenarios and outcomes - Budget trend analysis: How to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes\n5. How to summarize your main findings and insights from your budget trend analysis?\nIn this blog, we have discussed how to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes. We have seen how to collect, organize, and visualize your budget data using various tools and techniques. We have also learned how to identify and explain the trends, patterns, and outliers in your budget data, and how to use them to make informed decisions and projections. In this final section, we will summarize our main findings and insights from our budget trend analysis, and provide some tips and best practices for conducting your own budget trend analysis.\nHere are some of the key points to remember when summarizing your budget trend analysis:\n- Use a clear and concise summary statement. A summary statement is a sentence or two that captures the main message or takeaway of your budget trend analysis. It should answer the question: What did you learn from your budget trend analysis? For example, you could say: \"Our budget trend analysis revealed that our income has increased steadily over the past five years, while our expenses have fluctuated significantly due to seasonal and unexpected factors. We also found that our savings rate has improved over time, but we still need to work on reducing our debt and increasing our emergency fund.\"\n- Highlight the most important and relevant findings and insights. After stating your summary statement, you should elaborate on the most important and relevant findings and insights that support your summary statement. You should focus on the findings and insights that are most relevant to your budget goals, objectives, and questions. You should also explain how your findings and insights can help you improve your budget performance and planning. For example, you could say: \"Some of the key findings and insights from our budget trend analysis are:\n1. Our income has increased steadily over the past five years, mainly due to our career advancement and salary raises. This shows that we have been successful in growing our income and achieving our career goals. However, we also noticed that our income growth rate has slowed down in the last year, which could indicate a potential plateau or decline in our income in the future. Therefore, we should consider diversifying our income sources and exploring new opportunities for income growth.\n2. Our expenses have fluctuated significantly over the past five years, due to seasonal and unexpected factors. We observed that our expenses tend to spike in the months of December and January, due to the holiday season and the winter heating costs. We also noticed that our expenses have increased in the last two years, due to some major life events, such as buying a new car, renovating our house, and having a baby. These factors have impacted our budget balance and our ability to save and invest. Therefore, we should review our spending habits and prioritize our needs and wants. We should also create a realistic and flexible budget that can accommodate our changing needs and circumstances.\n3. Our savings rate has improved over time, but we still need to work on reducing our debt and increasing our emergency fund. We found that our savings rate has increased from 10% to 15% of our income over the past five years, which is above the average savings rate of 8.8% in the US. This shows that we have been disciplined and consistent in saving and investing our money. However, we also found that our debt-to-income ratio has increased from 25% to 35% over the same period, which is above the recommended ratio of 20% or less. This means that we are spending more than we can afford on debt payments, which can affect our credit score and our financial security. Therefore, we should pay off our high-interest debt as soon as possible and avoid taking on new debt. We should also increase our emergency fund to cover at least six months of our living expenses, in case of any unforeseen events or emergencies.\"\n- Use visual aids to support your summary. Visual aids, such as charts, graphs, tables, and diagrams, can help you present your budget data and findings in a clear and engaging way. They can also help you highlight the trends, patterns, and outliers in your budget data, and compare and contrast your budget performance and projections. You should use visual aids that are appropriate for your budget data and analysis, and that can convey your message effectively. For example, you could use a line chart to show the changes in your income and expenses over time, a pie chart to show the distribution of your expenses by category, or a bar chart to show the comparison of your budget performance and projections by month or year. You should also label your visual aids properly and provide a brief explanation or interpretation of what they show. For example, you could say: \"The following line chart shows the changes in our income and expenses over the past five years. As you can see, our income has increased steadily, while our expenses have fluctuated significantly. The gap between our income and expenses represents our budget surplus or deficit, which indicates our budget balance and our ability to save and invest.\"\n```markdown\n![Line chart of income and expenses over time](line_chart.\n6. How to cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis?\nData and Information\nOne of the most important aspects of writing a budget trend analysis is to properly cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your analysis. This not only shows respect for the original authors and their work, but also enhances the credibility and reliability of your analysis. Moreover, citing and acknowledging sources helps you avoid plagiarism, which is a serious academic and professional offense. In this section, we will discuss how to cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis, following some general guidelines and best practices. We will also provide some examples of common citation styles and formats that you can use in your analysis.\nHere are some steps that you can follow to cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis:\n1. Identify the type and format of the source. Different types of sources, such as books, journals, websites, reports, etc., may have different citation requirements and formats. For example, a book citation usually includes the author's name, the title of the book, the publisher, the year of publication, and the page number. A website citation usually includes the author's name, the title of the web page, the URL, and the date of access. You should also consider the format of the source, such as print, online, PDF, etc., as this may affect the citation style and format as well.\n2. Choose a citation style and format that suits your purpose and audience. There are many citation styles and formats that you can use in your budget trend analysis, such as APA, MLA, Chicago, Harvard, etc. Each citation style and format has its own rules and conventions for citing and acknowledging sources. You should choose a citation style and format that suits your purpose and audience, and that is consistent with the standards and expectations of your field or discipline. For example, if you are writing a budget trend analysis for a business or management course, you may want to use the APA style, which is commonly used in social sciences. If you are writing a budget trend analysis for a history or humanities course, you may want to use the Chicago style, which is commonly used in history and humanities. You should also check with your instructor, supervisor, or publisher for any specific citation requirements or preferences that they may have.\n3. Follow the citation rules and conventions of your chosen citation style and format. Once you have chosen a citation style and format, you should follow the citation rules and conventions of that style and format throughout your budget trend analysis. You should pay attention to the details and nuances of the citation style and format, such as punctuation, capitalization, indentation, spacing, etc. You should also make sure that your citations are accurate, complete, and consistent. You should avoid mixing different citation styles and formats, as this may confuse your readers and undermine your credibility. You should also avoid using outdated or unreliable sources, as this may compromise the quality and validity of your analysis.\n4. Provide a list of references or a bibliography at the end of your budget trend analysis. In addition to citing and acknowledging the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis within the text, you should also provide a list of references or a bibliography at the end of your budget trend analysis. A list of references or a bibliography is a comprehensive and alphabetical list of all the sources that you have cited and acknowledged in your analysis. It provides the full details and information of each source, such as the author's name, the title of the source, the publisher, the year of publication, the URL, etc. A list of references or a bibliography helps your readers to locate and access the sources that you have used in your analysis, and to verify and evaluate the information and data that you have presented. You should follow the same citation style and format that you have used in your analysis for your list of references or a bibliography, and make sure that it is consistent and error-free.\nHere are some examples of common citation styles and formats that you can use in your budget trend analysis:\n- APA style: This is a citation style and format that is commonly used in social sciences, such as psychology, education, business, etc. It uses the author-date system for in-text citations, and provides a list of references at the end of the analysis. For example:\nIn-text citation: (Smith, 2020, p. 15)\nReference list entry: Smith, J. (2020). Budget trends and patterns in the retail industry. ABC Publishing.\n- MLA style: This is a citation style and format that is commonly used in humanities, such as literature, language, art, etc. It uses the author-page system for in-text citations, and provides a works cited list at the end of the analysis. For example:\nIn-text citation: (Smith 15)\nWorks cited list entry: Smith, John. Budget Trends and Patterns in the Retail Industry. ABC Publishing, 2020.\n- Chicago style: This is a citation style and format that is commonly used in history and humanities. It uses the notes-bibliography system or the author-date system for in-text citations, and provides a bibliography or a list of references at the end of the analysis. For example:\nNotes-bibliography system:\nIn-text citation: 1. John Smith, Budget Trends and Patterns in the Retail Industry (ABC Publishing, 2020), 15.\nBibliography entry: Smith, John. Budget Trends and Patterns in the Retail Industry. ABC Publishing, 2020.\nAuthor-date system:\nIn-text citation: (Smith 2020, 15)\nReference list entry: Smith, John. 2020. Budget Trends and Patterns in the Retail Industry. ABC Publishing.\nThese are some of the general guidelines and best practices for citing and acknowledging the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis. By following these steps and examples, you can ensure that your budget trend analysis is well-researched, well-written, and well-referenced. You can also avoid plagiarism, enhance your credibility, and respect the original authors and their work.

Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired. We\u2019re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,\u201d said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county\u2019s two hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It\u2019s going to be exhausting, stretching.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\u00a0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\u00a0\n\u201cThat person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,\u201d Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\u00a0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there\u2019s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it\u2019s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.\u201d\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\u00a0\n\u201cOur hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cWhen you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that\u2019s 500 to 1000 people that are out.\u201d\u00a0\nSome are out because they\u2019re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\u00a0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure \u2014 at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar\u2019s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn\u2019t been cleared to talk to the press, said she\u2019s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\u00a0\n\u201cI was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter\u2019s while doing everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juggling act.\u201d\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\u00a0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\u00a0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county\u2019s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are full with patients coming to us through the front door,\u201d Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital\u2019s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. \u201cNothing about COVID-19 is typical.\u201d\u00a0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\u00a0\n\u201cICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.\u201d\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County \u2014 the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, \u201chospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,\u201d Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\u00a0\nSince October, Modoc County \u2014 wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet \u2014 has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county\u2019s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko. Typically, that includes hospitals in Modesto as well as Vohra\u2019s congested Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have the ability to do an improvised ICU should we have to hold patients but this is clearly not the preferred option,\u201d Sergienko said.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people, and has already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties.\nEven small counties that do have their own ICUs need to transfer patients who require a higher level of care than they can provide. Colusa County, for instance, has three ICU beds \u2014 none of which were occupied as of Monday, according to county counsel Marcos Kropf. (State data reports that zero ICU beds are available in Colusa. The state did not respond to a request for clarification.)\nBut Colusa County has nevertheless needed to transfer patients to hospitals elsewhere, including Chico, Roseville and Marysville. And in Marysville, the only ICU serving nearly 176,000 people in Sutter and Yuba counties is full, according to a health advisory released Friday.\u00a0\nPhuong Luu, health officer for both Sutter and Yuba counties, wrote that the surge has led hospitalizations at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville to almost triple.\u00a0\nMonica Arrowsmith, a spokesperson for the hospital, would not say Friday whether the ICU was at capacity or whether the hospital had enough staff, but she said the hospital has access to additional supplies, expertise and support from the rest of the Adventist Health system.\u00a0\nLuu, however, said the ICU \u201cis full because of the surge in COVID-19 patients needing ICU level care. There are not enough ICU nurses to expand for more ICU beds,\u201d according to the health advisory. \u201cThe current COVID-19 situation is dire in Yuba-Sutter.\u201d\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has requested 815 medical staffers, including 435 specifically for ICUs, from contractors and most are expected within a week, with Imperial County a high priority. The state has also asked the federal government for help staffing ICUs.\u00a0\nImperial County\u2019s El Centro Regional Medical Center plans to open 21 beds in a 50-bed parking lot tent facility today with staffing from the state, according to hospital CEO Edward. He also said the state will allow the hospital to increase the number of patients each nurse can care for. He hopes the changes will help the hospital increase its staffed ICU beds to 32 from 20.\nExhausted healthcare workers\nThe onslaught of cases after nine months of a pandemic are pushing healthcare workers to the brink. The word repeated by each healthcare worker CalMatters interviewed was \u201cexhausted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cExhausted. Oh man. Exhausted and frustrated,\u201d said one Northern California emergency medicine physician, who asked that her name and hospital not be named because she had not been cleared to speak to the press. \u201cAnd a little scared about what\u2019s going to happen soon.\u201d\u00a0\nAlready, she said, she\u2019s finding it increasingly difficult to transfer patients needing specialty care.\u00a0\n\u201cI called every single hospital in Northern California out to Reno and all the Bay Area hospitals, and they all refused to take this patient,\u201d the doctor said, adding that she found a local doctor who could help. \u201cFor those non-COVID patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\nEven at hospitals that still have room in their ICUs, healthcare workers are feeling the emotional toll of the prolonged pandemic.\u00a0\n\u201cFor those non-covid patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be dependent on this post-Thanksgiving surge,\u201d said Nick Sawyer, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health. \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we will overwhelm the system and people will end up in a hospital that is overwhelmed, that doesn\u2019t have the staffing that is necessary to provide that best care.\u201d\u00a0\nSawyer said that he traveled to New York to help the overwhelmed hospitals during the early days of the pandemic, and was shaken by what he saw there.\u00a0\n\u201cFamilies have to say goodbye to their loved ones over Facetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to the family. It\u2019s devastating to the nurses. It\u2019s devastating to the physicians. It\u2019s just not a normal thing we\u2019re used to doing.

      "\n\t\t\tCalifornia\u2019s intensive care nightmare: Which hospitals are full?\t\t\nShare this:\nIn summary\nIn the worst-hit counties, some hospitals are sending critically ill patients to other counties. Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired. We\u2019re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,\u201d said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county\u2019s two hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It\u2019s going to be exhausting, stretching.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\u00a0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\u00a0\n\u201cThat person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,\u201d Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\u00a0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there\u2019s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it\u2019s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.\u201d\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\u00a0\n\u201cOur hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cWhen you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that\u2019s 500 to 1000 people that are out.\u201d\u00a0\nSome are out because they\u2019re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\u00a0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure \u2014 at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar\u2019s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn\u2019t been cleared to talk to the press, said she\u2019s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\u00a0\n\u201cI was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter\u2019s while doing everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juggling act.\u201d\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population.

      "L.A. County shatters COVID-19 record with 12,741 new cases in one day\nLos Angeles County shattered its daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 12,741 reported Thursday as hospitals continued to fill with patients, according to an independent Times tally.\nThe new total is more than 2,800 more coronavirus cases than L.A. County has seen in a single day \u2014 breaking the previous record set Sunday \u2014 and shows the coronavirus is still spreading rapidly through communities. The county also reported 74 new deaths, the fourth-highest single-day total of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe surge in cases likely represents the consequence of an explosion of virus transmission over the Thanksgiving holiday, officials said. \n\u201cI do think that we\u2019re starting to see some of the increases from Thanksgiving week, and the thousands of people that were either traveling or mingling with people outside their household for the holiday,\u201d L.A County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said earlier this week. \nWith the new numbers, L.A. County is now averaging nearly 9,500 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, and 52 COVID-19 deaths a day. Those are both records in this pandemic. Until Thursday, the highest average daily number of COVID-19 deaths in L.A. County over a weekly period was 50, a record set for the seven-day period that ended April 24.\nL.A. County is now recording double the number of daily coronavirus cases than it saw on Nov. 30, and quadruple its daily coronavirus cases since mid-November. Cumulatively, L.A. County has tallied 488,519 coronavirus cases and 8,151 COVID-19 deaths. \nCalifornia has averaged nearly 29,000 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, a new record. More Californians are also dying of COVID-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. The state has averaged about 150  deaths a day over the last week \u2014 breaking a record set in August.\nCalifornia on Thursday recorded 33,995 new coronavirus cases, marking the third highest tally for a single day, and 172 deaths.\nCumulatively, the state has logged more than 1.48 million coronavirus cases and more than 20,600 COVID-19 deaths. \nAt the same time, the availability of intensive care beds in Southern California and the Central Valley hit alarming new lows. \n\u201cLike a speeding car approaching a cliff, if we do not rapidly change course, we are in jeopardy of catastrophic consequences,\u201d Dr. Paul Simon, chief science officer for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said during a briefing Thursday. \nIn Southern California, ICU availability fell to 7.7% on Thursday, down from 9% the day before, the latest data show. The state defines the region as Imperial, Inyo, Los Angeles, Mono, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. \nThe situation was even more dire in the San Joaquin Valley region, which is reporting 1.9% ICU availability, down from 4.2%. Numbers have also worsened in the Greater Sacramento area, which reported in at 13.3%, down from 14.3%; and the San Francisco Bay Area, which was at 17.8%, down from 20.9%.\nRural Northern California remains in comparatively solid shape, at 30.3% ICU availability.\nStatewide, an all-time high of 11,497 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized as of Wednesday, the most recent day for which complete data are available. \nThat number increased by 485 in just one day and has swelled by 30% over the last week, state figures show. \nThe story is much the same when it comes to ICUs. The number of Californians requiring that level of care jumped 115 in just one day to a record 2,621 as of Wednesday.\nAs of Wednesday, L.A. County had 3,624 people in its hospitals with coronavirus infections, the 11th consecutive day that number has been a new high. The county\u2019s net number of COVID-19 hospitalizations increased overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday by 191 \u2014 the highest single-day jump in the pandemic.\nSan Bernardino and Orange counties are the only others that have more than 1,000 coronavirus-positive patients, according to state data. \n California \n Southern California is a main driver of state\u2019s record COVID-19 deaths, with no signs of a letup \nSouthern California and the Central Valley are by far the state\u2019s biggest contributors of total COVID-19 deaths in the last week.\nDec. 10, 2020\nHospitals can take steps to gird themselves against an influx of new patients \u2014 by canceling scheduled surgeries and outpatient visits; discharging patients as quickly as possible; and temporarily diverting ambulances with certain types of patients, for instance. \nBut ICU beds require high-tech equipment and specially trained healthcare professionals, which are in high demand throughout the state and nation.\nHealthcare systems can move trained staff around to help plug gaps where needed, but \u201cat a certain point, you run out of options, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re worried about,\u201d Simon said. \n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is what we saw back in the spring in New York City and in northern Italy where there were literally people in gurneys in hallways that were dying or near death, and that\u2019s beyond a tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that we can\u2019t let happen. We have to do everything possible to prevent that.\u201d\n World & Nation \n One-day U.S. death toll from COVID-19 tops 3,000, more than D-Day or 9/11 \nAs officials met to discuss approval of a coronavirus vaccine on Thursday, the number of cases and deaths grew ever more stunning.\nDec. 10, 2020\nThe way the state calculates regional ICU capacity is more complicated \u201cthan just looking at how many beds are full at any given point in time,\u201d said Ferrer.\nShe said Wednesday that the state had set a threshold that only 30% of ICU beds should be occupied by COVID-19 patients and that, should an area exceed that, \u201cthey make a downward adjustment \u2014 sort of, you get a penalty.\u201d\nThe California Department of Public Health elaborated in response to an inquiry from The Times Thursday: \u201cIf a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is reduced by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold. This is done to preserve the capacity of the ICU to also treat non-COVID-19 conditions.\u201d\n\u201cThe ICU is an important tool to save lives for those with COVID-19 and other critical medical conditions such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes,\u201d the department statement continued. \u201cIf a disproportionate number of ICU beds are being utilized to treat COVID-19 patients, then patients with non-COVID medical issues may not be receiving or be able to receive the level of care they need.\u201d\nAccording to data provided by Los Angeles County, 47% of the region\u2019s intensive care beds were filled with COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday. That\u2019s a significant cause for alarm, officials said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to need ICU beds for those many other conditions and so there is greater concern if, in addition to seeing a reduced overall capacity, we\u2019re seeing a greater proportion of these ICU beds taken up by COVID-19 patients,\u201d Simon said.\nHow California determines ICU availability is of keen interest, as that\u2019s the metric the state uses to determine whether to hand down additional restrictions on businesses and activities. \nThe state is implementing new stay-at-home orders in any region that sees its ICU capacity drop below 15%.\nThose orders \u2014 which reduce capacity at retail stores; close businesses including hair salons, nail salons, card rooms, museums, zoos and aquariums; and prohibit outdoor restaurant dining \u2014 are already in place in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley.\nThose restrictions will also go into effect in Greater Sacramento beginning Thursday night.\nOfficials have said they hope the additional restrictions will help stymie the latest coronavirus surge. \nGiven how widespread the virus is in communities up and down the state, experts say the best thing residents can do to keep themselves and their loved ones from being infected is to stay home as much as possible over the next few weeks.\n\u201cTo be blunt, we have one chance to turn this serious surge around, and that chance is right now,\u201d San Francisco health director Dr. Grant Colfax said this week. \u201cBut our window is narrowing and closing fast.\u201d\nWith grim case counts, officials have pointed to the relief a vaccine will soon bring as a way to encourage people to continue to maintain precautions.\nFerrer announced earlier this week that the county would likely get its first doses of the coronavirus vaccine as early as next week. During a Thursday  news conference, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said that as many as 500,000 doses may be distributed by the end of December.\n\u201cVaccines will be our most important tool in getting this crisis under control,\u201d he said. \u201cFDA authorization will mean that it\u2019s safe and that it\u2019s effective, and I urge all Angelenos to get vaccinated as soon as they qualify and those vaccines are available.\u201d\nHe urged residents, however, to continue to stay at home as much as possible, stating that \u201cthe worst is not yet behind us.\u201d\nTimes staff writers Maura Dolan, Ryan Menezes and Leila Miller contributed to this report. \nMore to Read \n \u2018A huge burden\u2019: L.A. hospitals strained by COVID surge, very bad flu season \nDec. 8, 2022\n Another bummer coronavirus summer for California?

With telemedicine, patients can now receive medical advice, diagnosis, disease management and treatment from the comfort of their homes, increasing their access to care and eliminating physical barriers created by hospital capacity, distance or transportation.\nThis report examines the continued adoption of telemedicine, its applications across various specialties and health care services, and its effects on physician well-being, patient access, and continuity of care. Study findings show that 88% of physicians surveyed believe telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, with many reporting reduced wait times, improved adherence to treatment plans, and decreased no-show rates. Additionally, a consider- able portion of physicians surveyed reported that telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules and positively impacted their feelings of autonomy and work-life balance. Beyond expanding access to health care, telemedicine may also be increasing patients\u2019 willingness to seek medical attention. The majority of all patients surveyed (70%) said they may be more likely to consult with a doctor if they can do so virtually, with convenience and efficiency being primary drivers of adoption. Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year, 85% said it resulted in equivalent or superior quality of care, with the majority reporting increased satisfaction. As the digitization of health care continues, telemedicine is poised to main- tain a pivotal role in health care delivery. Telemedicine and in-person care are not mutually exclusive, and uniting both can help reduce costs, expand access, and improve care for everyone. With further identification and im- plementation of best practices, telemedicine\u2019s capacity to personalize care models, promote continuity of care, and improve patient outcomes will only get stronger.\nReport Introduction 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Introduction 03 Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 04 An analysis of fee-for-service Medicare telemedicine claims throughout 2022 revealed that nearly 47% of billing physicians were users of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform. In the last quarter of 2022 (October to December) alone, Doximity's telemedicine tools were used by over 375,000 unique clinicians.* To gain a deeper understanding of the progression and sustained utilization of telemedicine, Doximity conducted an analysis of how its physician members, across all specialties and practice areas, used its telemedicine tools throughout 2022. To supplement this data, Doximity conducted a survey of over 1,200 of its physician telemedicine users across nine specialties: cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology, endocrinology, rheumatology, pulmonology, and psychiatry.\n*As reported on February 9, 2023 during Doximity\u2019s Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter earnings call 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 05 Physician Insights Telemedicine Insights from Doximity's Physician Membership 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 06 The metro areas with the highest physician adoption of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform in 2022 ranged across all regions of the U.S. New York had the highest overall adoption of telemedicine among physicians, followed by Chicago and Boston.\nMetro Areas with the HIGHEST HIGHEST Adoption 1.

This trend may be attributed to telemedicine\u2019s ability to promote continuity of care and long-term patient-physician relationships. Among all physicians surveyed, over 83% reported they found telemedicine useful in enhancing continuity of care for patients with complex or chronic conditions, and nearly two-thirds (65%) said telemedicine improved communication with their patients. 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 08 Adoption by Specialty Adoption of Telemedicine Highest in Specialties that Manage Chronic Illness 1.

Psychiatry Top Specialty by Adoption Rate \"I\u2019m an advanced heart failure cardiologist, and there are not many of us in the state. With telemedicine, patients now have access to subspecialists which may not be available in their area. In addition, follow ups for things like adjusting a heart failure therapy can be done via telemedicine, eliminating the need for patients to drive long distances for a short office visit. Over the past few years, we\u2019ve learned telemedicine is not a replacement, but a complement to our practices. \u2013 Munir Janmohamed, MD, Medical Director Heart Failure, Dignity Health Medical Foundation 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 09 As health care becomes more digitized, physicians across specialties are integrating telemedicine into their practices. In a survey of Doximity's telemedicine users, nearly 84% of physicians reported using telemedicine at least weekly, with 40% incorporating it into their daily clinical practice. The highest reports of daily use were among psych- iatrists at 84%, followed by endocrinologists at 57%. Looking ahead, the increasing popularity of mobile medicine and remote patient monitoring devices \u2014 estimated to reach 60.6 million U.S. patients by 20243 \u2014\u00ad is likely to drive further demand for reliable and complementary telemedicine solutions.\nFrequency of Use Many Physicians Incorporating Telemedicine into Daily, Weekly Practice *May not sum to 100 due to rounding numbers.\nHow often do you use telemedicine (via voice, video, text, etc.) in your practice?* Monthly 11% Quarterly 3% None of the Above 3% Participant None of the Ab Quarterly Monthly Daily Weekly 44% 40% 11% 3% 3% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 1 Daily 40% Weekly 44% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine As physicians lean into digital, they are embracing multiple telemedicine modalities, with video emerging as the most predominant among physicians surveyed. Audio-only phone visits are also widely employed, demonstrating the need for telemedicine tools that are versatile and adaptable to patients\u2019 needs. According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, Medicare patients with less technology access, lack of video experience, Latinx ethnicity, or limited English pro- ficiency, were all more likely to be offered telephone visits compared to video visits.4 These findings underscore the importance of audio-only options and the ongoing need for inclusive, flexible, and accessible telemedicine and product features that meet the needs of an increasingly diverse patient population.

While one of the most predominant applications among physicians is routine follow-up visits (92% of physicians surveyed), the majority of physicians surveyed (57%) use telemedicine to discuss lab and test results and treatment options with their patients, and this is even higher among oncologists (70%). Telemedicine also offers an important channel for prescription refills and timely follow-ups after a missed in-person visit, while playing a non-trivial role in remote patient monitoring, patient triage and urgent care. Notably, a recent study conducted by Epic Research found that most patients who had a telemedicine visit did not require an in-person follow-up appointment within the same specialty for three months. These findings suggest that telemedicine can provide effective medical attention without the need for additional in-person visits.5 Adoption by Use Case Telemedicine's Role Extends Beyond Routine Care How Physicians Apply Telemedicine in Clinical Practice: Routine Follow-Up Patient Visits Patient Consults Patient Triage Remote Patient Monitoring Test Results and Treatment Options Follow-Ups After Missed In-Person Visits Medication Management Urgent Care 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 12 While the pandemic certainly increased telemedicine use, the opportunity for better time management could help explain its continued adoption. Two-thirds of all physicians surveyed (66%) reported at least one time management benefit, such as greater autonomy and work-life balance, increased productivity, and easier schedule management. In fact, the majority of physicians surveyed reported telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules. As physicians continue to navigate burnout and overwork, these benefits could drive even greater adoption of telemedicine in the future.\nEffects on Productivity, Work-Life Balance Physicians Report Better Time Management \"Telemedicine has made it easier to manage my schedule.\" \"Telemedicine helps me be more productive and better serve my patients.\" \"Telemedicine has provided me with greater autonomy and work-life balance.\" \"Telemedicine helps me to provide care to more patients per day.\" Physician-Reported Benefits of Telemedicine Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 13 Telemedicine is also instrumental in addressing the costly and disruptive issue of patient no-shows for doctor visits. Approximately 61% of physicians surveyed reported a reduction in their patient no-show rates as a result of telemedicine, likely due to the increased convenience, accessibility, and flexibility of virtual care visits. Importantly, 77% of physicians said they have observed either equivalent or improved patient adherence to treatment plans through telemedicine, with less than 2% reporting decreased adherence.\nEffects on Patient Visit, Treatment Adherence Reduces No-Show Rates, Improves or Maintains Adherence to Treatment Plans How has telemedicine affected your patients' adherence to treatment plans?* Not applicable 1 Not applicable 1% Decreased adherence 2% Unsure 21% Increased adherence 37% No change 40% 1 Decreased adherence 2% No change in adherence 40% Increased adherence 37% *May not sum to 100, due to rounding numbers.\nUnsure 21% Not applicable 1% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 14 Patient access also appears to be a leading contributor to telemedicine adoption. Nearly 88% of physicians surveyed said telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, particularly among populations that may have faced barriers to care previously. Similarly, 87% of physicians reported telemedicine has enabled them to provide care to patients who face obstacles visiting their office in person. As additional benefits, nearly 44% of physicians found that telemedicine has actually reduced wait times for their patients, while 41% said telemedicine has expanded their community reach and referral networks.\nEffects on Patient Access Physicians Report Improved Access, Reduced Wait Times for Patients Physicians Who Agree Telemedicine Has Increased Patient Access to Health Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree 88 Neutral 10 Disagree 3 Disagree 3% Neutral 10% Agree 87% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Approximately 92% of physicians surveyed identified ease of use as a key factor in promoting patient access, followed by cross-device compatibility, allowing access from both desktop and mobile devices. Notably, the majority of physicians surveyed identified the ability to avoid application downloads and login-protected patient portals as important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine.\nFactors Influencing Patient Access Ease of Use, Cross-Device Compatibility Key Attributes for Patient Access Which of the following features are important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine?\nEase of use Accessibility across desktop and mobile No application download required No patient portal log-in required Ability to add family member or care partner Language support (translation or interpreter service) 0 100 75 50 25 92% 81% 71% 56% 55% 42% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 16 As telemedicine\u2019s role in U.S. health care continues to evolve, pay parity and the ability to offer telemedicine services across state lines will continue to be two issues that can greatly impact patient access. Among all physicians surveyed, over 78% indicated they believe there should be pay parity between telemedicine and in-person visits, and nearly 84% said the ability to practice telemedicine across state lines is critical to improving patient access to specialists and other timely care. With a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034,1 telemedicine is likely to play a significant role in promoting patient access to care, particularly in rural or underserved areas.\nPolicies to Preserve Patient Access Pay Parity, Licensing Across State Lines Critical to Patient Access Percentage of Physicians Who Agree There Should Be Pay Parity Between Telemedicine and In-Person Visits Percentage of Physicians Who Agree Ability to Practice Telemedicine Across State Lines is Critical to Improving Patient Access to Specialists, Other Timely Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree Neutral Disagree Disagree 4% Neutral 12% Agree 84% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Survey respondents included 1,200 patients who identified as having a chronic illness and 1,200 patients who did not. Among all respondents surveyed, the majority reported participating in a telemedicine visit within the last year (between March 2022 to March 2023). The following analyses examine these patients' direct experiences with telemedicine, as well as broader trends and preferences among the full patient cohort.\nPatient Insights Tracking Patient Perception and Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 19 In 2022, telemedicine reached the 80% adoption mark overall, becoming the preferred channel for prescription care and minor illness.6 While this is a significant milestone, the frequency of telemedicine use is also noteworthy. Based on survey results, nearly 60% of patients who had a telemedicine visit in the past year participated in a minimum of three virtual visits. Over one in five (21%) participated in six or more visits, and this frequency was similar among patients with and without chronic illnesses. Further, nearly 76% of patients who had a telemedicine visit reported it improved their access to health care services.\nTelemedicine Use Among Patients Patients Report Recurring Use of Telemedicine Within One-Year Period In the past year, how many times did you meet with a doctor virtually?* Has virtual care improved your access to health care services?* *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nFundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold 6+ times 21 3-5 times 38 1-2 times 41 41% 38% 21% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Fundrais Participant Unsure No No Change Yes 76% 17% 5% 2% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 3-5 Times 38% No 5% Unsure 2% 1-2 Times 41% Yes 76% 6+ Times 21% No Change 17% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 20 Patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year identified a number of reasons for adoption, with efficiency and convenience being primary drivers. Telemedicine enables patients to consult with their doctors from the comfort of their homes, eliminating the need to interrupt their daily routines or commute to a doctor's office. Importantly, more than one in four patients with a telemedicine visit in the past year reported opting for a virtual visit because they did not believe their situation warranted an in-person appointment. This suggests that telemedicine could play a vital role in ensuring patients less inclined to visit a doctor's office still receive timely medical evaluation. In fact, the majority of all patients surveyed (70%) indicated they may be more likely to consult with a doctor in a non-emergency situation if the visit could be conducted virtually.\nFactors Driving Telemedicine Adoption Efficiency, Convenience Leading Drivers of Patient Adoption *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nWhy did you see your doctor virtually within the past year?* Easier than in-person visit (more convenient) Faster than in-person visit Concerns about COVID-19 and other infections Didn't feel in-person was needed (didn't feel bad enough) Difficulty getting to doctors office Couldn't miss work 0 60 45 30 15 53% 43% 31% 27% 26% 16% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 21 Over the past year, patients participated in telemedicine visits to receive a number of health care services, ranging from routine check-ups to appointments to discuss test results and treatment options. While follow-up appointments appear to be one of the primary applications of telemedicine use, this is likely due to the comprehensive nature of these visits, which can encompass various health care services. Among all patients who had a virtual care visit in the past year, approximately one in three patients (34%) used telemedicine to discuss their medications with their doctor or to refill their prescriptions, while roughly one in five used telemedicine to review test or treatment options. Notably, some of the highest use of telemedicine for these services was among patients with chronic illnesses.\nAdoption by Health Care Service Strong Telemedicine Adoption for Routine Visits, Medication Management What type(s) of care have you received virtually in the past year?\nFollow-ups after an in-person visit Regular check-ups Medication management and refills Review of test or lab results Mental health appointments Review of test or treatment options Same-day appointments (non-emergency) Urgent or emergency care Remote monitoring device check-up 0 50 38 25 13 46% 36% 34% 32% 25% 20% 17% 11% 9% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 22 Patients are also embracing a variety of telemedicine modalities to cater to their diverse needs and preferences. These modalities include video consultations, audio-only phone calls, and chat or text messaging. Among all patients surveyed, video emerged as the most preferred modality, with audio- only phone visits closely behind. These relatively strong preferences across modalities underscore the need for adaptable and flexible telemedicine solutions that can promote a positive patient experience for all.\nPreferences by Modality Patients Report Similar Preferences for Video, Audio-Only Visits Which types of virtual care formats do you prefer?\nAll Patients Patients with Telemedicine Visit in Past Year Video Phone (audio only) Chat or text messaging I prefer to meet with my doctor in person 15 0 30 45 60 42% 56% 39% 46% 27% 31% 27% 13% Computer (laptop/desktop) 51% Tablet or iPad 38% Home phone or basic cell phone 20% Wi-Fi or Internet 54% Among all patients surveyed, the majority (77%) reported having regular access to a smartphone, making it the most commonly available device for virtual health care visits. This was followed by computers at 51% and tablets at 38%. Importantly, only 54% of respondents reported having reg- ular access to Wi-Fi, underscoring the need for flexible telemedicine solutions that can easily adapt to meet individual patients\u2019 needs, including adjusting for no or low internet connection. In terms of patient preferences, 60% of respondents indicated a strong preference for using mobile devices for telemedicine visits, with less than one-fourth (24%) reporting a preference for computers.\n2023 State of Telemedicine Report 23 Device Access and Preferences Patients Continue to Favor, Depend on Smartphones Which of the following resources do you have regular access to for virtual health care visits?\nSmartphone 0 20 40 60 80 77% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 24 Consistent with prior year findings, patients continue to report equivalent or superior quality of care as the result of their experience with telemedicine. Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit within the past year, 85% reported their overall care was better or about the same with virtual care, and over half indicated increased satisfaction. These results underscore telemedicine\u2019s ability to enhance patient experiences and outcomes, making it a valuable tool in modern health care delivery.\nTelemedicine Satisfaction, Quality of Care Patients Report Increased Satisfaction, Equivalent or Superior Quality of Care Which of the following best represents your experience with virtual care overall?* How has virtual care affected your satisfaction with your care?* F Participant My overall care My overall care My overall care same Unsure 9% 46% 39% 6% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold My overall care is worse 7 My overall care is better 34 Increased Satisfaction 54 Unsure 5 5% 54% 34% 7% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Increased satisfaction 54% Unsure 9% Unsure 5% Decreased satisfaction 7% My overall care is worse 6% No change in satisfaction 34% My overall care is about the same 46% My overall care is better 39% *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\n2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 25 Expectations for Future Use Patients Emphasize Importance of Virtual Care Options Nearly 67% of patients with a telemedicine visit in the past year emphasized the importance of their doctor providing virtual care options, and this number was even higher among patients who had three or more telemedicine visits (72%). Notably, the large majority of patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year (83%) indicated they expect to maintain or increase their usage of telemedicine in the future.\nof patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year indicated they expect to maintain or increase their usage of telemedicine in the future 83% Conclusion, Methodology, & Sources 26 With strong adoption among physicians and patients, telemedicine is poised to maintain an important role in health care delivery, particularly as the U.S. contin- ues to grapple with physician burnout and shortage and an aging population. Moving forward, uniting telemedicine with in-person care will help personalize care models, promote more equitable access to care, and strengthen the overall health care system for all. By leveraging the advantages of both telemedicine and in-person care, physicians as well as care teams can create flexible and adaptable models that better meet the diverse needs of their patients. This flexibility could also provide much- needed support for physicians and other medical professionals, as they continue to navigate a complex and evolving health care landscape.\nConclusion, Methodology & Sources Conclusion 27 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Conclusion, Methodology & Sources 28 Physician Insights Medicare Telemedicine Insights: Doximity partnered with CareJourney, a health analytics organization, to measure the number of physicians billing a set of Medicare telemedicine codes throughout 2022.

With telemedicine, patients can now receive medical advice, diagnosis, disease management and treatment from the comfort of their homes, increasing their access to care and eliminating physical barriers created by hospital capacity, distance or transportation.\nThis report examines the continued adoption of telemedicine, its applications across various specialties and health care services, and its effects on physician well-being, patient access, and continuity of care. Study findings show that 88% of physicians surveyed believe telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, with many reporting reduced wait times, improved adherence to treatment plans, and decreased no-show rates. Additionally, a consider- able portion of physicians surveyed reported that telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules and positively impacted their feelings of autonomy and work-life balance. Beyond expanding access to health care, telemedicine may also be increasing patients\u2019 willingness to seek medical attention. The majority of all patients surveyed (70%) said they may be more likely to consult with a doctor if they can do so virtually, with convenience and efficiency being primary drivers of adoption. Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year, 85% said it resulted in equivalent or superior quality of care, with the majority reporting increased satisfaction. As the digitization of health care continues, telemedicine is poised to main- tain a pivotal role in health care delivery. Telemedicine and in-person care are not mutually exclusive, and uniting both can help reduce costs, expand access, and improve care for everyone. With further identification and im- plementation of best practices, telemedicine\u2019s capacity to personalize care models, promote continuity of care, and improve patient outcomes will only get stronger.\nReport Introduction 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Introduction 03 Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 04 An analysis of fee-for-service Medicare telemedicine claims throughout 2022 revealed that nearly 47% of billing physicians were users of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform. In the last quarter of 2022 (October to December) alone, Doximity's telemedicine tools were used by over 375,000 unique clinicians.* To gain a deeper understanding of the progression and sustained utilization of telemedicine, Doximity conducted an analysis of how its physician members, across all specialties and practice areas, used its telemedicine tools throughout 2022. To supplement this data, Doximity conducted a survey of over 1,200 of its physician telemedicine users across nine specialties: cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology, endocrinology, rheumatology, pulmonology, and psychiatry.\n*As reported on February 9, 2023 during Doximity\u2019s Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter earnings call 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 05 Physician Insights Telemedicine Insights from Doximity's Physician Membership 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 06 The metro areas with the highest physician adoption of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform in 2022 ranged across all regions of the U.S. New York had the highest overall adoption of telemedicine among physicians, followed by Chicago and Boston.\nMetro Areas with the HIGHEST HIGHEST Adoption 1.

This trend may be attributed to telemedicine\u2019s ability to promote continuity of care and long-term patient-physician relationships. Among all physicians surveyed, over 83% reported they found telemedicine useful in enhancing continuity of care for patients with complex or chronic conditions, and nearly two-thirds (65%) said telemedicine improved communication with their patients. 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 08 Adoption by Specialty Adoption of Telemedicine Highest in Specialties that Manage Chronic Illness 1.

With telemedicine, patients now have access to subspecialists which may not be available in their area. In addition, follow ups for things like adjusting a heart failure therapy can be done via telemedicine, eliminating the need for patients to drive long distances for a short office visit. Over the past few years, we\u2019ve learned telemedicine is not a replacement, but a complement to our practices. \u2013 Munir Janmohamed, MD, Medical Director Heart Failure, Dignity Health Medical Foundation 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 09 As health care becomes more digitized, physicians across specialties are integrating telemedicine into their practices. In a survey of Doximity's telemedicine users, nearly 84% of physicians reported using telemedicine at least weekly, with 40% incorporating it into their daily clinical practice. The highest reports of daily use were among psych- iatrists at 84%, followed by endocrinologists at 57%. Looking ahead, the increasing popularity of mobile medicine and remote patient monitoring devices \u2014 estimated to reach 60.6 million U.S. patients by 20243 \u2014\u00ad is likely to drive further demand for reliable and complementary telemedicine solutions.\nFrequency of Use Many Physicians Incorporating Telemedicine into Daily, Weekly Practice *May not sum to 100 due to rounding numbers.\nHow often do you use telemedicine (via voice, video, text, etc.) in your practice?* Monthly 11% Quarterly 3% None of the Above 3% Participant None of the Ab Quarterly Monthly Daily Weekly 44% 40% 11% 3% 3% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 1 Daily 40% Weekly 44% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine As physicians lean into digital, they are embracing multiple telemedicine modalities, with video emerging as the most predominant among physicians surveyed. Audio-only phone visits are also widely employed, demonstrating the need for telemedicine tools that are versatile and adaptable to patients\u2019 needs. According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, Medicare patients with less technology access, lack of video experience, Latinx ethnicity, or limited English pro- ficiency, were all more likely to be offered telephone visits compared to video visits.4 These findings underscore the importance of audio-only options and the ongoing need for inclusive, flexible, and accessible telemedicine and product features that meet the needs of an increasingly diverse patient population.

While one of the most predominant applications among physicians is routine follow-up visits (92% of physicians surveyed), the majority of physicians surveyed (57%) use telemedicine to discuss lab and test results and treatment options with their patients, and this is even higher among oncologists (70%). Telemedicine also offers an important channel for prescription refills and timely follow-ups after a missed in-person visit, while playing a non-trivial role in remote patient monitoring, patient triage and urgent care. Notably, a recent study conducted by Epic Research found that most patients who had a telemedicine visit did not require an in-person follow-up appointment within the same specialty for three months. These findings suggest that telemedicine can provide effective medical attention without the need for additional in-person visits.5 Adoption by Use Case Telemedicine's Role Extends Beyond Routine Care How Physicians Apply Telemedicine in Clinical Practice: Routine Follow-Up Patient Visits Patient Consults Patient Triage Remote Patient Monitoring Test Results and Treatment Options Follow-Ups After Missed In-Person Visits Medication Management Urgent Care 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 12 While the pandemic certainly increased telemedicine use, the opportunity for better time management could help explain its continued adoption. Two-thirds of all physicians surveyed (66%) reported at least one time management benefit, such as greater autonomy and work-life balance, increased productivity, and easier schedule management. In fact, the majority of physicians surveyed reported telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules. As physicians continue to navigate burnout and overwork, these benefits could drive even greater adoption of telemedicine in the future.\nEffects on Productivity, Work-Life Balance Physicians Report Better Time Management \"Telemedicine has made it easier to manage my schedule.\" \"Telemedicine helps me be more productive and better serve my patients.\" \"Telemedicine has provided me with greater autonomy and work-life balance.\" \"Telemedicine helps me to provide care to more patients per day.\" Physician-Reported Benefits of Telemedicine Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 13 Telemedicine is also instrumental in addressing the costly and disruptive issue of patient no-shows for doctor visits. Approximately 61% of physicians surveyed reported a reduction in their patient no-show rates as a result of telemedicine, likely due to the increased convenience, accessibility, and flexibility of virtual care visits. Importantly, 77% of physicians said they have observed either equivalent or improved patient adherence to treatment plans through telemedicine, with less than 2% reporting decreased adherence.\nEffects on Patient Visit, Treatment Adherence Reduces No-Show Rates, Improves or Maintains Adherence to Treatment Plans How has telemedicine affected your patients' adherence to treatment plans?* Not applicable 1 Not applicable 1% Decreased adherence 2% Unsure 21% Increased adherence 37% No change 40% 1 Decreased adherence 2% No change in adherence 40% Increased adherence 37% *May not sum to 100, due to rounding numbers.\nUnsure 21% Not applicable 1% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 14 Patient access also appears to be a leading contributor to telemedicine adoption. Nearly 88% of physicians surveyed said telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, particularly among populations that may have faced barriers to care previously. Similarly, 87% of physicians reported telemedicine has enabled them to provide care to patients who face obstacles visiting their office in person. As additional benefits, nearly 44% of physicians found that telemedicine has actually reduced wait times for their patients, while 41% said telemedicine has expanded their community reach and referral networks.\nEffects on Patient Access Physicians Report Improved Access, Reduced Wait Times for Patients Physicians Who Agree Telemedicine Has Increased Patient Access to Health Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree 88 Neutral 10 Disagree 3 Disagree 3% Neutral 10% Agree 87% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Approximately 92% of physicians surveyed identified ease of use as a key factor in promoting patient access, followed by cross-device compatibility, allowing access from both desktop and mobile devices. Notably, the majority of physicians surveyed identified the ability to avoid application downloads and login-protected patient portals as important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine.\nFactors Influencing Patient Access Ease of Use, Cross-Device Compatibility Key Attributes for Patient Access Which of the following features are important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine?\nEase of use Accessibility across desktop and mobile No application download required No patient portal log-in required Ability to add family member or care partner Language support (translation or interpreter service) 0 100 75 50 25 92% 81% 71% 56% 55% 42% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 16 As telemedicine\u2019s role in U.S. health care continues to evolve, pay parity and the ability to offer telemedicine services across state lines will continue to be two issues that can greatly impact patient access. Among all physicians surveyed, over 78% indicated they believe there should be pay parity between telemedicine and in-person visits, and nearly 84% said the ability to practice telemedicine across state lines is critical to improving patient access to specialists and other timely care. With a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034,1 telemedicine is likely to play a significant role in promoting patient access to care, particularly in rural or underserved areas.\nPolicies to Preserve Patient Access Pay Parity, Licensing Across State Lines Critical to Patient Access Percentage of Physicians Who Agree There Should Be Pay Parity Between Telemedicine and In-Person Visits Percentage of Physicians Who Agree Ability to Practice Telemedicine Across State Lines is Critical to Improving Patient Access to Specialists, Other Timely Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree Neutral Disagree Disagree 4% Neutral 12% Agree 84% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Survey respondents included 1,200 patients who identified as having a chronic illness and 1,200 patients who did not. Among all respondents surveyed, the majority reported participating in a telemedicine visit within the last year (between March 2022 to March 2023). The following analyses examine these patients' direct experiences with telemedicine, as well as broader trends and preferences among the full patient cohort.\nPatient Insights Tracking Patient Perception and Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 19 In 2022, telemedicine reached the 80% adoption mark overall, becoming the preferred channel for prescription care and minor illness.6 While this is a significant milestone, the frequency of telemedicine use is also noteworthy. Based on survey results, nearly 60% of patients who had a telemedicine visit in the past year participated in a minimum of three virtual visits. Over one in five (21%) participated in six or more visits, and this frequency was similar among patients with and without chronic illnesses. Further, nearly 76% of patients who had a telemedicine visit reported it improved their access to health care services.\nTelemedicine Use Among Patients Patients Report Recurring Use of Telemedicine Within One-Year Period In the past year, how many times did you meet with a doctor virtually?* Has virtual care improved your access to health care services?* *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nFundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold 6+ times 21 3-5 times 38 1-2 times 41 41% 38% 21% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Fundrais Participant Unsure No No Change Yes 76% 17% 5% 2% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 3-5 Times 38% No 5% Unsure 2% 1-2 Times 41% Yes 76% 6+ Times 21% No Change 17% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 20 Patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year identified a number of reasons for adoption, with efficiency and convenience being primary drivers. Telemedicine enables patients to consult with their doctors from the comfort of their homes, eliminating the need to interrupt their daily routines or commute to a doctor's office. Importantly, more than one in four patients with a telemedicine visit in the past year reported opting for a virtual visit because they did not believe their situation warranted an in-person appointment. This suggests that telemedicine could play a vital role in ensuring patients less inclined to visit a doctor's office still receive timely medical evaluation. In fact, the majority of all patients surveyed (70%) indicated they may be more likely to consult with a doctor in a non-emergency situation if the visit could be conducted virtually.\nFactors Driving Telemedicine Adoption Efficiency, Convenience Leading Drivers of Patient Adoption *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nWhy did you see your doctor virtually within the past year?* Easier than in-person visit (more convenient) Faster than in-person visit Concerns about COVID-19 and other infections Didn't feel in-person was needed (didn't feel bad enough) Difficulty getting to doctors office Couldn't miss work 0 60 45 30 15 53% 43% 31% 27% 26% 16% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 21 Over the past year, patients participated in telemedicine visits to receive a number of health care services, ranging from routine check-ups to appointments to discuss test results and treatment options. While follow-up appointments appear to be one of the primary applications of telemedicine use, this is likely due to the comprehensive nature of these visits, which can encompass various health care services. Among all patients who had a virtual care visit in the past year, approximately one in three patients (34%) used telemedicine to discuss their medications with their doctor or to refill their prescriptions, while roughly one in five used telemedicine to review test or treatment options. Notably, some of the highest use of telemedicine for these services was among patients with chronic illnesses.\nAdoption by Health Care Service Strong Telemedicine Adoption for Routine Visits, Medication Management What type(s) of care have you received virtually in the past year?\nFollow-ups after an in-person visit Regular check-ups Medication management and refills Review of test or lab results Mental health appointments Review of test or treatment options Same-day appointments (non-emergency) Urgent or emergency care Remote monitoring device check-up 0 50 38 25 13 46% 36% 34% 32% 25% 20% 17% 11% 9% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 22 Patients are also embracing a variety of telemedicine modalities to cater to their diverse needs and preferences. These modalities include video consultations, audio-only phone calls, and chat or text messaging. Among all patients surveyed, video emerged as the most preferred modality, with audio- only phone visits closely behind. These relatively strong preferences across modalities underscore the need for adaptable and flexible telemedicine solutions that can promote a positive patient experience for all.\nPreferences by Modality Patients Report Similar Preferences for Video, Audio-Only Visits Which types of virtual care formats do you prefer?\nAll Patients Patients with Telemedicine Visit in Past Year Video Phone (audio only) Chat or text messaging I prefer to meet with my doctor in person 15 0 30 45 60 42% 56% 39% 46% 27% 31% 27% 13% Computer (laptop/desktop) 51% Tablet or iPad 38% Home phone or basic cell phone 20% Wi-Fi or Internet 54% Among all patients surveyed, the majority (77%) reported having regular access to a smartphone, making it the most commonly available device for virtual health care visits. This was followed by computers at 51% and tablets at 38%. Importantly, only 54% of respondents reported having reg- ular access to Wi-Fi, underscoring the need for flexible telemedicine solutions that can easily adapt to meet individual patients\u2019 needs, including adjusting for no or low internet connection. In terms of patient preferences, 60% of respondents indicated a strong preference for using mobile devices for telemedicine visits, with less than one-fourth (24%) reporting a preference for computers.\n2023 State of Telemedicine Report 23 Device Access and Preferences Patients Continue to Favor, Depend on Smartphones Which of the following resources do you have regular access to for virtual health care visits?\nSmartphone 0 20 40 60 80 77% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 24 Consistent with prior year findings, patients continue to report equivalent or superior quality of care as the result of their experience with telemedicine.

Moving forward, uniting telemedicine with in-person care will help personalize care models, promote more equitable access to care, and strengthen the overall health care system for all. By leveraging the advantages of both telemedicine and in-person care, physicians as well as care teams can create flexible and adaptable models that better meet the diverse needs of their patients. This flexibility could also provide much- needed support for physicians and other medical professionals, as they continue to navigate a complex and evolving health care landscape.\nConclusion, Methodology & Sources Conclusion 27 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Conclusion, Methodology & Sources 28 Physician Insights Medicare Telemedicine Insights: Doximity partnered with CareJourney, a health analytics organization, to measure the number of physicians billing a set of Medicare telemedicine codes throughout 2022.

COVID-19 patients who were isolated and received HBIC were monitored through telephone consultations (TC), in-person TC visits, and a self-reporting application. By evaluating patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC, healthcare providers could gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of the HBIC program.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study design enrolled 444 HBIC patients who answered a structured questionnaire. A binary logistic regression model assessed the association between independent variables and patient satisfaction. The length of stay in HBIC was analyzed using Cox regression analysis. The data collection started on April (1\u201330), 2022, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\nResults: The median age was 34, and 247 (55.6%) were females. A greater proportion (313, 70.5%) of the participants had high satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AOR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those who were symptomatic (AOR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were found to be significant factors for high user satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and more in-person visits (>1 visit) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001) had greater chances to reduce the length of stay in the COVID-19 HBIC.\nConclusion: 70.5% of the participants had high satisfaction with the system, and frequent phone call follow-ups on patients\u2019 clinical status can significantly improve their satisfaction and length of recovery. An in-person visit is also an invaluable factor in a patient\u2019s recovery.\n1 Introduction\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on numerous countries, resulting in a staggering number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide. Specifically, 774,771,942 confirmed cases and 7,035,337 deaths were reported globally. In Africa, approximately 9,576,309 confirmed cases and 175,500 deaths have been recorded, whereas Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths (1). Given the outbreak\u2019s severity and the prevailing epidemiological situation, the Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia has taken swift action by developing, approving, and implementing a national guide on home-based isolation and care (HBIC). This guide is tailored for asymptomatic and mildly confirmed COVID-19 cases (2). Consequently, many patients have enrolled in the system, establishing a comprehensive telephone consultation (TC) service. Healthcare workers from health centers have been diligently monitoring the clinical condition of these patients through regular phone calls or in-person visits (2). The national or regional COVID-19 emergency centers are available for assistance to ensure that patients receive the necessary support and information. Patients facing challenges or requiring guidance on the system\u2019s functioning, worsening symptoms, medication advice, or ambulance requests can reach these centers (2). This approach provides comprehensive care and support to individuals affected by COVID-19 in Ethiopia.\nSeveral studies have emphasized the utilization of teleconsultations (TC) in Sub-Saharan Africa amid the COVID-19 outbreak. For instance, a study conducted at the Aga Khan Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, revealed varying frequencies of TC calls over 3\u2009months, with peaks observed at 7\u2009weeks and lows at 13\u2009weeks (3). In Uganda, the Ministry of Health rolled out TC services across multiple health centers simultaneously (4). Similarly, in Cameroon, many physicians resorted to TC consultations during the pandemic, often using WhatsApp applications (5). Despite the progress in telemedicine practices, assessing the quality of care provided through these methods is crucial. Quality indicators for telemedicine outcomes include mortality rates, average length of stay, and complication rates (6). The adoption of telemedicine has played a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of diagnosis and treatment in primary public hospitals (7). This is evident in the reduction of treatment duration, decrease in the average length of hospital stays, and decline in the percentage of critically ill patients (8). Moreover, telemedicine aids in improving personalized care and broadening the accessibility of medical services. Healthcare providers can deliver more efficient and effective patient care by harnessing telemedicine, particularly during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic (9, 10). Patient satisfaction is a significant indicator of the societal perception of healthcare services, particularly in telemedicine. The practical advantages of telemedicine further underscore its social reputation within primary healthcare facilities. First, Telemedicine plays a crucial role in alleviating the financial burden on patients and their families by eliminating expenses associated with transportation and accommodation (11). Second, the efficient nature of telemedicine expedites disease diagnosis and treatment, thereby mitigating patients\u2019 suffering (11). Lastly, telemedicine\u2019s unique \u201cface-to-face\u201d communication system fosters a novel connection between medical professionals and patients, ultimately enhancing the healthcare experience (12, 13). Despite numerous studies, the findings remain inconclusive and conflicting. Some researchers suggested recruiting adaptable patients who embrace this new technology\u2019s convenience (14). Conversely, others highlight limitations, such as the relative novelty of telehealth in medicine, which makes it challenging to compare its outcomes with those of more traditional interventions (15). In addition, patient satisfaction is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors. However, the factors influencing patient satisfaction in different settings or conditions remain debated (15).\nPatient satisfaction and length of stay are crucial metrics for assessing the quality of healthcare programs. This study aimed to provide insights into the factors influencing the satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC of COVID-19 patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This study uses traditional care (TC) and hybrid (in-person-TC) approaches in different sub-city areas. By understanding these factors, policymakers can develop strategic plans to improve the quality of healthcare services, thereby ensuring high satisfaction levels and shorter medical residence stays. The findings of this study can also inform the National Public Health Emergency Operation Center and the Federal Ministry of Health in Ethiopia on how to intervene and strengthen the healthcare system. In addition, the results can contribute to expanding telemedicine services and adopting digital health technologies in the country\u2019s healthcare sector.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Study area\nThis study focuses on Addis Ababa, primarily because of the significant burden of COVID-19 cases. Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths, with nearly 67% of these cases originating in Addis Ababa (1). Moreover, implementing the COVID-19 HBIC model in Addis Ababa surpasses other regions. Furthermore, the HBIC\u2019s self-reporting and follow-up application is exclusively available in Addis Ababa, making it an ideal location for research. Addis Ababa is divided into 11 sub-cities [Addis Ketema, Akaky Kaliti, Arada, Bole, Gullele, Kirkos, Kolfe Keranio, Lideta, Nefas Silk-Lafto, Yeka, Lemi Kura (New)], all of which have adopted the HBIC system for COVID-19 patients since the initial case was identified. The digital follow-up tool was specifically launched in the Bole sub-city (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Addis Ababa district locations. This map of the 11 Addis Ababa sub-cities is included in this study. Lemi Kura is a new district and is not included in this map.\n2.2 Study period\nThe study was conducted from 1 to 30 April 2022 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.3 Telemedicine medical team and technology\nEach sub-city is equipped with two to four health centers that serve as the base for the telemedicine medical team. A well-established system ensures that patient data is promptly transmitted to follow-up teams, enabling healthcare workers to initiate their follow-up procedures without delay. To support this initiative, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Addis Ababa Health Bureau allocated a tablet with complimentary airtime to each sub-city proportionate to the needs of the telemedicine medical team.\n2.4 Population studied\nThis study encompasses all individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who were isolated, received care at home, and met the criteria for inclusion. The study population consisted of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to HBIC from its inception, aged between 18 and 60, individuals who underwent regular follow-up assessments while at HBIC, and those whose contact information was documented in the registry.\n2.5 Patient\u2019s independent variables\nPatients were classified based on the following criteria: Gender (male, female), Age (<30, 31\u201340, 41\u201350, 51\u201360\u2009years), city of residence, education level (no education and elementary, secondary and diploma, degree and above), occupation (government employee, private employee, self-employee, not working), symptoms (asymptomatic, symptomatic), type of attention (only telephone call\u2014TC, telephone call with in-person visits - in-person-TC), frequency of calls (\u22642 calls, \u22653 calls), and frequency of in-person visits (no visits, \u22642 visits, \u22653 visits).\n2.6 Study design\nA cross-sectional research design assessed two primary variables: patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC in days. The formula for a single population proportion was applied to determine the required population size of 385 (with a Z-score of 1.96, an outcome proportion of 50%, and a marginal error of 5%). The technique of proportionate stratified sampling involved dividing the entire population into 11 strata or sub-cities. The total sample size was then distributed proportionally among each sub-city based on the burden of the disease. Study participants were selected from each stratum or sub-city using systematic probability sampling (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Data collection. Sampling technique from each sub-city in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.7 Data collection tools, techniques, and quality assurance\nA validated patient satisfaction survey from the teleneurology program in Chile (13) employed a Likert scale to assess the extent of patient satisfaction. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collected, a pretest was conducted on a random sample of 23 (5%) patients. Based on the findings from the pretest, necessary amendments were made to the data collection tool. Additionally, the collected data underwent daily reviews for clarity and completeness checks. Before analysis, the internal consistency of the questionnaire was evaluated using Cronbach\u2019s alpha test (13). The local language was used during data collection to ensure the required information was collected with greater understanding. To facilitate this, the data collection questionnaire was first developed in English and then translated into Amharic, and the data collected were back-translated to English for consistency. The data collectors administered the questionnaire over the telephone, and responses were recorded on the individual datasheets. Training on the basics of the questionnaire and how to use it appropriately was given by the principal investigator for two BSc nurses for 2\u2009days.\n2.8 Patient satisfaction survey\nThe final questionnaire consisted of 17 closed-response questions, each assigned a numerical value ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree). The questions were categorized into four contextualized areas. The overall score on the questionnaire, with a maximum of 85 points, served as an indicator of patient satisfaction. The scoring system classified satisfaction levels as follows: very low (17 points or below), low (18\u201334 points), moderate (35\u201351 points), high (52\u201368 points), and very high (69\u201385 points). Following completion of the survey, patients were divided into two main groups based on their scores: (i) those with a score below 51 points, indicating moderate or low patient satisfaction, and (ii) those with a score over 52 points, indicating high or very high patient satisfaction (Table 1).\nTable 1. Study questionnaire.\r\n\n2.9 Data and outcomes analysis\nSummary statistics, including frequency, percentage, median, and interquartile range, were utilized to summarize the characteristics of patients and other relevant information. This research aimed to assess the relationship between the independent variables and two primary outcomes: (i) the level of patient satisfaction and (ii) the length of stay in the HBIC. The binary logistic regression (Backwald) model was employed to examine the independent variables associated with patient satisfaction, and the findings were presented as odds ratios (OR). Cox regression (Backwald) analysis was conducted to evaluate the independent variables linked to the length of stay in HBIC, and the results were reported as hazard ratios (HR). To compare the means of length of stay in HBIC, a non-normal distribution, the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for independent samples was employed, while the chi-square test was used for categorical variables. The significance level was set at p\u2009<\u20090.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 26.\n2.10 Ethical considerations\nThe study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee. Oral informed consent was obtained from the participants before any form of data collection. Participants\u2019 contact information was obtained after a formal request was made to the Addis Ababa Health Bureau. Demographic data of all participants and survey responses were anonymously collected and entered. Access to the collected information was limited to the authors, and confidentiality was maintained throughout the project.\n3 Results\n3.1 Data collection\nA 17-question structured questionnaire was developed by reviewing similar studies (Table 1) (13). Upon completing a reliability assessment of the survey, the internal reliability of the survey was robust, as evidenced by a Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of 0.96 (data not shown). The study included 509 patients, yielding a response rate of 87.2% (n\u2009=\u2009444). Among the non-respondents (n\u2009=\u200965, 12.8%), the reasons provided for their lack of participation were as follows: 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) had incorrect contact information, and another 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) did not receive any follow-up, either in-person or through phone communication. The remaining 60% (n\u2009=\u200939) of participants displayed uncooperative behavior, as their phones were inactive, unreachable, or did not answer (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Patient\u2019s response from telephone calls. Response rate and reasons for non-response include: (i) wrong phone number, (ii) no follow-up, and (iii) other.\n3.2 Population description, patient satisfaction, and length of stay in HBIC\nThe descriptive statistics of the 444 patients who participated in the study are below. The median age was 34\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u2009years, with an age distribution as follows: Age:<30 (n\u2009=\u2009164, 36.9%); 31\u201340 (n\u2009=\u2009141, 31.8%); 41\u201350 (n\u2009=\u200987, 19.6%); and 51\u201360 (n\u2009=\u200952, 11.7%). The gender distribution of the patients was as follows: Female 247 (55.6%) (Table 2). We outline the performance of the HBIC system according to the patient satisfaction parameter. Due to the low frequency obtained in the lower user satisfaction groups (very low, low, and moderate), we grouped patients into two major groups according to the degree of user satisfaction: low or moderate and high or very high. patients with high or very high user satisfaction represent 313 (70.5%). When we break down this group by gender, we see that women have a slightly higher percentage of high or very high user satisfaction than men, with 177 (56.9%) females. However, no statistically significant differences are observed. Analyzing the distribution of patients with high and very high user satisfaction by age, we observe that more than 50% of patients are concentrated in a population under 40\u2009years old (Table 2). The length of stay for patients with high or very high satisfaction varied depending on certain variables. The average length of stay for females was 15\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009days, while for males, it was 16\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009days, and in terms of age groups, patients showed similar lengths between 14 and 16 days (Table 2).\nTable 2. Patient\u2019s demographic variables.\r\n\nThe distribution of patients according to sub-city of residence was found to be quite homogeneous, with some exceptions as detailed below: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200962, 14.0%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Arada (n\u2009=\u200943, 9.7%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200977, 17.3%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200959, 13.3%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u200911, 2.5%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200936, 8.1%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200922, 5.0%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u200916, 3.6%). Patients with high or very high satisfaction were distributed according to sub-city of residence as follows: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200948, 10.8%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200935), Arada (n\u2009=\u200932, 7.2%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200957, 12.8%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%, 7.9%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u20096, 1.4%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200923, 5.2%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200920, 4.5%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200918, 4.1%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u20098, 1.8%) (Table 2). Regarding the city of origin, the average length of stay varied as follows: Addis Ketema (17\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Akaki Kality (16\u2009\u00b1\u20098), Arada (16\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Bole (14\u2009\u00b1\u20093), Gulele (17\u2009\u00b1\u20094), Kirkos (17\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Kolfe Keranyo (16\u2009\u00b1\u20096), Lideta (14\u2009\u00b1\u20094), Nefas Silk Lafto (20\u2009\u00b1\u20097), Yeka (15\u2009\u00b1\u20097), and Lemi Kura (14\u2009\u00b1\u20097) (Table 2).\nThe patient\u2019s satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC can be influenced by various factors, including the patient\u2019s level of education and occupation. The distribution of patients\u2019 education level is as follows: 79 patients (17.8%) had no education or only completed elementary school, 174 patients (39.2%) had completed secondary school or obtained a diploma, and 191 patients (43.0%) had a degree or higher education. The distribution of patients\u2019 occupation is as follows: 121 patients (27.3%) were government employees, 114 patients (25.7%) were private employees, 120 patients (25.0%) were self-employed, and 89 patients (20.0%) were not working (Table 2). The majority of patients who showed high or very high user satisfaction have higher levels of education: Education: No Educ and Elementary (n\u2009=\u200945, 10.1%), Secondary and Diploma (n\u2009=\u2009125, 28.2%), Degree and above (n\u2009=\u2009143, 32.2%); however, the distribution was found to be more symmetrical according to the occupational level of these patients: Government employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.0%), Private employee (n\u2009=\u200985, 19.1%), Self-employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.1%), Not working (n\u2009=\u200968, 15.3%) (Table 2). No significant differences were found in the duration length of stay in HBIC among patients concerning their level of education and occupation type. The respective data for education are as follows: No Education and Elementary 14\u2009\u00b1\u20097, Secondary and Diploma 15\u2009\u00b1\u20094, Degree and above 17\u2009\u00b1\u20095. Similarly, the data for occupation type were: Government employee 14\u2009\u00b1\u20095, Private employee 15\u2009\u00b1\u20095, Self-employee 16\u2009\u00b1\u20094, Not working 18\u2009\u00b1\u20097 (Table 2).\nMost patients who participated in this study were symptomatic, accounting for 275 (61.9%) with an average length of stay for HBIC of 16 (\u00b16). Patients who displayed symptoms were more satisfied (n\u2009=\u2009215, 48.5%) than those who were asymptomatic (n\u2009=\u200998, 22.1%). The length of stay in HBIC for asymptomatic patients (14\u2009\u00b1\u20095), was slightly lower than that of Symptomatic patients (16\u2009\u00b1\u20095). However, no statistically significant differences were observed (data not shown).\nNext, we described the frequency of phone call follow-ups for patients during their stay at HBIC. The most common type of care was TC, with 330 patients (74.3%), followed by in-person and TC visits, with 114 patients (25.7%). The overall frequency of in-person visits was 1\u2009\u00b1\u20092 visits, and it can be further broken down as follows: no visits (n\u2009=\u2009330, 48.9%), \u22642 visits (n\u2009=\u200984, 18.9%), and\u2009\u2265\u20093 visits (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%). The average frequency of phone call follow-ups was 3\u2009\u00b1\u20096 calls, and we observe that the distribution of calls appears to be symmetrical: TC was \u22642 calls (n\u2009=\u2009221, 49.8%) and\u2009\u2265\u20093 calls (n\u2009=\u2009223, 50.2%).\nIn terms of the mode of care, patients who were exclusively contacted through teleconsultation (TC) 217 (48.9%) were more satisfied than those receiving hybrid care with both TC and in-person visits 96 (21.6%). Consistent with the findings, patients exhibited higher user satisfaction with an increased frequency of calls in TC, as those patients with more than \u22653 calls (n\u2009=\u2009184, 41.4%) expressed greater satisfaction compared to patients with less than or equal to \u22642 calls (n\u2009=\u2009129, 29.1%) (Table 2). Upon analyzing the frequency of in-person visits, patients with fewer visits reported higher user satisfaction: No visits (n\u2009=\u2009217, 69.3%), 1 visit (n\u2009=\u200970, 22.0%), and\u2009\u2265\u20092 visits (n\u2009=\u200926, 8.3%).\nIt is important to mention that differences in patient length of stay were observed according to the type of care, as patients treated through the TC system 14\u2009\u00b1\u20095 stayed for a shorter period than those receiving hybrid care through TC and in-person visits 18\u2009\u00b1\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). As expected, patients with more calls stayed longer in the HBIC system as described below: Frequency of calls in TC: \u22642 calls 13\u2009\u00b1\u20093, and\u2009\u2265\u20093 calls 18\u2009\u00b1\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Table 2).\n3.3 Statistical analysis associated with patient satisfaction\nA binary logistic regression analysis was utilized to explore the variables associated with high or very high patient satisfaction levels. The results revealed that individuals who placed more than three calls (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those displaying symptoms (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were more inclined to report increased satisfaction. Nevertheless, no statistically significant relationships were found between user satisfaction and the other independent variables investigated (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 3).\nTable 3. Relevant demographic variables that influence patient satisfaction.\r\n\n3.4 Statistical analysis associated with patient length of stay in HBIC\nA Cox regression analysis was employed to examine the factors influencing the duration of hospital stays in patients who reported high levels of satisfaction. The findings revealed that patients who made more than three phone calls had a significantly lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000), indicating a greater likelihood of reducing their length of stay. Similarly, patients with more in-person visits also exhibited a lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). However, no statistically significant associations were observed between the length of stay and the other independent variables analyzed (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 4).\nTable 4. Cox regression analysis to elucidate the demographic variables associated with the length of stay in HBIC and patients\u2019 satisfaction.\r\n\n3.5 Statistical analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC\nPreviously, we identified the following variables that significantly influence patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC: the presence of symptoms, the number of phone calls, and in-person follow-ups. Subsequently, we examined the relationship between symptoms and patient satisfaction with the number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups (Table 5). It was noted that symptomatic patients with low or moderate satisfaction levels have an OR\u2009=\u20095.7 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and 7.6 times higher likelihood of having in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was notably longer for those with a higher number of phone calls. Conversely, patients with high or very high satisfaction levels have a 2.3 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was significantly longer for those with in-person follow-up. Sig p\u2009<\u20090.05 (Table 5).\nTable 5. Analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC.\r\n\n4 Discussion\nThis study aimed to evaluate the levels of patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC among COVID-19 patients while also examining the different factors that may impact these outcomes. Given the considerable number of COVID-19-positive instances and the limited bed availability at COVID-19-specific hospitals, the HBIC endorsed the practice of home isolation for COVID-19-affected persons. This directive was instituted because most COVID-19 patients were either asymptomatic or displayed mild symptoms. Such cases generally do not necessitate hospitalization at COVID-19-designated medical facilities and can be adequately managed at home with appropriate medical guidance and monitoring. The heightened level of patient satisfaction observed in symptomatic individuals treated by HBIC is supported by an associated investigation conducted through a survey-based study (10, 16\u201318).\nWe identified a noteworthy connection between a high or very high satisfaction level and the frequency of phone call follow-ups in patients with COVID-19 symptoms. Essentially, for each increment of one in the frequency of phone call follow-ups, the chances of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction rose by a factor of 2.8 (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000). This tendency may be attributed to patients encountering difficulties during their healthcare facility stay, and regular communication with the follow-up team assists in addressing some of these challenges. As per the National HBIC Guideline, the frequency of phone call follow-ups escalates as the severity of the COVID-19 illness worsens, with follow-ups occurring once a week, every 3\u2009days until discharge, and daily until discharge (19). Correspondingly, individuals exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms had 2.0 times greater odds of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction than those with asymptomatic disease (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Cox regression analysis uncovered a negative correlation between the length of stay in HBIC patients with high or very high satisfaction and the frequency of phone calls, follow-ups, and in-person visits. Specifically, the number of phone calls and in-person visits (with a minimum of two visits) emerged as significant factors impacting the length of stay. Upon adjusting for other variables, it was observed that with each additional phone call, the length of stay in the hospital-based isolation center (HBIC) decreased by 46.3% (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000). Similarly, after accounting for other covariates, the length of stay among COVID-19 patients who had more than one in-person visit was 50.5% lower compared to patients with no in-person visits (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Finally, this investigation determined that symptomatic patients with Low or Moderate satisfaction had a greater likelihood of experiencing a larger Number of Phone Calls, In-Person follow-ups, and a longer stay at HBIC compared to patients with high or very high satisfaction.\nUser satisfaction and length of stay have shown dissimilar results in different latitudes. A study conducted in general and university hospitals in the Netherlands found no evidence of a correlation between the average length of stay in hospital wards and patient satisfaction (20). Several studies conducted at the Nancy University Hospital Center in France and in training hospitals in Turkey and Japan (21\u201323) have found a connection between prolonged lengths of stay and decreased patient satisfaction. These studies have highlighted the importance of environmental factors in influencing patient satisfaction (24). However, a distinct study carried out in teaching hospitals in Turkey discovered that patients who stayed longer expressed higher satisfaction levels than those with shorter stays (25). Despite these variations, one can speculate about the reasons for higher user satisfaction in patients with greater follow-ups. Among these reasons, it can be argued that it is well-documented that telemedicine technology has the potential to enhance the quality of primary medical care, shorten the duration of treatment, and decrease the number of severe hospitalization cases (17). Telemedicine expands the availability of medical services and broadens the range of medical care, which is particularly crucial in Ethiopia, with a fragmented healthcare system and limited coverage (26, 27). The sharing of medical resources is especially significant for rural or isolated areas, and telemedicine offers a greater abundance of advanced medical resources for primary hospital consultations in these vast rural regions, thereby enhancing the quality of medical and healthcare services (10, 28, 29).\nThe incorporation of telemedicine into the healthcare systems of low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as Ethiopia, has the potential to bring about cost savings and resource conservation in the long run. Consequently, this could alleviate the financial burden on individuals and enhance their access to affordable healthcare services (17). It is important to note that in many LMICs, a significant portion of overall health spending comes from out-of-pocket payments, as there is often no general health insurance available (30). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has further strained the already fragile healthcare systems in LMICs (10, 31). In this regard, telemedicine services could be crucial in relieving pressure on the healthcare system by saving time and resources and enhancing efficiency and accessibility. Additionally, telemedicine can facilitate social distancing measures and reduce the need for face-to-face interactions in hospitals and clinics, helping prevent the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 through physical contact (10, 32). Furthermore, telemedicine can also be instrumental in providing counseling and specific advice to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as guidance on prevention measures. Overall, the adoption of telemedicine in LMICs holds great potential for addressing healthcare challenges, reducing costs, and improving access to quality care. It can serve as a valuable tool in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthening healthcare systems in these countries (33).\nThroughout the initial three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, most patients seeking medical care were directed to the HBIC. This strategic decision is believed to have effectively alleviated the potential burden of cases and prevented burnout among the existing treatment facilities (2). The HBIC specifically caters to COVID-19 patients and represents our country\u2019s pioneering national telehealth service. Therefore, it is crucial to examine its operational experiences thoroughly. The focus should be on integrating functionalities that encourage community acceptance of this telehealth modality. As COVID-19 patients continue to be enrolled in the HBIC, the findings from this study will serve as a valuable resource for the Ministry of Health and COVID-19 response teams in their efforts to enhance the healthcare system. The HBIC framework offers a practical solution for healthcare providers who aim to extend their services to patients residing in remote areas. Moreover, the growing acceptance and familiarity with telemedicine visits, driven by the pandemic, are likely to shape the future landscape of healthcare delivery for both patients and providers.\nThe study\u2019s findings should be evaluated considering the strengths and limitations identified. The study\u2019s strength lies in the thorough selection process of participants from various sub-cities throughout the entire duration of the service. The research questions were also carefully developed using a validated tool and assessed for internal consistency, ensuring their comprehensibility.\n4.1 Limitations\nIt is important to acknowledge a limitation of the study, which is the potential recall bias introduced by enrolling most patients during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this limitation, this study is expected to pave the way for advancements in telemedical services in Ethiopia. Furthermore, it can potentially expand and incorporate other telemedicine care modalities, such as videoconferencing, in the future.\n5 Conclusion\nThe investigation evaluated patient satisfaction and length of stay in telemedicine services. The findings revealed that most patients, accounting for over 70.5%, reported high or very high satisfaction with these services. Notably, patients who received frequent follow-up phone calls and exhibited symptomatic COVID-19 disease expressed higher satisfaction. Additionally, it was observed that a higher frequency of phone calls and in-person visits resulted in a shorter stay in the Hospital-Based Isolation Center (HBIC). Consequently, it is crucial to consider the aforementioned factors to enhance patient satisfaction and reduce the length of stay in HBIC or other telemedicine services. It is worth mentioning that the HBIC, which caters specifically to COVID-19 patients, represents the first large-scale national telemedicine service implemented in our country. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly examine the experiences gained from this service, with particular attention given to incorporating features that facilitate community acceptance and reimbursement of this mode of healthcare delivery. Meanwhile, as the enrollment of COVID-19 patients in the HBIC continues, the findings of this study will serve as a valuable resource for guiding the Ministry of Health, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, and the COVID-19 response team in their efforts to improve the system.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving humans were approved by the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee.

A qualitative study was planned to understand the barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation program at rural and tribal areas. The study participants were medical officers from rural and tribal areas who actively planned and implemented COVID-19 vaccination at the primary health centre.\u00a0A total of 30 medical officers were interviewed.\u00a0Interview questions were focussed on the planning of COVID-19 vaccination in their area. Other questions were the problem faced during the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program and how it has been tackled.\nResults\nThe factors identified were grouped into three groups: Health system factors, Human resource factors and Community level factors.\u00a0Health system factors like shortage of vaccines and syringes, tablet paracetamol, online digital method of vaccination registration, overcrowding at the initial stage, and inadequate infrastructure were barriers to vaccination. Fear about vaccine adverse events, even in healthcare workers (HCWs), and overburdened healthcare workers were also factors affecting vaccination. At the community level, high resistance initially and misconception about the vaccine, and also the fear about post-vaccination side effects have an impact on the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural and tribal areas.\nConclusion\nThe successful vaccination rate among the population needs community leadership and a community-centred approach when conducting outreach and strengthening primary health care in terms of infrastructure, manpower, and capacity building of healthcare staff.\nKeywords: india, vaccination, outreach, barriers, facilitators, covid-19\nIntroduction\nOne of the greatest advancements in public health of the 20th century was the development of vaccines to prevent communicable diseases, which have prevented millions of deaths and saved billions of dollars [1]. Willingness to be vaccinated varies among individuals and groups based on various factors, including individual beliefs about vaccine safety and efficacy.\u00a0Every Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccination has been reported to cause reluctance, including delays in or outright rejection of the vaccines by some medical professionals [2,3].\nThe national policy includes a thorough, secure, and effective immunization effort. Successful vaccine awareness campaigns typically employ multiple strategies [4]. India set a goal to vaccinate 300 million people against COVID-19 by August 2021, the largest immunization program\u00a0ever. This challenge was announced on January 16, 2021. The homegrown vaccines made by Bharat Biotech, Covishield and Covaxin have been licensed for limited emergency use by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI)\u00a0[5]. India simultaneously planned COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in both urban and rural areas. The designated manpower, such as midwives, auxiliary nurses, etc., from all the states, who played a significant part in the healthcare of people in rural India, were trained in COVID-19 immunization. Midwives and auxiliary nurse midwives, who have a far broader reach in the interior and rural areas, were included in the first set of health workers educated in vaccination skills because India planned to have COVID-19 immunization programs in the urban and rural areas at the same time. The government utilized allied healthcare personnel, including pharmacists and public health professionals, to scale up a vaccination campaign. Primary health centres are in charge of effectively implementing the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural areas [6]. So, the study was planned to seek insight into the challenges faced by health personnel in the effective implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program.\nMaterials and methods\nA qualitative study was planned to understand the barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation program at rural and tribal areas.\u00a0Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of Government Medical College Akola (MH). The study was conducted in a rural area of Akola district, which lies in the western parts of Maharashtra State and belongs to the Vidarbha region, and is said to be one of the progressive districts in the region. The district has one municipal corporation (Akola Municipal Corporation), six municipalities (Murtizapur; Akot; Balapur; Patur; Telhara and Barshitakli) and 535 Gram panchayat (Total 864 villages). According to the 2011 Census, the district has a total population of 18,13,906, comprising 10,94,165 persons in rural areas and 7,19,741 persons in urban areas accounting for 1.6 percent of the total population of the State [7].\u00a0In Akola district, there are 30 primary health centres and 178 subcentres.\nThe study participants were medical officers from rural and tribal areas who actively planned and implemented COVID-19 vaccination at the primary health centre.\u00a0A total of 30 medical officers were interviewed.\u00a0Informed consent was taken from each participant. Each subject gave their informed consent. The Government Medical College (GMC) Akola Institutional Ethics Committee approved the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in person between September 2021 and December 2021.\u00a0All participants were asked regarding problems faced during the implementation of COVID-19 vaccination in their area.\u00a0Interview questions included: (1) How do you plan for COVID vaccination in your area? (2) What are the problems faced during COVID vaccination?\u00a0(3) What measures had been taken to solve the problems? (4) What measures will you suggest to implement COVID vaccination in your area successfully?\u00a0The interviews lasted 20 to 30 minutes and were conducted in the participants' preferred language (Hindi, Marathi, or English). A brief introduction and explanation of the study goals opened the session. Confidentiality was maintained to all participants. Participants were made aware of the existence of no right or wrong responses. Participants were welcomed to express their opinions on the effective implementation and difficulties encountered with the COVID vaccine.\nTranscripts of all recordings were created. Two researchers independently read the transcripts before using descriptive words or phrases to code them. Then, areas of interest were assigned to the coded transcripts, and developing themes were described. Review and editing were done on these emergent topics as well as sample transcripts that had been coded. A written presentation of the data is used whenever necessary to highlight study findings with quotes.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nA total of 30 medical officers involved in COVID vaccination working at the primary health centres (PHCs) were interviewed.\u00a0Twelve individuals (12 [40%] women; mean [SD] age, 45.04 [6.9] years) participated (Table 1). Twenty-three (76.7%) participants had work experience of more than five years at PHC in a rural area.\u00a0A total of 16 (53.3%) medical officers held MBBS degrees.\nTable 1. Characteristics of study participants.\nBarriers and facilitators in COVID vaccination\nThe factors identified were grouped into three groups: Health system factors, Human resource factors and Community level factors.\nHealth system factors\nIn the initial phase of the mass COVID-19 vaccination program, the barrier to implementation was a shortage of vaccine supply. The basic requirements to conduct an effective vaccination session, like space, manpower, vaccine stock, syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc. were not available initially. One key respondent mentioned that \u201cPeople unnecessarily argued for the non-availability of vaccine and created a panic situation that was difficult to handle by us. So we took help from the police department.\u201d\nRural or illiterate people did not prefer the online digital method of vaccination registration. Additionally, the network issue for registration was also one of the barriers to vaccination.\n\u201cDue to compulsory online registration for vaccination, people keep postponing for it.\u201d\nThe respondent also mentioned about the inconvenience to the people due to overcrowding highlighting the inadequate infrastructure as a barrier to vaccination.\nHuman resource factors\nRespondent mentioned that initially there was fear about vaccine adverse events even among healthcare workers.\n\u201cInitially there was fear about vaccine adverse events even among healthcare workers which led to misconception and rejection for vaccination.\u201d\nMost respondents referred to the general shortage of health personnel as a barrier to vaccination. The deficit in human resources affected the vaccination program and overburdened the healthcare workers; it affected non-COVID activities like Universal Immunization Programme, Antenatal check-ups, Field visits, etc.\u00a0One respondent mentioned that, due to a shortage of manpower in some facilities only one health worker has to perform various tasks in vaccination such as registration, counselling of clients and administration of vaccine.\n\u201cThere should be proactive involvement of other than health department like for registration, teachers from primary school should be involved. Such involvement should not be on paper but actually on the field.\u201d\nThe poor attitude among health care workers and lack of commitment due to everyday daily vaccination sessions also were reported to impact negatively on the implementation of the program. Lack of appreciation from higher authority and no additional incentives for staff involved in vaccination was also the barrier observed in the study. Regular training creates awareness among staff. Review from higher authority, especially bureaucrats under the disaster management act, also has an impact on the vaccination program.\nCommunity level factors\nRespondents also discussed the attitude of the community towards vaccination.\u00a0Most respondents viewed the misconception about the vaccine seen to undermine the delivery of COVID vaccine.\u00a0Respondents stated that there was high resistance initially and misconception about the vaccine particularly.\u00a0Misconception and superstitious behaviour about the vaccine is present in some communities like Muslims, Buddhist so half of the population of villages is unvaccinated.\u00a0Healthcare staff also faced high reluctance to vaccination in tribal areas. In Akola district, there were pockets of tribal populations; these populations were also not ready to take vaccines initially due to fear and mistrust.\nOne respondent said that:\n\u201cIn a few villages, people\u00a0were not ready to take the COVID vaccine, only after involving leaders from villages like Sarpanch and house-to-house counselling by Healthcare staff motivated the people for vaccination.\u201d\nMisconception and myths about the adverse outcome of the vaccine was a major barrier at the community level. The people were very hesitant and had a phobia about the side effects of vaccination. Pregnant women were also unwilling to take the COVID vaccination due to fear of side effects.\u00a0One respondent has mentioned that:\n\u201cInitially, people were unaware of the safety of vaccines. People had various misbeliefs about the efficacy and safety of vaccine like an increase in death rate after vaccination.\u201d\nSome respondents stated that vaccination session timing was not feasible, so people didn\u2019t prefer to lose their daily wages for vaccine.\n\u201cIn rural areas, in the afternoon, people go to the field, which is more preferred than taking the vaccine, so we can\u2019t cover the total population.\u201d\nPost-vaccination side effects like fever, headache, and myalgia created fear among unvaccinated people.\nDiscussion\nThis qualitative study explored barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural and tribal blocks of Akola district.\u00a0The findings highlighted in our study were classified at three levels: health system, human resource and community.\u00a0There were several administrative barriers during the initial phase of the COVID pandemic. India is a big country with disparities in health literacy, access to care, and risk perception among the general public by area [7]. The basic requirements to conduct an effective vaccination session like space, manpower, vaccine stock, syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc. were not available initially. In the initial phase, online digital registration for COVID-19 vaccination and internet or mobile network issues in rural areas were critical issues for illiterate people in rural areas. Vaccinating the whole population was challenging even though the country has the largest vaccine-producing units [8]. More than 2.4 billion doses of the vaccine are produced in India each year, in addition to a variety of surgical and medical disposables such as vials, stoppers, syringes, gauze, and alcohol swabs. However, because this necessitates adhering to very strict temperature guidelines, the first barrier was the storage and delivery of the vaccinations until the inoculation sessions [9]. Representatives from the Government of India (GOI) claim that the current healthcare system may not need more personnel to administer the vaccine to healthcare professionals [9].\nIn relation to WHO standards, India's health worker density continues to be low. In addition to the scarcity, it is extremely difficult to keep skilled health workers in rural and neglected areas [7]. In our study, the general shortage of health personnel and overburdening the healthcare workers affected non-COVID activities like Universal Immunization Programme, Antenatal Care Check-ups, field visits, etc. The frontline HCWs (FLHCWs) were particularly susceptible to increased work stress for a variety of reasons, such as having to work under stressful conditions because of rapidly changing guidelines, the inevitable need to be deployed to new settings and high-risk areas, the lack of adequate technical and human resources, and the worry that they might infect their families after work with COVID-19 [6]. In our study, fear about vaccine\u00a0adverse events even among healthcare workers (HCWs) was also a reason behind the effective implementation of the COVID vaccination program.\nA review by Biswas et al. indicated that 22.51% of 76,471 HCWs\u00a0worldwide reported COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy. Their main concerns with the vaccine were potential side effects (60%), safety (48%), and how well it works (30%). HCWs in this review also found higher vaccine acceptance in Whites and Asians [10]. A study conducted by Fu et al. on Chinese healthcare workers found that about 50% were unwilling to accept COVID-19 vaccination [11]. However, a study by Saudi healthcare workers\u00a0Magadmi and\u00a0Kamel\u00a0displayed hesitancy toward vaccination [12]. Medical professionals showed a high level of vaccine scepticism, according to Dror et al. [2]. Concerns about the safety of a quickly created vaccine were raised by several respondents who did not follow the recommendations for vaccines. In contrast, individuals who believed they had a higher risk of sickness showed greater vaccine acceptance [2].\nThe poor attitude among healthcare workers and lack of commitment due to daily vaccination sessions were also reported to impact the program's implementation negatively. Lack of appreciation from higher authority and no additional incentives for staff involved in vaccination was also the barrier observed in the study. Regular training creates awareness among staff. Review from higher authority, especially bureaucrats under the disaster management act, also has an impact on the vaccination program.\u00a0Rao and\u00a0Chowdhury also mentioned that frontline workers across the country were the backbone of the Indian public health system [13]. They were underpaid, undervalued, and alienated without any state support or protection. Workloads were raised during the COVID epidemic. The lack of medical insurance, proper governmental support, decreased physical and mental health, and delayed payments all contributed to the financial vulnerability that the healthcare workforce was experiencing [13].\nIn our study, it was observed that misconception and superstitious behaviour about vaccines were present in some communities like Muslim\u00a0and Buddhist so half of the population of villages is unvaccinated.\u00a0Healthcare staff also faced high reluctance to vaccination in tribal areas in the tribal block. The people were very hesitant and had a phobia about the side effects of vaccination [14,15]. Dutta et al. mentioned that various studies have identified myriad factors related to vaccination refusal and hesitancy, including refusal for religious, social, and philosophical reasons, lack of trust in vaccine providers and others, and fear of vaccines and adverse outcomes following immunization [16]. At the same time, King et al. mentioned that mandatory vaccination requirements must be planned with great care; there is no reason to think they are incompatible with human rights law [17]. So there is a need to create awareness regarding vaccination in the community. Vaccination session timing was not feasible for some people, so they didn\u2019t prefer to lose their daily wages for vaccines.\nThe limitation of our study is that findings cannot be extended to wider area populations with the same degree of certainty as the research findings are not tested statistically. In our study, we focussed on the understanding and explanation of the dynamics of the implementation of COVID vaccination in rural areas, but we haven\u2019t quantified the coverage and issues. This can be better answered with further research with a mixed-method approach.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, our findings were enablers and barriers for COVID-19 vaccination programs in rural and tribal areas.\u00a0Health system factors like shortage of vaccines and syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc., online digital method of vaccination registration and overcrowding at the initial stage, and inadequate infrastructure were a barrier to vaccination.\u00a0Fear about vaccine adverse events even in healthcare workers and overburdened healthcare workers were also factors affecting vaccination. At the community level, high resistance initially, misconception about the vaccine, and fear about post-vaccination side effects impact the COVID-19 vaccine program in rural and tribal areas.\u00a0The successful vaccination rate among the population needs community leadership and a community-centred approach when conducting outreach and strengthening primary health care in terms of infrastructure, manpower, and healthcare staff capacity building.\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nHuman Ethics\nConsent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.

A qualitative study was planned to understand the barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation program at rural and tribal areas. The study participants were medical officers from rural and tribal areas who actively planned and implemented COVID-19 vaccination at the primary health centre.\u00a0A total of 30 medical officers were interviewed.\u00a0Interview questions were focussed on the planning of COVID-19 vaccination in their area. Other questions were the problem faced during the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program and how it has been tackled.\nResults\nThe factors identified were grouped into three groups: Health system factors, Human resource factors and Community level factors.\u00a0Health system factors like shortage of vaccines and syringes, tablet paracetamol, online digital method of vaccination registration, overcrowding at the initial stage, and inadequate infrastructure were barriers to vaccination. Fear about vaccine adverse events, even in healthcare workers (HCWs), and overburdened healthcare workers were also factors affecting vaccination. At the community level, high resistance initially and misconception about the vaccine, and also the fear about post-vaccination side effects have an impact on the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural and tribal areas.\nConclusion\nThe successful vaccination rate among the population needs community leadership and a community-centred approach when conducting outreach and strengthening primary health care in terms of infrastructure, manpower, and capacity building of healthcare staff.\nKeywords: india, vaccination, outreach, barriers, facilitators, covid-19\nIntroduction\nOne of the greatest advancements in public health of the 20th century was the development of vaccines to prevent communicable diseases, which have prevented millions of deaths and saved billions of dollars [1]. Willingness to be vaccinated varies among individuals and groups based on various factors, including individual beliefs about vaccine safety and efficacy.\u00a0Every Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccination has been reported to cause reluctance, including delays in or outright rejection of the vaccines by some medical professionals [2,3].\nThe national policy includes a thorough, secure, and effective immunization effort. Successful vaccine awareness campaigns typically employ multiple strategies [4]. India set a goal to vaccinate 300 million people against COVID-19 by August 2021, the largest immunization program\u00a0ever. This challenge was announced on January 16, 2021. The homegrown vaccines made by Bharat Biotech, Covishield and Covaxin have been licensed for limited emergency use by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI)\u00a0[5]. India simultaneously planned COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in both urban and rural areas. The designated manpower, such as midwives, auxiliary nurses, etc., from all the states, who played a significant part in the healthcare of people in rural India, were trained in COVID-19 immunization. Midwives and auxiliary nurse midwives, who have a far broader reach in the interior and rural areas, were included in the first set of health workers educated in vaccination skills because India planned to have COVID-19 immunization programs in the urban and rural areas at the same time. The government utilized allied healthcare personnel, including pharmacists and public health professionals, to scale up a vaccination campaign. Primary health centres are in charge of effectively implementing the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural areas [6]. So, the study was planned to seek insight into the challenges faced by health personnel in the effective implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program.\nMaterials and methods\nA qualitative study was planned to understand the barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation program at rural and tribal areas.\u00a0Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of Government Medical College Akola (MH). The study was conducted in a rural area of Akola district, which lies in the western parts of Maharashtra State and belongs to the Vidarbha region, and is said to be one of the progressive districts in the region.

At the community level, high resistance initially, misconception about the vaccine, and fear about post-vaccination side effects impact the COVID-19 vaccine program in rural and tribal areas.\u00a0The successful vaccination rate among the population needs community leadership and a community-centred approach when conducting outreach and strengthening primary health care in terms of infrastructure, manpower, and healthcare staff capacity building.\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nHuman Ethics\nConsent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.

On national health systems, most of the financing comes from general taxation, whereas in social health insurance systems, financing typically comes from a combination of payroll contributions and taxation. Financing is linked to ability-to-pay.

Health insurance is compulsory, but people with an income above a fixed threshold or belonging to a particular professional group (e.g. self-employed people or civil servants) can opt out of SHI coverage and enrol in (substitutive) private health insurance (PHI). About 11 % of the population are covered by PHI; 89 % by SHI. Although coverage is universal for all legal residents and only 0.1 % of the population do not have health insurance, there are still gaps due to financial or administrative barriers (see Section 5.2). The multi-payer SHI system currently consists of 103 sickness funds and 41 PHI companies, and the three biggest sickness funds cover more than one third of the German population.\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cIn Germany, 88\u00a0percent of the population is covered by statutory health insurance, which is financed by financially and organizationally independent statutory health insurance funds, and 9\u00a0percent of the population is privately insured.15\u00a0The guiding principle of the German statutory health insurance system is solidarity regarding both income and provision of services: All insured people contribute a share of their income, irrespective of their health risk, and people are entitled to benefits according to their health needs, irrespective of their socioeconomic status, ability to pay, or location.16\u00a0All employed people earning less than the opt-out threshold, people receiving welfare benefits, and pensioners have mandatory statutory health insurance, and their nonearning dependents are insured free of charge. People with high income and self-employed people can purchase private health insurance or keep the statutory health insurance. Coverage of services is roughly the same in both systems, apart from certain newly launched drugs, which are paid for by private insurance. There is no restriction on patients\u2019 choice of hospitals, and patient copays for hospital stays do not differ across hospitals.\u201d\nSource: Esra Eren Bayindir\u00a0and\u00a0Jonas Schrey\u00f6gg. Public Reporting Of Hospital Quality Measures Has Not Led To Overall Quality Improvement: Evidence From Germany. Health Affairs\u00a02023\u00a042:4,\u00a0566-574\n\u201cThe German health system has a complex governance structure. The federal government defines only the legal framework, while regulatory details are specified in directives issued by the Federal Joint Committee \u2013 the highest self-governing decision-making body in the country. The Committee consists of representatives of associations of sickness funds, physicians, dentists and hospitals, as well as three independent members (plus patient representatives without voting rights). It takes decisions on SHI benefits, reimbursement systems and quality assurance.\u201cThe states (Bundesl\u00e4nder) supervise the self-governing bodies at the regional level and are responsible for hospital planning and investments, as well as medical education. They are also responsible for public health services and the running of public health offices, which gained in importance during the COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, the crisis revealed the challenges faced by federal systems in coordinating and managing the pandemic. Governance mechanisms have been put in place to enable rapid, cross-state measures to respond to the crisis through ordinance authorisations, particularly by the Federal Ministry of Health (Box 1).\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cThe German system provides universal population coverage either through social health insurance (SHI) (almost 90% of the population) or substitutive VHI [Voluntary Health Insurance]. As OOP [Out-Of-Pocket] policies of substitutive VHI vary widely (and data is largely unavailable), we focus on SHI. OOP spending in Germany is related to both direct payments for services not covered by SHI (e.g., over-the-counter drugs) and cost-sharing for SHI covered services, but the relative importance of cost-sharing versus direct payments is not known because of the health system\u2019s accounting methods. OOP spending above reference prices for dental care and medical aids can be substantial; for example, reference prices for dental care cover only about 50% of the costs of standard care. Cost-sharing requirements increased in 2004 for such things as prescription drugs, inpatient care, and physician and dental care, while at the same time adult eyeglasses were excluded from coverage. Since these increased requirements became effective in 2004 they do not affect the average growth rate in the 2004\u20132014 period and therefore do not contradict the observed drop in average growth in 2004\u20132014 compared to the 1994\u20132004 period. The most plausible explanation for the low growth in this period is the fact that in 2013, co-payments for physician visits were discontinued. The most important protection mechanism against OOPs is the exemption of children under 18\u00a0years of age and a maximum cost-sharing limit of 2% of annual income (or 1% for patients with severe chronic conditions). This has remained largely unchanged over the study period.\u201d\nRice, Thomas et al. \u201cRevisiting out-of-pocket requirements: trends in spending, financial access barriers, and policy in ten high-income countries.\u201d BMC health services research vol. 18,1 371. 18 May. 2018, doi:10.1186/s12913-018-3185-8.\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German federal government recently orchestrated a fundamental change to its public health infrastructure. This reconstruction centers around the founding of a National Institute for Prevention and Education in Medicine (Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Pr\u00e4vention und Aufkl\u00e4rung in der Medizin, BIPAM) at the cost of two federal institutions, the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) and the Federal Center for Health Education (Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, BzGA). Thus, the Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit, BMG) plans to dissolve the BzGA and integrate its personnel into the future BIPAM. Further, all RKI research and surveillance activities related to non-communicable diseases, including AI methods development will be transferred into the BIPAM. The RKI responsibilities will solely focus on infectious diseases. According to announced plans of the BMG the primary objective for establishing the BIPAM is to address non-communicable diseases and enhance overall population health. However, the medical specialist training for public health remains non-academic at a state institution. Simultaneously the BMG already replaced two thirds of experts of the permanent commission on vaccination (St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission, STIKO) and determined new procedures for appointing future expert commissioners. With these changes, Germany embarks on an extraordinary reshuffling of its national public health organizations and responsibilities, by fundamentally separating all issues around non-communicable diseases from those of infectious diseases. Germany\u2019s unraveled research tasks of public health authorities however remains unmet. Thus, 2024 marks a pivotal caesura for public health in the modern history of Germany.\u201d\nSource: Savaskan N, Lampl BMJ, Yavuz M, Tinnemann P.

It is the only country in Europe with coexisting SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] and substitutive PHI [Private Health Insurance]. Both schemes are separated along different organizational, regulative and financial lines (Figure 2.1). Care sectors are also separated in terms of organization, governance and financing. Due to separate legislation for individual sectors within public health, ambulatory and inpatient care, as well as in long-term care, there is strong fragmentation of service provision (Figures 2.1 and 2.2).\u201cHealth insurance is compulsory for all citizens and permanent residents, with SHI constituting the main source of financing health care. The multi-payer SHI insurance scheme covered 72.8 million people or 87.7% of the population in 2018. Employees above an opt-out threshold of income, \u20ac 62 550 in 2020, and certain professional groups, e.g. self-employed or civil servants, can opt to enroll in substitutive PHI. Thus, 8.7 million people (or 10.5% of the population) were covered by substitutive PHI (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit (BMG), 2019d; Statistisches Bundesamt, 2019b; Verband der privaten Krankenversicherung, 2019a) (see Section 3.3.1 Coverage for more detail). Another unique feature of the German health care system is that the vast majority of providers serve both insured populations. The few exemptions that are accessible only to those insured under substitutive PHI represent less than 1% of total hospitals in 2018 (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2020g).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i\u2013273.\n\u201cHealth insurance coverage is mandatory for the entire population. Coverage is virtually universal and less than 1% of the population is not insured. Some groups of people can choose between publicly financed coverage provided through the statutory health insurance scheme and privately financed substitutive coverage provided by private insurers. Access to substitutive private coverage is restricted to civil servants, self-employed individuals and high-income employees (the annual earnings threshold was \u20ac50,850 in 2012). These groups may opt out of the statutory scheme, but once they do so the return options are limited. For example, employees may only return to the statutory scheme when their earnings fall below the threshold. Individuals with substitutive private coverage who are older than 55 years are prohibited from returning to the statutory scheme.\u201d\nSource: Stefan Gre\u00df. \u201cGermany.\u201d In Voluntary health insurance in Europe: Country experience [Internet].

SHI and PHI (as well as the two long-term care insurance systems) use the same providers\u2014that is, hospitals and physicians treat both statutorily and privately insured patients, unlike those in many other countries.\u201cWithin the legal framework set by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Joint Committee has wide-ranging regulatory power to determine the services to be covered by sickness funds and to set quality measures for providers (see below). To the extent possible, coverage decisions are based on evidence from health technology assessments and comparative-effectiveness reviews. The Federal Joint Committee is supported by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency (IQWiG), a foundation legally charged with evaluating the cost-effectiveness of drugs with added therapeutic benefits, and the Institute for Quality and Transparency (IQTiG), which is responsible for intersectoral quality assurance. It has 13 voting members: five from the Federal Association of Sickness Funds, two each from the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation, one from the Federal Association of SHI Dentists, and three who are unaffiliated. Five patient representatives have an advisory role but no vote. Representatives of patient organizations have the right to participate in different decision-making bodies\u2014for example, the subcommittees of the Federal Joint Committee.\u201cThe Federal Association of Sickness Funds works with the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation to develop the SHI ambulatory care fee schedule and the DRG catalogue, which are then adopted by bilateral joint committees.\u201d\nSource: Commonwealth Fund.

Its tasks include developing laws and drawing up administrative guidelines for the self-governing activities within the health care system. The Ministry of Health directs a number of institutions and agencies responsible for dealing with higher-level issues of public health, such as the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (\u201cBundesinstitut f\u00fcr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte\u201d \u2013 BfArM) and the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI).

The Paul Ehrlich Institute is responsible for approving vaccines.\u201cWhen it comes to matters concerning statutory health insurance, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) is the highest decision-making body within the self-governing health care system. It includes members representing doctors, dentists, psychotherapists, the statutory insurers, hospitals and patients.

All provide the same services as defined by the G-BA (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) or the different umbrella organizations of the SHFs (referred to in the following the Statutory Health Insurer\u2019s organizations (SHIs). Private insurance covers nearly the same services but allows additional benefits (e.g. first class service) \u2013 there is competition between private insurers. Since 2004, decision-making in statutory health insurance has been integrated into a trans-sector federal joint committee that is supported by an independent institute for quality and efficiency in health care, the German IQWiG. Since 2008, according to the new Competition Enhancement Act, the IQWiG has to evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of pharmaceuticals in Germany based on international accepted guidelines in evidence based medicine and in health economics.\u201d\nSource: ISPOR\u2014The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research.

Last accessed Oct. 2, 2019.\n\u201cThe German health care system is divided into three main areas: outpatient care, inpatient care (the hospital sector), and rehabilitation facilities.\u201cThe institutions responsible for running the health care system include the associations and representatives of various providers and professions, health insurers, regulatory bodies, the Federal Ministry of Health, patient organizations and self-help groups.\u201cThe basic principles of the health care system\u201cThe health care system in Germany is based on four basic principles:\u201cCompulsory insurance: Everyone must have statutory health insurance (\u201cgesetzliche Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 GKV) provided that their gross earnings are under a fixed limit (\u201cVersicherungspflichtgrenze\u201d). Anyone who earns more than that can choose to have private insurance (\u201cprivate Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 PKV).\u201cFunding through insurance premiums: Health care is financed mostly from the premiums paid by insured employees and their employers. Tax revenue surpluses also contribute. To give you an idea of what this means: State-funded health care systems like those in Great Britain or Sweden draw on tax revenue. In market-oriented systems such as that in the United States, many people have to carry the costs of treatment and loss of earnings due to illness themselves, or have to get private health insurance.\u201cPrinciple of solidarity: In the German health care system, statutory health insurance members jointly carry the individual risks of the costs of medical care in the event of illness. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care and continued payment of wages when ill \u2013 regardless of their income and premium level. The premiums are based on income. This means that the rich can help the poor, and the healthy can help the ill. However, these premiums are only calculated based on a percentage scale up to a certain income level (\u201cBeitragsbemessungsgrenze\u201d). Anyone earning more than this amount pays the same maximum premium.\u201cPrinciple of self-governance: While the German state sets the conditions for medical care, the further organization and financing of individual medical services is the responsibility of the self-governing bodies within the health care system. These are made up of members representing doctors and dentists, psychotherapists, hospitals, insurers and the insured people. The Federal Joint Committee (\u201cGemeinsamer Bundesausschuss\u201d or G-BA \u2013 please also see below: \u201cStructure and institutions of the health care system\u201d) is the highest entity of self-governance within the statutory health insurance system.\u201d \nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

At EUR 1,221 per capita for outpatient care and EUR 1,212 for inpatient care in 2019, these figures are above the EU averages (EUR 1,022 for outpatient and EUR 1,010 for inpatient care), as was Germany\u2019s spending across all categories of health care (Figure 8). However, overall spending has increased more slowly than the EU average since 2016, and the distribution of resources across different functions is close to the EU averages at around 27 % each for inpatient and outpatient care (EU: 29.1 % and 29.5 %), 19 % for long-term care (LTC) (EU: 16 %), 19 % for medical goods (EU: 18 %) and 3 % for prevention (EU: 3 %). Over recent years, LTC spending has grown more strongly than other expenditure categories. In 2015, Germany spent EUR 637 per capita on LTC (the health component); this increased to EUR 849 in 2019. The 2017 reform of LTC increased spending as it expanded the benefits package and increased the number of recipients entitled to LTC services.\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cGermany spends a substantial amount of its wealth on health. Total expenditure on health amounted to 11.7% of GDP in 2018 according to data of the Federal Statistical Office. According to WHO data, per capita health expenditure more than doubled between 2000 and 2018, from US$ 2687 (adjusted for differences in purchasing power) to US$ 6098, which ranks Germany third in comparison to other WHO Europe countries in 2018 (after Switzerland and Norway) (World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, 2020) (see Section 3.1 Health expenditure). By OECD data, health expenditure in Germany as a share of GDP was the fourth highest share among OECD countries (after the United States, Switzerland and Norway) and per capita spending was way above the OECD36 average of US$ 3994 in 2018 (OECD, 2019).\u201cPer capita expenditure on health in Germany rose by an average of 2.5% per annum in real terms between 2013 and 2018 (up from 2.1% p.a. between 2008 and 2013). In comparison to other OECD countries, this was a relatively large increase during this period, and higher than in the Netherlands (0.5%), France (0.8%), Austria (1.0%), Switzerland (2.1%) and the OECD36 average (2.4%). According to OECD calculations, average per capita health expenditure growth is projected at 1.9% a year between 2015 and 2030, which would reflect a moderate increase compared to other OECD countries (OECD, 2019). The pace of health expenditure growth is partly attributable to the comparatively large human, technical and infrastructural resources in the German health care system and a high level of activity (e.g. in terms of consultations, hospital cases, consumption of pharmaceuticals). In addition, the full implementation of reforms to the long-term care insurance (LTCI) scheme, such as the broadening of eligibility criteria and benefits, and a rapidly ageing population, represent additional pressures on the sustainability of financing (see Section 5.8 Long-term care).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R.

Sickness funds offer selectable tariffs with a range of deductibles and no-claims bonuses. Preventive services do not count toward the deductible. SHI-contracted physicians are not allowed to charge above the fee schedule for services in the SHI benefit catalogue. However, a list of \u201cindividual health services\u201d outside the comprehensive range of SHI coverage may be offered to patients paying out of pocket.\u201cSafety nets: Children under 18 years of age are exempt from cost-sharing. For adults, there is an annual cap on cost-sharing equal to 2 percent of household income; part of a household\u2019s income is excluded from this calculation for additional family members. About 0.3 million of those insured under SHI exceeded the 2 percent cap in 2014 and were exempted from further cost-sharing. The cap is lowered to 1 percent of annual gross income for qualifying chronically ill people; to qualify, those people have to demonstrate that they attended recommended counseling or screening procedures prior to becoming ill. Nearly 6.3 million people, or around 9 percent of all the SHI-insured, benefited from this regulation in 2014.10 Unemployed people contribute to SHI in proportion to their unemployment entitlements. For the long-term unemployed, government contributes on their behalf.\u201d \nSource: Commonwealth Fund. International Health System Profiles: Germany. From the web, last accessed Sept. 30, 2019.\n\u201cAllocative efficiency indicates the extent to which an appropriate mix of services or interventions are purchased to maximize population health outcomes. In Germany the allocation of resources at the federal level mostly reflects the bargaining process between corporatist bodies, rather than a restrictive budget plan. Although there are mechanisms in place to secure the (cost-)effectiveness of benefits covered under SHI using tools such as Health Technology Assessment (see Section 2.7 Regulation), there is no priority setting by e.g. formulating goals. Pooled resources are reallocated among the sickness funds according to a morbidity-based risk-adjustment scheme, by which sickness funds have to cover all costs (see Section 3.3 Overview of the statutory financing system). However, the details of care provision and reimbursement are consequently negotiated between corporatist bodies and are not guided by an overarching strategic programme at the national level (instead, budgets are determined by historic spending levels).\u201cInternational comparisons of health expenditure by function show that Germany spent 27.2% on curative and rehabilitative care in inpatient and day care settings in 2018, which is higher than in the Netherlands (24.4%), Denmark (25.1%) and Switzerland (25.3%), but lower than the EU average (30%), France (31.5%) and Austria (33.3%) (OECD, 2020b). In more detail, Germany spent \u20ac 1169 per inhabitant on hospital care in 2018 (up from \u20ac 691 in 2000), \u20ac 428 on inpatient long-term care (up from \u20ac 211 in 2000) and \u20ac 122 on preventive and rehabilitative institutions (up from \u20ac 92 in 2000).\u201cGermany spent considerably less on ambulatory care than other EU countries. For instance, France (27.2%), Austria (29%), the Netherlands (29.2%), Switzerland (33.4%) and Denmark (34.9%) spent a higher share of health expenditure on ambulatory care, and the EU average is 31.4% (OECD, 2020b). In 2018, \u20ac 662 was spent per inhabitant for ambulatory care practices (up from \u20ac 383 in 2000), \u20ac 330 for dental care practices (up from \u20ac 227), \u20ac 257 for ambulatory long-term care (up from \u20ac 83) and \u20ac 206 on other allied health professionals (up from \u20ac 73).\u201cPharmaceuticals and medical devices accounted for another 13.7% of current health expenditures in 2018 (the fourth highest), according to the Federal Statistical Office. OECD data give a higher estimation for this category, with pharmaceuticals and medical devices representing the third highest budget item (19.3%). Under this data source, comparative countries like France (18.4%), Austria (168%), Switzerland (14.8%) and the Netherlands (11.5%) spent less on pharmaceuticals than Germany, while Denmark (10%) recorded almost half of the German costs (OECD, 2020b).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i\u2013273.\n\u201cA large part of health care expenditure in Germany is derived from the SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] system (see Table 3.2). Contributions to the 105 sickness funds constitute the major system of financing health care. The sickness funds are responsible for collecting contributions, which they transfer to a central reallocation pool known as the Gesundheitsfonds, which is responsible for pooling and reallocating the revenues according to a risk-adjustment mechanism (see Section 3.3.3 Pooling and allocation of funds).\u201cGeneral tax revenue is also used for various purposes in the health care system. All tax-based budgets, at federal as well as state level, are determined by legislatures acting on proposals from their governments. In addition, the Hospital Financing Act stipulates that investment costs should be paid from state taxes as well as by owners of public, private not-for-profit and private for-profit hospitals, if listed in the state\u2019s hospital requirement plan. Therefore, states receive tax money for investments in their hospitals (see Section 3.7.1 Paying for health services).\u201cTaxes as a source of health care financing have decreased throughout the last decade, falling from 10.8% of total health expenditure in 1996 to 4.2% in 2018. The most substantial decrease has been observed in spending on long-term care (about 50%), reflecting the unburdening of municipal budgets after the introduction of statutory long-term care insurance (see Section 5.8 Long-term care). Nevertheless, other spending on investments has decreased as well. Altogether, general government and statutory public sources accounted for 73.5% of current expenditure on health. Private sources accounted for a total 26.5% of total current expenditure: this includes direct out-of-pocket payments made by private households (13.6%). Private insurers financed 8.7%, which includes expenditures for substitutive/comprehensive health insurance, complementary health insurance and long-term care insurance.\u201cIt should be noted that the largest tax-financed item \u2013 the subsidies for SHI \u2013 is not declared as such in the fiscal statistics. Sickness funds receive a fixed amount from the federal budget for several benefits relevant to family policies: maternity benefits, sick-pay for parents caring for sick children, in-vitro fertilization, sterilization for contraceptive purposes, and prescription-only contraception up to the age of 21 and legal abortions. The federal government transfers its subsidy to the central reallocation pool (see Section 3.3.3 Pooling and allocation of funds). In 2012 the federal subsidy was \u20ac 14 billion. In order to consolidate the federal budget, the subsidy was temporarily reduced to \u20ac 10.5 billion in 2013 and \u20ac 11.5 billion in 2015. In 2016 it was again at \u20ac 14 billion and from 2017 it has been set at \u20ac 14.5 billion annually (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit (BMG), 2020j).

Revenues and outlays alike increased from 2023 totals: Revenues rose by 11 percent, or $479 billion, and outlays increased by 10 percent, or $617 billion. Revenues in all major categories, but notably individual income taxes, were greater than they were in fiscal year 2023. The largest increase in outlays was for education ($309 billion). Net outlays for interest on the public debt rose by $239\u00a0billion (or 34 percent) to a total of $949 billion. Those amounts differ only slightly from the amounts CBO estimated and discussed in last month\u2019s Monthly Budget Review.\nTable 1.Totals, Fiscal Years 2019 to 2024Billions of Dollars\u00a0201920202021202220232024Receipts3,463\u00a03,421\u00a04,047\u00a04,897\u00a04,439\u00a04,919\u00a0Outlays4,447\u00a06,554\u00a06,822\u00a06,273\u00a06,135\u00a06,752\u00a0Deficit (\u2212)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amount\u2212984\u00a0\u22123,132\u00a0\u22122,775\u00a0\u22121,376\u00a0\u22121,695\u00a0\u22121,833\u00a0\u00a0Percentage of Gross Domestic Product\u22124.6\u00a0\u221214.7\u00a0\u221212.1\u00a0\u22125.4\u00a0\u22126.2\u00a0\u22126.4\u00a0Data sources: Congressional Budget Office; Department of the Treasury; Office of Management and Budget.\u00a0\nIn 2024, the deficit was equal to 6.4 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), an increase from 6.2 percent of GDP in 2023. The 2024 deficit as a share of GDP is greater than the 50\u2011year average of 3.8 percent and has been exceeded only six times since 1946 (from 2009 through 2012 and in 2020 and 2021). Compared with the size of the economy, federal debt held by the public also increased in 2024\u2014rising to 97.8 percent of GDP from 96.0 percent of GDP at the end of fiscal year 2023.\nOutlays in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 were affected because October 1 (the first day of the fiscal year) fell on a weekend in each of those years. As a result, certain payments were shifted into the prior fiscal year\u2014$64 billion from 2023 into 2022 and $75 billion from 2024 into 2023. If not for those shifts, the deficit in 2024 would have been 13 percent larger\u2014instead of 8 percent larger\u2014than it was in 2023.\nThe 2023 deficit of $1.7 trillion would have been larger if not for the recording of budgetary effects related to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn a plan the Administration announced in 2022 to cancel many borrowers\u2019 outstanding student loans.1 If those effects, and the effects of timing shifts, were excluded for fiscal year 2023, the deficit for that year would have been $2.0\u00a0trillion instead of $1.7 trillion. Thus, without the savings related to the unwinding of the proposed debt cancellation (and excluding the effects of timing shifts in 2023 and 2024), CBO estimates that the\u00a0federal deficit would have been $106 billion smaller in 2024 than in 2023.\nThe deficit in 2024 was $82 billion (or 4 percent), smaller than the shortfall estimated in CBO\u2019s most recent baseline budgetary projections, which were issued in June 2024.2 Revenues were greater than CBO projected in that baseline\u2014by $29 billion (or 1\u00a0percent) and outlays were less than projected, by $53 billion (or 1 percent).\nTotal Receipts: Up by 11 Percent in Fiscal Year 2024\nReceipts totaled $4.9 trillion during fiscal year 2024, CBO estimates\u2014$479 billion more than during fiscal year 2023. Receipts increased from 16.2 percent of GDP in 2023 to 17.1 percent in 2024, just below the average of 17.3 percent for the past 50 years. A portion of that increase is the result of the postponement until fiscal year 2024 of various 2023 tax deadlines for some taxpayers in federally declared disaster areas.\n\nReported receipts from individual income taxes, the largest source of revenue, increased by $250 billion (or 11 percent). Such collections increased from 8.0\u00a0percent of GDP in 2023 to 8.4 percent in 2024, remaining close to the average of 8.0 percent over the past 50 years.\nIndividual income taxes withheld from workers\u2019 paychecks increased by $72 billion (or\u00a04\u00a0percent), reflecting increases in wages and salaries.\nNonwithheld income tax payments increased by $104 billion (or 12\u00a0percent), relative to payments in the same period in fiscal year 2023. That increase includes the effects of delayed payments from taxpayers in areas affected by natural disasters for whom, beginning in February 2023, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) postponed some 2023 filing deadlines. Most of those payments were due by November 2023.\nThe increase in nonwithheld income tax payments would have been even larger were it not for an adjustment of $8.5 billion in fuel tax refunds and credits that were recorded originally in fiscal year 2023. In that year, the IRS reported payments of fuel tax refunds and credits that were not actually paid, incorrectly reducing amounts reported for excise tax collections and increasing amounts reported for collections of individual income taxes. A recertification of the fuel tax credit in July\u00a02024 resulted in an increase in the reported amounts of excise tax collections for that year and a reduction in the amount recorded for collections of individual income taxes. As\u00a0a result, the year-over-year change in individual income taxes was reduced by $17\u00a0billion.\nIndividual income tax refunds declined by $74 billion (or 20 percent), in part because of\u00a0a moratorium placed on new claims for the Employee Retention Tax Credit, which increased individual income tax refunds in\u00a02023. The IRS announced the moratorium in September 2023. In August 2024, the IRS began processing claims while continuing efforts to identify improper and ineligible claims.\n\n\n\nTable 2.Total ReceiptsBillions of DollarsMajor SourceFY\u00a02022FY\u00a02023FY\u00a02024Percentage ChangeFrom 2023 to 2024Individual Income Taxes2,632\u00a02,176\u00a02,426\u00a011.5\u00a0Payroll Taxes1,484\u00a01,614\u00a01,710\u00a05.9\u00a0Corporate Income Taxes425\u00a0420\u00a0530\u00a026.3\u00a0Other Receipts357\u00a0229\u00a0253\u00a010.7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total4,897\u00a04,439\u00a04,919\u00a010.8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Percentage of Gross Domestic Product19.2\u00a016.2\u00a017.1\u00a0n.a.\u00a0Data sources: Congressional Budget Office; Department of the Treasury; Office of Management and BudgetFY = fiscal year; n.a. = not applicable.\u00a0\n\nReceipts recorded from payroll (social insurance) taxes, the second-largest revenue source,\u00a0rose by $95 billion (or 6 percent), remaining at 5.9\u00a0percent of GDP and close to the 6.0\u00a0percent average for the past 50 years. Payroll tax collections typically rise or fall with rising or falling wages and salaries, which constitute the largest part of the payroll tax base. Unemployment insurance receipts (one type of payroll tax) declined by $1 billion (or\u00a02\u00a0percent).\nReceipts from corporate income taxes increased by $110 billion (or 26 percent), from 1.5\u00a0percent of GDP in 2023 to 1.8 percent in 2024\u2014equal to the average of the past 50 years. However, a significant part of that increase was caused by the IRS\u2019s postponement until November 2023 of the deadline for payments that ordinarily would have been due in fiscal year 2023 for many corporations in areas affected by natural disasters, particularly in California.\nReported receipts from other sources rose, on net, by $24 billion (or 11 percent). Most of that increase is the result of the recertification of fuel tax refunds and credits; without that effect, receipts from other sources would have shown an increase of only 3 percent in 2024. Regardless of that timing effect, receipts from other sources remained below 1 percent of GDP and below the 50\u2011year average of 1.5 percent of GDP.\nExcise taxes in 2024 increased by $26 billion (or 34 percent), compared with 2023, largely as a result of the recertification of fuel tax credits.\nRemittances from the Federal Reserve increased by $3 billion, from less than $1 billion in 2023. Those amounts represented significantly less than 0.1 percent of GDP. Those amounts are well below the $107 billion remitted in 2022 and also well below the 50\u2011year average of 0.3 percent of GDP. Since 2022, higher short-term interest rates have raised the central bank\u2019s interest expenses above its income, eliminating the profits of most of the Federal Reserve banks.\nMiscellaneous fees and fines increased by $2 billion (or 4 percent).\nCustoms duties declined by $3 billion (or 4 percent).\nEstate and gift taxes declined by $2 billion (or 6 percent).\n\n\n\nTotal Outlays: Up by 10 Percent in Fiscal Year 2024\nOutlays in fiscal year 2024 were $6.8 trillion\u2014$617 billion (or 10\u00a0percent) more than in 2023. In total, outlays were equal to 23.4 percent of GDP in 2024, down from the recent high of 30.7\u00a0percent in 2020, but still above the 50-year average of 21.1 percent.\nTable 3.Total OutlaysBillions of Dollars\u00a0\u00a0Percentage ChangeFrom 2023 to 2024Major Program or CategoryFY\u00a02022FY 2023FY 2024ActualAdjustedaSocial Security Benefits1,206\u00a01,342\u00a01,448\u00a07.9\u00a07.9\u00a0Medicareb752\u00a0844\u00a0870\u00a03.1\u00a09.4\u00a0Medicaid592\u00a0616\u00a0618\u00a00.3\u00a00.3\u00a0\u00a0Subtotal, Largest MandatorySpending Programs2,550\u00a02,802\u00a02,935\u00a04.8\u00a06.7\u00a0\u00a0Department of Education639\u00a0\u221241\u00a0268\u00a0n.m.\u00a0n.m.\u00a0Veterans Affairs274\u00a0301\u00a0325\u00a08.0\u00a013.8\u00a0Refundable Tax Creditsc292\u00a0171\u00a0199\u00a016.2\u00a016.2\u00a0FDIC\u22129\u00a092\u00a037\u00a0\u221259.5\u00a0\u221259.5\u00a0U.S Coronavirus Refundable Credits29\u00a052\u00a01\u00a0\u221298.5\u00a0\u221298.5\u00a0PBGC2\u00a040\u00a012\u00a0\u221270.2\u00a0\u221270.2\u00a0Food and Nutrition Service192\u00a0171\u00a0147\u00a0\u221214.0\u00a0\u221214.0\u00a0DoD\u2014Militaryd726\u00a0776\u00a0826\u00a06.5\u00a07.2\u00a0Net Interest on the Public Debt534\u00a0710\u00a0949\u00a033.7\u00a033.7\u00a0Other1,044\u00a01,061\u00a01,051\u00a0\u22120.9\u00a00.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total6,273\u00a06,135\u00a06,752\u00a010.1\u00a011.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Percentage of Gross Domestic Product24.6\u00a022.4\u00a023.4\u00a0n.a.\u00a0n.a.\u00a0Data sources: Congressional Budget Office; Department of the Treasury; Office of Management and Budget.DoD = Department of Defense; FDIC = Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; FY = fiscal year; PBGC = Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; n.a. = not applicable; n.m. = not meaningful.a. Adjusted amounts exclude the effects of shifting payments that otherwise would have been made on a weekend. If not for those timing shifts, total outlays would have been $6,123 billion in 2023 and $6,827 billion in 2024. (In 2022, total outlays excluding timing shifts would have been $6,209 billion.)b. Medicare outlays are net of offsetting receipts.c. Recovery rebates, earned income tax credit, child tax credit, premium tax credits, and American Opportunity Tax Credit.d. Excludes a small amount of spending by DoD on civil programs.\u00a0\nOutlays in 2023 and 2024 were affected by the shifts of payments from October\u00a01, 2023, and October 1, 2024\u2014both of which fell on a weekend\u2014into the previous fiscal year. Because of those shifts, outlays were lower by $75 billion in 2024 and higher by a net of $11\u00a0billion in 2023. If not for those shifts, the increase in outlays from 2023 to 2024 would have been larger\u2014$703\u00a0billion rather than $617 billion. (The discussion below reflects adjustments to exclude the effects of those timing shifts.)\nIf the 2024 savings related to the unwinding of the proposed cancellation of student loans (discussed below) and the effects of timing shifts are excluded, CBO estimates that outlays in 2024 would have been $373\u00a0billion (or 6\u00a0percent) greater than in 2023.\nOutlays by the Department of Education increased by $309 billion, largely because the Administration recorded a decrease of $330\u00a0billion in August 2023 to reflect the June 2023 Supreme Court decision prohibiting the cancellation of outstanding loans for many borrowers. Excluding the reversal of that proposed debt cancellation, net outlays by the department decreased by $21 billion, primarily because increases in the estimated costs of outstanding loans recorded in fiscal year 2023 were larger than the increases recorded for those costs in 2024. Partly offsetting that decrease, the costs recorded for loans originated in 2024 were higher than the costs of loans originated in 2023. The totals do not include the costs of the debt cancellation policy described in a proposed rule published in April 2024; that rule is currently paused by litigation.\nThe next-largest increase in outlays was for net interest on the public debt. Those outlays rose substantially\u2014increasing by $239\u00a0billion (or\u00a034\u00a0percent)\u2014primarily because interest rates were significantly higher in fiscal year 2024 than they were in fiscal year 2023.\nOutlays for the largest mandatory spending programs increased by $186 billion (or\u00a07\u00a0percent):\n\nSpending for Social Security benefits rose by $106 billion (or 8 percent) because of increases in the average benefit payment (stemming mostly from cost-of-living adjustments) and in the number of beneficiaries.\nMedicare outlays increased, on net, by $78 billion (or 9 percent) because of increased enrollment and higher payment rates for services.\nMedicaid outlays increased by $2 billion (or less than 1 percent) because states have largely completed reassessing the eligibility of enrollees who remained in the program for the duration of the coronavirus public health emergency. (The continuous-enrollment requirement ended on March 31, 2023.) Despite millions of disenrollments during the period in which states reassessed eligibility, Medicaid outlays rose in 2024 because per-person costs for enrollees remaining on Medicaid were greater in 2024 than they were in 2023.\n\nOutlays increased in several other areas:\n\nSpending by the Department of Defense was $56 billion (or 7 percent) greater than in fiscal year 2023; the largest increases were for research and development and operation and maintenance.\nSpending by the Department of Veterans Affairs increased by $41 billion (or 14 percent), mostly because of increased spending per person and veterans\u2019 increased use of health care facilities.\nOutlays for certain refundable tax credits increased by $28 billion (or 16\u00a0percent).3 Those outlays include subsidies for health insurance purchased through the marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act, which were boosted by higher enrollments.\nNet outlays by the Department of Energy (included in \u201cOther\u201d in Table 3) increased by $15\u00a0billion (or 43 percent), primarily because in fiscal year 2023 the Administration sold a substantial amount of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. No such receipts were recorded in 2024. From October 2023 through May 2024, the Administration spent $1 billion to purchase oil to replenish the reserve.\n\nOutlays declined in several areas:\n\nOutlays of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) decreased by $55 billion (or\u00a060\u00a0percent). Outlays in fiscal year 2023 were $92 billion as the FDIC began to resolve two major bank failures that occurred in March 2023. The FDIC\u2019s outlays totaled $37 billion during fiscal year 2024 while that agency continued to resolve those failures along with four more that occurred after March 2023. Starting in June 2024, the FDIC began charging special assessments to recover the losses that resulted from covering uninsured depositors at two of the failed institutions. Over the next decade, the FDIC expects to continue to recover much of the amounts spent by liquidating the failed banks\u2019 assets and by collecting higher premiums from FDIC-insured institutions.\nOutlays related to U.S. Coronavirus Refundable Credits, a group of temporary tax credits to help employers cover the costs of sick and family leave, employee retention, and continuation of health insurance for certain workers, decreased by $51 billion (or 98\u00a0percent). That result is attributable in part to the IRS\u2019s moratorium on processing claims for the Employee Retention Tax Credit.\nNet spending by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation decreased by $28\u00a0billion (or\u00a070\u00a0percent) primarily because of a decline in onetime payments to certain multiemployer pension plans under the Special Financial Assistance Program. Such payments amounted to $15\u00a0billion in fiscal year 2024, compared with $46 billion during 2023.\nSpending by the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service decreased by $24\u00a0billion (or 14 percent), in part because emergency allotments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ended in March 2023.\nOutlays from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (also in \u201cOther\u201d) declined by $14 billion (or 50 percent), as expenditures decreased for pandemic-related activities.\n\nEstimated Deficit in October 2024: $255 Billion\nThe federal government incurred a deficit of $255 billion in October 2024, CBO estimates\u2014$189\u00a0billion more than the shortfall recorded last October. Revenues were lower this October (the first month of fiscal year 2025) than a year ago and outlays were higher.\nRevenues in October 2024 were $77 billion less than they were last October, when individual and corporate income taxes had been boosted by deferred payments. Outlays in October 2023 were affected by shifts in the timing of certain federal payments that otherwise would have been due on October 1, which fell on a weekend (those payments were made in September 2023, the last month of fiscal year 2023). If not for those shifts, the increase in outlays in October compared with the same month last year would have been smaller\u2014$39 billion rather than $112 billion. Correspondingly, the increase in the deficit for October also would have been smaller\u2014$116\u00a0billion rather than $189 billion.\nActual Surplus in September 2024: $64 Billion\nThe Treasury Department reported a surplus of $64\u00a0billion for September\u2014$1 billion more than CBO estimated last month, on the basis of the Daily Treasury Statements, in the Monthly Budget Review: September 2024.\nEach month, CBO issues an analysis of federal spending and revenues for the previous month and the fiscal year to date.

      "The Cost of Common Surgeries Compared\nUpdated: 13 September 2024\nAustralia\u2019s healthcare system is divided into two distinct sectors. Private and public. With the public system, public patients are covered by Medicare and often do not have many out-of-pocket fees. The downside to Medicare is that they do not cover every procedure. The private system has more freedom in choice and a faster expectation regarding the surgery date. The downside to this system is that it is often expensive and requires a good health insurance policy that will cover all the associated costs that Medicare cannot.\nKey facts\nCompare Health Insurance Quotes\nProtect what\u2019s most important to you.

Please consider the PDS before purchasing any products.\nUnderstanding Surgery Costs in Australia\nSurgeries are classified into three distinct groups. Urgent, elective and cosmetic.\u00a0Understanding each surgery type will assist you in knowing if your health insurance policy covers it.\u00a0Let\u2019s look closely at these surgery types, the difference between each and why they are necessary.\nMedicare and surgery\nMedicare is free health insurance for all Australian residents. Medicare assists in covering most fees at a public hospital and some at a private hospital.\u00a0Medicare\u00a0does not cover the costs of accommodation and theatre at private hospitals. Private health insurance is important because it creates a safety blanket between you and unforeseen costs. Different health insurance policies are tailored to different requirements. Before any procedure, you must speak to your health insurance provider to\u00a0understand the associated coverage and what out-of-pocket costs can be expected.\nPrivate Surgery and Associated Costs\nPrivate health insurance\u00a0covers any costs that Medicare does not. This may include accommodation, theatre and ambulance costs. Private health insurance offers three packages: Hospital, Extras and Combined. Hospital policies cover costs associated with being a private patient in a private hospital. Extras policies cover out-of-hospital costs that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover, as well as ambulance cover for those who live in a state that does not provide ambulance cover. Combined cover is an option that merges both hospital and extras policies. Identifying your personal requirements will assist you in choosing the health insurance policy that meets your needs.\nWhen the costs of your procedure are larger than your policy\u2019s coverage, you will often need to pay for it out-of-pocket or as a copayment. The medical gap scheme assists you in this situation. This is usually a result of specialist fees, bulk billing availability and the services you need. The amount owed is referred to as \u2018the gap\u2019. Most private health insurance providers have policies that include coverage for any gaps that may occur.\u00a0The amount of assistance provided for gap costs varies between health insurance providers.\nAdvantages of private health insurance\nAnalysis of Costs for Top 10 Surgical Procedures\nCataract Surgery\nCataract surgery is a procedure that involves the removal of the eye\u2019s lens and replacing it with an artificial lens.\u00a0The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $2000 in specialist fees and $2400 in hospital fees. Private health insurance will typically cover the full hospital fee, depending on your coverage type.\u00a0\nFor private patients requiring cataract surgery with a glaucoma stent in a private hospital, the average out-of-pocket payment is $490 and $370 for private patients needing general cataract surgery. The average expected costs for uninsured patients can range from $1700 to $2500 per eye. The cost may fluctuate depending on the chosen artificial lens, hospital, and location. Medicare provides cover for this procedure.\u00a0Medicare will pay for 80% of the involved costs, with the patient needing to pay the remaining 20%.\nGastroscopy\nGastroscopy is a procedure that utilises a small and thin flexible tube to examine the upper digestive tract.\u00a0This procedure is used to visualise the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and rule out possible conditions such as peptic ulcers and gastritis. The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $940 for specialist fees and $530 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure receive an average out-of-pocket cost of $140.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $370. This out-of-pocket cost will fluctuate based on your policy. Medicare will pay an average of $420 towards the procedure, with the rest being covered by your private health insurer.\nKnee Replacement\nKnee replacement surgery involves the removal and replacement of diseased, worn-out or damaged knee joint areas.\u00a0The replacement is usually an artificial piece that acts just as a knee joint would and lowers the overall pain a patient may feel while restoring movement to the designated area. The average out-of-pocket cost of this procedure in Australia is around $4,800 for specialist fees and $ 18,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $680.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $3900 but fluctuates based on the chosen policy.\nHeart Angiogram with or without Heart Catheterization\nA heart angiogram is a procedure in which an X-ray is used to view the blood supply to the heart.\u00a0This is to check if the patient has any heart-related issues that need rectifying. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2000 for specialist fees and $ 4,200 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $40.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $490.\nCesarean Section\nA cesarean section, also known as a C-section, is a\u00a0pregnancy-related procedure that allows the baby to be delivered through an incision made on the mother\u2019s abdomen.\u00a0This usually occurs when the healthcare provider believes it is safer for the mother, baby, or both. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 3,500 for specialist fees and $ 7,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $450.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $570.\nCholecystectomy\nA cholecystectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a patient\u2019s gallbladder.\u00a0This surgery is often done to remove gallstones and any complications they may cause. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2,800 for specialist fees and $4,500 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $400.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,200.\nCoronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)\nA coronary artery bypass graft is a surgical procedure that improves oxygen supply and blood flow to the heart.\u00a0\u00a0This surgery is usually done to assist with coronary artery disease, which causes a buildup of plaque in the heart\u2019s arteries. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $15000 for specialist fees and $ 35,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $470.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,600.\nHip Replacement Surgery\nA hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which\u00a0damaged, diseased or worn-out hip joint areas are removed and replaced with an artificial piece.\u00a0The artificial piece works in the same manner that a healthy hip joint would and aims to reduce pain in the patient\u2019s hip area while also increasing the area\u2019s mobility. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 5,000 for specialist fees and $ 20,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $690.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 4,000.\nBreast Biopsy\nA breast biopsy is a procedure in which\u00a0a sample of the breast tissue is removed and tested for abnormal cells.\u00a0This test rules out the possibility of breast cancer or any other condition. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 2,400 for specialist fees and $1,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $500.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 100.\nVentral Hernia Repair\nA ventral hernia repair is a surgical procedure in which the surgeon makes an\u00a0incision into the abdomen above the hernia and pushes any protruding intestines back into the abdomen to repair the muscle wall.\u00a0The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 800 for specialist fees and $3 300 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $380.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 1,000.\nCompare common surgeries\nSource: Medical Costs Finder (October 2023; The prices above are estimates for specialists fees; Please refer to your medical professional for an accurate cost estimation)\nHow Private Health Insurance Can Assist with Surgery Costs\nPrivate health insurance is designed to assist patients with any fees that they may have during the course of the necessary procedure.\u00a0Depending on the coverage type, this may include ambulance, extras, and hospital cover.\nThere may be an instance in which the total cost of the procedure is higher than the coverage provided by both Medicare and your Private Health Insurance Provider. Depending on your chosen provider, the policy\u00a0will often provide assistance in the form of gap cover that partially or completely lowers the final amount that you will have to\u00a0pay out-of-pocket.\u00a0The assistance amount will vary based on the provider and policy that you have chosen.\nHow Medicare Works with Private Health Insurance\nMedicare typically covers 75% of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee for procedures performed in private hospitals, but this doesn\u2019t include hospital accommodation or theater fees. Private health insurance helps cover the remaining costs, but the level of coverage depends on your plan. It\u2019s crucial to understand the limits of your policy, including any gaps you might need to pay out of pocket.\nWhat is the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS)?\nThe Medicare Benefits Schedule is a list of medical services covered by Medicare, including surgery, and specifies the amount Medicare will pay for each service. When you have surgery, Medicare covers 75% of the MBS fee, and private health insurance typically covers the rest, though you may still have out-of-pocket costs if your specialist charges more than the MBS fee.\nFrequently Asked Questions and Answers\nThree main types of surgeries could occur. Elective, emergency or cosmetic. Depending on the type of surgery needed, the location, the specialist, and the hospital itself, these factors will increase or decrease the overall cost of surgery in Australia.\nMedicare is a free Health Insurance that is provided to all residents of Australia. It covers the costs associated with public hospitals and most general procedures. Medicare also assists in lowering the total out-of-pocket cost that a patient may need to pay after their procedure.\nTalking to your specialist beforehand will assist you in understanding the costs involved. It is also important to speak with your health insurance provider to ensure that the costs are covered and to verify the estimated amount that may be required.\nPrivate health insurers cover the costs that Medicare does not. For private hospitals, this may include ambulance fees, theatre and accommodation. Each policy is tailor-made to fit specific requirements and as such, there may be certain limitations for each policy type. Understanding these limitations will ensure you are not caught off-guard with unexpected fees and out-of-pocket costs.\nPublic hospitals are often cheaper than private hospitals. The downside to a public hospital is that the wait time is often longer and the patient does not have the option to choose their own specialist. Private hospitals are often more expensive but have faster surgery times and grants the patient the ability to choose their own specialist.\nOther Topics\nFind out more with our useful guides\nHave a question?

Costs for all wound types were determined.\nConclusion The cost of treating wounds in Australia was determined and is anticipated to inform a review of equitable reimbursement of wound treatment costs for Australians with wounds.\nIntroduction\nChronic wounds, or wounds that have failed to heal, are a serious public health issue1,2. In Australia, the economic burden arising from chronic wounds was estimated to be around A$3 billion annually based on 2003\u20132004 and 2010\u20132011 datasets3,4. It is estimated that some 450,000 Australians live with a chronic wound4 which impacts on their explicit and implicit costs and their quality of life and wellbeing1,2,4. Furthermore, the management of acute and chronic wounds presents a significant workload and fiscal burden for Australian hospitals, primary healthcare settings, residential aged care facilities (RACFs) and community health services1\u20135. Yet actual data, which is important for planning, budgeting and resourcing purposes, and which informs national benchmarking and activity-based funding6, is limited across all Australian health sectors. More importantly, there is inequitable access to evidence-based wound management services and contemporary treatment consumables for all Australians1,2,4.\nIn response to these challenges the Australian Health Research Alliance (AHRA), which is comprised of 10 National Health and Medical Research Centre-accredited research translation centres across Australia developed and implemented a National Wounds Initiative which comprised four projects:\nCollectively, these four projects aimed to promote a nationally consistent and effective approach to wound care. The initiative was co-led for the AHRA by the Western Australian Health Translation Network (WAHTN) and Health Translation Queensland (HTQ).\nIn developing this National Wounds Initiative, an extensive literature review was undertaken which considered the recommendations and outcomes produced in some key literature such as: the Australian Centre for Health Services Innovation\u2019s Chronic wounds in Australia: an issues paper1; Pacella et\u00a0al\u2019s Solutions to the chronic wounds problems in Australia: a call to action2; the Australian Government\u2019s 2019 Wounds management pilot grant opportunity7; and the Medicare Benefits Schedule Review Taskforce\u2019s Wound Management Working Group Taskforce findings8. In addition, the AHRA hosted a workshop in Brisbane, Queensland which brought together 32 clinical experts, researchers and representatives from the AHRA and Wounds Australia to determine the wound-related research priorities and strategies.\nThis paper reports on the methodology and outcomes for Project\u00a01: Determining the actual cost of wound care, which aimed to determine the number and type of wounds and their treatment costs (consumables and labour) in Australian hospitals, RACFs, general practices (GPs) and community providers, and to provide evidence to inform reimbursement of wound treatment costs for all Australians. This would do much to ensure access to best practice treatments and a consistent standard of wound care for all Australians. This project was initiated and led by WAHTN in partnership with HTQ and in collaboration with the Silver Chain Group Inc (Silverchain), a large Australian community care provider.\nMethodology\nExpressions of interest to participate were sought from the Western Australian (WA) and Queensland (QLD) Health Departments, public hospitals and RACF administrators and GP directors. Unfortunately, the COVID pandemic and associated staffing and access restrictions limited the number of participating facilities and areas. However, two tertiary hospitals (one in WA with 600 beds and the other in QLD with 1,308 beds), one secondary care hospital in WA (290 beds), three WA RACFs (207 beds) and four GPs (two in WA and two in QLD) participated. Approval to conduct the study was obtained from the relevant Human Research Ethics Committees and site-specific Governance Committees.\nData recorded in Silver Chain Group\u2019s (community care provider hereafter) electronic wound module at the point-of-care in 2020/2021 were analysed. They comprised 21,189 clients with 49,234 wounds treated by nurses from this community care provider in WA, QLD and South Australia (SA). The scope included all wounds treated during 2020/2021 irrespective of whether they were healed or discharged unhealed during the year or had ongoing care beyond 2020/2021. A total of 445,400 client visits for wound treatments were recorded. For each of these visits, the following details were collected: the date, the visit duration, the category and type of wound/s treated, and consumables used excluding Goods and Services Tax. The contemporary wound treatment consumables used (dressing packs, solutions, dressings, devices, instruments, bandages/wraps) were provided at no cost to clients by the community care provider.\nEmbedded in the electronic wound module was the cost of these wound consumables, which were automatically allocated to each electronic care plan for each wound treatment performed. These records were linked with details about the attending nurse time spent undertaking each procedure, and labour costs were calculated using the actual direct time taken to perform the wound treatments by each attending community nurse and multiplied by their pay rates. Other indirect costs such as travel and organisational overheads were excluded, as these would have differed across the various health settings.\nIf client visits involved the treatment of multiple wounds, the cost of consumables was ascertained from each care plan for each wound. The labour cost for treating multiple wounds on the same client at the same visit was estimated based on the mean and median time taken to treat the collective different wound types. Since every wound treated had a unique identifier in the wound module database, all the costs of managing a wound across numerous client visits was consolidated into a single total cost to manage each wound treated during 2020/2021.\nAll of the wounds recorded in the wound module were catalogued into wound categories and wound types, the latter being subdivisions of each of the former. The wound categories were acute wounds, amputations, foot ulcers, leg ulcers, pressure injuries, skin tears and tumours and other wounds (primarily open dermatological wounds or abrasions). Although skin tears are in effect acute wounds, they were categorised separately, because skin tears comprised a large cohort of wounds in the community provider\u2019s data for elderly clients9.\nThe client outcomes identified in this same dataset, and reported separately, demonstrated 80% of wounds healed or were discharged to self-care (virtually healed and usually required the client to remove the final protective dressing), during the study period9.\nThe cost to treat the hospital, GP and RACF wounds was estimated by using the mean and median costs for the same wound type as identified in the community care provider 2020/2021 dataset. The rationale for this modelling was that it standardised the cost of wounds to treat across the cohorts and it took into account that many hospital patients are discharged prior to complete wound healing. Therefore, the cost for each study wound type was estimated based on the mean and median costs to treat different wound types in the community care provider\u2019s dataset 2020/2021 for 21,189 clients with 49,234 wounds. The assumption was that the same wound type across the four cohorts would have had similar treatments and all healthcare providers (primarily nurses) would have taken similar times to perform the treatments, and would have used similar consumables (dressing packs, instruments, solutions, dressings, devices, bandages/wraps).\nIn order to determine if this modelling was reasonable, a review of wound costing methods literature was conducted using Medline and Onesearch, with three relevant articles identified10\u201312. The project methodological design and data collection methods were reviewed in light of the literature to confirm that:\nData was then collected during the surveys conducted in WA hospitals, GPs and RACFs on electronic tablets using Qualtrics\u00ae software between 14 December 2020 and 20 August 2021. In Queensland, survey data was collected between 19 May 2021 and 15 October 2021 using hospital survey software or Qualtrics\u00ae for GPs. A 1-day representative survey sample of data for 30 June 2021 was obtained from the community care provider.\nThe following protocol was adopted to carry out the wound surveys in the hospitals and RACFs:\nAs the number of patients who visited a GP with a wound on a daily basis was considered to be low, the following process was adopted to facilitate data collection in the GPs:\nA representative sample of 1 day of community clients who had wound care on 30 June 2021 was obtained from the community care provider and underwent the same costing analysis as the other three cohorts. All statistical analysis was conducted using R (version 4.2.1) with descriptive statistics reported as counts or proportions of the total cohort. Chi-squared tests of proportion were used to determine differences between gender proportions between settings.\nResults\nThe characteristics of each individual and each wound recorded in the respective surveys across each of the four cohorts are summarised in Table\u00a01. Overall, there were 2,505 patients/residents/clients with 3,096 wounds. The relatively low numbers of hospital patients with wounds was influenced by COVID\u201119 access restrictions in some hospital areas. In addition, written consent was required for hospital patients; a large proportion of these were either too ill or cognitively unable to provide written consent, whilst some declined.\nThe four cohorts differed in both demographics such as age and also in wound categories and type of wounds. The median age of individuals in the hospitals, RACFs, GPs and community provider cohorts was 64\u00a0years, 82\u00a0years, 67\u00a0years and 69.5\u00a0years respectively. However, it is to be noted that no paediatric hospital was surveyed. As expected, the RACFs generally cared for older patients as compared to hospitals and GPs. There was an observed difference in the percentage of males between cohorts (\u03c72(3)=18.8, p=0.0003). The GPs treated more females with wounds than males (\u03c72(1)=4.20, 95% CI [0.33, 0.50], p=0.040) and the community care provider treated more males with wounds than females (\u03c72(1)=30.3, 95% CI [0.55, 0.60], p<0.0001).\n\u00a0\n\n\n* Includes some patients/residents/clients treated for multiple wounds\n\u00a0\nOverall, acute wounds were the most common (34.01%), followed by leg ulcers (17.70%), \u2018other wounds\u2019 (13.27%), foot ulcers (11.92%), pressure injuries (9.95%), skin tears (8.14%), and tumours (2.94%). In the hospital cohort, there were 816 patients with 748 wounds, mostly acute wounds (56.82%, including amputations) due to surgical or traumatic aetiologies. The RACF cohort treated 205 residents with 99 wounds, mostly \u2018other wounds\u2019 (34.34%), skin tears (28.28%) and pressure injuries (8.8%). The GP cohort treated 137 patients with 181 wounds, mostly acute wounds (49.72%), leg ulcers (21.55%) and skin tears (11.05%). The community care provider treated 1,347 clients with 2,068 wounds, mostly acute wounds (28.85%, including amputations), leg ulcers (23.74%) and foot ulcers (16.73%).\nEstimates using both the mean and the median costs associated with treating wounds in all four cohorts are shown in Table\u00a02. The distribution of costs was heavily right skewed. While the median is more robust against outliers than the mean, the mean better reflects the real costs expended in clinical practice. There were a significant number of \u2018other wound\u2019 types whose costs could not be estimated because insufficient numbers of these wound types were recorded in the community care provider dataset. Also, some \u2018other wound\u2019 types such as incontinence-associated dermatitis that were identified in the hospital and RACF cohorts were not specifically recorded in the community care provider dataset. Different categorisation schema may also have contributed to low numbers of certain wound types. The wound categories that conveyed the costliest burdens were acute wounds followed by leg ulcers and pressure injuries.\nTable\u00a02 summarises the estimated costs of wounds in the four cohorts, including the standard error (SE) in each estimate. Estimates\u00a0A and B indicate the estimated costs of wound treatment for each wound type based on the mean or median costs, respectively, as extrapolated from the community care provider\u2019s costs in 2020/2021. For example, Estimate\u00a0A for the consumables cost for treating the 95 abscesses observed during this survey was A$16,841\u00b1804, calculated by multiplying 95 by the mean cost of consumables incurred by the community care provider in treating abscesses in 2020/2021. Estimate\u00a0B of the labour cost for the same 95 abscesses was A$17,773\u00b1820, calculated by multiplying 95 by the median cost. Lastly, estimates of the total treatment cost are the sum of the consumables and labour costs.\n\u00a0\nTable 2. Consumables and direct labour costs for wounds across the four cohorts* as estimated using the mean (Estimate A) or median (Estimate B) costs identified in the community provider\u2019s dataset for 2020/2021\n\n\n\n* Four care settings combined: residential aged care, hospital, general practice, and community. Excluded any indirect costs such as organisational overheads, management, administration, travel, systems, training that were additional to direct client contact, and business overheads such as rent, utilities, insurances, vehicles, maintenance and repairs. Consumable costs excluded the goods and services tax.\n\u2020 These wounds were excluded from cost analysis since there were no comparator wounds in the community care provider dataset.\n\u00a0\nDiscussion\nEvaluation of the data collection methods across each site and cost modelling, which was conducted using a modified bottom-up costing method based on the Independent Hospital and Aged Care Pricing Authority (IHACPA) methodology, proved robust15. The results provided valuable insight into the number and type of wounds across a sample of Australian hospitals, RACFs, GPs and a community care provider. Although it was anticipated that hospitals would have a higher number of acute wounds, it was noteworthy that acute wounds also comprised the greater number of wounds managed by GPs and the community care provider. Similar findings were found in a community cross-sectional study conducted in North America16, as well as in a cross-sectional study conducted amongst 18 GPs in Queensland in 2011, which demonstrated 81.5% of the wounds resulted from surgery or trauma17.\nSkin tears, which are common wounds found amongst the elderly, comprised 28.28% of the RACF wounds18,19. They also comprised 12.97% of hospital wounds which was slightly more than the WoundsWest findings obtained from surveys which were conducted across all 86 public hospitals in WA in 2008, 2009, 2011, and which found skin tears to be 11%, 9% and 9.6% respectively20,21. Pressure injuries on the other hand were found to range from 4% in GPs, 9% in RACFs and hospitals, and 10% in the community cohort. Nghiem et\u00a0al22 reported 12.9% of pressure injuries cost Australian public hospitals A$9.11\u00a0billion (95% confidence intervals (CI): 9.02, 9.21) in 2020 and treatment costs attributed to A$3.59\u00a0billion (CI: 3.57, 3.60) of these costs. Whilst there appears to be a dearth of data concerning pressure injuries managed by GPs, Wilson et\u00a0al23 reported projected costs of A$98,489 to care for 20 residents with 23 pressure injuries. However, these modelled costs included wound treatments, pressure off-loading devices, nutritional supplements and labour, whereas the median cost (consumables and labour) to treat pressure injuries in a community cohort in 2020/2021 was A$150.56 (interquartile range: A$71.85\u2013391.12)9. Pressure injuries are costly, and they are considered to be largely preventable wounds; the implementation of preventative strategies is therefore a fundamental tenet of the Australian Commission for Safety and Quality in Health Care Standards24.\nThe Australian Medical Association25 reported challenges in gauging the extent of GP and community wound care costs, although a study in the UK found 81% of total wound care costs to the National Health Scheme were incurred in the community sector26. Access to rigorous data from diverse community healthcare providers in Australia is complicated by the number and variety of community healthcare providers and the potential for duplication of services. An Australian study conducted in Queensland found patients with leg ulcers reported a median of three (range two to seven) healthcare provider organisations involved in their care27. Fortunately, the community care provider whose data was used to determine costs in this study has an enviable and rigorous electronic system for recording wound data at point of care and a commitment to monitoring data entry9.\nAdherence to the principle that wound care should be provided at the lowest appropriate cost without compromising best practice28 is challenged by inequitable access to contemporary wound consumables across Australia1,2. Furthermore, some researchers have employed a top-down costing model using hospital estimated costs4, or in other settings modelled costs for inclusion of adjuvant therapies such as nutritional supplements or pressure off-loading devices5. Although the IHACPA approach uses a bottom-up model for costing direct labour time and therapeutic goods specific to the patient and the diagnosis, they also include additional cost buckets for recurrent costs such as hotel costs, procedure and imaging costs, staff salaries with on-costs and depreciation15.\nHowever, the researchers involved in this study chose to report only actual costs for treatment consumables and direct labour costs to perform the wound treatments in order to provide a more transparent insight into the direct costs of wound care. It was acknowledged that many other costs associated with the delivery of care are covered within alternative funding arrangements of the treating organisation. Nor did the researchers explore additional costs that may have been placed on patients/residents/clients, although these additional costs should be investigated by subsequent research.\nAs outlined, a strength of this study was the use of actual costs made possible by the fact that contemporary treatment consumables were provided at no cost to the community care provider\u2019s clients, and it was these data that were used to model the costs of wound treatments across the four study cohorts. However, treatment costs varied significantly between and within the study wound types due to the variations between the estimates for each wound type (Table\u00a02). This variation emphasises that a standardised average reimbursement price for wound care across all wound types is not feasible. However, determining the cost of reimbursement other than for labour and consumables for each wound type was outside the scope of this study.\nThe wound types associated with highest estimated costs in this study were suture lines, open incisional wounds and venous leg ulcers. The findings for incisional wounds were similar to a review of 2014 data from US Medicare beneficiaries which found surgical wounds and infections were the costliest items, noting that the highest costs were incurred in outpatient settings29. In an earlier study, Fife et\u00a0al30 reported a mean cost to heal per wound of US$3,927, and also noted wide variation in costs for complex wounds such as flaps or grafts which had a mean cost to heal of US$9,358. Guest et\u00a0al31 examined a sample of 2,000 patients which comprised 40% acute wounds, 48% chronic wounds and 12% an unknown diagnosis in the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS) and calculated costs of \u00a3698\u20133,998 for healed wounds, and \u00a31,719\u20135,976 for unhealed wounds. The wide variations in costs were again similar to those found in this study.\nPhillips et\u00a0al32 reported that leg and foot ulcers, pressure injuries and postoperative wounds accounted for most of the wound care costs in GP in Wales in 2012/2013, with average costs of \u00a31,727 per patients (for up to 6\u00a0months follow-up). Costs were associated with GP visits, district nurse home visits, outpatient and inpatient care32. Potentially some of these associated costs would have been covered by other NHS funding arrangements, and conglomerate healthcare costs make for difficult comparisons of actual wound treatment costs (consumables and labour). Furthermore, they can negatively influence the argument for national reimbursement of wound consumables.\nNotwithstanding, it is difficult to compare costs across studies as there is inconsistency in methods of cost evaluation, that is discrepancies in use of direct and indirect costs, duration of data collection and outcomes measured. Romanelli et\u00a0al33 reported standard care direct costs were US$2,540 for venous leg ulcers during an 8-week trial in an outpatient setting. While Urwin et\u00a0al34 reported an average 2-week cost per person of \u00a3166.39 (95% CI: 157.78\u2013175.00), with an estimated annual cost per person of \u00a34,585.70 using data from a survey of nine UK NHS community health services in 2015/2016. More recently, venous leg ulcers were demonstrated to be a common wound in an Australian community cohort, with a median cost to treat (consumables and direct labour) of A$495 (range A$198\u20131,162)9.\nConsidering venous leg ulcers are estimated to affect over 300,000 mainly older Australians, and with anticipated increases in the ageing population35 and reports of lengthy healing times and recurrence rates of up to 78%35,36, it would appear feasible and prove cost-effective to fund preventive treatments. Compression therapy in the form of bandages, hosiery or wraps is considered the \u2018gold\u2019 standard treatment for venous leg ulcers34\u201336. However, there is currently no Australian reimbursement scheme for dressings or compression therapies for all Australians. Cheng et\u00a0al35 determined reimbursement of compression therapy for the treatment of venous leg ulcers would cost the Australian health system an additional A$270 million over 5\u00a0years, which they proposed would be substantially offset by anticipated A$1.4 billion in cost savings.\nIn accordance with the results from this study, the researchers debated three options for an Australian Health System reimbursement of wound treatment (product, labour) services and products:\nThe researchers would recommend the last option as it is considered to be more feasible for ensuring equitable access to wound care services and products for all Australians.\nAs previously highlighted, a strength of this study was the use of data for actual wound treatment consumables and direct labour costs for performing the wound dressing procedures. The fact that the consumables were supplied at no charge to clients with wounds recorded in the community care provider dataset, and these data were used to model the costs across the four cohorts, allowed for standardised comparisons.\nA limitation relates to the fact that the community care provider has the capacity to bulk purchase consumables yet these associated cost benefits may not be available to smaller providers. Furthermore, these costs reflect 2020/2021 costs for labour and consumables, and variations in exchange rates and procurement may lead to associated cost increases over time. The community provider labour costs were determined based on nurse salary levels; it could be assumed that health professionals other than nurses may perform the wound dressing procedures in other health settings and therefore this may lead to associated cost differences. Additional limitations were access restrictions associated with the management of the COVID\u201119 pandemic which limited the capacity to survey all wards in the tertiary hospitals and conduct surveys in more health settings, particularly regional hospitals, remote communities and a more diverse range of GPs across all Australian states and territories.\nConclusion\nThis study sought to determine the number and type of wounds and their treatment costs (consumables and labour) in a sample of Australian hospitals, RACFs, GPs and community care providers and provide evidence to inform reimbursement of wound treatment costs for all Australians. Ultimately, every Australian with a wound should expect the same standard of care regardless of their geographic location, type of wound and healthcare provider. The researchers are strongly convinced that best practice wound prevention and management would lead to optimal healing outcomes if services and practitioners who adhere to this thesis and implemented national standards were reimbursed the mean cost of wound treatments and, if not covered by other funding arrangements, the mean cost of direct labour for performing the treatment procedures.\nAcknowledgements\nThe researchers gratefully acknowledge the support of the administrators and staff of Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Armadale Hospital, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Third Avenue Surgery, Illawarra Medical Centre, Salisbury Medical Centre, Inala Primary Care, Hall and Prior Aged Care Homes (Belmont, Leighton and Karingal Green), School of Nursing QUT, Silver Chain Group Inc., The University of Western Australia, Queensland University of Technology, Curtin University, University of Notre Dame Australia and all of the surveyors.\nAuthor contribution\nJo Wilkie was involved in the conception, design, acquisition, analysis and interpretation of the data, as well as final approval of the version of the paper to be published.

Some commentators point to widespread supply bottlenecks and adverse geo-political events that caused significant disruption to the production and availability of manufactured goods. Others argue that significant shifts in aggregate demand for manufactured goods were the leading factors underlying these observed price fluctuations, and cite shifts in consumer preferences, unprecedented discretionary fiscal policy, and a change in the monetary policy stance following the pandemic.\nIn this note, we provide new evidence to the debate of how much of the recent run-up and retreat of producer price inflation is driven by supply versus demand factors, which is part of an ongoing area of research that has seen recent contributions by e.g. Shapiro (2022), Benigno and Eggertsson (2023), Kabaca and Tuzcuoglu (2023), Bai, Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde, Li and Zanetti (2024) among others. Quantifying the relative effects of supply and demand shocks is critical to understanding movements in inflation and, thus, to informing appropriate policy responses to changes in inflation.\nFigure 1 (top panel) shows the year-on-year (YoY) inflation rate based on the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) of manufactured goods published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. After a brief decline during the height of the pandemic, prices climbed rapidly in subsequent months, reaching rates above 18%, the highest recorded values since the start of the index in 1987. Then, in 2023, manufacturing producer prices suddenly levelled off, with a rapid decline in the rate of inflation to levels near zero.\nHow much of these fluctuations can be attributed to supply and demand factors? Answering this question has proved very difficult not only because of the complexity of the post-pandemic period, but also because many of the observed outcomes could be consistent with either changes in supply or demand conditions. For new evidence on this topic, we leverage data from the Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity (QPC), a U.S. Census Bureau data product primarily designed to gauge capacity and utilization rates in the manufacturing sector.\nThe survey asks establishments to report their full production capabilities (capacity) as well as their operating rate, with plants operating at less than full capacity further asked to identify the reasons. As shown in Figure 1 (bottom left), in normal times the vast majority of establishments cite lack of demand (or, \"insufficient orders\") as the reason for operating at less than capacity. During the pandemic, this share dropped notably, with the fraction of plants citing \"insufficient orders\" reaching an all-time low of just 48.3% in the first quarter of 2022. On the other hand, Figure 1 (bottom right) also shows a spike of manufacturing establishments citing \"insufficient supply of materials\" during the pandemic, with this fraction reaching an all-time high of 42.7% of firms in the fourth quarter of 2021. Both of these spikes in establishment responses have since largely, though not completely, unwound to more typical levels. Taken together, the evidence from the QPC suggests both supply and demand as being important drivers of producer prices over the last few years.\nThe QPC is a useful resource for gauging demand and supply conditions together in one survey. Moreover, the QPC measure of supply bottlenecks is ideal in that it captures the extent to which a firm is constrained from producing a desired quantity. However, the published QPC data only report the share of respondents citing a certain explanation, which has drawbacks in quantifying structural supply and demand factors underlying the manufacturing PPI. Furthermore, even if used as direct explanatory variables for PPI inflation, their high mutual correlation would make it difficult to disentangle their individual contributions.\nNote: Shaded areas indicate periods of recessions as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research where appropriate: March 2001\u2013November 2001, December 2007\u2013June 2009 and February 2020\u2013April 2020.\nSources: Top panel: Bureau of Labor Statistics. Bottom panel: U.S. Census Bureau Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity (Disclosure Review Board (DRB) approval number: CBDRB\u2011FY23\u20110231).\nAccessible version\nIn this FEDS note, we argue for an approach that combines insights from the QPC survey data with bivariate industry-level structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models for industrial production (quantities) and producer prices. These are simple models designed to disentangle producer price fluctuations into supply and demand factors. We then relate these models to industry-level estimates of demand and supply constraints from the QPC survey data to obtain sharper identification. After decomposing changes in PPI into supply and demand factors at a granular level, we then aggregate to obtain a decomposition for the entire manufacturing sector.\nFor our exercise, we collect data at the 3-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) level for industrial production (IP) and producer price indexes, and match those with shares of establishments reporting either insufficient materials or insufficient demand in the QPC data. After extending PPI indexes back in time, the result is monthly data on IP and PPI from 1978 to December 2023, for a total of 18 industries1, and quarterly QPC survey data going back to 2008.\nIn the following, we denote by $$ q_{it} $$ and $$ p_{it} $$ the monthly percentage changes in industry i's industrial production and producer price index, respectively. We consider bivariate industry-level structural VAR (SVAR) models of the form:\n$$$$ q_{it} = \\alpha_i p_{it} + c_{1i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\alpha_{ij}^{qq} q_{i,t-j} + \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\alpha_{ij}^{qp} p_{i,t-j} + \\epsilon_{it}^s , \\\\ $$$$\n$$$$ q_{it} = \\beta_i p_{it} + c_{2i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\alpha_{ij}^{pq} q_{i,t-j} + \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\alpha_{ij}^{pp} p_{i,t-j} + \\epsilon_{it}^d , $$$$\nwhere the first equation is the supply equation perturbed by supply shocks $$ \\epsilon_{it}^s $$, with $$ \\alpha_i $$ measuring industry i's short-run price elasticity of supply. The second equation represents the demand equation, where $$ \\epsilon_{it}^d $$ are demand shocks and $$ \\beta_i $$ measures the short-run price elasticity of demand. The rest of the coefficients are meant to capture the joint-dynamics of IP and PPI around their average growth rate.\nWithout further assumptions, the bivariate system of equations is not identified, yielding many constellations of $$ \\alpha_i $$ and $$ \\beta_i $$ equally consistent with the data (for a discussion, see e.g., Kilian and L\u00fctkepohl (2017)). To achieve identification, we impose a series of identifying constraints. First, we assume conventional sign restrictions on the short run price elasticities. This includes that the supply curve is upward sloping ($$ \\alpha_i > 0 $$ ), while the demand curve is downward sloping ($$ \\beta_i < 0 $$ ). Second, we postulate that quarterly averages of structural supply and demand shocks should be highly correlated with the change in the QPC survey measure for establishments citing insufficient materials and insufficient demand, respectively.2 Once the model is identified, it is possible to decompose industry i's PPI growth through the lenses of the estimated SVARs as:\n$$$$ p_{it} = \\mu_i + p_{it}^d + p_{it}^s $$$$\nwhere $$\\mu_i $$ is the average growth rate of industry i's PPI index, the term $$p_{it}^s $$ is the variation that can be accounted for by supply shocks, and the term $$ p_{it}^d $$ is the variation driven by demand shocks. Finally, an approximate decomposition of the aggregate PPI's monthly percentage increase $$ p_t $$ is then given by:\n$$$$ p_{t} = \\underbrace{\\sum_i w_{i,t} \\mu_i}_{\\text{deterministic components}} + \\underbrace{\\sum_i w_{i,t} p_{it}^s}_{\\text{supply factors}} + \\underbrace{\\sum_i w_{i,t} p_{it}^d}_{\\text{demand factors}} $$$$\nwhere $$w_{i,t} $$ are industry relative importance weights available from the Federal Reserve Board's Industrial Production G.17 statistical release.3\nThis methodology is related to the recent work by Shapiro (2022), which disentangles the supply and demand factors driving the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index by leveraging joint fluctuations in quantity and price data of individual PCE goods and services categories. For each month, a category's PCE growth rate is allocated to either the supply or demand component based on sign restrictions equivalent to what we use in our industry level SVARs. We refine this approach by sharpening the identification strategy, i.e. leveraging the additional survey data that is unique to the manufacturing sector. In addition, our approach allows us to decompose each industry's monthly variation into a mix of both demand and supply factors, and historical realizations thereof, instead of only estimating their net effect, as in Shapiro (2022).\nBefore discussing the results of our decomposition, we first conduct an exercise to test the ex-post validity of our methodology. Following Shapiro (2022), we study the dynamic response of the estimated PPI demand and supply factors to well-understood macroeconomic shocks. Specifically, we estimate empirical impulse response functions (IRF) to a monetary policy shock as in Bauer and Swanson (2023), and oil supply shocks as in Kanzig (2021).4 For a credible decomposition, only the demand component of the PPI should respond to a monetary policy shock, and only the supply component to an oil supply shock.\nFigure 2 shows estimates of these IRFs to a monetary policy shock, normalized to increase the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points (top panel), and an oil supply shock normalized to increase the real oil price by 10% (bottom panel). The solid lines show the dynamics of producer prices in percentage deviations from trend, with dashed and dotted lines indicating estimation uncertainty at the 68% confidence interval coming from two econometric procedures.5 As we expect, the demand-driven level of producer prices is estimated to decrease in response to a 25bp tightening in monetary policy, peaking at about -0.5 percent after 18 months. On the other hand, the dynamic effect on the supply factor remains small and is statistically insignificant. Similarly, in the IRFs to a cost-pushing oil supply shock normalized to increase oil prices by 10%, we find strong reactions in supply driven factors, which peak rapidly at around 0.7 percent after 8 months. The demand component is estimated to decrease slightly but remains insignificant.\nThese IRF results validate that the supply and demand shocks we identify act as intended in disentangling the supply and demand driven fluctuations in the producer price index of manufactured goods.6 Next, we show the role these supply and demand factors have played in the evolution of the manufacturing PPI since 2007.\nNote: The solid lines show the dynamics of producer prices in percentage deviations from trend, with dashed and dotted lines indicating estimation uncertainty at the 68% confidence interval. The dashed line corresponds to confidence intervals computed by the block bootstrap of Jentsch and Lunsford (2022), while the dotted line corresponds to weak-identification robust confidence set by Montiel Olea, Stock and Watson (2021).\nAccessible version\nFigure 3 plots the estimated decomposition of the year-on-year PPI inflation rate (black line), adjusted for the deterministic terms. The beige bars capture the fluctuations that are attributed to supply shocks, while the red bars capture demand factors. The gray shaded areas correspond to recessions as reported by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\nNote: Shaded areas indicate periods of recessions as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research: December 2007\u2013June 2009 and February 2020\u2013April 2020.\nAccessible version\nWe focus our discussion of this decomposition on the period of the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) as well as the COVID and post-Covid inflation surge more recently.\nGreat Financial Crisis\nThe increase in prices at the onset of the Great Financial Crisis has been well documented. Hamilton (2009) discusses in detail the demand and supply factors leading to the oil price shock in 2007-2008 which contributed significantly to the increase in goods prices. Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas (2008) highlight the surge in commodity (in particular oil) prices during the early part of the GFC. The Caballero et al. (2008) model alongside the evidence put forward by Christiano, Eichenbaum, Trabandt (2015) and Gilchrist, Schoenle, Sim, Zakrajsek (2017), argues that the main reason for the commodity price volatility and other \"missing disinflation/deflation\" during this time was ultimately due to the scarce supply of liquid financial assets.\nOur decomposition for the Great Financial Crisis suggests that the sharp increase in producer prices was predominantly due to supply factors. This result lends support to research emphasizing the cost pressures on U.S. producers emanating from higher global commodity prices and reduced availability of credit in the initial phase of the crisis. In the second phase, after the severe disruption to financial markets and sharp decline in aggregate activity triggered by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the decomposition intuitively shows that the resulting changes in prices are driven mostly by demand factors.\nCovid and its aftermath\nThe decomposition in Figure 3 also shows features of the Covid period that are both intuitive and revealing. The change in PPIs during the first few months of the pandemic is skewed to changes in demand factors, which aligns with the experience of extensive shutdowns during this period. In subsequent months (from mid-2020 into 2021), however, supply factors quickly moved from being a drag on prices to being a driver of price increases. Indeed, significant jumps in supply factors occur around February 2021, aligning with the so-called Texas Freeze that had dramatic effects on the petrochemical and downstream industries. It was also during this time that semiconductor shortages began to impact prices and delivery times of many manufactured goods including automobiles, computers, household appliances and other consumer electronics.\nNoticeable changes in the demand contributions lag those of supply, with a switch from a drag on prices to supporting price increases in the first half of 2021. Supply contributions to price increases peak in the latter half of 2021, while demand contributions peak in early 2022, very soon (maybe a quarter or two) after U.S. monetary policy tightens.\nMore recently, both supply and demand have moved into negative territory in 2023, with once again supply moving more suddenly and somewhat in advance of the demand contributions. In the last data point, in December 2023, supply factors remain the main drag on goods prices, although in the last five months demand is beginning to exert significant downward pressure as well.\nCombining novel survey evidence with a structural VAR model of quantities and prices, we decompose the role of supply and demand factors in U.S. manufacturing producer price inflation from 2007 to 2023. Such a decomposition is particularly useful in recent years encompassing the post-COVID inflation surge, as policymakers and market participants debate the relative impacts of monetary policy versus supply chain normalization in the rapid disinflationary period observed in 2022 and 2023. Over the last several years, our evidence points to a significant role for supply factors in the run-up and retreat of goods prices, with demand factors contributing to that contour, but with a lag. Looking ahead, this decomposition will further our understanding of the forces behind future inflation developments, while also serving to inspire other ways in which survey evidence can be combined with more traditional tools for identifying the mechanisms underlying economic outcomes.\nBai, Xiwen, Jesus Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde, Yiliang Li and Francesco Zanetti (2024). \"DP18785 The Causal Effects of Global Supply Chain Disruptions on Macroeconomic Outcomes: Evidence and Theory\".

These sample correlations are computed over the period 2008-2023 for which quarterly QPC data is available.

If we were to instead throw out the identifying variation from the QPC data and rely only on movements in quantities and prices for the full 60 industries for which we have data \u2013 effectively applying the method in Shapiro (2022) to our manufacturing context \u2013 the IRFs do not successfully isolate supply and demand from these shocks.

It should take 8 minutes for the ambulance to arrive if the call is life threatening or an emergency. Ambulance services often send more than one vehicle to try to meet the 8 minute target.\nWhy are ambulance response times so long?\nPlus, despite the increased workforce, ambulance crews have less capacity, as ambulances now have to wait longer with patients outside hospitals. According to one Health Foundation report, more than 10% of ambulances had to wait for over an hour outside hospitals in July 2022.\nWhat is the average EMS response time in Chicago?\nThe state standard is six minutes.

      "Mayors blast 'terrible' rural ambulance response times\nAuditor general report shows poor rural response times masked by urban data\nSocial Sharing\nMayors and community leaders in small\u2013town New Brunswick say they weren't surprised at all by this week's scathing report by the auditor general about ambulance response times.\nThe audit shows that in many rural and remote communities, Ambulance New Brunswick fails to respond to 90 per cent of calls within its target of 22 minutes.\n\"It's terrible,\" said\u00a0Belledune Mayor Joe Noel. \"It shouldn't be allowed and there's no need for it.\"\nBut those shortfalls are obscured, and don't count against ANB's performance payments, because they're combined with better response times in urban centres for measuring performance--which is allowed under the company's contract.\nBlackville Mayor Chris Hennessy said\u00a0the report is a vindication for him.\n\"They basically bury the rural stats in the urban numbers so they never show the bad with the good,\" he said.\n\"I know people thought I was crazy when I was preaching about this for the last five years \u2026 so I'm glad somebody uncovered that.\"\u00a0\nRural vs. urban response\nThe aggregation of the numbers allows Medavie Health Services New Brunswick, which operates the ambulance service, to collect $650,000 a year for hitting the broader 90-percent target in four large zones that include cities and towns.\u00a0\n\"They're meeting them on the backs of the rural areas,\" Noel said.\n\"That's exactly what happens here. When an ambulance goes out in Campbellton or Bathurst, they take the ambulance from Belledune and send it to Bathurst or Campbellton to sit there, whether it gets a call or not...\n\"That's where the calls are and that's why they're doing it: because it makes their numbers look good.\"\u00a0\nHarvey Mayor Winston Gamblin said\u00a0response times in the village are good when the ambulance happens to be at its local station.\u00a0\nBut when it's been shifting elsewhere, paramedics have a hard time reaching some locations within 22 minutes.\n\"We feel that if you live in a rural area, you have to take second best, and that's the way it came out in the report yesterday -- that we're second class citizens and [they say] 'we'll get there when we can,'\" he said.\nAmbulance targets\nUnder Medavie's contract with the province, ambulances must hit response targets 90 per cent of the time for the organization to receive performance payments.\nThe targets are to reach the scene of a call within nine minutes in 16 urban areas and within 22 minutes everywhere else in New Brunswick.\nThe audit found that in 19 out of 67 communities, ANB fell short of the 90 per cent goal.\u00a0\nBut because response times are blended together within four large zones, it \"masked\" the poor numbers in those rural, remote communities, Auditor General Kim Adair-MacPherson said Tuesday.\nHer audit said the system \"has introduced a bias toward achieving high performance in areas of greater population density, to the detriment of rural or remote communities where 911 calls occur less frequently.\"\nRural areas were at a disadvantage because the system is \"reducing the emphasis on improving performance in those areas,\" allowing Medavie \"to focus resources on urban areas while having decreased performance in outlying communities.\"\nIn a statement released Tuesday, Medavie Health Services New Brunswick president Richard Losier agreed the average response time \"varies from community to community.\"\nBut he pointed out what Adair-MacPherson's audit acknowledged: that the contract doesn't rate performance community by community but in four large zones.\n\"MHSNB is always open and willing to work with our government partners to improve the services to the people of New Brunswick,\" he said.\nMedavie mum\nMedavie did not respond to a request Wednesday for an interview with Losier.\nOn Tuesday Health Minister Dorothy Shephard said she was talking to Medavie officials about renegotiating the contract, which was renewed in 2017 for another 10 years.\nNoel said\u00a0rural response times should carry more weight in measuring ambulance performance.\n\"When you're 25 minutes away from a hospital to start with, that's where you need the response times,\" he said.\nBelledune had the lowest number of any community measured by the auditor general: ambulances reached their destination within 22 minutes in only 69 per cent of calls.\nMarc Henrie, the former chair of the Saint-Paul local service district north of Moncton, said\u00a0he was not surprised to see the Fords Mills ambulance station with the second-worst rate in the report.\nAmbulances based there reach calls within 22 minutes in only 70 per cent of cases.\n\"The auditor general just released proof that rural citizens are sadly taken as citizens of a second-class,\" he said.\nHenrie chaired the LSD when Ambulance New Brunswick decided to put its bay in Fords Mills rather than in another location closer to Saint-Paul and Route 126, where he says most people in the area live.\n\"The numbers are not surprising at all,\" he said.\nSometimes ambulances responding to calls in the Saint-Paul area are sent from Salisbury, even though Moncton is closer. Henrie believes it's so ambulances based in Moncton can stay there and respond to calls in and around the city.\u00a0\n\"It's clear that it's not strategic and it's not what's for the well-being in an emergency situation,\" he says.\nGamblin says he's glad to see the auditor general put the spotlight on the problem but worries it will discourage people from moving to smaller communities. \"It's not an advertisement for rural areas,\" he says.\u00a0\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nProvincial Affairs reporter\nJacques Poitras has been CBC's provincial affairs reporter in New Brunswick since 2000.

With ambulance response times clocking in at an average of 8 minutes in places like Singapore, one can't help but wonder if residents are secretly running emergency drills every time they hear a siren. Here, the race against the clock isn't just a metaphor\u2014it's a vital reality where every second truly counts. So, the next time you find yourself stuck in traffic in a bustling city, just remember that somewhere nearby, an ambulance might be navigating its way through the chaos to save a life in record time.\nInfluence of Technology on Ambulance Response Time\n\nSome major cities like New York and Los Angeles have implemented programs to reduce ambulance response times through improved dispatch systems.\nThe use of advanced technology like GPS tracking and predictive analytics has been shown to help improve ambulance response times by up to 20% in some regions.\n\nInterpretation\nIn the high-stakes race against time, major cities are turning to advanced dispatch systems to give their ambulances a speed boost. From the bustling streets of New York to the star-studded avenues of Los Angeles, the use of GPS tracking and predictive analytics is proving to be the turbocharger in emergency response, shaving off precious minutes and improving outcomes. It seems even technology wants to be a hero nowadays, swooping in to save the day and make those sirens sing a little louder.\nRecommendations and Guidelines for Improving Ambulance Response Time\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends an ambulance response time of 8 minutes or less for life-threatening emergencies.\nAccording to a study by the American Heart Association, every minute decrease in ambulance response time for cardiac arrest cases increases the chances of survival by 7-10%.\n\nInterpretation\nWhen it comes to ambulance response times, the clock isn't just ticking - it's a matter of life and death. The World Health Organization's 8-minute target is not just a suggestion, it's a lifeline for those in dire need. As the American Heart Association's study suggests, every minute saved can mean the difference between life and death, with chances of survival increasing with each swift arrival. So the next time you hear that siren in the distance, remember that those minutes matter more than you think.\nReferences\nE ems.gov\nJ jems.com\nN ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\nW who.int\nM medicare.gov\nJ jamanetwork.com\nC cbc.ca\nS sciencedirect.com\nP pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\nE england.nhs.uk\nA abs.gov.au\nA annemergmed.com\nJ jaanet.org\nS straitstimes.com\nA ahajournals.org\nJ journals.plos.org\nI itu.int\nT timeslive.co.za\nP portalms.saude.gov.br\nL lakartidningen.se\nI indianexpress.com\nA aa.com.tr\nO omnyaccz.com\nT timesofindia.indiatimes.com\nY ynetnews.com\nE europeanciss.org\nR researchgate.net\nM medicalgeography.studymoose.com\nC cnnturk.com\nR rts.ch\nS sulaimanialrestaurants.com\nT thejakartapost.com\nM mdzol.com\nE egyptindependent.com\nN nimc.gov.ng\nS setn.net\n\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\n\nRigorous fact-checking process\nData from reputable sources\nRegular updates to ensure relevance\n\nExplore More In This Category\n\nExploring the Most Dangerous Hobbies: Risks and Statistics Revealed\nShocking Lineman Death Rate Statistics: 20.3 Fatalities per 100,000 Workers\nShocking Lineman Death Rate Statistics: 20.3 Fatalities per 100,000 Workers\nAfrica Hunger Statistics: Alarming Figures Reveal Widespread Undernourishment Crisis\nGlobal Asbestos Statistics: Deadly Impact, Legal Challenges, and Health Risks.\nBicycle Helmet Safety Statistics: Key Facts on Head Injury Prevention\n\nOur Most Popular Topics\nIndustry Specific StatisticsEducation and Learning StatisticsHealth and Medical StatisticsSports StatisticsCrime and Safety StatisticsHealth and Wellness StatisticsAnimal and Wildlife StatisticsTravel StatisticsMedia and Entertainment Statistics\n\nWorldmetrics.org\n\nHome\nPrivacy Policy\nContact\nOur Process\nAbout Us\nOur Partner\n\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

Evans Jr., PhD, APA\u2019s CEO. \u201cLike many other health care providers, psychologists are feeling the pressure.\u201d\nMore than 8 in 10 (84%) psychologists who treat anxiety disorders said they have seen an increase in demand for anxiety treatment since the start of the pandemic, compared with 74% a year ago. Demand for treatment of depression is also up, with 72% of psychologists who treat depressive disorders saying they have seen an increase, compared with 60% in 2020. Other treatment areas with greater demand included sleep-wake disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and substance-related and addictive disorders, the survey found.\nThe number of psychologists who reported receiving more referrals this year almost doubled from last year (from 37% in 2020 to 62% this year). Almost 7 in 10 psychologists (68%) with a waitlist reported that it had grown longer since the start of the pandemic.\u00a0\nWith these indicators suggesting many psychologists are working at or beyond capacity, more than 4 in 10 (41%) reported being unable to meet the demand for treatment (up from 30% last year), and 46% said they felt burned out (up from 41% last year).\u00a0\n\u201cThese numbers highlight what we have been saying since the early days of the pandemic\u2014we are facing a mental health tsunami,\u201d Evans said. \u201cWe need to continue to support treatment via telehealth, and we must invest in screening, prevention, and innovative interventions to expand access to various levels of care.\u201d\nThe pandemic led to a switch to telehealth for many psychologists, and virtually all clinical psychologists continue to provide at least some services remotely (96%), according to the survey. While few have returned to seeing patients entirely in person since a year ago (about 4% vs. 3% in 2020), a greater number of psychologists have adopted a hybrid approach of seeing some patients in person and some remotely (50% vs. 33% in 2020), revealing a slow progression back to the office.\nAPA continues to advocate for continued flexibility in insurance coverage of telehealth services, including audio-only telehealth, as well as equal coverage and reimbursement for telehealth services in comparison with in-person treatment. Telehealth services enable patients from underserved communities\u2014such as rural areas and communities of color\u2014to access these services, often for the first time.\nDemonstrating that telehealth is here to stay, 96% of psychologists said that the use of telehealth during the pandemic has proven its effectiveness as a therapeutic tool, and 93% said that they intend to continue providing telehealth as an option in their practice after the pandemic.\nIn coping with the additional demand for treatment, more than three-quarters of psychologists said that they were able to maintain a positive work-life balance (77%, up from 66%) and nearly two thirds said that they practiced self-care (64%, up from 55%).\nMethodology\nThe 2021 American Psychological Association\u2019s COVID-19 Practitioner Survey was distributed to approximately 26,400 doctoral-level active licensed psychologists (both APA members and non-members) in the U.S. between August 30 and September 17, 2021. A total of 1,141 psychologists responded. This was a non-probability sample, and thus it is not possible to calculate confidence intervals or margins of error.\nThe 2020 COVID-19 Telehealth Practitioner Survey was fielded from August 28 to October 5, 2020. A total of 1,787 psychologists responded to that survey.\nContact\nSophie Bethune\n(202) 336-6134\n",

A high Access Ranking\u00a0(1-13) indicates that a state provides relatively more access to insurance and mental health\u00a0treatment than those ranked 39-51.\nThe eight measures that make up the Access Ranking include:\n\n\n\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness.\nIn 2022, 64% of adults who were uninsured said that they did not have health insurance because they could not afford it.\nThe state prevalence of uninsured adults with mental illness ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\nAdults with SUD Who Needed But Did Not Receive Treatment\nOver three-quarters (76.9%) of all adults with a substance use disorder did not receive the treatment they needed.\nMost adults with SUD who sought or thought about receiving treatment reported they didn\u2019t because they thought they should have been able to handle their drug or alcohol use on their own (75.4%).\nThis was followed by: Not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop or cut back using alcohol or drugs (48.4%), thought it would cost too much (47.7%), and did not know how or where to get treatment (47.3%).\nThe state prevalence of adults with SUD with unmet treatment needs ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\n10.2% of adults who experienced a mental illness in the past year had private health insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems.\nThe state prevalence of adults with AMI whose private insurance did not cover mental or emotional problems ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs\n24.58% of adults who reported experiencing 14 or more mentally unhealthy days each month were not able to see a doctor due to costs. This was a 2% increase over last year\u2019s report.\nHigh costs of mental health care are a critical barrier to access. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading. Unfortunately, doing so hides the fact that the percentages are significantly lower.\nThe state rate of students identified as having an emotional disturbance for an IEP ranges from 28.01 per 1,000 students in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 students in Alabama.\n\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\nMental Health Workforce Availability\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. The term \u201cmental health provider\u201d includes psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care.\nAs of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, and only 27% of the mental health need in shortage areas was being met by mental health providers. Over the next 15 years, the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis has projected increasing shortages for several behavioral health providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health and addiction counselors.\nThe state rate of mental health workforce ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.\nThe State of Mental Health in America\n2024 STATISTICS\nAccess to Care\nAbout Us\nGet Help\nGet Active\nGet Information\n\n                500 Montgomery Street,\n                \n                Suite 820\n                \n                Alexandria, VA. 22314\n                \n\n                Phone (703) 684.7722\n                \n                Toll Free (800) 969.6642\n                \n                Fax (703) 684.5968\n              \nFooter menu\n",

Recent national surveys found that 2 in 5 Canadians felt that their mental health has been negatively impacted by the economic downturn,Reference2 \u00a0and that 1 in 3 Canadian households have experienced difficulties meeting their financial needs for necessary expenses such as transportation, housing, food and clothing.Reference3\nIn the CMWF survey, more Canadians reported feeling concerned about economic factors than their peers in other countries. These concerns included always or usually being worried or stressed about paying for housing, having enough food and having a safe and clean place to sleep. The proportion of Canadians reporting that they are always or usually stressed about these factors significantly increased from the 2020 survey.\nFinancial concerns remain a negative factor for mental health among Canadians. Food and housing insecurity has been tied to high levels of anxiety.Reference2 \u00a0CMWF survey findings also showed an increase in the proportion of Canadians 18 and older reporting a diagnosis of depression, anxiety or other mental health condition, from 20% in 2016 (CMWF average: 14%) to 29% in 2023 (CMWF average: 25%).\nCanadians\u2019 worries about economic stressors\n\n\nShow text version Hide text version\nText version of graph\nThe proportion of Canadian adults who always or usually felt worried or stressed about having enough food was 4% in 2020 and 10% in 2023, representing a significant increase from 2020.

A lower percentage is more desirable.\nThe proportion of Canadian adults who always or usually felt worried or stressed about paying their rent or mortgage was 11% in 2020 and 17% in 2023, representing a significant increase from 2020. The CMWF average was 9% in 2020 and 14% in 2023. Canada\u2019s 2023 proportion of 17% is significantly higher than the 2023 CMWF average of 14%.

With mental health services not fully covered by public health insurance, patients predominantly pay out of pocket or with private insurance plans.Reference4 \u00a0Canadians were more likely to cite cost as the reason they did not access mental health services when they needed them (Canada: 15%; CMWF average: 11%), particularly among those previously diagnosed with a mental health condition (34%).\nAdults who did not get mental health services because of the cost\n\n\nShow text version Hide text version\nText version of graph\nThe proportions of adults who did not get mental health services when they needed them during the past 12 months due to cost are as follows: Germany, 3%; the Netherlands, 3%; France, 6%; Sweden, 8%; New Zealand, 10%; CMWF average, 11%; the United Kingdom, 12%; Switzerland, 12%; Canada, 15%; Australia, 18%; and the United States, 26%.

Most in this group were younger than 65, and more than two-thirds had a diagnosed mental health concern (71%). Nearly half reported household income lower than $60,000, while 60% reported having a private insurance plan. Even with an insurance plan, potential barriers to accessing mental health care \u00a0can include benefits coverage limits; out-of-pocket costs for copayments, deductibles and medications; and the ability to take time away from work to receive care.\nHealth care providers can support mental health by addressing stressors and lifestyle factors\nPrimary care providers and other health care professionals can support patients\u2019 mental health by addressing stressors and lifestyle factors. However, fewer than 3 in 10 Canadians reported that a health professional talked with them about things in their lives that caused them worry or stress (Canada: 28%; CMWF average: 28%). Discussing lifestyle factors such as physical exercise, healthy eating and substance use with their care providers also varied, with Canada\u2019s results being very similar to the CMWF average. In the 2022 CMWF survey of primary care physicians, less than half of Canadian physicians reported that they often screen or assess patients for their social needs like housing, financial security and food insecurity.Reference5\nDiscussions about stressors with health care professionals\n\n\nShow text version Hide text version\nText version of graph\nThe proportions of adults who reported that a health care professional talked with them in the past 12 months about things in their life that worry them or cause them stress are as follows: the United States, 40%; Australia, 35%; France, 30%; Germany, 30%; Sweden, 28%; CMWF average, 28%; Canada, 28%; New Zealand, 27%; Switzerland, 25%; the United Kingdom, 21%; and the Netherlands, 18%.

In 2022, about three-quarters of Canadian primary care physicians reported that virtual care allowed them to effectively assess the mental and behavioural health needs of their patients.Reference5 \u00a0Virtual mental health care is not yet common across Canada, with only 1 in 9 Canadians (11%) reporting that they received virtual health care from a mental health professional (CMWF average: 7%); however, both uptake of and satisfaction with virtual mental health services were significantly higher among Canadian adults than among adults in other countries surveyed. Of those who received virtual mental health care, most were very or somewhat satisfied with the care received (Canada: 82%; CMWF average: 74%). Younger adults (19%) and females (14%) were more likely to use virtual mental health care. Nearly 3 in 4 Canadian adults who used virtual mental health care had a diagnosed mental health condition (72%).\nVirtual mental health care may not be appropriate for severe and/or acute mental health conditions, but it can be helpful for patients with anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.Reference7Reference8 \u00a0It may have the potential to address barriers to accessing care, and to empower patients to better manage their conditions.Reference9 Further research is needed to understand how to improve equitable access to virtual mental health care in marginalized communities.\nBack to Commonwealth Fund survey, 2023\nReferences\n1.\nBack to Reference 1 in text\nStatistics Canada.

After all, to report on impact is not just looking at\u00a0past achievements. It is also a promise for the future: the\u00a0pact,\u00a0the commitment, and the hope. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 6 The ability to foster change in mental health is an ongoing commitment, for even when we achieve milestones we must be aware of emerging challenges. That is why the MHCC seeks to truly understand and engage with people who have lived and living experience of mental health and substance use health challenges. Not only are these experiences integrated into our research, planning, and outreach efforts. They make it possible to identify gaps in policy and services that provide our evidence-based research to inform change, training to reduce stigma, and programs to offer life-affirming hope. One example is Roots of Hope, a community-led initiative to reduce suicide rates whose impact is empowering communities and provinces across the country \u2014 most recently, the government of Manitoba.\nCanada is a vast country with many geographic, cultural, linguistic, and economic differences. But no matter what your status, you can be affected by mental health concerns. Just as we all have physical health, we all have mental health \u2014 and it\u2019s something that needs tending. Yet, because doing so can be difficult for many people, the MHCC is part of a global forum of mental health leaders who are tackling challenges related to virtual care implementation and its intersections with artificial intelligence. As critical questions emerge, so is the potential for virtual care to reduce mental health service wait times \u2014 something we saw this year in the Northwest Territories. An MHCC project, implemented in partnership with the territorial government and Stepped Care Solutions, led to a 79 per cent reduction in\u00a0wait times for mental health counselling in the region. The Stepped Care model allows individuals to access mental health services at level with the most effective impact. Each level can then be stepped up or down depending on progress and the nature of the concern. The reductions in wait times involved simplifying intake processes, introducing drop-in counselling sessions, and implementing e-mental health services.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 7 The MHCC is also changing the lives of Canadians and communities by increasing mental health literacy and improving access to quality mental health and substance use health supports. Since care needs to be culturally informed to do this well, the commission partnered with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) on a research and pilot program for culturally adapted cognitive behavioural therapy that is improving outcomes for Canadians of South Asian origin with anxiety and depression.\nIn addition, MHCC collaboration across numerous communities regarding the relationship between mental health and cannabis resulted in 40 community-based research projects. Six were led by Indigenous researchers, who provided perspectives on parental cannabis use and child welfare, cannabis retailers in Indigenous communities, and guidance on the interface of cannabis and traditional medicines.\nWe have also been collaborating with Indspire, a\u00a0cross-Canada Indigenous charity that invests in the education of First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis youth and young adults. This initiative focuses on mental health education and resources to support Indigenous students with Indspire\u2019s programs.\nWhile these are truly impactful programs, mental health stigma continues to be a significant issue. We know from work with our research partners that 95 per cent of people with a mental health or substance use disorder were impacted by stigma over the past five years, with the majority reporting feelings of self-stigma and internalizing negative stereotypes.\nThis finding underscores the critical importance of our evidence-based training programs, including those offered through Opening Minds to increase mental health literacy. Since the MHCC was established in 2007, we have trained more than a million people in these innovative evidence-based courses and plan to increase this number significantly.\nTogether, we are actively ensuring that we are equipped to advance policy and program objectives in a sustainable and meaningful manner while creatively increasing our impact. Work like this changes lives.Michel Rodrigue\u2019s signature.\nMichel Rodrigue President and CEOChuck Bruce\u2019s signature.\nChuck Bruce Board Chair Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 8 Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 9 Sporting Mindfulness More than 15,000 schoolchildren across Saskatchewan received mental health training thanks to a ground-breaking partnership between the Mental Health Commission of Canada and\u00a0a\u00a0professional football team. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 10Three female athletes celebrating.\nThe MHCC\u2019s alliance with the Saskatchewan Roughriders also led to a new version of The Working\u00a0Mind (TWM), an evidence-based program to promote mental health and reduce the stigma associated with mental\u00a0illness in the workplace.\n\u201cI\u2019ve long been aware of the mental health training developed and delivered by the MHCC,\u201d says Cindy\u00a0Fuchs, the foundation\u2019s executive director and a recognized leader in Saskatchewan\u2019s not-for-profit sector. \u201cWhen\u00a0I learned about plans to develop a version of TWM for the sports industry, I saw an opportunity for us to work together and serve the greater good.\u201d Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 11Three male athletes celebrating.\nThe Saskatchewan Roughrider Foundation, the charitable organization affiliated with the Canadian Football League team, has\u00a0been funding community-based education, health, and amateur sports projects for young people since it\u00a0was\u00a0established in 2019.\nDeveloped by clinicians and peers, TWM offers facilitated discussions that focus on work-related mental health topics. Since the MHCC launched TWM in 2013, it has developed a series of industry\u2011specific versions of the training by collaborating with a range of\u00a0partners. One of those versions is TWM\u00a0Sport, which was piloted through the foundation with the help of Saskatchewan Roughrider players and coaches, along with a handful of elite athletes in the\u00a0province. Feedback\u00a0from the pilot led to additional improvements to the program.\nDetermined to have more elite football players benefit from the training, the foundation paid to deliver TWM\u00a0Sport to two varsity teams and several junior and women\u2019s teams. To spread its benefits further, the\u00a0foundation also built on its long-standing partnership with the province\u2019s Ministry of Education. For years, the ministry and foundation have partnered on the Game Changers Playbook to give elementary and secondary students evidence-based, curriculum\u2011related mental health and wellness resources. Now, five Roughrider players trained in TWM Sport tour the province to talk about mental health with student groups through the foundation\u2019s Win\u00a0With\u00a0Wellness\u00a0Presentation Series.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 12A Saskatchewan Roughrider team member speaks to students seated at their desks.\n\u201cThe mind is the strongest muscle in your body,\u201d says\u00a0Brayden Lenius, a Saskatchewan Roughrider wide\u00a0receiver who participated in the pilot.\n\u201cYou can develop your mind to become stronger and more resilient. TWM Sport teaches you how to do that.\u201d \u201cLessons from TWM are for everyone \u2014 not just pro athletes,\u201d says Lenius. \u201cTelling schoolchildren about some of the mental health challenges I face, and\u00a0listening to their stories, helps me and helps them.\u201d Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 13 The MHCC continues to seek like-minded partners to expand and improve the effectiveness of programs like TWM. In\u00a0the end, everyone must recognize that mental health can be nurtured, that help is\u00a0available, and that recovery is expected. TWM Versions Besides different versions for employees and managers in\u00a0Canada, Australia, and the United States, TWM is available for\u00a0specific industry groups.

Its\u00a0success is based on sound evidence and an operating model that prioritizes collaboration and independence: Each Roots of Hope community is encouraged to develop and implement the initiatives \u2014 and establish the partnerships \u2014 it considers most appropriate. In many cases, they build on existing programs and services.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 17 \u201cGiving back to others through Roots\u00a0of\u00a0Hope has helped to save my life.\u201d \u201cThe launching of an eight-week support group for [suicide] attempt survivors provided a space for them to work through their struggles in a safe space. I went through the group myself and found it beneficial. I know that, as a lived experience person on the team, it has given me the opportunity to use my life experience for good and to make meaning out of what happened. My\u00a0friend Travis also went through the group last year and found it helpful. He unfortunately died by suicide recently, but I think the group bought him the better part of a year.\nI am very grateful that Roots of Hope exists. I am also grateful that the services we provide gave me more time with my friend. This is meaningful work, and I hope to be able to see it through. It\u2019s the only group of its kind in the area \u2014 and by area I\u2019m pretty sure I mean all of Western Canada. Lastly, the suicide prevention-related events that Stony Plain hosts always have good\u00a0turnouts, and I think the public is starting to be able to speak more openly about it.\u201d Wesley Jones Roots of Hope community Stony Plain, Alberta Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 18 \u201cWe are network of 65 volunteers trained in ground-based search and rescue. Many of the people we search for don\u2019t want to be found, usually because they are experiencing a mental\u2011health crisis. These now account for about 75 per cent of our searches. In many cases, the person is contemplating suicide, and time is of the essence. Partnering with Roots of Hope improves our ability to find and rescue people in crisis. The partnership also improves the mental health of our volunteers, who are now more resilient.\u201d Tina Brown Planning Section Chief Colchester Ground Search and Rescue Colchester County, Nova Scotia \u201cA big reason that members of the 2SLGBTQI+ community experience higher rates of both mental illness and suicide ideation is social stigma, particularly in rural and remote communities. Under our partnership with Roots of Hope, two members of the 2SLGBTQI+ community in each of Nova Scotia\u2019s four health-care zones have been trained to deliver SafeTALK suicide-prevention courses. Hundreds of at-risk people, along with their friends and families, will benefit. Roots of Hope is a catalyst \u2014 the extra ingredient that inspires tangible progress.\u201d Tyler Colbourne Executive Director Healthy Minds Cooperative Nova Scotia Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 19Two youths at a race.\nBy the Numbers 2019 eight communities 2021 11 more Today 18 communities, three provinces, and one territory Roots of Hope is based on\u00a0community expertise To increase the impact of their efforts, Roots of Hope community coalition forge partnerships with a variety of local organizations.

Through consultations with\u00a0the community, care providers, and administrators, the partners overhauled service delivery processes and transformed the system. This\u00a0work enabled the government to integrate SC2.0 into its Community Counselling Program and offer diverse care options while significantly reducing or eliminating\u00a0wait\u2011lists.\nSC2.0 comprises a series of increasingly intensive steps or levels of support and service. From a wide range of\u00a0available choices, individuals and families can make informed decisions about the care that best suits their needs and preferences. For instance, they can access relevant information anonymously, get support from an e-mental health app, join a support group, engage with cultural or land-based programs, or access one-on-one counselling, among other\u00a0options.\nThe Mental Wellness and Addictions Recovery Advisory Group includes residents from across the NWT. The\u00a0group helped co-design SC2.0 in the NWT and continues to provide advice and wisdom rooted in lived and living expertise with mental\u00a0wellness and substance use health.

So far this year, the United States has already experienced 25 weather and climate disasters that each resulted in more than a billion dollars of damages, costing hundreds of lives and more than $73 billion total. For some extreme weather events like Hurricane Idalia and the fires in Hawai\u2018i, the full cost is not yet completely known. Actions taken by President Biden through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS for America Act are helping Americans prepare for, and respond to extreme weather events, as well as a spectrum of other climate-related challenges.\nClimate disasters that occur in one region of the United States can have cascading or compounding effects in other regions. For example, wildfires in one region can worsen air quality and health in other regions. When hazards occur in different regions but at the same time, such as the simultaneous megafires that burned across multiple western states and record back-to-back Atlantic hurricanes in 2020, these compounding disasters can put unprecedented demand on federal emergency response resources. Climate change also interacts with other stressors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and social inequities, which can multiply harm and further increase demand for resources that are needed when responding to disasters. This is particularly true for overburdened communities. These interactions can lead to cascading impacts that cross state and national borders. For example, both gradual changes in average climate conditions (e.g., shifts in temperature and precipitation) and extreme events (e.g., floods, droughts, and wildfire) can shock the global food supply chain and lead to food insecurity, geopolitical instability, and mass migration. These cascading and compounding impacts affect people\u2019s well-being, our economy, and our national security.\nIn addition to federal action, state, local, Tribal, and territorial efforts to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions have expanded in every U.S. region. Many of these actions advance climate mitigation and adaptation at the same time. Effective climate action has prioritized equitable and inclusive planning processes to help ensure that affected communities can participate in decision-making. Across the country, mitigation and adaptation efforts that build upon community strengths and center local and Indigenous Knowledge systems improve resilience.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Fifth National Climate Assessment includes ten regional chapters that assess climate risks and describe challenges, opportunities, and success stories for managing those risks. In addition, the new NCA Atlas allows users to explore localized climate projections to inform climate resilience, adaptation, and mitigation efforts in their communities.\nClimate Change Impacts in Regions Across America\nNortheast \u2014 Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia\nThis region is experiencing increases in the frequency of extreme weather events and other climate-driven changes, including intense rainstorms, warmer ocean temperatures, and rapid sea level rise. For example, the amount of rain that falls during the heaviest downpours has increased by approximately 60% in the Northeast since the 1950s\u2014the largest increase in the United States. Many regional climate impacts, including extreme heat and flooding, disproportionately impact low-income communities and communities of color. The region is responding with mitigation and adaptation efforts, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative\u2014a market-based program aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions; eight state laws requiring emissions reductions of at least 80% by 2050; and new financing options, such as grants, loans, or tax assessments, that improve the capacity of households, communities, and businesses to build climate resilience. Cities, states, and Tribes are implementing climate action plans with innovative approaches that embrace inclusive and equitable processes. For example, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\u2019s Climate Action Plan was developed with multi-year civic engagement opportunities, focuses on benefits of climate action that improve equity, and tracks progress through annual reports. The city\u2019s 2022 stormwater code requires any new development that could affect stormwater runoff to plan for projected increases in heavy rainfall under climate change, rather than building to historical rainfall amounts. Read more in Chapter 21: Northeast.\nSoutheast \u2014 Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia\nThis region\u2019s growing population faces rising sea levels and increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves that lead to greater risks of wildfires. Climate stressors, including drought and extreme heat, are expected to disproportionately affect communities of color and low-income communities who struggle to afford energy bills, especially for air conditioning. Due to increasing energy demands and extreme weather events, there is a growing number of power outages in the region that affect more than 1,000 residents for longer than an hour. This is especially true during the warmer months that place some communities at a higher risk of heat exposure and heat-related illness due to a lack of access to air conditioning. While adaptation efforts tend to be concentrated in wealthier coastal and metropolitan areas, there have been notable advancements in climate actions throughout the region. Following repeated flooding from multiple hurricanes, measures to reduce flood risk in Princeville, North Carolina, include buyouts, elevating homes, and building housing that meets local flood standards. In Orlando, Florida, the city government and businesses are adopting commercial building energy efficiency requirements and a community-wide commitment to 100% renewable energy to advance the decarbonization of local buildings. As the largest rental car market in the world, the metropolitan area has also adopted new electric vehicle readiness policies. Read more in Chapter 22: Southeast.\nU.S. Caribbean \u2014 Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands\nWarmer air and ocean temperatures are leading to intense hurricanes and increasingly powerful storms. The number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes is projected to increase as the climate crisis worsens. In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused more than $2.3 billion in losses and damages to crops and infrastructure, which represented a reduction of about 80% of the main island\u2019s total agricultural value. Paired with rising sea levels and other climate changes, these impacts are harming human health\u2014particularly in underserved communities; degrading, disrupting, and undermining the functions of ecosystems, especially in coastal zones; and threatening the region\u2019s water and food security. Critical infrastructure in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands is at risk of flooding due to sea level rise and heavy rainfall. Changes in precipitation and extreme events are expected to increase outbreaks of disease and can also disrupt vital local services, such as health care and water quality management. Across the region, many community-based organizations have taken actions to advance adaptation, social transformation, and sustainable development. Effective adaptation to support resilience in the region could be enhanced by decentralization of energy and water systems, improved governance and funding, and stronger partnerships across the Caribbean region and the U.S. mainland. For example, decentralized household solar systems and rainwater harvesting improve resilience by providing power and water during interruptions to the centralized utility grid or public water system. Read more in Chapter 23: U.S. Caribbean.\nMidwest \u2014 Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Wisconsin\nThe Midwest is facing rising temperatures, drought, extreme precipitation, and other climate changes. These changes affect Midwestern ecosystems, agriculture, infrastructure, and human health, as well as livelihoods and cultural practices that rely on natural resources, including ice fishing or the harvesting of local plant species. Since 1980, the Midwest has incurred more than $49 billion in economic damages due to flooding. Although average corn and soybean yields have increased in recent decades, both flooding and extreme droughts significantly decreased corn yields in some locations and in some years by up to 37%. Over the past decade, clean energy production in the region has grown by more than 275% and has reduced carbon emissions from the energy sector. Communities, local and state governments, and businesses are embracing adaptation approaches that include green infrastructure, climate-smart agriculture, and collaboration with Tribes on land management issues to improve climate outcomes for all residents. For example, climate-smart agricultural approaches have the potential to increase production, improve resilience to climate-related risks, and yield additional benefits for Midwestern ecosystems. An innovative finance and construction approach being used by the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewer District has reduced the number of annual combined sewer overflow events over the last five years. Using a community-based public-private partnership, Milwaukee is now looking to add an additional 20 million gallons of green stormwater infrastructure capture capacity. Read more in Chapter 24: Midwest.\nNorthern Great Plains \u2014 Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming\nThe Northern Great Plains are experiencing unprecedented extremes, including severe droughts, floods, and wildfires. Climate change can affect floods along the Missouri River, like the ones in 2011 and 2019 that caused evacuations, costly damages, and interstate closures. With additional global warming, the region would expect to see some of the highest increases in annual flooding damage costs in the United States. At the same time, drought is projected to increase, with moderate to extreme droughts occurring as much as 20% more frequently by the end of the century. These changes threaten economic sectors, such as agriculture and recreation, and affect the mental and physical health of residents. The region\u2019s share of employees working in fossil fuel extraction is four times greater than in the nation as a whole. Shifts in energy demand, production, and policy will affect energy-related livelihoods for the region\u2019s residents, especially rural, Indigenous, and low-income immigrant populations, as opportunities in the clean energy field expand. Renewable energy production is on the rise in the Northern Great Plains, with the region supplying 12% of the total U.S. electricity generation from wind, biomass, and solar sources. In addition, the region is home to a number of Tribes who are leading the nation\u2019s clean energy transition by installing clean energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower. Read more in Chapter 25: Northern Great Plains.\nSouthern Great Plains \u2014 Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas\nIncreasing frequency and intensity of precipitation, warmer ocean temperatures, extreme heat, and rising sea levels are degrading the air, lands, and waters that people in the Southern Great Plains rely on for economic, recreational, and cultural activities. Annual precipitation has increased across most of the region, with Texas enduring its five wettest months on record between 2000 and 2021. By contrast, the region also experienced severe to exceptional drought for significant portions of the years between 2010 and 2022. Between 2018 and 2022, 52 individual billion-dollar climate-related disasters affected all or part of the region. By 2050, annual average temperatures are projected to exceed historical record levels in all three states. These impacts compound existing burdens on disadvantaged communities that have the fewest resources to prepare and adapt to climate change. Communities are adapting through nature-based solutions, reliance on Indigenous and local knowledge, and resilient infrastructure that enhances public health and the region\u2019s economy. In 2020, Oklahoma City produced its first sustainability plan to address climate change. Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas, Texas, adopted plans that included both mitigation and adaptation actions and have started to address local equity issues. Throughout the Southern Great Plains, a major shift in energy generation from fossil fuels toward renewables is underway, with the region accounting for 42% of national wind-generated electricity in 2022. This shift in the demand for clean energy is reducing emissions and creating new jobs and cleaner air in the region. Read more in Chapter 26: Southern Great Plains.\nNorthwest \u2014 Idaho, Oregon, Washington\nHigher temperatures are leading to declining snowpack, melting glaciers, and rising sea levels. These changes, combined with increasing risks of flooding, wildfires, and other climate hazards, threaten human health, ecosystems, infrastructure, and industries. For example, the record-breaking Pacific Northwest heatwave of June 2021 led to more than 1,400 heat-related deaths, a subsequent severe wildfire season, significant losses of economically important fishery species, and total damages exceeding $38.5 billion. Impacts on the Northwest\u2019s economy will have cascading effects on livelihoods and well-being of residents. For instance, snow-based recreational industries, such as skiing, have already lost revenue due to a decrease in snow days per calendar year. In parts of the Cascade Range, the snow season is projected to decrease by nearly half by the end of the century. In response to these changes, local governments, Tribes, labor unions, and community groups across the region are adopting policies and programs that support a just transition to a low-carbon future. State and local climate policies in the Northwest are prioritizing climate response strategies that recognize the importance of climate justice, such as subsidizing adaptation, redistributing benefits, and reducing harm to frontline communities. The Quinault Indian Nation is adapting to accelerated loss of land caused by sea level rise, flooding, and erosion along the central coast of Washington State by reacquiring fractionated land and relocating housing and key facilities from their traditional village site to a newly developed site at higher elevation.

Since 2018, 31 climate- and weather-related disasters that have each resulted in more than a billion dollars in damages have affected the Southwest, resulting in more than 700 deaths and estimated damages totaling $67.3 billion. Climate-driven changes to infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries, and other economic sectors are impacting some communities disproportionately. These communities include farmers and ranchers, especially Hispanic, women, and migrant farmworkers; food-insecure households; Indigenous Peoples facing water access challenges; and coastal communities that are reliant on a declining population of traditional fish species. In response, state and local municipalities across the Southwest have implemented adaptive water governance and management approaches. After more than 22 years of historic drought, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation declared the first-ever water shortage on the Colorado River in August 2021. The federal governments of the United States and Mexico, the seven U.S. Colorado River basin states, and Indigenous Peoples are developing a range of adaptation pathways and solutions to enhance long-standing collaboration on the Colorado River, including modeling the impact of more extreme climate change scenarios on water resources in the basin. Efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are also being implemented throughout the region. For example, the Phoenix, Arizona Climate Action Plan states that the city is on track to meet its goal of 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Read more in Chapter 28: Southwest.\nAlaska\nAlaska is warming two to three times faster than the global average, with increases in annual average temperatures since 1971 as high as 6.2\u00b0F in northern Alaska. A 2019 summer heatwave brought record-high temperatures to southern and Interior Alaska, with daily high temperatures exceeding normal by more than 20\u00b0F. The Alaska snowfall season is projected to shorten and snowpack is projected to decrease significantly in the southern and western parts of the state. Warming temperatures, thawing permafrost, and other climate-related changes are damaging ecosystems, disrupting cultural practices, harming fisheries and other livelihoods, exacerbating health disparities, and placing critical infrastructure at risk. Many Alaskans, particularly Alaska Native Peoples, depend on natural resources and have a distinct connection to and understanding of the natural environment. While these communities foster self-reliance and resilience in light of a changing climate, geographical isolation and distance from health care and other services leave many people vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change. In recent years, Alaska has emerged as a leader of climate adaptation initiatives in the Arctic, many of which have been implemented by regional entities and municipal, community, and Tribal governments. For example, to address climate threats to traditional foods, the Chugach Regional Resources Commission, an inter-Tribal fish and wildlife commission in Alaska, is integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Western scientific methods in its adaptation efforts, including weekly water sampling for harmful algal blooms, kelp farming, and restoring clam populations. Community renewable energy initiatives like Thermalize Juneau and the Solarize initiatives in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Kenai, Mat-Su, and Palmer help residential and commercial property owners install solar capacity.

By 2050, fisheries catch are projected to decline by 40% compared to the early 2000s. These climate changes impair access to clean water and healthy food, undermine human health, threaten cultural resources and the built environment, exacerbate inequities, disrupt economic activity, and damage diverse ecosystems across the region. Strategies are being developed and implemented across the region to revitalize healthier traditional food systems, resulting in more just access to food. Subsistence-based food system practices have sustained Pacific Island peoples for millennia and have aided in recoveries from natural disasters such as typhoons and tsunamis. Other promising fisheries adaptations include establishing networks of marine protected areas to preserve coastal resources, safeguarding fish habitats from pollution runoff, and restoring traditional fishpond mariculture. To help mitigate climate change, the Kaua\u02bbi Island Utility Cooperative achieved a nearly 70% renewable portfolio standard in 2021, and the island is sometimes 100% renewably powered during midday hours. Meanwhile, U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands plan to use blue carbon ecosystems, including mangroves and seagrasses, to offset emissions while also protecting coastal infrastructure.

Savings of \u20ac3.5 billion\nThe government plans to save billions across the healthcare sector, including \u20ac600 million on hospital spending, \u20ac1.3 billion on healthcare products and medicine prices, \u20ac300 million on outpatient care (particularly on analysis laboratories), and \u20ac1.25 billion on \u2018making professionals and patients more responsible\u2019, or \u2018self-sufficient\u2019.\nDespite this, however, health insurance expenditure is still set to represent 8.7% of GDP in 2024, compared with 8.2% before the Covid-19 health crisis.\n2. More measures against social security fraud\nAlso on the government\u2019s list is the \u2018under-declaration\u2019 of turnover by micro-entrepreneurs employed by digital platforms.\nThis is estimated to equal a loss of revenue of \u20ac800 million. By 2027 platforms will be required to deduct these contributions directly, the government has said. The bill will also introduce the offences of 00\u2018incitement to social fraud\u2019 as well as the \u2018promotion and facilitation of fraud\u2019.\n3. Single-pill dispensing in the event of shortages\nIn the event that a medicine is in short supply, pharmacists may be required to dispense single-dose, or specific tablet quantities, of a medicine. Pharmacists will have to dispense \u2018the appropriate quantity\u2019 according to the patient's prescription, rather than a whole box.\nThe government may also make it compulsory to carry out a test rapide d'orientation diagnostique (TROD, rapid diagnostic test) when dispensing certain antibiotics, to ensure that antibiotics are only prescribed when appropriate.\nOn the other hand, testing will also mean that pharmacists will be able to check for issues such as strep throat and cystitis, and dispense antibiotics for these conditions without a doctor's prescription.\nRead more: Shortages of 4,000 medicines in France; what risk for this winter?\n4. Tighter controls on sick leave\nTighter rules on sick leave will mean that companies will have the power to appoint their own examining doctor, who will be authorised to suspend the payment of benefits to the patient on sick leave if they consider the absence to be unjustified. The Assurance maladie may also carry out a second examination.\nSick leave signed off via teleconsultation (video call) will be limited to three days at a time, except for those prescribed by the company\u2019s own appointed doctor.\nRead more: Doctors under fire over number of sick days they grant French workers\n5. \u2018Temporary status\u2019 for therapeutic cannabis\nTherapeutic cannabis - cannabis that is used to help treat health conditions, such as chronic pain - has been granted \u2018temporary status\u2019 for five years, pending a decision from European authorities on its marketing authorisation.\nSome European countries have already authorised medical cannabis to calm pain and anxiety for some patients. However, it was previously only authorised in France as part of an experiment, which had been due to end on March 26, 2024.\nRead more: Medical cannabis gets go-ahead for pain relief in French hospitals\n6. More widespread use of shared medical transport\nThe new bill states that patients who refuse to share a health transport service (light medical vehicle or approved taxi) with another patient without a valid medical reason will have to pay in advance.\nThey will also only be reimbursed on the basis of the price of shared transport, rather than a solo service.\n7. Different sources of hospital funding\nThe new budget is set to introduce two new funding methods for hospitals. One will be based on \u2018public health objectives\u2019 and the other on \u2018specific missions\u2019 (not yet revealed).\nThis reform will not begin to apply in full until January 1, 2025.\n8. Reimbursed physical activity sessions for cancer patients\nCancer patients will benefit from reimbursed physical activity sessions to help support their treatment journey. The scheme will initially be trialled for two years, on an experimental basis.\n9. Menstrual underwear and cups reimbursed\nReusable sanitary protection (menstrual pants and menstrual cups) will now be reimbursed for women under the age of 26, and all women covered by the Compl\u00e9mentaire sant\u00e9 solidaire scheme.\nCondoms will also be free for all insured persons under the age of 26.\n10. Systematic screening for pregnant women\nPregnant women will now be systematically screened for cytomegalovirus (CMV).This is a virus that can affect foetal development.\nIn addition, a three-year trial of a care pathway dedicated to post-partum depression - a serious condition that can range from \u2018baby blues\u2019 to severe psychosis - has also been added.\nRelated articles\nFrance\u2019s 2024 budget plans for healthcare: What could change for you?\nMore tax on alcohol, sick pay: what will France\u2019s 2024 budget change?\nWill sports sessions be reimbursable throughout France?\n\n\n\ngovernment funding\ngovernment\nfrench news\nbudget\nparliament\nhealth\n\nRunners join Nice-Cannes Marathon to fund English-language cancer support services in Alpes-Maritimes \nWet, overcast and blustery weather is forecast for most of the country\nThe door, window and joinery chain has gone into administration and cannot fulfil orders or reimburse customers\nMarathon effort boosts cancer support in France\n\n\n    Runners join Nice-Cannes Marathon to fund English-language cancer support services in Alpes-Maritimes \n\nLetters: French GP is charging more than he should for consultation\n\n\n    Connexion reader says her doctor is already asking for \u20ac30 per visit\n\n\nFrench winter warmer recipes: Boeuf bourguignon \n\n\n    This delicious beef stew braised in red wine is a standard of Parisian bistros\n\nSmartphone SOS alert saves driver's life in France after crash\n\n\n    Crash Detection system is triggered by violent movement and sends message to emergency services\n\nRevered French national icon falls from grace\n\n\n    Celebrated anti-poverty and homelessness campaigner Abb\u00e9 Pierre was voted France\u2019s most popular person for many years, but sexual abuse accusations have shattered the activist priest\u2019s crusading legacy\n\nEU faces legal challenge from French lawyer over weedkiller sale decision\n\n\n    Corinne Lepage fighting decision to allow glyphosate to be sold in Europe for another 10 years\n\nFrance's first national park is an outdoor haven\n\n\n    Discover the breathtaking landscapes and rich biodiversity of Parc National de la Vanoise, in the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region\n\nImprove your language skills with these five French tongue twisters\n\n\n    As well as being a fun party trick, these can help you master pronunciation of difficult sounds\n\nChild health booklets in France will be updated to include risks of screen time\n\n\n    Report by experts recommends banning screens for children under the age of three\n\nHow many bank holidays does France get vs Europe and US?\n\n\n    See how France compares as MPs debate taking away one of the country\u2019s jours f\u00e9ri\u00e9s\n\nBeaujolais Nouveau: France\u2019s youngest, freshest and fruitiest wine\n\n\n    Producer Laurent Metge-Toppin shares ten facts to help you appreciate the once-maligned tipple\n\n\nMany French hospitals trial fingertip test for heart disease\n\n\n    Test takes 15 minutes and can detect early signs of the disease\n\nSNCF train tickets open for early 2025 bookings\n\n\n    International destinations and skiing stations within France are included in the seats now available\n\nIgnoring this increasingly common French road sign could cost you \u20ac135\n\n\n    New driving rule relates to areas designated a zone \u00e0 trafic limit\u00e9\n\nFrench farmer protests: what action is planned and where on November 18?\n\n\n    Major unions are demonstrating against the Mercosur trade deal in a bid to pressure the government to provide more support\n\nFrance\u2019s 2025 budget will \u2018probably\u2019 be forced through without vote, says PM\n\n\n    Right-wing MPs rejected taxation section of the budget earlier this week\n\n\nFrench study tests psychedelics in alcoholism therapy\n\n\n    A groundbreaking experiment explores how psilocybin can be used to combat depressive symptoms in alcohol recovery\n\nHow your pet can be a blood donor in France\n\n\n    Veterinary hospitals say it is crucial to treat sick cats and dogs and it is easy to sign up your pet\n\nLetters: French cycling rules are rarely enforced\n\n\n    Connexion reader says he takes special precautions to stay safe\n\nStrepsils, Olbas Oil, TCP: Find French equivalents to common remedies\n\n\n    Moving to France means navigating pharmacies and hunting down alternatives to treat everyday ailments\n\nBriton applies for French residency card and finds he was adopted -

There will also be changes to some medical fees.\nHere is a list of the key changes to expect in the coming year:\nFranchises m\u00e9dicales\nThe franchise m\u00e9dicale, the obligatory fee which is not reimbursed (or refunded by mutuelles) on the purchase of prescription drugs and certain paramedical services (nurses, physiotherapists, speech therapists, podiatrists\u2026) could increase from 50 cents to \u20ac1 from January.\nIn December, Finance Minister Bruno le Maire confirmed the change but did not give a launch date. No further information has been given.\nThe franchise on medical transport costs could also increase from \u20ac2 to \u20ac4. However, an annual limit of \u20ac50 for prescription medicine and paramedical franchises will remain in place.\nRead more: Obligatory fee not reimbursed on medicines in France to double\nMedical buses\nThere are already 10 \u2018m\u00e9dicobus\u2019 services in operation \u2013 buses carrying everything onboard to provide a \u2018doctor\u2019s surgery\u2019 service.\nThe government aims for about 30 in early 2024 and 100 by the end of the year.\nAd\nDigital services\nA nationwide rollout of a digital version of the carte Vitale is due to be launched this year at an unspecified date.\nCurrently a \u2018carte Vitale\u2019 app is available on phones in a few departments but it is not familiar to all health professionals in these areas.\nThe idea was first announced in 2019 but has undergone several iterations since then.\nMeanwhile a \u2018digital prescription\u2019 service, whereby prescriptions should be printed in a special format with a smartcode containing the information \u2013 that pharmacists can scan \u2013 should also be rolled out for all hospital and doctors\u2019 appointments this year, but has suffered from limited take-up and familiarity.\nYou are also more likely this year to see \u2018telemedicine\u2019 cabins, especially in pharmacies, with France\u2019s largest provider of these, Medadom, hoping to reach 10,000 installations.\nThese allow people to have GP consultations at a distance and to provide basic health information such as blood pressure and heart rate.\nPreventative health checks\nFully-reimbursed preventative health checks are to be available nationwide from January for the following age groups: 18-25, 45-50, 60-65 and 70-75.\nCalled Mon bilan pr\u00e9vention, the checks will look at general health, diet, sleep, addictions etc as well as risk of illnesses common to the age group.\nThey will be on offer from doctors, midwives, nurses and pharmacists. If eligible, you can book one here.\nCondoms and sanitary protection\nCondoms are to be available free of charge from pharmacies for people aged below 26, and reusable menstrual protection including protective underwear or menstrual cups for women aged under 26 will now be reimbursed.\nVaccination\nVoluntary vaccinations against human papillomavirus will be available from age 11, instead of 14.\nSubsidised top-up insurance\nPeople who claim certain benefits will be automatically offered CSS subsidised top-up insurance without them having to apply and provide extra information on their means\nThe benefits that are eligible for this include:\n\nAAH and ASI disability benefits,\nAllocation de solidarit\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifique (means-tested benefit for people out of work whose rights to ordinary unemployment benefit have run out)\nAllocation de contrat d\u2019engagement jeune (for young jobseekers in training or volunteering)\n\nRead more: Claiming free or cheaper top-up French health insurance to get easier\n\u2715\nhealth french news doctor medicine\nDel p\u00e5 Facebook Del p\u00e5 Twitter Del p\u00e5 e-post\nAd\nhealth french news doctor medicine\n\n #### Is France set to ban smoking on restaurant and cafe terraces?

December 2023 - 12:40 Modified wednesday 06. December 2023 - 12:40\nDel p\u00e5 Facebook Del p\u00e5 Twitter Del p\u00e5 e-post\nThe French parliament has officially adopted its healthcare budget for 2024, including measures to cap spending, address medicine shortages, and limit social security fraud.\nThe budget de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale, sometimes shortened to the \u2018S\u00e9cu\u2019 budget, was adopted on December 4 after the Assembl\u00e9e nationale rejected a motion of no confidence against the government after Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne once again used the controversial article 49.3 to pass the bill.\nRead more: What is France\u2019s article 49.3?\nThere are 113 articles in total, but the major measures include more stringent checks on sick leave and social security fraud, and the enabling of pharmacists to dispense of medicines pill-by-pill (rather than entire boxes) in the event of shortages.\nHere are the 10 key measures and aims.\n1. Savings of \u20ac3.5 billion\nThe government plans to save billions across the healthcare sector, including \u20ac600 million on hospital spending, \u20ac1.3 billion on healthcare products and medicine prices, \u20ac300 million on outpatient care (particularly on analysis laboratories), and \u20ac1.25 billion on \u2018making professionals and patients more responsible\u2019, or \u2018self-sufficient\u2019.\nDespite this, however, health insurance expenditure is still set to represent 8.7% of GDP in 2024, compared with 8.2% before the Covid-19 health crisis.\n2. More measures against social security fraud\nAlso on the government\u2019s list is the \u2018under-declaration\u2019 of turnover by micro-entrepreneurs employed by digital platforms.\nAd\nThis is estimated to equal a loss of revenue of \u20ac800 million. By 2027 platforms will be required to deduct these contributions directly, the government has said. The bill will also introduce the offences of 00\u2018incitement to social fraud\u2019 as well as the \u2018promotion and facilitation of fraud\u2019.\n3. Single-pill dispensing in the event of shortages\nIn the event that a medicine is in short supply, pharmacists may be required to dispense single-dose, or specific tablet quantities, of a medicine. Pharmacists will have to dispense \u2018the appropriate quantity\u2019 according to the patient's prescription, rather than a whole box.\nThe government may also make it compulsory to carry out a test rapide d'orientation diagnostique (TROD, rapid diagnostic test) when dispensing certain antibiotics, to ensure that antibiotics are only prescribed when appropriate.\nOn the other hand, testing will also mean that pharmacists will be able to check for issues such as strep throat and cystitis, and dispense antibiotics for these conditions without a doctor's prescription.\nRead more: Shortages of 4,000 medicines in France; what risk for this winter?\n4. Tighter controls on sick leave\nTighter rules on sick leave will mean that companies will have the power to appoint their own examining doctor, who will be authorised to suspend the payment of benefits to the patient on sick leave if they consider the absence to be unjustified. The Assurance maladie may also carry out a second examination.\nSick leave signed off via teleconsultation (video call) will be limited to three days at a time, except for those prescribed by the company\u2019s own appointed doctor.\nRead more: Doctors under fire over number of sick days they grant French workers\n5. \u2018Temporary status\u2019 for therapeutic cannabis\nTherapeutic cannabis - cannabis that is used to help treat health conditions, such as chronic pain - has been granted \u2018temporary status\u2019 for five years, pending a decision from European authorities on its marketing authorisation.\nSome European countries have already authorised medical cannabis to calm pain and anxiety for some patients. However, it was previously only authorised in France as part of an experiment, which had been due to end on March 26, 2024.\nRead more: Medical cannabis gets go-ahead for pain relief in French hospitals\n6. More widespread use of shared medical transport\nThe new bill states that patients who refuse to share a health transport service (light medical vehicle or approved taxi) with another patient without a valid medical reason will have to pay in advance.\nThey will also only be reimbursed on the basis of the price of shared transport, rather than a solo service.\n7. Different sources of hospital funding\nThe new budget is set to introduce two new funding methods for hospitals. One will be based on \u2018public health objectives\u2019 and the other on \u2018specific missions\u2019 (not yet revealed).\nThis reform will not begin to apply in full until January 1, 2025.\n8. Reimbursed physical activity sessions for cancer patients\nCancer patients will benefit from reimbursed physical activity sessions to help support their treatment journey. The scheme will initially be trialled for two years, on an experimental basis.\n9. Menstrual underwear and cups reimbursed\nReusable sanitary protection (menstrual pants and menstrual cups) will now be reimbursed for women under the age of 26, and all women covered by the Compl\u00e9mentaire sant\u00e9 solidaire scheme.\nCondoms will also be free for all insured persons under the age of 26.\n10. Systematic screening for pregnant women\nPregnant women will now be systematically screened for cytomegalovirus (CMV).This is a virus that can affect foetal development.\nIn addition, a three-year trial of a care pathway dedicated to post-partum depression - a serious condition that can range from \u2018baby blues\u2019 to severe psychosis - has also been added.\nRelated articles\nFrance\u2019s 2024 budget plans for healthcare: What could change for you?\nMore tax on alcohol, sick pay: what will France\u2019s 2024 budget change?\nWill sports sessions be reimbursable throughout France?\n\u2715\ngovernment funding government french news budget parliament health\nDel p\u00e5 Facebook Del p\u00e5 Twitter Del p\u00e5 e-post\nAd\ngovernment funding government french news budget parliament health\n\n#### People in France giving more to charity in 2024 than 2023 The most popular causes are medical research and animal protection\n #### When do the clocks change in France this month?

      "Boston Subway Map 2024 \u2013 Timetable, Tickets & Prices\n  \nSubway Boston (MTBA) \u2013 The route network\nThe Boston subway is a true monument to American history. The metro system is the oldest subway in the USA. It opened on September 1, 1887, just before the Chicago subway.\nOpened at the time as the \u201cStreet Subway\u201d, the route is still part of the so-called Green Line with the oldest subway tunnel in the USA. Alongside the three modern metro lines, it is a special feature on the Boston Metro Map. The Green Line is actually an S-Bahn line, but a large part of it runs underground. At 37 kilometers, it is not only the longest, but also the busiest subway line in Boston, carrying around 230,000 passengers a day.\nAll lines are operated by Massachusetts Bay Transportation (MBTA). The subway network, affectionately known by Bostonians as \u201cThe T\u201d or \u201cBoston T\u201d, stretches over a total length of around 120.3 kilometers. With 200,000 passengers per day, the Orange Line has the second largest passenger volume after the Green Line. The metro lines on the Boston Metro Map can only be distinguished by their color. To avoid confusion with other public transport lines, travelers should therefore remember the Red Line, the Blue Line, the Orange Line and the Green Line.\nInhaltsverzeichnis\nThe Boston subway lines at a glance\nInformation for tourists about the Boston Metro\nBoston owes its popularity as a travel destination and place to work and study not least to its famous universities. Harvard University and the New England Conservatory are particularly famous. However, it is not just students and commuters who use the transportation services of the \u201cBoston T\u201d. There are also plenty of tourists who want to see historically significant sites such as the Old State House, the Freedom Trail, Faneuil Hall or the USS Constitution.\nAccordingly, the number of people in Boston who use the Metro Map is also increasing. This is comparatively easy to accomplish due to the small number of lines. The most important connection for tourists is undoubtedly the Blue Line between the airport and the city center at the Government Center stop.\nBoston subway tickets & prices\nWith a population of just over 600,000, Boston is not exactly a small town. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the tariff system is very reminiscent of this. Instead of a complex system with several tariff zones, a flat-rate billing system is used. This also makes it much easier for non-residents to use the metro in Boston. This also limits the choice of tickets to a minimum.\nThey are valid for both the subway and the bus lines. In addition to one-way tickets, the operating company MTBA only offers daily, weekly and monthly tickets. Tickets are cheaper for senior citizens, the disabled and students. Boston\u2019s subway is also very family-friendly. Children up to the age of 11 can travel free of charge on the metro.\nThe most important metro tickets in Boston\nIf you want to buy a metro ticket in Boston, you have several options. The most common option is to buy classic paper tickets, known as Charlie tickets. They are available from the ticket machines in front of the entrances to the subway platforms. If there is no ticket machine and validator to be found on a subway platform, tickets can often also be purchased on board the trains. However, only tickets with a value of up to 20 US dollars can be purchased at the ticket machines on board.\nUsing the CharlieCard is much more convenient. This is a rechargeable chip card that can be used to book tickets and also serves as a travel pass. It can be used as a one-way ticket, day ticket, weekly ticket and monthly ticket. The CharlieCard is particularly attractive because of the discount on the price of single trips. The CharlieCard is also validated or activated at the electronic access barriers to the platforms. There are no smartphone tickets for the metro in Boston, nor are there any special combined tickets for tourists. Such tickets are usually associated with discounts for attractions.\nBoston subway schedule\nThe Green Line starts its service at around 5:00 am. Service on the three remaining lines on the Boston Metro Map begins between 5:15 and 5:30 a.m. This regulation applies on the Green Line and Blue Line seven days a week. On the Red Line and the Orange Line, however, the first trains on Sundays do not depart until an hour later at around 6:00 am. Both during the week and at weekends, all lines run until around 1:00 a.m. or 1:30 a.m. at night.\nThe frequency of the four metro lines on the Boston Metro Map varies throughout the day between a 3-minute interval during rush hour and a 9-15-minute interval in the late evening and night hours. So if you want to be out and about in Boston after 1:00 a.m., you have to use one of the city\u2019s many cabs or the Uber service.\nRed Line, Orange Line, Blue Line, Green Line\nFurther information on the Boston Metro\nThe saying \u201cother countries, other customs\u201d applies not only to the USA in general, but also to the metro in Boston. There are some rules that may seem strange to the average European at first. Eating on the Boston subway is not prohibited, but if the food smells too strong, the employees of the operating company can issue a warning. Incidentally, no one should put up any resistance, as these employees are official security guards from the MBTA Police Department.\nSo safety on board is also well taken care of. Very loud conversations that disturb the other passengers are also worthy of a warning. Playing music loudly is prohibited both at subway stations and on the trains themselves. No less unusual is the clear permission to put your feet up on the seat, provided the subway carriage is largely empty.\n (No Ratings Yet)Loading...\n",

Provisional estimates are published quarterly and remain provisional until after they have been constrained by the final annual estimates each year. These provisional estimates are based on traffic data collected continuously from a network of around 300 automatic traffic counters. Final annual figures also incorporate manual traffic count data.\nTraffic shows a seasonal pattern at the national level, being highest in summer and lowest in winter. This publication focuses on rolling annual traffic totals, which better illustrate medium and long term trends in traffic.\nAnnual traffic estimates are usually published between May and June of the following year. The next provisional figures, for the year ending June 2024, are due to be released in September 2024.\nThese are accredited official statistics[footnote 1] and were independently reviewed by the Office for Statistics Regulation in February 2013. For more information, see the background information on provisional road traffic estimates.\nHeadline figures\nOverall traffic levels in the year ending March 2024 were higher than in year ending March 2023 and below pre-pandemic levels.\nChart 1: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 1 is a line chart showing that 332.4 billion vehicle miles were driven on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was up 2.1% compared to the year ending March 2023. Motor vehicle traffic levels fell during the pandemic but have since increased. This is the case for all vehicle types and road types. Traffic levels for the year ending March 2024 were 1.8% below pre-pandemic levels.\nRoad traffic by vehicle type\nChart 2: Share of traffic by vehicle type for the year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 2 is a bar chart which shows that cars accounted for 76% of all motor vehicle traffic on Great Britain\u2019s roads over the year ending March 2024. Therefore, cars continue to be the main contributor to changes in overall motor vehicle traffic.\nThe proportion of van traffic has increased in recent years, accounting for 18% of all motor vehicle traffic in this 12 month period.\nLorries accounted for 5% of all motor vehicle traffic and 1% of traffic came from other motor vehicles including motorcycles and buses.\nIn the year ending March 2024:\nTable 1: Vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain by vehicle type in the year ending March 2024, and percentage change compared to previous 12 month periods (from TRA2501a)\nTable 1 shows how traffic in the year ending March 2024 compares to a selection of earlier years for different vehicle types. For example, car and taxi traffic was 2.6% higher in the year ending March 2024 than the year ending March 2023. Note that any differences between -0.5% and +0.5% are considered negligible.\nCars and taxis\nChart 3: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by cars and taxis in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 3 is a line chart which illustrates that cars and taxis travelled 252.5 billion vehicle miles in the 12 months ending March 2024. Car and taxi traffic rose 2.6% from the year ending March 2023. Car and taxi miles for the year ending March 2024 were down by 4.0% compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nVans (Light Commercial Vehicles - LCVs)\nChart 4: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by vans in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 4 is a line chart which shows that 58.2 billion vehicle miles were driven by vans on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was a rise of 1.1% compared to the year ending March 2023. Van distance travelled for the year ending March 2024 was 8.8% higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nLorries (Heavy Goods Vehicles - HGVs)\nChart 5: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by lorries in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 5 is a line chart showing that 16.9 billion vehicle miles were driven by lorries on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. Lorry traffic decreased by 2.0% compared to the year ending March 2023. Distance covered by lorries for the year ending March 2024 was 1.7% below pre-pandemic levels. The chart shows that the pandemic had a lesser effect on total lorry traffic than other vehicle types. Between the years ending December 2019 and December 2020, lorry traffic only fell by 5.9%, while car and van traffic fell by 24.9% and 9.2% respectively.\nRoad traffic by road type\nChart 6: Share of traffic by road type for the year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 6 is a bar chart displaying that on Great Britain\u2019s roads, in the year ending March 2024, 21% of motor vehicle miles travelled were on motorways, 44% on \u2018A\u2019 roads, and 35% on minor roads. 65% of motor vehicle miles travelled were on major roads (motorways and \u2018A\u2019 roads) despite comprising only 13% of the road network by length.\nIn the year ending March 2024:\nTable 2: Vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain by road type in the year ending March 2024 compared to previous 12 month periods (from TRA2502a)\nTable 2 shows how traffic in the year ending March 2024 compares to a selection of earlier years for different road types. For example, motorway traffic was 1.9% higher in the year ending March 2024 than the year ending March 2023. Note that any differences between -0.5% and +0.5% are considered negligible.\nMotorways\nChart 7: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled on motorways in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 7 is a line chart illustrating that 70.1 billion vehicle miles were driven on motorways in Great Britain in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was an increase of 1.9% compared to the year ending March 2023. Motorway traffic for the year ending March 2024 was similar to pre-pandemic levels.\n\u2018A\u2019 roads\nChart 8: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled on \u2018A\u2019 roads in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 8 is a line chart which shows 146.5 billion vehicle miles were driven on \u2018A\u2019 roads in Great Britain in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This represents a 2.6% rise from the year ending March 2023. Traffic on \u2018A\u2019 roads for the year ending March 2024 was 2.5% lower than pre-pandemic levels.\nMinor roads\nChart 9: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled on minor roads in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 9 is a line chart showing that 115.8 billion vehicle miles were driven on minor roads in Great Britain in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This represents a 1.6% increase from the year ending March 2023. Distance travelled on minor roads for the year ending March 2024 was 1.8% below pre-pandemic levels.\nBackground information\nGlossary\nFurther information\nA background quality report has been published for these statistics.

The increase entails trains arriving every 8 to 9 minutes compared to their current schedule of every 10 to 11 minutes.\nPhase two begins in August, with a weekday midday service increase on the C, N, and R lines, which will cut train wait times by 2 minutes. Train service frequency will also increase on the 1 and 6 lines on weekends, with trains arriving every 6 minutes instead of every 8.\nIncreased train frequency will most definitely be a welcome sight this summer, as we all know how miserable the subway gets in the heat, especially considering the subway saw over one billion riders last year.\nBy December phase three will begin, which will increase weekday evening service on the C, N, and R lines as well as midday service on the G line. Trains on these lines will arrive every 8 minutes under the enhanced service.\n6-minute service on the 1 and 6 lines during the weekend will also be extended during this phase to encompass more hours of the day.\nFinally, the fourth and final phase will begin in July 2024. During this phase, weekday and evening service will increase on the B, D, J, and M lines with trains arriving every 8 minutes. The 3 and 5 lines will also see increased weekend service with trains arriving every 10 minutes.\n\u201cThe subway is the lifeblood of New York City, and that is why in this year\u2019s state budget we made sure to deliver the necessary funding not just to shore up the MTA\u2019s financing, but to enhance service as well,\u201d said State Senator Liz Krueger.\nIn addition to the increased service, NYC\u2019s Re-NEW-vation Program aims to renovate a total of 50 subway stations by the end of 2023.\nGET US IN YOUR INBOX\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city\n\n\n  I accept terms & conditions\nDiscover our cities\nGET US IN YOUR INBOX\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city\n\n\n  I accept terms & conditions\nGET US IN YOUR INBOX\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city\n\n\n  I accept terms & conditions\n\n\nTYPE IN YOUR SEARCH AND PRESS ENTER\nNo result\n"

      "An X inside this box indicates no flooding occurred within this Hydrologic Service Area.\nNear to above-normal precipitation was observed across Upper Michigan during April when WFO Marquette, Manistique, and Munising all recorded more than 150% of normal precipitation (Table 1, Figure 6). A wintry storm on April 2-4 brought the large majority of Upper Michigan\u2019s monthly snowfall and a wetter storm tracked across the region April 28-29. Percent of normal year-to-date precipitation increased at each observation site relative to March values (Table 2) signaling a continuation of the transition to above-normal precipitation that began in March. Temperatures trended closer to average during April, but all observations sites remain in the top 10 warmest January-April periods with temperature anomalies of +3\u00b0F to +7\u00b0F (Table 3). Despite the wetter pattern, the very warm start to the year melted the paltry seasonal snowpack during March resulting in much below-normal streamflow for most of Upper Michigan\u2019s waterways during April (Figures 1-3). Warmth also maintained drought conditions, mainly across portions of western Upper Michigan where deficits in soil moisture continue to linger, but have improved since March (Figures 4, 7-9).

      "MIAMI-SOUTH FLORIDA National Weather Service Forecast Office http://www.weather.gov/miami Summer 2024 Weather Summary Top 10 Warmest Summer on Record Mostly Above Normal Rainfall September 3rd, 2024: Now that meteorological summer (June-August) has concluded, here\u2019s a look back at the observed temperatures and precipitation across South Florida. South Florida\u2019s summer weather pattern fluctuated from lower-than-normal pressures and southerly wind flow from the deep tropics during the first half of June, to one dominated by the subtropical high pressure and resultant easterly wind over the western Atlantic from the second half of June through most of July. In August, the mean wind was mostly out of the south and southwest, due in part to the influence from Hurricane Debby in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on the 3rd and 4th. June started dry across most of South Florida, with moderate to severe drought conditions from the Everglades east to metro Broward and Palm Beach counties. A flow of deep tropical moisture affected the region during the period from June 10-15 as a tropical disturbance moved across the Florida peninsula on June 12th. Several days of copious rainfall led to major flash flooding across parts of South Florida, mainly in the northern Miami-Dade and southern Broward County metro areas where 2-day rainfall totals of 15 to 20 inches were observed (Figure 1). Rainfall totals of 10-20 inches were common across most of Collier County (highest values over the eastern sections of the county), with generally 5-8 inches elsewhere across the region. This rainfall quickly ended the late spring drought. Figure 1: 2-day rainfall totals from June 11-13 The predominant easterly wind pattern following the tropical disturbance through most of July contributed to a rather wide disparity in rainfall during this time frame. Most of Southwest Florida received above normal rainfall in July from near-daily afternoon thunderstorms resulting from the Gulf sea breeze interacting with the prevailing east wind flow. Naples Municipal Airport measured 14.47\u201d of rainfall, the 3rd wettest July on record. Meanwhile, much of metro SE Florida was drier than normal with some areas receiving less than half of the average monthly total, including West Palm Beach with 1.90 inches and Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport with 2.59 inches. On August 3rd, a tropical disturbance over Cuba became Tropical Storm Debby over the lower Straits of Florida, then moved northwest and north over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on August 4th and 5th, reaching hurricane strength before landfall in the Florida Big Bend on the 5th. Bands of heavy rainfall and gusty winds began affecting South Florida on August 3rd, continuing through August 5th. The highest rainfall totals were in western Collier County in closest proximity to the center of Debby, with 2-day rainfall totals of 6-8 inches common over the greater Naples area. This, combined with a storm tide of 3 feet, led to significant flooding across this region. Elsewhere across South Florida, rainfall totals were mostly in the 2\u20134-inch range. The rest of August was characterized by a moist south to southwest wind flow with above normal rainfall fairly evenly distributed across the southern peninsula. The end result for the summer was above normal precipitation, most notably in Collier County where Naples received just over 40 inches, their second wettest summer on record going back to 1942. Most areas ranked in the top 10 wettest summer going back at least 20-25 years.

While this past summer\u2019s average of daily maximum temperatures was slightly lower than last year\u2019s record-setting values, the average daily minimums were mostly higher than last year. For example, both West Palm Beach (25) and Fort Lauderdale (43) had at least twice as many days with low temperatures of 80F or higher than last year. Summer 2024 temperature summaries for the 4 main climate sites are below: - Miami International Airport had an average summer temperature of 84.6 degrees Fahrenheit. This is 0.9 degrees above the 30-year normal and ties the 7th warmest summer on record. Miami observed 67 days of temperatures at or above 90 degrees this summer, which is just above the normal total of 64 days. The highest temperature was 98 degrees on August 15th, and the lowest was 73 degrees on August 9th. A total of 8 daily high minimum temperature records were tied or broken, and 2 daily high temperature records were tied or broken. - Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport had an average summer temperature of 84.6 degrees Fahrenheit. This is 1.2 degrees above the 30-year normal, and ties their warmest summer on record set in 2010. Fort Lauderdale observed 68 days of temperatures at or above 90 degrees, which is well above the normal total of 49 days. The highest temperature was 96 degrees on August 7th, and the lowest was 74 degrees on June 4th, June 12th, June 30th, August 22nd, and August 29th. A total of 14 daily high minimum temperature records were tied or broken. - Palm Beach International Airport had an average summer temperature of 84.3 degrees Fahrenheit. This is 1.7 degrees above the 30-year normal and is the 5th warmest summer on record. West Palm Beach observed 66 days of temperatures at or above 90 degrees, which is above the normal total of 55 days. The highest temperature was 96 degrees on July 28th and August 19th. The lowest temperature was 71 degrees on June 4th. A total of 11 daily high minimum temperature records were tied or broken, and 1 daily high temperature records was broken. - Naples Municipal Airport had an average summer temperature of 84.3 degrees Fahrenheit. This is 1.4 degrees above the 30-year normal and ties the 3rd warmest summer on record. Naples observed 76 days of temperatures at or above 90 degrees, which is above the normal total of 64 days. The highest temperature was 96 degrees on July 3rd, July 4th, August 1st, and August 2nd. The lowest was 73 degrees on June 1st, June 3rd, and June 4th. A total of 7 daily high minimum temperature records were tied or broken, and 5 daily high temperature records were tied or broken. Heat advisories were issued for the following number of days per county this summer: Miami-Dade: 40 Broward: 39 Palm Beach: 29 Collier: 29 Hendry: 19 Glades: 19 (NOTE: 3 heat advisories were issued in May which are not included in the above totals) No Excessive Heat Warnings were issued. Below are graphs (Figures 3-8) courtesy of IEM showing the number of hours with heat index values at or above 105F at several airport locations (2024 values at the far right in orange): Note: Naples Airport data not shown due to incomplete dew point data Fall 2024 Outlook (September to November) Latest outlooks by the NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC, Figures 9 and 10) are indicating the likelihood (50-60%) of above normal temperatures, and leaning (40-50%) to above normal precipitation for the September to November period. This is the period in which South Florida transitions from the wet season to the dry season, with the rainy season ending on October 15th. Predicting this transition period well in advance is quite difficult, with some years experiencing a quick transition of only a few days while others going through a gradual transition spanning a few weeks. This transition period can be largely influenced by tropical systems during what is typically the most active part of hurricane season. Those looking for relief from the summer-long heat and humidity typically have to wait until early or mid-October for the first noticeable cold front to bring cooler and less humid air into the region, with more substantial lowering of temperatures into the 50s not normally observed until late October or November. This means that summer-like heat and humidity often linger well into October. Those taking part in outdoor activities should stay hydrated and avoid prolonged exposure especially during the late morning through mid-afternoon time frame. September and October represent the two most hurricane prone months for South Florida. Therefore, it is important that we continue to keep a close eye on the tropics and make sure that our personal hurricane plans are in place for this season.

These data, collected at over 5,000 continuous traffic counting locations nationwide, are used to determine the percent change in traffic for the current month compared to the same month in the previous year. This percent change is applied to the travel for the same month of the previous year to obtain an estimate of travel for the current month. Because of the limited sample sizes, caution should be used with these estimates.

On Tuesday, the company announced the Waymo One app will be available to an 80-square-mile swath of greater LA \u2014 including Santa Monica, Hollywood and parts of South LA around the USC campus, among surrounding areas.  \nWith no one in the driver's seat, Waymo One's vehicles are fully autonomous, with the fleet made up entirely of fully electric Jaguar I-PACEs. Like rideshare apps such as Uber and Lyft, riders can hail a car 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\u00a0\n\"Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,\" Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a statement announcing the expansion into LA. \"Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We're so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can't wait to serve more riders soon.\"\nWaymo started out in Los Angeles with rides only available to people on a waiting list, which nearly 300,000 people ended up joining, according to the company. Waymo claims those rides resulted in an average rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars, with LA riders who were surveyed reporting 98% of them are satisfied with the service and 96% saying it was useful.\nThe company initially launched in San Francisco after getting approval from state regulators last year to charge for rides, after first offering its service in Phoenix\u00a0beginning in 2020. Waymo rides in the Arizona city are available across a 315-square-mile area.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a federal agency under the U.S. Department of Transportation, reports fully-autonomous vehicles such as Waymo's robotaxi service can have some safety benefits as these cars may be able to detect threats of crashes humans don't. The agency says these vehicles, like all other automobiles, must be tested by the companies that make them and adhere to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards in place for all U.S. cars.\nHowever, some watchdog agencies and experts have warned of potential dangers. The National Transportation Safety Board issued recommendations for Tesla's Autopilot system in the early years of the launch of the driver-assisted technology. An NTSB\u00a0investigation into a 2018 Culver City crash found the driver over relied on the system against the manufacturers' warnings.\nMeanwhile, the MITRE Corporation, a nonprofit organization that manages federally funded research for U.S. government agencies in transportation and defense, released a report in 2021 calling for adjustments in federal safety regulations for fully-autonomous vehicles \u2014 saying such changes should be made as the safety approach in their manufacturing and development \"matures.\"\n\"Regulators have recognized this need in traditional vehicles and have codified it in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, and states require their own levels of driver certifications through licenses and behavioral testing,\" the report reads.\u00a0\nLast year, General Motors' own robotaxi service, Cruise, had its license revoked by California regulators and had to end its service in San Francisco amid safety concerns, including reports by police and fire officials who said the vehicles were impeding traffic during emergency situations while still in their testing phase, the Associated Press reported.\nMore from CBS News\nMarissa Wenzke is a journalist based in Los Angeles.

      "Disruptive Transportation: The Adoption, Utilization, and Impacts of Ride-Hailing in the United States\nRide-hailing adoption has far outpaced other shared mobility modes\nRide-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft are changing the way many people travel in major cities. Due to their rapid rise in popularity, relatively light levels of regulation, and lack of available data on how, when, and why people use these services, city and transportation planners and researchers know alarmingly little about how ride-hailing is changing travel choices or how to plan for them in the future.\nNearly 10 years after these services were introduced, we still have limited research and few answers to key questions, including: To what extent do ride-hailing services influence vehicle ownership? Where is ride-hailing complementary to or competitive with public transit?\nMany public agencies responsible for transportation planning in the United States \u2014 typically metropolitan planning organizations and state transportation and environmental agencies \u2014 conduct travel surveys to gather data on vehicle ownership rates, trip-making patterns, and transportation mode choice. However, these custom surveys are costly and typically administered only every five to 10 years, which is not frequent enough given our rapidly changing transportation ecosystem. To address this gap in knowledge, our research has sought to better understand the relationships among ride-hailing services, demographics, and travel behavior.\nTo begin quantifying the adoption and travel behavior impacts of these services, we gathered data in major metropolitan areas of the United States through travel surveys designed by our team. Our survey asked questions about the adoption and utilization of shared mobility services, including carsharing, ride-hailing, bikeshare, and more recently, shared electric scooters. The results presented in our 2017 research report are based on data that were collected from fall 2015 through spring 2016 in seven metropolitan areas: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. We employed sampling methods that regional planning agencies typically use to gather data from a statistically representative sample using rigorous methods so that we could draw defensible conclusions about the population at large.\nShared mobility: A diversifying landscape\nMuch of prior research on the behavioral impacts of shared mobility services focused on what we term \u201cCarsharing 1.0,\u201d\u200aearly models of carsharing where vehicles were picked up and returned to the same location, typically through hourly rentals. The shared mobility landscape has rapidly evolved and new services have been introduced, including free-floating car-sharing, ride-hailing (e.g. Uber and Lyft), and pooled or shared services (Table 1). A key takeaway from our recent research is that not all shared services should be viewed through this lens and that the adoption rates and behavioral impacts of different types of shared mobility services vary substantially.\nTable 1. The evolution of shared mobility services\n\nAmong these various forms of shared mobility, the rates of ride-hailing adoption have far outpaced the adoption rates of other shared mobility models. Carsharing 1.0 business models had attracted only 2 million members in North America and close to 5 million globally between the early 2000s and 2017. By contrast, ride-hailing services, such as Uber, Lyft, and Didi, are estimated to have grown to more than 250 million users globally during the 2010s alone. Our more recent research on \u201cmicromobility\u201d services, such as shared bikes, electric bikes, and electric scooters, finds that the adoption rates of these services have grown at an even faster pace than for ride-hailing.\nAdoption of ride-hailing\nThe adoption rates, or share of the population that has used Uber or Lyft, in our study were significantly higher than those reported in previous research. While earlier studies found adoption rates of 10 to 15 percent, our 2015\u20132016 data found that 21 percent of adults had personally used ride-hailing services (measured as having installed and used a ride-hailing app), and an additional 9 percent of adults had used ride-hailing with friends. Our different results are likely due to our focus on major metropolitan areas and suggest that ride-hailing service use is increasingly widespread, particularly compared with adoption rates of previous generation carsharing services, which are roughly an order of magnitude smaller.\nSimilar to the higher ride-hailing adoption rates, we also found higher rates of utilization, or frequency of use, among ride-hailing users in cities. Nearly a quarter (24 percent) of ride-hailing users reported use on a daily to weekly basis. Such a significant portion of people relying on these services daily or weekly suggests that ride-hail is shifting from a niche to a mainstream travel option in many cities.\nSimilar to the adoption trends for new technologies and prior carsharing services, we found that early ride-hailing adopters tended to be younger, more educated, and have higher incomes than the rest of the population (Figure 1). Notably, we find women and minorities were more likely to adopt ride-hailing. There was a fairly significant gap in adoption between the youngest and oldest segments of the population. More than one-third (36 percent) of those between 18 and 29 years of age had used ride-hailing services, while only 4 percent of those 65 and older had. Although ride-hailing is often cited as a possible transportation solution for aging Baby Boomers, our research suggests very few of them currently utilize services like Uber and Lyft.\n\nMore than a third of 18- to 29-year-olds had used ride-hailing services, while only 4 percent of those 65 and older had.\n\nFigure 1. Ride-hailing adoption by demographics and geography, 2015-2016\n\nWealthier, more educated people use Uber and Lyft at much higher rates than those who are less affluent. The adoption rate among the college educated (26 percent) was double that of those without a college degree (13 percent). Those with advanced degrees also had slightly higher adoption rates than those with only a bachelor\u2019s degree. Similarly, respondents with annual household incomes of $150,000 or more had an adoption rate of 33 percent, compared with only 15 percent among those earning $35,000 or less.\nWhile many observers herald these exciting new mobility options, their continuing growth presents significant challenges for the public sector. As officials and managers at cities and public transit agencies consider whether and how to integrate these services into publicly subsidized transportation networks, these gaps in adoption between the wealthy and the poor need to be addressed.\nVehicle ownership and driving\nTwo important questions facing transportation policymakers are whether the adoption of ride-hailing services might reduce vehicle ownership and total vehicle miles traveled. Contrary to prior research on the topic, we found that ride-hailing users on average do not own significantly fewer vehicles than their non-ride-hailing counterparts. We find, as others have, that the key drivers of vehicle ownership are household income, household structure, and urban density, the latter of which is strongly correlated with limited parking. Once these factors have been statistically controlled, we observe little difference in vehicle ownership between those who use ride-hailing and those who do not.\nWhen asked whether using Uber or Lyft had prompted them to decrease their ownership of motor vehicles, the vast majority of ride-hailing respondents (91 percent) reported making no vehicle ownership changes, while 16 percent indicated they had no vehicle to begin with. However, nearly one in 10 respondents (9 percent) said they had downsized by one or more household vehicles, which suggests that Uber and Lyft may indeed motivate long-range changes to vehicle ownership and use decisions.\nFrom an environmental perspective, a significant shift away from personal vehicle ownership is primarily of value inasmuch as it reduces vehicle-related emissions. While vehicle travel is correlated with emissions, the effect of ride-hailing on total vehicle travel is the subject of ongoing debate.\nWe found a strong correlation between reduced vehicle ownership and increased ride-hailing use (Figure 2). This suggests that such travelers are substituting trips in which they would have driven themselves with trips that are now driven by an Uber or Lyft driver.\nFigure 2. Vehicle shedding by ride-hailing utilization rate\n\nAs we ponder the future introduction of shared, automated vehicles, trip-making and travel mode choice (i.e., walk, bike, transit, carpool, drive, ride-hail, etc.) will be central to determining whether their introduction will result in more miles traveled, more congestion, and more energy use, or whether they will be deployed to provide mobility benefits with fewer negative social, economic, and environmental impacts.\nImpacts of ride-hailing on public transit\nThe extent to which ride-hailing complements or substitutes for public transit use will play a key role in whether Uber, Lyft, and potential automated vehicle services increase or decrease total vehicle travel. We addressed this question by assuming that not all public transit services are created equal. Some transit services are more frequent, reliable, and operate in environments where they are an especially convenient choice, while other services operating in less \u201ctransit-friendly\u201d areas can be slow and inconvenient. In short, the question of whether ride-hailing competes with or complements public transit services depends on the context.\nWe asked survey respondents whether they use different public transit services, including buses, subways, and streetcars, more or less after they began using Uber and Lyft. The majority of respondents reported no change in their transit use. However, among the few who did report changing transit use, 6 percent said that they used bus services less and 3 percent said they used light rail (i.e., streetcars) less. By contrast, 3 percent of respondents reported increasing their use of commuter rail, which typically carries commuters longer distances from suburbs to central business districts. In short, we find that the substitutive versus complementary nature of ride-hailing services varies by the location, type, and quality of the transit service in question.\nRecent research on New York City finds that travel has shifted away from public transit towards ride-hailing. So while many suggest that ride-hailing can be complementary to public transit by making it easier to get to and from transit stops and stations, there is mounting evidence that ride-hailing is pulling more people away from public transit than towards it.\nHow might the introduction and increased use of automated vehicles affect public transit use and driving? Simulations that consider whether shared automated vehicles will replace public transit services have found that total vehicle travel increases moderately-to-substantially if shared-ride automated vehicles substitute for transit use: a 6-percent increase if buses are replaced, and an 89-percent increase if high-capacity transit, like urban rail, is replaced. These simulations assume existing levels of travel demand, but most transportation economists assume that the per capita demand for travel will increase with widespread adoption of fully automated vehicles. Why more vehicle travel? Some people previously unable to drive because of age or disability could now do so, others might find riding rather than driving less onerous, and so on.\nRide-hailing and mode substitution\nIn our survey, we asked ride-hailing users which transportation modes they would have used for the trips they currently make using Uber and Lyft (Figure 3). The majority of respondents said that they would have traveled by walking, biking, or public transit, or would not have made the trip at all, while nearly four in 10 (39 percent) reported that they would have traveled by car (either by driving alone, carpooling, or taking a taxi). Using data unadjusted by frequency of ride-hailing use, about half (49 percent) of ride-hailing trips were likely to have been made by walking, biking, or public transit, or not been made at all.\nFigure 3. Likely travel mode used if Uber/Lyft were not available for last trip\n\nThis new evidence of mode substitution suggests that ride-hailing is likely increasing vehicle travel in major cities, though to date by relatively small amounts. The 61 percent of Uber and Lyft trips that would have been made by walking, biking, or transit, or not been made at all are adding vehicles to the road. In addition, ride-hailing raises the concern of deadheading miles, or miles traveled without passengers, which have previously been estimated at 20 to 50 percent of ride-hailing miles. With deadheading miles included, the vehicle travel associated with a ride-hailing trip is potentially higher than if taken in a personal vehicle.\nWhile these data provide initial insights into the travel behavior changes associated with ride-hailing, they only represent a snapshot of representative data from a sample of large cities in late 2015 to early 2016. Continued research in this area is needed to help cities and transportation planners make critical policy decisions such when and where to invest in public transit infrastructure, and whether and when to price or subsidize private mobility services in order to manage travel demand.\nConclusions and policy recommendations\nGiven the rapid growth of private mobility services, it is critical to collect data on their potential impacts on travel behavior, including vehicle ownership, vehicle miles traveled, and travel mode. Further research is needed to understand how ride-hailing will influence future traffic volumes and associated emissions so that cities can effectively manage roads, vehicles, and travel. Absent these data, cities and transit agencies are in the dark when making important decisions that influence how citizens move in their regions. Accordingly, I recommend the following to ensure that the continued growth of private mobility services leads to better urban transportation.\nPricing and/or priority to improve the flow of high-occupancy vehicles\nIn the near term, policymakers need to address the additional vehicle miles that ride-hailing services contribute to cities. Given limited road infrastructure and expanding urban populations, high-occupancy vehicles need to have priority rights-of-way. Both congestion pricing (of all vehicles, including the majority, which are still personally driven) and bus priority lanes (to allow buses to bypass traffic, making transit faster and more attractive) can serve as effective measures to ensure that scarce roadway space is used effectively.\nImproving data access for cities and transportation planners\nThere is an increasing data gap between privatized mobility operators and those in the public sphere who make critical transportation planning and policy decisions. As private mobility providers continue to rapidly expand, they gather massive amounts of data about how people move in cities \u2013 data that, for the most part, are unavailable to transportation planners or policymakers. Limited data in the public sector perpetuate less-informed decision-making, which in turn can result in transportation systems that may not meet the public\u2019s needs.\nThere are two potential solutions for bridging the data gap. First, the public sector can and should mandate data-sharing for new mobility operators like Uber and Lyft that travel on public streets and roads. The New York Taxi and Limousine Commission adopted regulations requiring ride-hail companies to share detailed data on rides in New York City. Provided they are sufficiently anonymized, and that cities have put in place clear policies and infrastructure to responsibly safeguard it, this type of data is essential for informed transportation decision-making. Regulators and planners can reasonably require the data because mobility operators rely on publicly funded infrastructure.\nSecond, the public sector can invest in more frequent data-collection efforts. While research that harnesses data from ride-hailing providers themselves may shed light on the utilization, demographics, and miles traveled of these services, the more complex decisions that individuals and households make about where to live, work, and how to get around require continued data-collection efforts through representative samples of the population. Given the pace of innovation in the transportation sector, the current pace of occasional data collection and travel analysis efforts are insufficient.\nRide-hailing services have disrupted traditional transportation providers, including public transit operators. The expansion of ride-hailing has highlighted a number of opportunities for cities to harness new technologies, data, and business models that can serve a greater portion of the population more effectively. While the introduction of private mobility services has brought about welcome innovation in the transportation sector and higher levels of mobility for many travelers, better collaboration between the public sector and these private service providers are required to ensure that these services can be effectively woven into the fabric of cities in ways that are sustainable, equitable, and safe.\n\n This article is adapted from Clewlow, R.

The event signified the start of construction in the East Downtown area and in the Midtown and Third Ward areas.\n\u201cWe are proud to be here, opening this huge benefit for the people of Houston today and for future generations,\u201d said J. Bruce Bugg, chairman of the Texas Transportation Commission. \"We\u2019re making big plays. Getting Texans moving and out of traffic faster and safer is our goal.\"\nThe I-45 project \u2014 one of the largest infrastructure projects in Texas \u2014 is designed to expand roadway capacity, reduce congestion, improve safety, and enhance mobility along I-45 from I-69 to Beltway 8. It also includes rebuilding downtown Houston\u2019s freeway system, which covers I-45, I-69, I-10, and SH 288. A key element is rerouting I-45 to run parallel with I-69 and I-10 through downtown Houston.\nThe project not only addresses current population growth but also lays a foundation for the region\u2019s sustainable development. The project targets congestion relief, improves evacuation routes, and promotes multimodal transportation options.\n\u201cThis road is about economic development\u2026You\u2019re talking about joining the two sides of downtown,\u201d said Transportation Commissioner Steven Alvis. \u201cIn addition, it will move freight and give people back time. If you can save people 20 minutes twice a day, think about what that means for them and their families.\u201d\nThe groundbreaking event had a football-themed celebration, featuring appearances by Houston legend Vince Young, NHHIP Project Manager Grady Mapes, and Texas Southern University (TSU) mascot TEX. The TSU Ocean of Soul drumline and Young Women\u2019s College Preparatory Academy (YWCPA) cheerleaders added vibrancy to the occasion.\nThe first phase, Segment 3B-1, will focus on stormwater management with the installation of 12-foot box culverts to direct stormwater to detention ponds, enhancing flood resiliency. St. Emanuel Street will serve as a feeder road for this portion of I-45. This phase, expected to be completed by 2027, has a budget of $121 million.\nFollowing this, Segment 3B-2, set to begin in January 2025 and expected to be completed by 2030, will focus on constructing new mainlanes, frontage roads, and enhanced bike and pedestrian infrastructure on I-69 between SH 288 and I-45. The estimated cost for Segment 3B-2 is $695.5 million.\nNHHIP is needed for several reasons. There is inadequate highway capacity for existing and future traffic demands on the highways in the North Houston corridor. Between the years 2015 and 2040, average daily traffic volumes are projected to increase by as much as 40% in the project corridor.\nTraffic congestion, which is measured by traffic volume and roadway capacity, will increase if no improvements are made.\nThe current high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane on I-45 serves traffic in only one direction during the peak traffic periods and is unused for large portions of the day. During peak hours, the HOV lane is congested.\nI-45 is a designated evacuation route for the region. At its present capacity, evacuation effectiveness would be limited in the event of a hurricane or other regional emergency.\nPortions of I-45 do not meet current roadway design standards, creating a traffic safety concern. Other roadway design deficiencies include inadequate storm water drainage in some locations. Intense rainfall causes high water levels at the I-45/I-10 underpass and on the outside lanes. I-45 would not operate effectively as an evacuation route with high water closures, especially during hurricane evacuations when high rainfall events are likely.\nForecasts for commuter traffic indicate that even with parallel high-capacity transit in the corridor, two-way managed lanes would be needed to support commuter traffic and express bus service. The entire I-45 NHHIP project is expected to take 18 years to complete. \n",

across more than 180 countries and territories\nMontreal, 19 September 2024 \u2013 Airports Council International (ACI) World today announces the release of its highly anticipated 2024 Annual World Airport Traffic Report, projecting 10% growth for passenger traffic in 2024 to reach 9.5 billion.\nDrawing data from over 2,700 airports across more than 180 countries and territories, the report offers the most comprehensive overview of the global airport industry and aviation markets for the operating year 2023 and the first half of 2024. It includes full rankings for passenger, cargo, and aircraft traffic.\nACI World Director General Justin Erbacci commented: \u201cThe release of the 2024 Annual World Airport Traffic Report highlights the resilience and adaptability of the global aviation industry and demonstrates ACI World\u2019s unmatched ability to predict and analyze industry trends. As we continue to navigate an increasingly complex and evolving landscape, ACI World remains committed to supporting our airport members through advocacy and the development of timely resources.\n\u201cThe insights provided in this report\u2014reaffirming ACI World\u2019s 99.99% forecasting accuracy\u2014are crucial for aviation stakeholders, policymakers, and industry professionals to make informed, data-driven decisions and strategically plan for the future.\u201d\nBi-annual air travel demand Advisory Bulletin\nIn tandem with the release of the 2024 World Airport Traffic Report, ACI World also unveils its bi-annual air traffic demand Advisory Bulletin. This trusted source for air travel demand is an essential resource for ACI members and the wider aviation system, further cementing ACI World\u2019s authority in the industry.\nHighlights:\n\n2023 global passenger traffic: Global passenger traffic reached 8.7 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 30.6% from 2022 or a recovery at 95% from pre-pandemic results (2019).\n99.99% forecasting accuracy: The ACI World Airport Traffic Forecast 2023-2052, released in February 2024, estimated global passenger traffic would reach 8.7 billion. The actual global total for 2023, confirmed in July 2024, astonishingly matched this projection with 99.99% accuracy.\n2024 global passenger traffic: Current projections estimate total passenger will reach approximately 9.5 billion, representing 104% of the 2019 level and reflecting a 10% year-on-year (YoY) growth from 2023.\nH1 2024 passenger traffic: By June 2024 year-to-date (YTD), total passenger traffic increased by 11% YoY, reaching 102% of the June 2019 YTD level. The international market, driving recovery, saw a 17% YoY increase, while the domestic market grew by 6% YoY.\n2024 international passenger traffic: Expected to reach 4.1 billion by the end of 2024, accounting for 43% of total passengers.\n2024 domestic passenger traffic: Projected to reach 5.4 billion by the end of 2024, making up 57% of the total.\n\nDespite positive macroeconomic developments such as easing inflationary pressures, the medium-to-long-term outlook remains subject to downside risks such as geopolitical conflicts, labor market bottlenecks, and aircraft delivery constraints. However, the gradual recovery of international passengers and a return to profitability for airlines signal a positive momentum in the industry.\nAbout ACI\nAirports Council International (ACI), the trade association of the world\u2019s airports, is a federated organization comprising ACI World, ACI Africa, ACI Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, ACI EUROPE, ACI Latin America and the Caribbean and ACI North America.

Additionally, you can explore current design and construction projects via map and list view here. These projects play a pivotal role in furthering the Atlanta Beltline vision to be the catalyst for making Atlanta a global beacon for equitable, inclusive, and sustainable city life.\n\nNortheast\u202fTrail\nNortheast Trail \u2013 Segment 1: Construction is underway on this segment that runs alongside Piedmont Park and will be completed in three phases: Phase I from Westminster Drive to Evelyn Street, Phase II from Evelyn Street to Monroe Drive, and Phase III including the 10th Street and Monroe Drive intersection improvements.\nIn Phase I, the trail is complete from Westminster Drive NE, running adjacent to Clear Creek to Evelyn Street. This area is sometimes referred to as the Carriage Trail. Lighting and camera installation, and planting work is complete. This section of trail will be opened for use at the end of March.\u00a0 Temporary barriers will be in place along the trail edge until permanent handrails along the trail edge can be delivered and installed. The construction team will start refurbishing the wooden Clear Creek bridge along the gravel trail in April.\nAlong Phase II, construction grading and wall work is ongoing within the corridor with retaining walls granite cladding underway along the dog park.\nPhase III work, which includes pedestrian safety improvements at the intersection of 10th and Monroe Drive, will be the last phase of work to start. Planning and logistics are in progress for this complex phase of work. The team is fine tuning the plans to minimize traffic impacts. Reeves Young has applied for the traffic and sidewalk permits for 10th and Monroe.\u00a0 Once the permits are received from the City, final logistics and phasing plans for the intersection will be shared with the community. The ABI project management team has met with several neighborhood groups and APS to coordinate on timing and phasing of work.\nThe Beltline continues to work alongside Piedmont Park Conservancy, City of Atlanta Parks Department, and Atlanta Department of Transportation on this project. The project is expected to be complete in fall of 2024.\n\nThe first phase of trail work is complete from Evelyn Street NE to Westminster Dr. This view shows the new trail where it ties into existing trails in Piedmont Park just south of Westminster Dr. Photo taken 03/29/2024.

Photo by Kerri Parker.\nNortheast Trail \u2013 Segment 3: This federally funded portion of trail includes the mainline trail of the Atlanta Beltline 22-mile loop, called Northeast Trail \u2013 Segment 3, and also includes connector trails to MARTA Lindberg station, PATH 400, and to the Armour-Ottley business district. The design team is finalizing the 90% drawings this month. Real estate acquisition and construction easements are underway and will be followed by GDOT approvals for right of way, environmental, and utility work. A total of 16 real estate parcels will require agreements with property owners.\u00a0 Construction letting / bidding is targeted for May 2025. The current expected construction start is August of 2025, with up to a three-year schedule to complete the mainline trail and the connector trails.\nDetails on each Northeast Trail segment can be found in our design and construction updates section: Segment 1, Segment 2, and Segment 3.\nEastside Trail\nPonce de Leon Avenue Streetscapes: The Ponce streetscape project will provide an improved pedestrian and bicycle connection along Ponce de Leon Avenue to the Beltline running from Boulevard to Freedom Parkway.\u00a0 JHC is working on constructing the last sections of sidewalk between Ponce City Market and Ford Factory Lofts, followed by installing the median between Midtown Place and the Ponce Beltline bridge. This work should continue through the end of April. The contractor will begin construction on the Beltline access ramp as soon as GDOT approves the wall and materials submittals, currently under review.\u00a0 This project is currently anticipated to complete in June of 2024, but the access ramp will likely be completed at a later date due to timing of engineering review work. Updates are posted at here.\n\nPonce De Leon complete street work in progress as seen from the Eastside Trail. Photo taken 03/29/2024.

This project achieved the highest level of federal funding possible at 80% of the total construction budget.\u00a0 On the interim trail, rail events have caused slope failure along Skylark Apartments.\u00a0 A temporary engineering fix has been developed to stabilize the condition near term.\u00a0 A permanent stabilization solution will be implemented as a part of the construction work.\u00a0 Trail users should use caution around these areas, which are restricted with cones and barriers.\nSouthside Trail \u2013 Segments 4 \u2013 5:\u00a0 Storm line installation is ongoing. The contractor is working at the United Avenue bridge and expects to have the new abutments constructed and begin setting beams by the end of April. Grading prep for the United Avenue ramp will begin mid-April and continue throughout the end of May. Pile driving for bridge abutments at Ormewood Avenue will begin the last week of April. Reeves Young will also be continuing construction on the walls which will support the ramp up to Delmar throughout May. The trail\u202fwill remain closed for the duration of construction which is expected to last through spring 2025.\u00a0Detour options can be found here.\n\nStormwater pond construction.

A contract is executed for a Construction Manager for Enota Park, and the award went to Reeves Young. Now that the construction team is on board, the project budget will be confirmed and any required adjustments to the design will be completed to maintain the budget before construction is released to begin. ABI is working with the City of Atlanta to address revisions to real estate parcels within the park, and finalizing construction permitting.\u00a0 Construction schedule is currently dependent upon permitting and real estate resolution.\u00a0 A construction start date will be confirmed when these tasks are close to completion.\nNorthwest Trail\nNorthwest Trail \u2013 Segment 1: This section of trail is 0.8 miles in length, beginning at the western edge of Peachtree Parks Apartments and running south along Peachtree Creek. We have executed a contract with Reeves Young for Construction Manager at Risk Services. Drawings are 90% drawings and a cost model for the project is complete. We have begun to procure various parts of the project such as the bridge over Peachtree Creek as well as the materials for the retaining walls along the corridor and all elevated sections. The acquisition of easements is ongoing and once complete, we will be in a position to begin enabling work at the Peachtree Park Apartment complex , targeting early Q2.\u00a0 This enabling work clear the way for all the work to progress, such as the installation of the new Peachtree Creek bridge.\nNorthwest Trail \u2013 Segment 2: This segment begins at the southwest corner of Bobby Jones Golf Course and travels east along Colonial Hills Circle for 0.7 miles. Design drawings are 60% complete as of the end of March.\u00a0 This releases the start of real estate work required to secure the corridor for the trail.\nNorthwest Trail \u2013 Segment 3: This section of trail begins at Trabert Avenue near Monday Night Brewing\u2019s parking lot and ends after crossing under I-75 at Tanyard Creek, for a total length of 1.2 miles. Design will be 60% complete by May 2024. A contract has been awarded to Astra Group for Construction Manager at Risk Services.\u00a0 The construction manager will provide early assistance with construction logistics, scheduling, and budgeting while the drawings are being completed.\u00a0 A section of the trail that is approximately 0.5 miles and runs between between Trabert and Northside is scheduled to start construction early April.\nNorthwest Trail \u2013 Segment 4: This 0.9-mile-long trail begins at English and Culpepper and ends at the parking lot of Monday Night Brewery at Trabert. The 60% drawings are complete which releases the start of real estate work required to secure the corridor for the trail. \u00a0Coordination with the Department of Watershed Management and other property owners has been very productive and the alignment for this segment has been confirmed.\nNorthwest Trail \u2013 Segment 5:\u00a0This trail section begins at the intersection of Marietta Blvd and Huff Rd, traveling to Ellsworth Industrial and English Street for a total of 0.7 miles. Real estate work is\u00a0coming to an end in Q1.\u00a0 The project has been posted for construction and bids are due April 11th.\u00a0 We expect to be under construction early May. The construction schedule is anticipated to be 14 months.\nBeltline Transit Study\nThis planning project, primarily focused on determining a preferred transit alignment in the NW Beltline quadrant where there is no abandoned railroad corridor. It also intends to identify stop locations and generalized cross-sections in the SW and SE quadrants of the Beltline corridor.\u00a0 The overall study area is looking at 13-14 miles of future light-rail/streetcar transit corridor, tying into the NE Beltline quadrant planning work previously performed by MARTA in 2021.\u00a0 The effort is guided by principles of equity and the goal of developing a world-class network of high-capacity transit in a green guideway wherever possible. Since the October 2nd kick-off meeting, we have been coordinating outreach with the community via multiple forums, including the State of the Beltline, an Equity Stakeholder Committee, three small-group roundtables, multiple Pop-Up engagements on weekends, etc. The project runs through June 2025 with numerous engagement points along the way.\nYou can view February\u2019s design and construction update here.\u202f Our first Quarterly Briefing of 2024 was held virtually on February 8th.

(Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)\nThe Brief\n\n\n\nTraffic in most major cities is worse now than it was before the pandemic, a new report finds.\nAdding more roadways doesn\u2019t appear to be solving the problem.\n\n\n\nTraffic congestion and the amount of daily driving in America is worse now than it was before the pandemic, according to a report from Streetlight Data.\nThe report, which analyzes traffic congestion and VMT (vehicle miles traveled) in major U.S. metros, found that as of spring 2024, the number of miles Americans are driving has jumped \u2013 and the increase in VMT in spring 2024 compared to spring 2023 marks the steepest year-over-year increase since the initial pandemic bounce back in 2021.\n\"While there was some hope that a new remote work culture might keep miles driven down and congestion at bay, StreetLight\u2019s results indicate that the status quo isn\u2019t working,\" the report says. \"A reliance on remote work is not a panacea to the rise in VMT and the default solution for traffic\u2014adding roadway capacity\u2014isn\u2019t solving congestion.\n\"Without significant changes, the upward trend in VMT shows no signs of peaking.\"\nREAD MORE: Lyft to downsize, restructure bike and scooter program\nNew York City saw the biggest increase in miles traveled and congestion over the past five years, while Minneapolis had the biggest decrease in congestion and a 16% decrease in miles traveled.\nAccording to the report, 88 of the top 100 metros in the U.S. showed an increase in VMT from spring 2019-spring 2024. Only four metros saw double-digit decreases.\nCongestion is also up in nearly every metro, with only six of the top 100 metros keeping congestion at or below levels seen in 2019, the report found.\nUS cities where people drive the most\nThe 10 metros where people tend to drive the most are concentrated in the Southeast, Streetlight found.\n\"These are places with sprawling geographies and often limited public transit availability,\" the report states.\nThe Northeast, Northwest and California ranked as the regions where people drive the least \u2013 people in the Southeast drive nearly twice as far as people in those regions.\nRELATED: These aging bridges will be updated, replaced with the help of $5 billion in federal funding\nCalifornia had five cities with VMT below 2019 levels. The only other large city to accomplish that is Washington, D.C.\nNew York, Washington, and California are home to nine of the top 10 metros with the lowest daily VMT per capita.\nUS cities with the most traffic congestion\nNot surprisingly, Los Angeles ranked worst for overall congestion, despite a decrease in VMT being down.\n\"While VMT reduction has not yet translated to a reduction in congestion, LA has managed to keep traffic from worsening, unlike most of its peers,\" the report says.\nREAD MORE: Pedestrian deaths declining since COVID-19 pandemic, report finds\nNew York City, meanwhile, saw its congestion worsen faster in the past five years than the next 47 most populous cities.\nSan Francisco was ranked as the top metro for congestion reduction while also reducing daily VMT per capita by 13%.\nThe Source\n\nThis story includes information from Streetlight Data.\n\n\nTrending Now\n\nFort Worth Lyft driver shot by passenger during private ride\n\nEx-Lake Worth officer indicted for hitting man with police radio\n\nDallas woman, 19, kills elderly man over phone in Facebook Marketplace meetup: police\n\nMike Tyson-Jake Paul fight, undercard results and more\n\nAccused drunk driver threw beer cans out of truck, tried to run from deadly Arlington crash\nDAILY NEWSLETTER\nAll the news you need to know, every day\nBy clicking Sign Up, I confirm\nthat I have read and agree\nto the Privacy Policy\nand Terms of Service.\nNews\n\nLocal News\nTexas\nNational\nWorld\nPolitics\nConsumer\nBusiness\nHealth\nFOX News Sunday\n\nWeather\n\nForecast\nClosings\nAllergies\nAlmanac\nRainfall Totals\nFOX Weather\n\nSports\n\nCowboys\nRangers\nMavericks\nStars\nFC Dallas\nWings\nColleges\nHigh School\n\nGood Day\n\nLinks from On Air\nBirthdays\nRecipes\nTraffic\nEntertainment\nThings To Do\nSave Me Steve\n\nLatest Episodes\n\nWatch Live\nThe Ten\nLast Call with Steve Noviello\nTrackdown\nTexas: The Issue Is\nThe Tex Factor\nTexas To-Do List\nHere's To You\nDZTV\n\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\nAnchors and Reporters\nStation History\nFAQ\nHow to Stream\nWork for Us\nTV Listings\nFCC Public File\nFCC Applications\nKDFI / MORE 27\nBrand Spotlight\n\nRegional News\n\nHouston News - FOX 26 Houston\n\nAustin News - FOX 7 Austin\n\n\nfacebook\n\ntwitter\ninstagram\nyoutube\nemail\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nNew Privacy Policy\nUpdated Terms of Use\nYour Privacy Choices\nFCC Public File\nEEO Public File\nClosed Captioning\nContests\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92024 FOX Television Stations",
      "\nHighway Dashboard \u2013 IIJA\n\n\nTracking Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act Highway and Bridge Resources\n\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), signed into law Nov. 15, 2021, provides the largest year-to-year increase in federal highway investment since the late 1950s. ARTBA economists utilize federal and state data to quantify the highway, bridge and safety improvements underway that include this landmark measure.\nThrough August 30, 2024, states have committed $165 billion in highway and bridge formula funds to support over 80,000 new projects.\nThis resource tracks highway and bridge formula and discretionary funds by state and congressional district, allowing a look at how federal investments, including the IIJA are being used in communities across the country. Nearly 90 percent of the IIJA\u2019s highway resources are dispersed by formula to states, with the remainder distributed through discretionary grant awards and other allocated programs.\nUpdates to this resource will occur monthly, as new data becomes available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the last decade, federal funding has accounted for over 50 percent of state highway and bridge capital outlays. This investment has supported the repair and reconstruction of structures on the National Highway System, which includes the Interstates and the major roads that connect U.S. airports, ports, rail and truck terminals, pipeline terminals, and intermodal facilities.\nNearly half of the projects- 46 percent \u2013 were for repair or reconstruction work. An additional 21 percent of funds were used for adding capacity, such as a new lane or major widening, to an existing roadway. Just six percent of funds were invested in new roads or bridges.\nAdvertisements:\n\n\nImpacts of Federal Highway Program\n\nWhile public investments in transportation infrastructure create jobs and generate tax revenue throughout the economy during the construction cycle, infrastructure improvements also foster economic growth and efficiency over many years beyond the initial investment by creating long-lived tangible capital assets.\nThe Federal Highway Administration estimates that every $1 billion in highway and bridge infrastructure investment supports at least 13,000 jobs throughout the U.S. economy. This includes work in retail, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, food services and other industries.\nWith questions or to request more information, please contact\u00a0governmentaffairs@artba.org\n\nBecome A Member\n\nTransportation construction market development and protection is your business and our mission.

      "\nHighway Dashboard \u2013 IIJA\n\n\nTracking Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act Highway and Bridge Resources\n\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), signed into law Nov. 15, 2021, provides the largest year-to-year increase in federal highway investment since the late 1950s. ARTBA economists utilize federal and state data to quantify the highway, bridge and safety improvements underway that include this landmark measure.\nThrough August 30, 2024, states have committed $165 billion in highway and bridge formula funds to support over 80,000 new projects.\nThis resource tracks highway and bridge formula and discretionary funds by state and congressional district, allowing a look at how federal investments, including the IIJA are being used in communities across the country. Nearly 90 percent of the IIJA\u2019s highway resources are dispersed by formula to states, with the remainder distributed through discretionary grant awards and other allocated programs.\nUpdates to this resource will occur monthly, as new data becomes available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the last decade, federal funding has accounted for over 50 percent of state highway and bridge capital outlays. This investment has supported the repair and reconstruction of structures on the National Highway System, which includes the Interstates and the major roads that connect U.S. airports, ports, rail and truck terminals, pipeline terminals, and intermodal facilities.\nNearly half of the projects- 46 percent \u2013 were for repair or reconstruction work. An additional 21 percent of funds were used for adding capacity, such as a new lane or major widening, to an existing roadway. Just six percent of funds were invested in new roads or bridges.\nAdvertisements:\n\n\nImpacts of Federal Highway Program\n\nWhile public investments in transportation infrastructure create jobs and generate tax revenue throughout the economy during the construction cycle, infrastructure improvements also foster economic growth and efficiency over many years beyond the initial investment by creating long-lived tangible capital assets.\nThe Federal Highway Administration estimates that every $1 billion in highway and bridge infrastructure investment supports at least 13,000 jobs throughout the U.S. economy. This includes work in retail, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, food services and other industries.\nWith questions or to request more information, please contact\u00a0governmentaffairs@artba.org\n\nBecome A Member\n\nTransportation construction market development and protection is your business and our mission.

      "Congestion continues to grow, says INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard\nINRIX\u2019s recently released\u00a02023 Global Traffic Scorecard\u00a0has identified and ranked congestion and mobility trends in more 900 than cities, across 37 countries. The report provides a range of metrics to help cities understand and address congestion issues at a local, national, and global level.\nINRIX\u2019s research found traffic congestion around the world continued to grow in 2023. Of all 947 urban areas analyzed, delays increased in 78% and decreased in 19%, with 3% unchanged.\nNew York City topped the global ranking, followed by Mexico City and London. US cities held two spots in the top five and four in the top 10.\nIn general, European urban areas experienced the quickest \u201crebound\u201d in traffic from COVID-19, and still outpaced the United States in terms of returning to 2019 norms. Two-thirds of European cities have already met or exceeded pre-COVID levels of delay, whereas just 40% of US urban areas have the same distinction.\nLast year\u2019s number one, London, and number two, Paris, took the top spots in the European ranking again this year, with drivers losing 99 and 97 hours in congestion, respectively.\nThere was a noticeable upswing in traffic congestion in the Netherlands, pushing the urban areas of Utrecht (ranked 10th in Europe), Leiden (13th), Amsterdam (16th), and The Hague (17th) onto the 2023 top 25. Additionally, urban areas in Ireland, Portugal, Czech Republic, and Finland also saw significant increases in traffic delay in 2023, while Denmark, Hungary, Belgium, Germany and the UK saw single digit growth. At a country level, none of the countries analyzed in Europe encountered year on year delay decreases in 2023.\nVisit INRIX\u2019s\u00a0interactive traffic scorecard page\u00a0to explore this year\u2019s findings and download the full report to get a detailed analysis of transportation in 2023.\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\t\t\t\tINRIX journey time analysis underlines TSOG benefits\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDo traffic signal improvement schemes achieve their objectives?\u00a0 Delegates at the JCT Traffic Signals Symposium will find out how tomorrow\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUK roads set for busiest August Bank Holiday Monday since 2015\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tJCT sees surge in delegate bookings for this year\u2019s Traffic Signals Symposium\t\t\t\n\nPopular this month\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCalifornia strengthens driverless reporting detail requirements\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tLondon\u2019s return to work stalls\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWaymo gets $5.6bn further investment\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMott MacDonald secures new electric vehicle charging framework with Welsh Government\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDfT stalwart Hanson wins top ITS UK honour\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThe AA steps up calls for Graduated Driving Licence\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNational Highways looks for Scheme Delivery Framework engagement\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCauseway Technologies acquires Buchanan Computing\t\t\t\n\nHighways News is a new daily news service that delivers you insightful, engaging and concise news on the highways and transport technology sectors.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of various components, technologies, challenges, and advancements in ITMS. The research explores the integration of artificial intelligence, IoT, and data analytics in traffic management, highlighting their impact on congestion reduction, accident prevention, and environmental sustainability. Additionally, it discusses the future directions and potential avenues for further research in this domain. Introduction: In the rapidly evolving landscape of urban transportation, the efficient management of traffic has become a paramount concern for city planners, policymakers, and transportation authorities worldwide. Intelligent Traffic Management Systems (ITMS) have emerged as a critical solution to address the complex challenges associated with urban mobility. By leveraging advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and big data analytics, ITMS aims to optimize traffic flow, enhance safety, and improve the overall efficiency of transportation networks. At its core, ITMS encompasses a diverse array of components and technologies designed to monitor, analyze, and control various aspects of traffic operations in real-time. From traffic surveillance systems and signal control algorithms to incident detection platforms and traveler information systems, the components of ITMS work in tandem to enable proactive management of traffic patterns and mitigate congestion. The importance of ITMS cannot be overstated, particularly in densely populated urban areas where traffic congestion has become a ubiquitous problem. Beyond mere inconvenience, traffic congestion leads to significant economic losses, environmental degradation, and compromises public safety. Therefore, the implementation of intelligent traffic management strategies holds the promise of alleviating these issues while fostering more sustainable and livable cities. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of ITMS, delving into its various components, underlying technologies, advantages, challenges, and real-world implementations. By examining the state-of-the-art advancements in this field and identifying future research directions, this study seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of how ITMS can revolutionize urban transportation and pave the way for smarter, more efficient cities.

Cost and Funding: \uf0b7 Implementing and maintaining intelligent traffic management systems involve significant upfront costs for infrastructure, technology deployment, and ongoing operation. \uf0b7 Securing funding from government agencies, private investors, or public-private partnerships can be challenging, especially in budget-constrained environments. \uf0b7 Demonstrating the system's return on investment (ROI) through measurable benefits such as reduced congestion, improved safety, and enhanced mobility is crucial for securing funding and support Proposed ITMS System: In response to the growing challenges posed by urban congestion, safety concerns, and the need for sustainable transportation solutions, we propose the development and implementation of an Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS). This innovative system represents a paradigm shift from traditional traffic management approaches, harnessing advanced technologies to create a more efficient, adaptive, and user-centric urban mobility environment. The proposed ITMS leverages cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics to transform how traffic is monitored, controlled, and optimized in urban areas. By integrating these technologies with existing infrastructure and transportation networks, the ITMS aims to address the limitations of conventional traffic management systems while unlocking new opportunities for improving the overall quality of transportation services. At its core, the ITMS is designed to provide real-time monitoring, analysis, and decision-making capabilities to effectively manage traffic flow, reduce congestion, enhance safety, and improve the overall commuter experience. By harnessing the power of AI and machine learning algorithms, the system can predict traffic patterns, identify congestion hotspots, and dynamically adjust traffic signals and lane configurations to optimize traffic flow in real-time. Moreover, the ITMS incorporates IoT devices and sensors deployed throughout the transportation network to gather comprehensive data on traffic volume, vehicle speeds, environmental conditions, and other relevant factors. This data is processed and analyzed in real-time, enabling proactive interventions and adaptive control strategies to mitigate traffic congestion and minimize travel times. In addition to optimizing traffic flow, the ITMS enhances safety by integrating with autonomous vehicle technology and implementing smart infrastructure solutions such as dynamic lane management systems and automated incident detection. By facilitating seamless communication between vehicles, infrastructure, and commuters, the system aims to reduce the risk of accidents and improve overall road safety. Furthermore, the ITMS prioritizes user engagement and accessibility by providing commuters with real-time traffic updates, alternative route suggestions, and personalized travel recommendations through mobile applications and digital platforms. By empowering commuters with timely and relevant information, the system enables them to make informed decisions and navigate through the urban landscape more efficiently. Advantages And Benefits Of Proposed ITMS: 1.

Singapore's Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) System: Singapore's ERP system is one of the earliest and most successful implementations of road pricing to manage traffic congestion. It uses a network of gantries equipped with electronic toll collection technology to charge vehicles for road usage during peak hours and in congested areas. The ERP system dynamically adjusts toll rates based on real-time traffic conditions, encouraging drivers to consider alternative routes or modes of transportation, thus reducing congestion. 2. Stockholm Congestion Charging System: The Stockholm Congestion Charging System is another notable example of road pricing aimed at reducing traffic congestion. Implemented in 2006 as a trial, it became permanent due to its effectiveness. The system charges vehicles entering or exiting the city center during peak hours. Revenue generated from congestion charges is invested in public transportation and infrastructure improvements. The system has led to significant reductions in traffic congestion and emissions while promoting the use of public transit. 3. Los Angeles Metro Traffic Signal Synchronization Project: Los Angeles Metro's Traffic Signal Synchronization Project focuses on optimizing traffic signal timings across the city to improve traffic flow and reduce delays. By synchronizing traffic signals along major corridors and using adaptive signal control technology, the project aims to minimize stops and delays for vehicles, thereby improving overall traffic efficiency. Real-time data analytics and monitoring help adjust signal timings dynamically in response to changing traffic patterns. 4. Amsterdam's Smart Mobility Initiatives: Amsterdam has implemented various smart mobility initiatives to enhance transportation efficiency and sustainability. These initiatives include integrated multi-modal transportation systems, smart parking solutions, bike-friendly infrastructure, and real-time traffic management systems. Amsterdam's approach emphasizes the use 5. of data analytics, IoT sensors, and intelligent algorithms to optimize traffic flow, promote active transportation, and reduce reliance on private cars. These case studies showcase different approaches to intelligent traffic management, ranging from congestion pricing and traffic signal optimization to multi-modal integration and smart infrastructure development. Each implementation demonstrates the potential of ITMS to address urban transportation challenges and improve the overall quality of life for residents. Conclusion: Intelligent Traffic Management Systems (ITMS) represent a critical cornerstone in the evolution of modern urban transportation networks. Through the integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, IoT, and data analytics, ITMS offer a plethora of benefits ranging from congestion reduction to enhanced safety and environmental sustainability. This comprehensive review has underscored the multifaceted nature of ITMS, encompassing various components such as traffic surveillance, signal control, incident management, and traveler information systems. Leveraging technologies like AI, IoT, and big data analytics, ITMS empower traffic operators with real-time insights and decision support capabilities, thereby optimizing traffic flow and improving overall system efficiency. In conclusion, the continued advancement and adoption of Intelligent Traffic Management Systems hold immense promise for creating safer, more efficient, and sustainable urban transportation networks.

      "Edition\n\n\n            After a delay, New York City is moving ahead with congestion pricing to improve traffic, air quality and public\u00a0transit\n          \n\nAuthor\n\n      Professor Emeritus of Public Policy, University of Maryland, Baltimore County\n    \nDisclosure statement\nJohn Rennie Short does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\nPartners\n\nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County provides funding as a member of The Conversation US.\nView all partners\nNew York City is poised to launch the first congestion pricing plan to reduce traffic in a major U.S. metropolitan area on Jan. 5, 2025. Like many journeys in the Big Apple, this one has been punctuated by delays, including a pause that Gov. Kathy Hochul imposed in early June 2024 as the plan was about to launch. \nNow, however, Hochul has resuscitated the plan with a new US$9 fee for private cars to enter Manhattan, down from $15 in the earlier iteration. It remains to be seen whether this version can withstand resistance and legal challenges from New Jersey officials, car commuters and President-elect Donald Trump. \nAssuming that the system starts up, it\u2019s expected to significantly reduce gridlock in Manhattan and generate billions of dollars to improve public transit citywide. \nThe basic idea is simple. To enter the Congestion Relief Zone, which covers Manhattan south of 60th Street, under new rates announced by Hochul, large trucks will now pay $21.60, small trucks $14.40, passenger vehicles $9 and motorcycles $4.50. Ride-share vehicles and taxis will pay $1.50 and $0.75, respectively. Peak hours run from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends; overnight tolls are discounted by 75%.\nPassenger vehicles that are not part of the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system will pay $13.50 during peak periods. \nEvidence from cities around the world shows that charging motorists fees for driving into city centers during busy periods is a rarity in urban public policy: a measure that works and is cost-effective. Congestion pricing has succeeded in cities including London, Singapore and Stockholm, where it has eased traffic, sped up travel times, reduced pollution and provided funds for public transportation and infrastructure investments.\nAs an urban policy scholar, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing New York\u2019s plan go into effect. There may well be surprises and adjustments as officials see how it works in practice. But given the heavy costs that traffic imposes on public health and productivity, I\u2019m encouraged to see a major U.S. city finally test this approach.\nNudging drivers\nCongestion pricing is a response to externalities \u2013 costs or benefits that are generated by one party but incurred by another. Clogged city streets and air pollution are externalities created by urban car users, many of whom live outside the city. \nThis concept has been around for some time. British economist Arthur Pigou discussed it as early as 1920 as part of his attempt to remedy the suboptimal workings of the market system. In Pigou\u2019s view, taxing harmful activities would discourage people from engaging in them. \nOther thinkers took up this idea. In 1963, Canadian economist William Vickrey, a future Nobel laureate, argued that roads were scarce resources that needed to be valued by imposing costs on users. \nThis approach is behind behavioral economics, the policy strategy of using \u201cnudges\u201d that preserve choice but encourage certain actions. Congestion pricing assumes that increased prices will make people heading into New York think more carefully about their travel patterns, and about alternatives to driving. \nPublic transit receives priority\nCongestion pricing in a city a big as New York is no small step. The New York plan was presented to the board of the Metropolitan Transit Authority in November 2023 after years of study and a detailed environmental impact assessment, required by federal law.\nProject sponsors, which include several city agencies and the state transportation department, stated in the impact assessment that on an average weekday, an estimated 1.86 million people entered lower Manhattan by motor vehicle. Travel speeds in Manhattan\u2019s central business district, below 60th Street, declined by 23% between 2010 and 2019, from 9.1 to 7.1 mph. The traffic was generating air and noise pollution, wasting travelers\u2019 time, increasing business costs and preventing emergency vehicles from responding quickly to accidents. \nThe agencies estimated that the proposed toll system would reduce traffic in the Congestion Relief Zone by 17%, with an associated decline in air pollution. It also would generate US$15 billion for capital improvements to the city\u2019s public transit system, including making stations accessible for passengers with disabilities and buying new electric buses and commuter rail and subway cars. \nMore than 75% of all trips into the central business district are made by public transit. The system has been plagued by breakdowns over the past decade. The Metropolitan Transit Authority recently adopted a $52 billion capital improvement program to update its network, some parts of which are more than 100 years old.\nOver several months of public hearings, the MTA heard both broad support for congestion pricing and thousands of requests for credits, discounts and exemptions, most of which were denied. The limited number of exemptions includes private commuter buses, school buses and city-owned vehicles, including emergency vehicles. \nIn addition, drivers who travel via Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive on Manhattan\u2019s eastern edge, the West Side Highway on its western edge, or the Carey Tunnel between Brooklyn and Battery Park will not be charged if they do not enter any street in the Congestion Relief Zone. Drivers from the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island will be eligible for rebates and discounts on certain bridge tolls.\nThere were widespread complaints from New Yorkers in the outer boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, and from car commuters who live outside of the city. New Jersey is suing the MTA, arguing among other things that the plan is unconstitutional because it burdens interstate commerce. This suit, which is ongoing, could delay the start of congestion pricing. \nNonetheless, the board adopted the plan with just one dissenting vote, from a representative of Nassau County on Long Island.   \nStarting the journey\nMany questions will only be answered once the system starts up. Will toll prices be high enough to spur people to switch to another mode of transportation or combine trips, while still generating enough revenue for the MTA\u2019s ambitious capital improvement program? How will toll revenue be spent? And how will commuters respond when they find that trains and subways initially are more crowded, before capital upgrades improve the system? \nSome low-income and minority communities that already experience heavy traffic, such as the Bronx, could see increased congestion as drivers detour around the toll zone. To help mitigate some of these effects, the transit authority is planning to invest millions of dollars to reduce pollution in these environmental justice areas through steps such as installing air filters in schools, planting more trees and electrifying trucks at the massive Hunts Point Food Distribution Center in the Bronx. \nNo one likes to pay for something that was previously free. But freedom for car users has imposed health and economic costs on millions of New Yorkers for many years. Congestion charges do raise equity issues, but only 5% percent of people who commute into the central business district travel by car, and most of those drivers have relatively high incomes. \nThe MTA may need to adjust tolls, the zone\u2019s borders or other aspects of the plan. But if New York\u2019s experiment succeeds, it could provide a model and valuable insights for other traffic-clogged U.S. cities.\nThis article was originally published on April 10, 2024, and has been updated to reflect the pause on implementing congestion pricing imposed by Gov.

      "The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\nIf 2023 was the year the world discovered generative AI (gen AI), 2024 is the year organizations truly began using\u2014and deriving business value from\u2014this new technology. In the latest McKinsey Global Survey\u00a0on AI, 65 percent of respondents report that their organizations are regularly using gen AI, nearly double the percentage from our previous survey just ten months ago. Respondents\u2019 expectations for gen AI\u2019s impact remain as high as they were last year, with three-quarters predicting that gen AI will lead to significant or disruptive change in their industries in the years ahead.\nAbout the authors\nThis article is a collaborative effort by Alex Singla, Alexander Sukharevsky, Lareina Yee, and Michael Chui, with Bryce Hall, representing views from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and McKinsey Digital.\nOrganizations are already seeing material benefits from gen AI use, reporting both cost decreases and revenue jumps in the business units deploying the technology. The survey also provides insights into the kinds of risks presented by gen AI\u2014most notably, inaccuracy\u2014as well as the emerging practices of top performers to mitigate those challenges and capture value.\nAI adoption surges\nInterest in generative AI has also brightened the spotlight on a broader set of AI capabilities. For the past six years, AI adoption by respondents\u2019 organizations has hovered at about 50 percent. This year, the survey finds that adoption has jumped to 72 percent (Exhibit 1). And the interest is truly global in scope. Our 2023 survey found that AI adoption did not reach 66 percent in any region; however, this year more than two-thirds of respondents in nearly every region say their organizations are using AI.1Organizations based in Central and South America are the exception, with 58 percent of respondents working for organizations based in Central and South America reporting AI adoption. Looking by industry, the biggest increase in adoption can be found in professional services.2Includes respondents working for organizations focused on human resources, legal services, management consulting, market research, R&D, tax preparation, and training.\nAlso, responses suggest that companies are now using AI in more parts of the business. Half of respondents say their organizations have adopted AI in two or more business functions, up from less than a third of respondents in 2023 (Exhibit 2).\nGen AI adoption is most common in the functions where it can create the most value\nMost respondents now report that their organizations\u2014and they as individuals\u2014are using gen AI. Sixty-five percent of respondents say their organizations are regularly using gen AI in at least one business function, up from one-third last year. The average organization using gen AI is doing so in two functions, most often in marketing and sales and in product and service development\u2014two functions in which previous research\u00a0determined that gen AI adoption could generate the most value3\u201cThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,\u201d McKinsey, June 14, 2023.\u2014as well as in IT (Exhibit 3). The biggest increase from 2023 is found in marketing and sales, where reported adoption has more than doubled. Yet across functions, only two use cases, both within marketing and sales, are reported by 15 percent or more of respondents.\nGen AI also is weaving its way into respondents\u2019 personal lives. Compared with 2023, respondents are much more likely to be using gen AI at work and even more likely to be using gen AI both at work and in their personal lives (Exhibit 4). The survey finds upticks in gen AI use across all regions, with the largest increases in Asia\u2013Pacific and Greater China. Respondents at the highest seniority levels, meanwhile, show larger jumps in the use of gen Al tools for work and outside of work compared with their midlevel-management peers. Looking at specific industries, respondents working in energy and materials and in professional services report the largest increase in gen AI use.\nInvestments in gen AI and analytical AI are beginning to create value\nThe latest survey also shows how different industries are budgeting for gen AI. Responses suggest that, in many industries, organizations are about equally as likely to be investing more than 5 percent of their digital budgets in gen AI as they are in nongenerative, analytical-AI solutions (Exhibit 5). Yet in most industries, larger shares of respondents report that their organizations spend more than 20 percent on analytical AI than on gen AI. Looking ahead, most respondents\u201467 percent\u2014expect their organizations to invest more in AI over the next three years.\nWhere are those investments paying off? For the first time, our latest survey explored the value created by gen AI use by business function. The function in which the largest share of respondents report seeing cost decreases is human resources. Respondents most commonly report meaningful revenue increases (of more than 5 percent) in supply chain and inventory management (Exhibit 6). For analytical AI, respondents most often report seeing cost benefits in service operations\u2014in line with what we found last year\u2014as well as meaningful revenue increases from AI use in marketing and sales.\nInaccuracy: The most recognized and experienced risk of gen AI use\nAs businesses begin to see the benefits of gen AI, they\u2019re also recognizing the diverse risks associated with the technology. These can range from data management risks such as data privacy, bias, or intellectual property (IP) infringement to model management risks, which tend to focus on inaccurate output or lack of explainability. A third big risk category is security and incorrect use.\nRespondents to the latest survey are more likely than they were last year to say their organizations consider inaccuracy and IP infringement to be relevant to their use of gen AI, and about half continue to view cybersecurity as a risk (Exhibit 7).\nConversely, respondents are less likely than they were last year to say their organizations consider workforce and labor displacement to be relevant risks and are not increasing efforts to mitigate them.\nIn fact, inaccuracy\u2014which can affect use cases across the gen AI value chain, ranging from customer journeys and summarization to coding and creative content\u2014is the only risk that respondents are significantly more likely than last year to say their organizations are actively working to mitigate.\nSome organizations have already experienced negative consequences from the use of gen AI, with 44 percent of respondents saying their organizations have experienced at least one consequence (Exhibit 8). Respondents most often report inaccuracy as a risk that has affected their organizations, followed by cybersecurity and explainability.\nOur previous research has found that there are several elements of governance that can help in scaling gen AI use responsibly, yet few respondents report having these risk-related practices in place.4\u201cImplementing generative AI with speed and safety,\u201d McKinsey Quarterly, March 13, 2024. For example, just 18 percent say their organizations have an enterprise-wide council or board with the authority to make decisions involving responsible AI governance, and only one-third say gen AI risk awareness and risk mitigation controls are required skill sets for technical talent.\nBringing gen AI capabilities to bear\nThe latest survey also sought to understand how, and how quickly, organizations are deploying these new gen AI tools. We have found three archetypes for implementing gen AI solutions: takers use off-the-shelf, publicly available solutions; shapers customize those tools with proprietary data and systems; and makers develop their own foundation models from scratch.5\u201cTechnology\u2019s generational moment with generative AI: A CIO and CTO guide,\u201d McKinsey, July 11, 2023. Across most industries, the survey results suggest that organizations are finding off-the-shelf offerings applicable to their business needs\u2014though many are pursuing opportunities to customize models or even develop their own (Exhibit 9). About half of reported gen AI uses within respondents\u2019 business functions are utilizing off-the-shelf, publicly available models or tools, with little or no customization. Respondents in energy and materials, technology, and media and telecommunications are more likely to report significant customization or tuning of publicly available models or developing their own proprietary models to address specific business needs.\nRespondents most often report that their organizations required one to four months from the start of a project to put gen AI into production, though the time it takes varies by business function (Exhibit 10). It also depends upon the approach for acquiring those capabilities. Not surprisingly, reported uses of highly customized or proprietary models are 1.5 times more likely than off-the-shelf, publicly available models to take five months or more to implement.\nGen AI high performers are excelling despite facing challenges\nGen AI is a new technology, and organizations are still early in the journey of pursuing its opportunities and scaling it across functions. So it\u2019s little surprise that only a small subset of respondents (46 out of 876) report that a meaningful share of their organizations\u2019 EBIT can be attributed to their deployment of gen AI. Still, these gen AI leaders are worth examining closely. These, after all, are the early movers, who already attribute more than 10 percent of their organizations\u2019 EBIT to their use of gen AI. Forty-two percent of these high performers say more than 20 percent of their EBIT is attributable to their use of nongenerative, analytical AI, and they span industries and regions\u2014though most are at organizations with less than $1 billion in annual revenue. The AI-related practices at these organizations can offer guidance to those looking to create value from gen AI adoption at their own organizations.\nTo start, gen AI high performers are using gen AI in more business functions\u2014an average of three functions, while others average two. They, like other organizations, are most likely to use gen AI in marketing and sales and product or service development, but they\u2019re much more likely than others to use gen AI solutions in risk, legal, and compliance; in strategy and corporate finance; and in supply chain and inventory management. They\u2019re more than three times as likely as others to be using gen AI in activities ranging from processing of accounting documents and risk assessment to R&D testing and pricing and promotions. While, overall, about half of reported gen AI applications within business functions are utilizing publicly available models or tools, gen AI high performers are less likely to use those off-the-shelf options than to either implement significantly customized versions of those tools or to develop their own proprietary foundation models.\nWhat else are these high performers doing differently? For one thing, they are paying more attention to gen-AI-related risks. Perhaps because they are further along on their journeys, they are more likely than others to say their organizations have experienced every negative consequence from gen AI we asked about, from cybersecurity and personal privacy to explainability and IP infringement. Given that, they are more likely than others to report that their organizations consider those risks, as well as regulatory compliance, environmental impacts, and political stability, to be relevant to their gen AI use, and they say they take steps to mitigate more risks than others do.\nGen AI high performers are also much more likely to say their organizations follow a set of risk-related best practices (Exhibit 11). For example, they are nearly twice as likely as others to involve the legal function and embed risk reviews early on in the development of gen AI solutions\u2014that is, to \u201cshift left.\u201d They\u2019re also much more likely than others to employ a wide range of other best practices, from strategy-related practices to those related to scaling.\nIn addition to experiencing the risks of gen AI adoption, high performers have encountered other challenges that can serve as warnings to others (Exhibit 12). Seventy percent say they have experienced difficulties with data, including defining processes for data governance, developing the ability to quickly integrate data into AI models, and an insufficient amount of training data, highlighting the essential role that data play in capturing value. High performers are also more likely than others to report experiencing challenges with their operating models, such as implementing agile ways of working and effective sprint performance management.\nAbout the research\nThe online survey was in the field from February 22 to March 5, 2024, and garnered responses from 1,363 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. Of those respondents, 981 said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one business function, and 878 said their organizations were regularly using gen AI in at least one function. To adjust for differences in response rates, the data are weighted by the contribution of each respondent\u2019s nation to global GDP.\nAlex Singla and Alexander Sukharevsky\u00a0are global coleaders of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and senior partners in McKinsey\u2019s Chicago and London offices, respectively; Lareina Yee\u00a0is a senior partner in the Bay Area office, where Michael Chui, a McKinsey Global Institute partner, is a partner; and Bryce Hall\u00a0is an associate partner in the Washington, DC, office.\nThey wish to thank Kaitlin Noe, Larry Kanter, Mallika Jhamb, and Shinjini Srivastava for their contributions to this work.\nThis article was edited by Heather Hanselman, a senior editor in McKinsey\u2019s Atlanta office."

      "Edition\n\n\n            After a delay, New York City is moving ahead with congestion pricing to improve traffic, air quality and public\u00a0transit\n          \n\nAuthor\n\n      Professor Emeritus of Public Policy, University of Maryland, Baltimore County\n    \nDisclosure statement\nJohn Rennie Short does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\nPartners\n\nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County provides funding as a member of The Conversation US.\nView all partners\nNew York City is poised to launch the first congestion pricing plan to reduce traffic in a major U.S. metropolitan area on Jan. 5, 2025. Like many journeys in the Big Apple, this one has been punctuated by delays, including a pause that Gov. Kathy Hochul imposed in early June 2024 as the plan was about to launch. \nNow, however, Hochul has resuscitated the plan with a new US$9 fee for private cars to enter Manhattan, down from $15 in the earlier iteration. It remains to be seen whether this version can withstand resistance and legal challenges from New Jersey officials, car commuters and President-elect Donald Trump. \nAssuming that the system starts up, it\u2019s expected to significantly reduce gridlock in Manhattan and generate billions of dollars to improve public transit citywide. \nThe basic idea is simple. To enter the Congestion Relief Zone, which covers Manhattan south of 60th Street, under new rates announced by Hochul, large trucks will now pay $21.60, small trucks $14.40, passenger vehicles $9 and motorcycles $4.50. Ride-share vehicles and taxis will pay $1.50 and $0.75, respectively. Peak hours run from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends; overnight tolls are discounted by 75%.\nPassenger vehicles that are not part of the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system will pay $13.50 during peak periods. \nEvidence from cities around the world shows that charging motorists fees for driving into city centers during busy periods is a rarity in urban public policy: a measure that works and is cost-effective. Congestion pricing has succeeded in cities including London, Singapore and Stockholm, where it has eased traffic, sped up travel times, reduced pollution and provided funds for public transportation and infrastructure investments.\nAs an urban policy scholar, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing New York\u2019s plan go into effect. There may well be surprises and adjustments as officials see how it works in practice. But given the heavy costs that traffic imposes on public health and productivity, I\u2019m encouraged to see a major U.S. city finally test this approach.\nNudging drivers\nCongestion pricing is a response to externalities \u2013 costs or benefits that are generated by one party but incurred by another. Clogged city streets and air pollution are externalities created by urban car users, many of whom live outside the city. \nThis concept has been around for some time. British economist Arthur Pigou discussed it as early as 1920 as part of his attempt to remedy the suboptimal workings of the market system. In Pigou\u2019s view, taxing harmful activities would discourage people from engaging in them. \nOther thinkers took up this idea. In 1963, Canadian economist William Vickrey, a future Nobel laureate, argued that roads were scarce resources that needed to be valued by imposing costs on users. \nThis approach is behind behavioral economics, the policy strategy of using \u201cnudges\u201d that preserve choice but encourage certain actions. Congestion pricing assumes that increased prices will make people heading into New York think more carefully about their travel patterns, and about alternatives to driving. \nPublic transit receives priority\nCongestion pricing in a city a big as New York is no small step. The New York plan was presented to the board of the Metropolitan Transit Authority in November 2023 after years of study and a detailed environmental impact assessment, required by federal law.\nProject sponsors, which include several city agencies and the state transportation department, stated in the impact assessment that on an average weekday, an estimated 1.86 million people entered lower Manhattan by motor vehicle. Travel speeds in Manhattan\u2019s central business district, below 60th Street, declined by 23% between 2010 and 2019, from 9.1 to 7.1 mph. The traffic was generating air and noise pollution, wasting travelers\u2019 time, increasing business costs and preventing emergency vehicles from responding quickly to accidents. \nThe agencies estimated that the proposed toll system would reduce traffic in the Congestion Relief Zone by 17%, with an associated decline in air pollution. It also would generate US$15 billion for capital improvements to the city\u2019s public transit system, including making stations accessible for passengers with disabilities and buying new electric buses and commuter rail and subway cars. \nMore than 75% of all trips into the central business district are made by public transit. The system has been plagued by breakdowns over the past decade. The Metropolitan Transit Authority recently adopted a $52 billion capital improvement program to update its network, some parts of which are more than 100 years old.\nOver several months of public hearings, the MTA heard both broad support for congestion pricing and thousands of requests for credits, discounts and exemptions, most of which were denied. The limited number of exemptions includes private commuter buses, school buses and city-owned vehicles, including emergency vehicles. \nIn addition, drivers who travel via Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive on Manhattan\u2019s eastern edge, the West Side Highway on its western edge, or the Carey Tunnel between Brooklyn and Battery Park will not be charged if they do not enter any street in the Congestion Relief Zone. Drivers from the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island will be eligible for rebates and discounts on certain bridge tolls.\nThere were widespread complaints from New Yorkers in the outer boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, and from car commuters who live outside of the city. New Jersey is suing the MTA, arguing among other things that the plan is unconstitutional because it burdens interstate commerce. This suit, which is ongoing, could delay the start of congestion pricing. \nNonetheless, the board adopted the plan with just one dissenting vote, from a representative of Nassau County on Long Island.   \nStarting the journey\nMany questions will only be answered once the system starts up. Will toll prices be high enough to spur people to switch to another mode of transportation or combine trips, while still generating enough revenue for the MTA\u2019s ambitious capital improvement program? How will toll revenue be spent? And how will commuters respond when they find that trains and subways initially are more crowded, before capital upgrades improve the system? \nSome low-income and minority communities that already experience heavy traffic, such as the Bronx, could see increased congestion as drivers detour around the toll zone. To help mitigate some of these effects, the transit authority is planning to invest millions of dollars to reduce pollution in these environmental justice areas through steps such as installing air filters in schools, planting more trees and electrifying trucks at the massive Hunts Point Food Distribution Center in the Bronx. \nNo one likes to pay for something that was previously free. But freedom for car users has imposed health and economic costs on millions of New Yorkers for many years. Congestion charges do raise equity issues, but only 5% percent of people who commute into the central business district travel by car, and most of those drivers have relatively high incomes. \nThe MTA may need to adjust tolls, the zone\u2019s borders or other aspects of the plan. But if New York\u2019s experiment succeeds, it could provide a model and valuable insights for other traffic-clogged U.S. cities.\nThis article was originally published on April 10, 2024, and has been updated to reflect the pause on implementing congestion pricing imposed by Gov.

      "The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\nIf 2023 was the year the world discovered generative AI (gen AI), 2024 is the year organizations truly began using\u2014and deriving business value from\u2014this new technology. In the latest McKinsey Global Survey\u00a0on AI, 65 percent of respondents report that their organizations are regularly using gen AI, nearly double the percentage from our previous survey just ten months ago. Respondents\u2019 expectations for gen AI\u2019s impact remain as high as they were last year, with three-quarters predicting that gen AI will lead to significant or disruptive change in their industries in the years ahead.\nAbout the authors\nThis article is a collaborative effort by Alex Singla, Alexander Sukharevsky, Lareina Yee, and Michael Chui, with Bryce Hall, representing views from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and McKinsey Digital.\nOrganizations are already seeing material benefits from gen AI use, reporting both cost decreases and revenue jumps in the business units deploying the technology. The survey also provides insights into the kinds of risks presented by gen AI\u2014most notably, inaccuracy\u2014as well as the emerging practices of top performers to mitigate those challenges and capture value.\nAI adoption surges\nInterest in generative AI has also brightened the spotlight on a broader set of AI capabilities. For the past six years, AI adoption by respondents\u2019 organizations has hovered at about 50 percent. This year, the survey finds that adoption has jumped to 72 percent (Exhibit 1). And the interest is truly global in scope. Our 2023 survey found that AI adoption did not reach 66 percent in any region; however, this year more than two-thirds of respondents in nearly every region say their organizations are using AI.1Organizations based in Central and South America are the exception, with 58 percent of respondents working for organizations based in Central and South America reporting AI adoption. Looking by industry, the biggest increase in adoption can be found in professional services.2Includes respondents working for organizations focused on human resources, legal services, management consulting, market research, R&D, tax preparation, and training.\nAlso, responses suggest that companies are now using AI in more parts of the business. Half of respondents say their organizations have adopted AI in two or more business functions, up from less than a third of respondents in 2023 (Exhibit 2).\nGen AI adoption is most common in the functions where it can create the most value\nMost respondents now report that their organizations\u2014and they as individuals\u2014are using gen AI. Sixty-five percent of respondents say their organizations are regularly using gen AI in at least one business function, up from one-third last year. The average organization using gen AI is doing so in two functions, most often in marketing and sales and in product and service development\u2014two functions in which previous research\u00a0determined that gen AI adoption could generate the most value3\u201cThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,\u201d McKinsey, June 14, 2023.\u2014as well as in IT (Exhibit 3). The biggest increase from 2023 is found in marketing and sales, where reported adoption has more than doubled. Yet across functions, only two use cases, both within marketing and sales, are reported by 15 percent or more of respondents.\nGen AI also is weaving its way into respondents\u2019 personal lives. Compared with 2023, respondents are much more likely to be using gen AI at work and even more likely to be using gen AI both at work and in their personal lives (Exhibit 4). The survey finds upticks in gen AI use across all regions, with the largest increases in Asia\u2013Pacific and Greater China. Respondents at the highest seniority levels, meanwhile, show larger jumps in the use of gen Al tools for work and outside of work compared with their midlevel-management peers. Looking at specific industries, respondents working in energy and materials and in professional services report the largest increase in gen AI use.\nInvestments in gen AI and analytical AI are beginning to create value\nThe latest survey also shows how different industries are budgeting for gen AI. Responses suggest that, in many industries, organizations are about equally as likely to be investing more than 5 percent of their digital budgets in gen AI as they are in nongenerative, analytical-AI solutions (Exhibit 5). Yet in most industries, larger shares of respondents report that their organizations spend more than 20 percent on analytical AI than on gen AI. Looking ahead, most respondents\u201467 percent\u2014expect their organizations to invest more in AI over the next three years.\nWhere are those investments paying off? For the first time, our latest survey explored the value created by gen AI use by business function. The function in which the largest share of respondents report seeing cost decreases is human resources. Respondents most commonly report meaningful revenue increases (of more than 5 percent) in supply chain and inventory management (Exhibit 6). For analytical AI, respondents most often report seeing cost benefits in service operations\u2014in line with what we found last year\u2014as well as meaningful revenue increases from AI use in marketing and sales.\nInaccuracy: The most recognized and experienced risk of gen AI use\nAs businesses begin to see the benefits of gen AI, they\u2019re also recognizing the diverse risks associated with the technology. These can range from data management risks such as data privacy, bias, or intellectual property (IP) infringement to model management risks, which tend to focus on inaccurate output or lack of explainability. A third big risk category is security and incorrect use.\nRespondents to the latest survey are more likely than they were last year to say their organizations consider inaccuracy and IP infringement to be relevant to their use of gen AI, and about half continue to view cybersecurity as a risk (Exhibit 7).\nConversely, respondents are less likely than they were last year to say their organizations consider workforce and labor displacement to be relevant risks and are not increasing efforts to mitigate them.\nIn fact, inaccuracy\u2014which can affect use cases across the gen AI value chain, ranging from customer journeys and summarization to coding and creative content\u2014is the only risk that respondents are significantly more likely than last year to say their organizations are actively working to mitigate.\nSome organizations have already experienced negative consequences from the use of gen AI, with 44 percent of respondents saying their organizations have experienced at least one consequence (Exhibit 8). Respondents most often report inaccuracy as a risk that has affected their organizations, followed by cybersecurity and explainability.\nOur previous research has found that there are several elements of governance that can help in scaling gen AI use responsibly, yet few respondents report having these risk-related practices in place.4\u201cImplementing generative AI with speed and safety,\u201d McKinsey Quarterly, March 13, 2024. For example, just 18 percent say their organizations have an enterprise-wide council or board with the authority to make decisions involving responsible AI governance, and only one-third say gen AI risk awareness and risk mitigation controls are required skill sets for technical talent.\nBringing gen AI capabilities to bear\nThe latest survey also sought to understand how, and how quickly, organizations are deploying these new gen AI tools. We have found three archetypes for implementing gen AI solutions: takers use off-the-shelf, publicly available solutions; shapers customize those tools with proprietary data and systems; and makers develop their own foundation models from scratch.5\u201cTechnology\u2019s generational moment with generative AI: A CIO and CTO guide,\u201d McKinsey, July 11, 2023. Across most industries, the survey results suggest that organizations are finding off-the-shelf offerings applicable to their business needs\u2014though many are pursuing opportunities to customize models or even develop their own (Exhibit 9). About half of reported gen AI uses within respondents\u2019 business functions are utilizing off-the-shelf, publicly available models or tools, with little or no customization. Respondents in energy and materials, technology, and media and telecommunications are more likely to report significant customization or tuning of publicly available models or developing their own proprietary models to address specific business needs.\nRespondents most often report that their organizations required one to four months from the start of a project to put gen AI into production, though the time it takes varies by business function (Exhibit 10). It also depends upon the approach for acquiring those capabilities. Not surprisingly, reported uses of highly customized or proprietary models are 1.5 times more likely than off-the-shelf, publicly available models to take five months or more to implement.\nGen AI high performers are excelling despite facing challenges\nGen AI is a new technology, and organizations are still early in the journey of pursuing its opportunities and scaling it across functions. So it\u2019s little surprise that only a small subset of respondents (46 out of 876) report that a meaningful share of their organizations\u2019 EBIT can be attributed to their deployment of gen AI. Still, these gen AI leaders are worth examining closely. These, after all, are the early movers, who already attribute more than 10 percent of their organizations\u2019 EBIT to their use of gen AI. Forty-two percent of these high performers say more than 20 percent of their EBIT is attributable to their use of nongenerative, analytical AI, and they span industries and regions\u2014though most are at organizations with less than $1 billion in annual revenue. The AI-related practices at these organizations can offer guidance to those looking to create value from gen AI adoption at their own organizations.\nTo start, gen AI high performers are using gen AI in more business functions\u2014an average of three functions, while others average two. They, like other organizations, are most likely to use gen AI in marketing and sales and product or service development, but they\u2019re much more likely than others to use gen AI solutions in risk, legal, and compliance; in strategy and corporate finance; and in supply chain and inventory management. They\u2019re more than three times as likely as others to be using gen AI in activities ranging from processing of accounting documents and risk assessment to R&D testing and pricing and promotions. While, overall, about half of reported gen AI applications within business functions are utilizing publicly available models or tools, gen AI high performers are less likely to use those off-the-shelf options than to either implement significantly customized versions of those tools or to develop their own proprietary foundation models.\nWhat else are these high performers doing differently? For one thing, they are paying more attention to gen-AI-related risks. Perhaps because they are further along on their journeys, they are more likely than others to say their organizations have experienced every negative consequence from gen AI we asked about, from cybersecurity and personal privacy to explainability and IP infringement. Given that, they are more likely than others to report that their organizations consider those risks, as well as regulatory compliance, environmental impacts, and political stability, to be relevant to their gen AI use, and they say they take steps to mitigate more risks than others do.\nGen AI high performers are also much more likely to say their organizations follow a set of risk-related best practices (Exhibit 11). For example, they are nearly twice as likely as others to involve the legal function and embed risk reviews early on in the development of gen AI solutions\u2014that is, to \u201cshift left.\u201d They\u2019re also much more likely than others to employ a wide range of other best practices, from strategy-related practices to those related to scaling.\nIn addition to experiencing the risks of gen AI adoption, high performers have encountered other challenges that can serve as warnings to others (Exhibit 12). Seventy percent say they have experienced difficulties with data, including defining processes for data governance, developing the ability to quickly integrate data into AI models, and an insufficient amount of training data, highlighting the essential role that data play in capturing value. High performers are also more likely than others to report experiencing challenges with their operating models, such as implementing agile ways of working and effective sprint performance management.\nAbout the research\nThe online survey was in the field from February 22 to March 5, 2024, and garnered responses from 1,363 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. Of those respondents, 981 said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one business function, and 878 said their organizations were regularly using gen AI in at least one function. To adjust for differences in response rates, the data are weighted by the contribution of each respondent\u2019s nation to global GDP.\nAlex Singla and Alexander Sukharevsky\u00a0are global coleaders of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and senior partners in McKinsey\u2019s Chicago and London offices, respectively; Lareina Yee\u00a0is a senior partner in the Bay Area office, where Michael Chui, a McKinsey Global Institute partner, is a partner; and Bryce Hall\u00a0is an associate partner in the Washington, DC, office.\nThey wish to thank Kaitlin Noe, Larry Kanter, Mallika Jhamb, and Shinjini Srivastava for their contributions to this work.\nThis article was edited by Heather Hanselman, a senior editor in McKinsey\u2019s Atlanta office.",

A previously colonized town by the Portuguese, Dutch, and British now breathes new life into its built landscape. Across the world, in the German city of Kassel, the scars of World War II are etched into the environment, deep under its revived cultural soul. Both Kochi and Kassel, though worlds apart in geography and history, shared a commonality: the power of art and festivals to heal. In the aftermath of historical trauma, these cities found renewal in the creative expression of artists from around the globe.\nAlong India's southwest coast dotted with a mix of colonial architecture and ancient heritage, the city of Kochi stands as a relic of foreign influence.

Embraced by locals, it became the only spacious area for strolling in a city of narrow streets and grew into a central meeting place for all social classes. Over time, leisure and cultural sites, like the Gran Teatre del Liceu and Boqueria Market, emerged, making it a vibrant, cultural hub. In 2017, Barcelona's local government launched a competition for the revitalization of this beloved urban space. Km_ZERO, a 15-member interdisciplinary team that also relied on the input of community groups was declared the winner. Now the first phase of the urbanization process has been almost completed, led by Lola Dom\u00e8nech and Olga Tarras\u00f3. A hundred trees still remain to be planted in this phase, postponed due to drought conditions. The entire project is expected to be finished in 2027.\nLa Rambla, a 1.2-kilometer-long promenade in Barcelona, was established in 1766 along the old city walls.

Throughout its history, the stream played different roles in the city until it was covered by an elevated highway in the 1970s. For over 30 years, this natural artery remained hidden. It was not until 2003 that the city government launched a restoration project to reintegrate this urban waterway into the city fabric, revitalize the local economy, and revive the area's history and culture. The revitalization efforts were led by Mikyoung Kim Design. Since the project's completion in 2005, it quickly became one of Seoul's most visited tourist attractions. Moreover, it has become a focal point for ample urban research, with many studies offering positive assessments of the impact it had on Seoul's urban, economic, and ecological context.\nCheongye Stream, known as Cheonggyecheon (\uccad\uacc4\ucc9c) in Korean, runs eastward through the heart of Seoul, passing through 13 neighborhoods in four districts of the capital of South Korea.

This poses a complex question that involves political history, architectural theory, and cultural significance. Adaptive reuse extends beyond architectural and spatial designs; it allows cities and communities to reflect, reevaluate, and reinterpret their history from different perspectives. However, unlike books and words, buildings may not withstand the test of time themselves and serve as firsthand evidence of the stories they tell. How should we question ourselves on what to preserve and demolish? How can communities be involved in the active restoration or adaptation of historic buildings?\nAs major cities continue to develop, we face intriguing challenges regarding the preservation and adaptive reuse of significant buildings, sites, and artifacts.

They act as the hubs of social and cultural activity where people congregate, interact, and escape the clamor of the city. These areas are crucial in determining a city's identity, character, and citizens' well-being and standard of living. Public spaces can define our communities and significantly impact how we live, work, and interact with one another through their architectural designs, facilities, and activities. Furthermore, they provide leisure, exercise, and recreation opportunities, allowing individuals to escape the confines of their daily routines and connect with nature.\nPublic spaces are the beating heart of our cities.

While the economy was down, crime rates were at an all-time high. The negative public image also kept tourists away, driving the city into a financial crisis. To change perceptions about The Big Apple, the New York State Department for Economic Development approached advertising firm Wells Rich Greene to create an inviting marketing operation. After 45 years, the resulting I Love NY campaign remains fresh in the minds of locals and tourists, successfully revamping New York City\u2019s brand. Cities across the world like Paris, Amsterdam and Jerusalem have similarly invested heavily in constructing magnetic brands for themselves. \nThe 1970\u2019s were a dark time for New York City.

By analyzing this data, airlines can optimize their pricing strategies, plan their capacity, and make informed decisions about their route network. The data can also be used for market and competitive analysis, helping airlines identify profitable routes and gain a competitive advantage.\nBased on initial true O&D level data from FlightBI released this week, total US domestic air travel continue to decline in September 2024 from the previous month, reflecting typical seasonal patterns. Likewise, U.S. international air travel saw a decrease, while average airfares increased during this period.\nVolume Trend\nIn September 2024, domestic passenger numbers fell from 56.4 million in August to 50.4 million, though this still marked a 4.6% increase over September 2023, which recorded 48.2 million passengers. In the international sector, passenger numbers declined from 24.5 million in August to 20.7 million in September 2024.\nFigure 1: US Domestic and International Air Traffic by Month\nAirfare Trend\nAfter several months of decline, airfares began to rise again. The average gross fare increased from $198 in August to $205 in September, while the average net fare also saw an uptick, climbing from $169 to $176 during the same period.\nFigure 2: US Domestic Average Airfare by Month\nLoad Factor Trend\nIn September 2024, both Available Seat Miles (ASM) and Revenue Passenger Miles (RPM) declined from the previous month. The average load factor for major U.S. airlines also fell to 82.6%, as shown in Figure 3. Despite this decrease, it remains above the 82.1% recorded in September 2023.\nFigure 3: US Airlines\u2019 Average Load Factor by Month\nMonth Over Month Comparison\nIn September 2024, all major U.S. airlines experienced a decline in daily traffic compared to August. Allegiant (G4) saw the largest drop, with a 26.2% decrease due to significant capacity cuts. In contrast, Southwest (WN) and United (UA) reported more modest declines of 4.8% and 5.2%, respectively.\nFigure 4: Air Traffic by Dominant Marketing Airlines in August 2024 (Previous) vs. September 2024 (Current)\nDuring this period, traffic declined at most airports, with New York (JFK), Miami (MIA), and Boston (BOS) showing month-over-month decreases of 13.9%, 12.4%, and 11.8%, respectively. However, Phoenix (PHX) saw a 2.4% increase in traffic over the same period.\nFigure 5: Air Traffic by Top Origin Airports in August 2024 (Previous) vs. September 2024 (Current)\nYear Over Year Comparison\nBetween September 2023 and September 2024, most major U.S. airlines experienced growth, led by Frontier (F9), United (UA), and American (AA), with increases of 10.8%, 10.5%, and 10.0%, respectively.

Only four metros saw double-digit decreases.\nCongestion is also up in nearly every metro, with only six of the top 100 metros keeping congestion at or below levels seen in 2019, the report found.\nUS cities where people drive the most\nThe 10 metros where people tend to drive the most are concentrated in the Southeast, Streetlight found.\n\"These are places with sprawling geographies and often limited public transit availability,\" the report states.\nThe Northeast, Northwest and California ranked as the regions where people drive the least \u2013 people in the Southeast drive nearly twice as far as people in those regions.\nRELATED: These aging bridges will be updated, replaced with the help of $5 billion in federal funding\nCalifornia had five cities with VMT below 2019 levels.

      "\n\nArticles\n\n\nNew Construction Activity Slows in September, Primarily in Multi-Family Space\nSeptember 2024 New Residential Construction\n\u00a0\nWhat happened\nNew residential construction retreated slightly in September following a strong August. The number of units permitted for construction fell to 1,428,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, a decrease of 2.9% from the previous month and 5.7% from the previous year. Housing starts slowed as well, falling 0.5% from August 2024 and 0.7% from September 2023. Completions dipped by 2.7% month-over-month, but remain up by 14.6% year-over-year. After leading the surge in August, multi-family projects dragged in September. Permits fell 10.8% month-over-month and 17.4% year-over-year, starts fell 4.5% month-over-month and 15.7% year-over-year, and completions fell 8.7% month-over-month though they remain elevated from 2023 figures. After 14 months of consecutive declines in median asking rent, builders seem to be responding to the market and shifting their focus to single-family construction. \n\n\u00a0\nWhere it happened\nThis month\u2019s data contains some eye-popping regional splits, mostly in the Northeast, which this team of economists suggests should be taken with a grain of salt. Housing starts in the Northeast are up 57.9% month-over-month and 109.3% year-over-year for September, the same month in which the region\u2019s first snowfall occurred. Completions too were up 55.6% month-over-month and 92.2% year-over-year on a seasonally adjusted annual basis. Blips in the raw data during off-peak months of the year in regions with a high degree of seasonality, like the Northeast, can skew the adjusted figures that are primarily reported. We will be interested to see how next month\u2019s revisions of the September data come in.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the majority (51.0%) of newly-built homes hitting the market are still in the South, where September completions fell 21.6% from the spike month in August, but still exceed September of last year by 3.1%. The West region had a strong month in terms of housing completions, beating August by 22.1% and last September by 25.3%. On a permitting basis, the South also dominates in terms of future construction, constituting 53.6% of permits issued nationally. Southern states make up most of the top 10 states for new construction highlighted in our New Construction Insights Report, and it appears that trend will continue.\nWhat does this mean for homebuyers, sellers, homeowners, and the housing market\nProspective homebuyers are facing major affordability challenges, with mortgage rates ticking back up into the mid-6% range and listing prices remaining stubbornly high. Though the bottom-line new construction figures for September 2024 are somewhat disappointing, single-family projects specifically had a more promising month. Single-family permits and starts were up from even a strong August, and single-family completions still exceeded September 2023. Builders are increasingly bringing smaller, more affordable homes to the market, so buyers may find more newly-built homes that fit their budget in the coming years if the pace of new construction continues.\nSign up for updates\nJoin our mailing list to receive the latest data and research.\n\n\n"

The number of units permitted for construction fell to 1,428,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, a decrease of 2.9% from the previous month and 5.7% from the previous year. Housing starts slowed as well, falling 0.5% from August 2024 and 0.7% from September 2023. Completions dipped by 2.7% month-over-month, but remain up by 14.6% year-over-year. After leading the surge in August, multi-family projects dragged in September. Permits fell 10.8% month-over-month and 17.4% year-over-year, starts fell 4.5% month-over-month and 15.7% year-over-year, and completions fell 8.7% month-over-month though they remain elevated from 2023 figures. After 14 months of consecutive declines in median asking rent, builders seem to be responding to the market and shifting their focus to single-family construction. \n\n\u00a0\nWhere it happened\nThis month\u2019s data contains some eye-popping regional splits, mostly in the Northeast, which this team of economists suggests should be taken with a grain of salt. Housing starts in the Northeast are up 57.9% month-over-month and 109.3% year-over-year for September, the same month in which the region\u2019s first snowfall occurred. Completions too were up 55.6% month-over-month and 92.2% year-over-year on a seasonally adjusted annual basis. Blips in the raw data during off-peak months of the year in regions with a high degree of seasonality, like the Northeast, can skew the adjusted figures that are primarily reported. We will be interested to see how next month\u2019s revisions of the September data come in.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the majority (51.0%) of newly-built homes hitting the market are still in the South, where September completions fell 21.6% from the spike month in August, but still exceed September of last year by 3.1%. The West region had a strong month in terms of housing completions, beating August by 22.1% and last September by 25.3%. On a permitting basis, the South also dominates in terms of future construction, constituting 53.6% of permits issued nationally. Southern states make up most of the top 10 states for new construction highlighted in our New Construction Insights Report, and it appears that trend will continue.\nWhat does this mean for homebuyers, sellers, homeowners, and the housing market\nProspective homebuyers are facing major affordability challenges, with mortgage rates ticking back up into the mid-6% range and listing prices remaining stubbornly high. Though the bottom-line new construction figures for September 2024 are somewhat disappointing, single-family projects specifically had a more promising month. Single-family permits and starts were up from even a strong August, and single-family completions still exceeded September 2023. Builders are increasingly bringing smaller, more affordable homes to the market, so buyers may find more newly-built homes that fit their budget in the coming years if the pace of new construction continues.\nSign up for updates\nJoin our mailing list to receive the latest data and research.\n\n\n",
      "HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 1 HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM DATE: August 14, 2024 TO: Darrell West | Bonneville MPO DaNeil Jose | Bonneville MPO FROM: Aaron Berger, PE | DKS Associates SUBJECT: BMPO High-Capacity Roadways Study Project #22174-000 This memorandum summarizes the process used to identify, evaluate, and select the recommended high-capacity roadway system for the BMPO area. The memo includes: \u2022 Summary of Prior Work \u2013 Baseline Needs Evaluation Summary, Study Purpose and Need Statement, and summary Public Outreach completed to date \u2022 Alternatives Development and Evaluation \u2013 process and outcomes from expressway and strategic arterial concept development and evaluation of alternatives \u2022 Recommendations \u2013 Presents the recommended new expressways and strategic arterials, including recommended changes to functional classification throughout the BMPO area SUMMARY OF PRIOR WORK The work completed during the High-Capacity Roadway Study (HCRS) to date is summarized in the following sections: \u2022 Baseline Needs Evaluation Summary \u2022 Purpose and Need Statement \u2022 Public Outreach Summary BASELINE NEEDS EVALUATION SUMMARY The baseline needs for the BMPO area roadway system are described in detail in the Baseline Conditions and Needs Technical Memorandum.1 The needs evaluation used the BMPO travel demand model for years 2022 (existing), 2035, and 2050 conditions, flagging key congested corridors throughout the region. This evaluation included planned projects from the LRTP through the year 2050, including widening projects on several arterial corridors and the I-15 to US 20 Connector (see Figure 1). These Baseline projects were documented in the study Methods and 1 BMPO HCRS Baseline Conditions and Needs and Technical Memorandum, September 2023 HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 2 Assumptions Memorandum.2 The planning level cost estimates for these proposed improvements total $325 Million, excluding the cost of the I-15 to US 20 Connector, The I-15/US20 connector project was included in the modelling. FIGURE 1: BMPO BASELINE PROJECTS (2022, 2035, 2050) 2 BMPO HCRS Methods and Assumptions Memo, March 2023 HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 3 The future traffic conditions of the BMPO area were forecasted based on the demographic projections and baseline network assumptions presented in Baseline Conditions Memorandum. The needs analysis focused on the year 2050 Baseline Conditions. To identify levels of congestion and network constraints, estimate traffic Level of Service (LOS) was used to compare the daily traffic volumes to the roadway capacity, based on roadway type and number of lanes. The 2050 Baseline BMPO model LOS and estimated Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volumes are summarized in Figure 2. FIGURE 2: 2050 BASELINE LOS AND ADT As shown in Figure 2, the BMPO Area is expected to experience increased congestion in the future, even with assumed significant investment in expanding and adding to existing roadways. System wide, drivers in the BMPO Area are forecasted to experience 82% more delay per trip by the year 2050. HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 4 The BMPO Area system wide levels of congested roadway, LOS E (at capacity) and LOS F (over capacity) are summarized by lane miles in Table 1. TABLE 1: CONGESTED LANE MILES SUMMARY YEAR % LANE MILES LOS E % LANE MILES LOS F % LANE MILES DEFICIENT (LOS E AND F) 2022 2.6% 1.9% 4.5% 2050 8.3% 6.9% 15.2% As shown in Table 1, by the year 2050 the total miles of congested roadway within the BMPO area roadway system is estimated to more than triple, despite the improvements assumed in the 2050 Baseline Scenario to include the projects in the LRTP. The primary areas of need identified in the Baseline Needs analysis include: \u2022 Existing and future congestion on segments of critical arterial corridors such as: o 17th Street (both existing and future conditions) o Ammon Road (both existing and future conditions) o Iona Road (both existing and future conditions) o 5th East (both existing and future conditions) o Lincoln Road (future conditions) o 25th East (future conditions) o Sunnyside Road (future conditions) o 5th West (future conditions) \u2022 Constrained East-West river crossings, including 2050 daily traffic demand projected to increase by 94% over present-day conditions, include: o Broadway (LOS D) o Pancheri (LOS F) o Sunnyside (LOS E) o 65th S (LOS D with assumed widening of the existing bridge to double capacity) \u2022 The Sunnyside Road/I-15 Interchange \u2013 trips using the interchange are expected to increase from 17,000 to 45,000 per day by the year 2050. This increase includes the baseline assumption that the 65th S bridge is widened. Without this project, Sunnyside Interchange traffic would increase even more. \u2022 Traffic growth on rural roads towards the foothills to the East, including the rural segments of Sunnyside Road, 17th Street 45th East, Ammon Road, and 65th South are expected to exceed capacity due to the growth projected in the southern portion of the BMPO Area. PROJECT PURPOSE AND NEEDS STATEMENT The roadway congestion needs identified in the Future Baseline Evaluation were combined with other identified needs including safety, access, and active transportation themes from the most HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 5 recent BMPO LRTP to create the High-Capacity Roadway Study (HCRS) Needs Statement, as follows: \u201cLack of safe, efficient, and equitable access for all modes of travel from new growth areas within the BMPO area to regional activity centers and highway facilities, with increasing pass-through travel on congested arterial corridors.\u201d Based on the study needs statement, the HCRS Purpose Statement was then defined as follows: \u201cProactively plan and develop comprehensive multi-modal high-capacity roadway corridors and supporting connections, optimizing future transportation investments to help alleviate traffic congestion on existing arterial corridors and enhance overall regional mobility.\u201d Both the Purpose and Need Statements establish the approach to the alternatives development process. PUBLIC OUTREACH SUMMARY The Exiting and Future Baseline system evaluation results and study Purpose and Need Statement were shared with the Public in an Open House event on November 14, 2023. Public feedback from this event identified the following additional key themes: \u2022 Lack of active transportation facilities \u2022 Congestion on arterial corridors, particularly Ammon Road \u2022 Pass/Cut-thru traffic on local streets \u2022 Need for coordinated signal timing on arterials \u2022 Utility of roundabouts on arterials \u2022 Speeding on rural arterials \u2022 Need for beltway system to reduce congestion These needs were also considered where applicable to the project purpose statement during the subsequent alternatives screening and evaluation process. ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION The alternatives development and evaluation process followed four distinct steps: 1. Develop initial Expressway Alternatives 2. Fatal Flaw (Level 1) Screening of Expressway Alternatives (with the Steering Committee only or including elected officials?) Concern was expressed by elected officials in the last Joint TAC Police Board meeting giving indicators that we might have to go back to this step 3. Evaluation (Level 2) of Expressway Alternatives 4. Develop and Evaluate Strategic Arterial Alternatives HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 6 INITIAL EXPRESSWAY ALTERNATIVES An expressway is a limited access, median-separated, high speed (55 mph or more) facility. US 20 through Idaho Falls currently operates as an expressway facility. Expressways may include grade separations/interchanges, particularly in urbanized areas, but can also be full access at-grade intersections, albeit spaced at 1-mile minimum distances. An expressway will contain a minimum of two lanes per direction. The initial expressway alternatives were developed using a combination of ideas from the Steering Committee, project team, and the public, as well as concepts proposed in the \u201cIdaho Falls Arterial Loop: Economic Assessment\u201d and the \u201cTransportation System Alternatives Study.\u201d These expressway concepts were intended to serve future growth areas surrounding the currently urbanized BMPO areas while also providing higher speed, higher capacity alternatives to existing congested arterial corridors. Note that by nature of their proposed locations, the expressways would not be expected to provide significant relief to current congestion issues in the more fully built out areas within the BMPO, as the new facilities would be too far out of direction to pull trips from these roadways. The expressway alternatives were intended to provide both capacity for new development and increase resiliency of nearby congested arterials against future growth. The following initial Expressway Alternatives were proposed for Level 1 Screening (See Figure 3): \u2022 North Concept o North Expressway Alternative 1 \u2013 New Expressway located approximately on the 81st North Alignment, from I-15 to US 26. This concept would include a new interchange on I-15 and a new Snake River crossing. \u2022 South Concepts o South Expressway Alternative 1 \u2013 New Expressway located approximately along the 65th South existing alignment, from I-15 to 45th East (Crowley). This concept would involve re-aligning the 65th South Corridor between 15th East and 25th East. o South Expressway Alternative 2 \u2013 New Expressway located approximately halfway between 65th South and 81st South, connecting I-15 to 45th East (Crowley). This alternative would follow the 65th South existing alignment from I-15 through US 91. o South Expressway Alternative 3 \u2013 New Expressway located approximately along the 65th South existing alignment, but routing to the north-east at 25th East, ultimately connecting to 45th East (Crowley) near Sunnyside Road. This concept is identical to South Expressway Alternative 1 from I-15 to 25th East. \u2022 East o East Expressway Alternative 1 \u2013 New Expressway located approximately \u00bc mile east of 55th East, from just north of the 65th South/45th East (Crowley) intersection to the US 26/55th East intersection. \u2022 West o West Expressway Alternative 1 \u2013 New Expressway connecting the planned I-15/US 20 Connector system interchange to the I-15/45th West/65th South interchange. This alignment would approximately follow the existing 45th West alignment from 17th North to 65th South. HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 7 Note that these initial concepts were very high-level planning alignments, and more specific details related to the alignment locations and geometry were saved for alternatives passing the subsequent Level 1 (Fatal Flaw) Screening. FIGURE 3: INITIAL EXPRESSWAY CONCEPTS HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 8 Two additional alternatives were considered and dismissed based on clear feasibility constraints: \u2022 45th East Expressway (65th S to US 26) \u2013 the existing land use, constrained ROW, and access conditions on this corridor led to this alternative being deemed infeasible by the Stakeholder Committee \u2022 55th East Expressway (45th E near 65th S to US 26) \u2013 similar to 45th East, the constrained ROW, and access conditions on this corridor led to this alternative being deemed infeasible by the Stakeholder Committee EXPRESSWAY ALTERNATIVES LEVEL 1 SCREENING The HCRS Streeting Committee performed the Level 1 (Fatal Flaw) Screening of the initial expressway alternatives. The key Level 1 Screening Criteria considered were: \u2022 Physical Constraints \u2013 consideration of prohibitive terrain features such as steep grades \u2022 Traffic Utility \u2013 consideration of the project purpose and need related to identified congestion needs \u2022 ROW/property Impacts \u2013 Potential to create large scale property acquisitions in already built out neighborhoods and subdivisions \u2022 Access Impacts \u2013 existing roadway and driveway access for expressway alignments following current roadway corridors Using these criteria, the Steering Committee screened out the following expressway alternatives: \u2022 North Expressway Alternative 1 \u2013 This concept was screened out due to minimal anticipated traffic utility towards the HCRS Purpose and Need. Under 2050 Baseline Conditions, the I-15 to US 20 Connector project provides surplus capacity for east-west traffic in this area, and the proposed expressway corridor would not be targeting any clear needs. In addition, the ROW impacts along 81st N and the feasibility of constructing another system level interchange on I-15 were determining factors in screening out this alternative. \u2022 South Expressway Alternative 1 \u2013 This alternative was screened out due to access impacts along the existing 65th South corridor, which includes many driveways and already abuts housing subdivision connections. \u2022 South Expressway Alternative 3 \u2013 This alternative was also screened out due to access impacts along the existing 65th South corridor as well as conflicts with subdivisions when connecting from 65th south across Ammon Road and onto 49th East (Crowley) \u2022 East Expressway Alternative 1 \u2013 This alternative was screened out due to property impacts and grade constraints for the segment from 45th East to the proposed north-south alignment, particularly conflicts at Sunnyside Road The remaining Expressway Alternatives (South Expressway Alternative 2 and West Expressway Alternative 1) were advanced to the Level 2 Evaluation. EXPRESSWAY ALTERNATIVES LEVEL 2 EVALUATION The two expressway alternatives advanced to the Level 2 Evaluation (South Alt 2 and West Alt 1) were analyzed in the 2050 BMPO travel demand model to estimate the potential traffic benefits and independent utility of these proposed corridors. Each corridor was also evaluated to determine the HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 9 high-level key design constraints and potential ROW, access, and design challenges that the proposed expressway would likely entail. WEST EXPRESSWAY ALTERNATIVE EVALUATION The West Expressway Alignment was refined to include curves that met AASHTO standards for the anticipated speeds (55 mph) of the new facility. The northern terminus of the proposed expressway was connected to the yet to be constructed I-15/US 20 Connector as the fourth leg of the system interchange. At the southern terminus, the expressway follows the 45th W alignment into the 65th S/I-15 interchange. The West Expressway Alternative was added to the BMPO 2050 Baseline network and run as an independent scenario under 2050 conditions. As this was a high-level evaluation of the viability of this proposed expressway, the initial coding assumptions emphasized capacity, speed, and throughput. These coding assumptions do not represent the likely expressway configuration but do portray the ability of the proposed facility to draw trips away from other congested corridors. The arterial intersections with the proposed expressway were either modeled as grade separations (overpass/underpass) or interchanges, described as follows: \u2022 Old Butte Rd/N 26th W \u2013 Coded as an overpass/underpass \u2022 35th W \u2013 Coded as an interchange \u2022 57th W \u2013 Coded as an overpass/underpass \u2022 W 17th N \u2013 Coded as an interchange \u2022 US 20 \u2013 Coded as an interchange \u2022 17th Street S \u2013 Coded as an overpass/underpass \u2022 W 33rd S \u2013 Coded as an interchange \u2022 W 49th S \u2013 Coded as an overpass/underpass To better understand the traffic benefits of the West Expressway Alternative, the change in daily traffic volume between the year 2050 West Expressway Alternative and the Baseline Scenario was mapped and analyzed (See Figure 4). HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 10 FIGURE 4: WEST EXPRESSWAY VS BASELINE 2050 TRAFFIC VOLUME CHANGE As shown in Figure 4, the West Expressway draws traffic away from the I-15 and US 20 West, reducing daily traffic on these corridors by up to 15%. The expressway essentially provides a US 20 bypass around Idaho Falls. The expressway also pulls traffic away from the congested I-15/Sunnyside Road interchange, reducing traffic at this location by 5%. Additional localized increases on roadways such as 33rd S, 49th S, and Broadway are driven be assumed reduced access HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 11 to the 45th West corridor, which would then reallocate trips to these east-west corridors. Overall, these reallocated future trips are not expected to create significant capacity issues on these east-west corridors. The West Expressway 2050 BMPO model LOS and estimated Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volumes are summarized in Figure 5 (without the South Expressway Alternative). FIGURE 5: 2050 WEST EXPRESSWAY LOS AND ADT As shown in Figure 5, the West Expressway does not directly address any of the critical 2050 Baseline LOS issues. This proposed expressway does provide significant regional route redundancy by providing an alternate US 20 route, and also provides additional capacity to support growth west of the Snake River. HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 12 A high-level assessment of the corridor for expressway feasibility indicated the challenges summarized in Table 2. TABLE 2: WEST EXPRESSWAY KEY CHALLENGES CHALLENGE SEGMENT POTENTIAL MITIGATIONS PRIVATE DRIVEWAYS 65th S to 49th S Shift expressway alignment west of 45th W \u00bd Mile south of US 20 Shift expressway alignment slightly west, extend old S 45th Rd W alignment south as a frontage connection CONSTRAINED ROW 17th S/45th W Consider shifting alignment east to bypass existing privates and commercial structures NEW ROW NEEDED 17th N to I-15/US 20 Connector Interchange Refine alignment for this corridor to provide basis for ROW buffer, ensuing future development does not build over the proposed corridor 17th N to 65th S Ensure incoming development along 45th W leaves sufficient ROW setbacks to accommodate an expressway cross section 65th S/I-15 Interchange ROW needs for potential system interchange SOUTH EXPRESSWAY ALTERNATIVE EVALUATION The South Expressway Alignment was refined to include curves that met AASHTO standards for the anticipated speeds (55 mph) of the new facility. The western terminus of the proposed expressway follows the existing 65th S alignment and connects into the 65th S/I-15 interchange. At the eastern terminus, the expressway ties into 45th E (Crowley). The South Expressway Alternative was added to the BMPO 2050 Baseline network and run as an independent scenario under 2050 conditions. As this was a high-level evaluation of the viability of this proposed expressway, similar to the West Expressway, the initial coding assumptions emphasized capacity, speed, and throughput. These coding assumptions do not represent the likely expressway configuration but do portray the ability of the proposed facility to draw trips away from other congested corridors. The arterial intersections with the proposed expressway were either modeled as grade separations (overpass/underpass) or interchanges, described as follows: \u2022 1600 Rd/81 S \u2013 Overpass/Underpass \u2022 US 91 \u2013 Interchange \u2022 Jameston Rd \u2013 Overpass/Underpass \u2022 5th W \u2013 Overpass/Underpass \u2022 5th E (Holmes) \u2013 Interchange HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 13 \u2022 15th E \u2013 Overpass/Underpass \u2022 25th E \u2013 Interchange \u2022 Ammon Rd \u2013 Overpass/Underpass In addition, the 65th S/I-15 interchange capacity was assumed to be expanded as part of the South Expressway Alternative, with the existing roundabouts widened to multi-lane and the existing overpass expanded to four lanes. To better understand the traffic benefits of the South Expressway Alternative, both South Expressway Alternative 1 and Alternative 2 were evaluated. South Expressway Alternative 1 was modeled to determine whether shifting the expressway further south significantly decreased the traffic benefits. In addition, the West Expressway Alternative was included with both South Expressway Scenarios to better understand the traffic impacts at the 65th S/I-15 interchange. The change in daily traffic volume between the year 2050 South Expressway Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the Baseline Scenario are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7.

Based on these findings, shifting the south expressway approximately \u00bd mile south of 65th S was determined to provide similar traffic benefits to the expressway alternative on the existing 65th S alignment. Note that there are additional shifts of north-south traffic between parallel corridors. These shifts are driven by the modeled access points from arterials onto the expressway, and result in some small north-south traffic shifts farther from the expressway, such as on to Woodruff north of 25th S. The South Expressway 2050 BMPO model LOS and estimated Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volumes are summarized in Figure 8. FIGURE 8: 2050 SOUTH EXPRESSWAY LOS AND ADT HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 17 As shown in Figure 8, the South Expressway reduces future congestion on Sunnyside Road, reducing travel time on this corridor by more than 12%, and on 17th Street by more than 7%. In addition, this alternative reduces traffic demand on the 65th S corridor. A high-level assessment of the corridor for expressway feasibility indicated the challenges summarized in Table 3.

Strategic arterials would be five to seven lane roadways, with access limited to \u00bd mile intersection spacing. Intersections could be HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 18 signal or roundabout controlled, with roundabout control working particularly well in locations where eliminating access points, particularly existing driveways, is not feasible. The initial strategic arterials proposed for consideration are shown in Figure 9. FIGURE 9: PROPOSED STRATEGIC ARTERIALS HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 19 The strategic arterials were added to the BMPO 2050 Baseline network and run as an independent scenario under 2050 conditions without expressways. The coding of the proposed corridors consisted of removing/revising centroid connections (neighborhood access) onto the proposed strategic arterials. These changes reflected potential access restrictions along the corridors. Corridor speeds were also increased to reflect reduced intersection impedance. Note that the strategic arterials were first tested independently from the expressways to understand their utility, but the ultimate goal is to have the strategic arterials combined with expressways to serve future traffic needs. To better understand the traffic benefits of the Strategic Arterials, the change in daily traffic volume between the year 2050 Strategic Arterials Alternative and the Baseline Scenario was mapped and analyzed (See Figure 10). HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 20 FIGURE 10: STRATEGIC ARTERIAL ALTERNATIVE VS BASELINE 2050 TRAFFIC VOLUME CHANGE The strategic arterial corridors draw traffic demand from parallel corridors, with 65th S, Lincoln Rd, 25th E, and 45th E in particular drawing additional traffic demand and providing some relief to adjacent corridors such as Ammon Road (up to 13% reduction) and 1st St (up to 12% reduction). The Strategic Arterial 2050 BMPO model LOS and estimated Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volumes are summarized in Figure 11. HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 21 FIGURE 11: 2050 STRATEGIC ARTERIAL LOS AND ADT As shown in Figure 11, the Strategic Arterial Alternative improves travel times on the following routes: \u2022 65th S (east of US 91) \u2022 35th W \u2022 45th E HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 22 \u2022 49th S \u2022 45th N Overall, the strategic arterials provide system wide benefit, and that benefit is further augmented when coupled with the south expressway. A high-level assessment of the corridors for strategic arterial feasibility indicated the following key challenges: \u2022 65th S Corridor Challenges o Driveway access \u2013 numerous private driveways, particularly between Ammon Road and 45th E o Local subdivision access, including > Maggie Dr > 9 W > S 9th W > S 12th W > Limousin Ave > Glass Mountain Blvd > Sommer Dr o Land Use \u2013 Fairgrounds o Geometry \u2013 offset intersection at 25th E \u2022 Sunnyside Road Corridor Challenges o Local road access, particularly east of 25th E o Constrained ROW \u2013 East of 25th E o Existing private driveway access \u2022 Lincoln Road Corridor Challenges o Unknown future tie-in to existing US 20 corridor o Commercial Access points west of 25th E o Private driveway access from 25th E to Ammon Rd \u2022 49th N Corridor Challenges o Need to coordinate with ITD US 26 corridor project, particularly at Beaches Corner o Private driveways from Ammon Rd to 45th E \u2022 33rd N Corridor Challenges o Private driveway access near 26th W/Old Butte Rd \u2022 45th W Corridor Challenges o Private driveway access south of 49th S, near 17th S, south of US 20 \u2022 25th E Corridor Challenges o Commercial access near Iona Road and US 26 o Private accesses north of US 26 \u2022 45th E Corridor Challenges HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 23 o Limited ROW/canal conflicts, particularly north of Lincoln Rd o Private drive access, particularly for \u00bd mile south of Iona Rd INITIAL HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY SYSTEM The West Expressway was initially recommended for inclusion as an opportunity to provide long-term (30+ year) capacity for growth west of I-15. Based on this recommendation, 45th W and 33rd N were not initially recommended as strategic arterials. The South Expressway was initially recommended for inclusion in the high-capacity roadway system due to both the 25-year benefits to adjacent corridors such as Sunnyside and 65th S as well as the potential to serve larger future growth needs as the urbanized areas continue to extend to the south. Due to the South Expressway recommendation, 65th S was not initially recommended as a strategic arterial, but rather was recommended to become a minor arterial with a 3-lane cross section. The Old Butte Road Corridor was recommended for inclusion as a strategic arterial as this corridor completes an inner loop connection and provides support for the more near-term development likely to occur west of the Snake River. All other proposed strategic arterials corridors were included in the initial recommended high-capacity roadway system. In addition, 5th W (Freeman Rd/E River Rd) north of US 20 showed capacity issues under 2050 conditions, and is recommended to be upgraded from a Minor Arterial to a Major Arterial from US 20 to 65th N. The full initial recommended scenario is shown in Figure 12.

The change in daily traffic volume between the year 2050 Initial High-Capacity Roadway and the Baseline Scenario was mapped along with the ADT and LOS (See Figure 13 and Figure 14).

Key system performance metrics are summarized in Table 4.

These corridors do have opportunities for additional capacity enhancement, particularly with coordinated signal timings on the signalized corridors, and widening on to existing five-lane segments at key locations. These proposed corridors will help keep the regional traffic movements off the local system, enhancing opportunities for parallel low stress active transportation corridors, reduce the risk of neighborhood cut-through traffic attempting to bypass arterial congestion, and provide opportunities for safer transit access. Additional evaluation at the corridor level considered the traffic operations benefits of limiting future access to the strategic arterial corridors as the surrounding areas develop and build out. These benefits were estimated based on the proportion of each corridor currently undeveloped, and the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) travel time and segment density (congestion) reductions associated with reduced access. Existing corridors surrounded by more built out adjacent land uses realize less future benefit, as many of the access decisions on the urban segments of these corridors have already been made. Key initial benefits and future project considerations of the Initial High-Capacity Roadway System are summarized by corridor as follows: \u2022 South Expressway o Benefits > Reduces future traffic demand on Sunnyside Road, improving travel times by 12% > Reduces future traffic demand on 17th Street by approximately 8%, improves travel time by 7% > Reduces future traffic demand on 65th S by 56%. This corridor could now be built out to a 3-lane (rather than 5-lane) minor arterial standard > Provides long-term east-west capacity, providing potential to serve a broader variety of land uses along the new corridor o Future Project Considerations > Need to increase capacity at I-15/65th S interchange > New Snake River Bridge HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 28 > Interchange at US 91/South Expressway \u2013 design must balance 65th S access, railroad tracks/ROW, and gravel pit impacts > Minimize impacts to the platted Ivywood development > Incorporate 5th E future extension > Avoid Fairgrounds property impacts > Tie-in with 45th E should include a transition zone down to a strategic arterial. This could include a roundabout at 45th E/65th S/South Expressway. \u2022 West Expressway o Benefits > Reduces future traffic demand on I-15 and US 20 by approximately 15% > Reduces future north-south travel time on the east side by approximately 30% > Provides long-term capacity to land east of I-15 o Future Project Considerations > Coordinate tie-in to I-15/US 20 Connector > Plan for future interchange at US 20/45th W > Complete preliminary design for alignment from I-15 to US 20 W to determine ROW needs > Expand 65th S/I-15 Interchange to incorporate multi-lane roundabouts/system interchange \u2022 Sunnyside Road Strategic Arterial Re-classification o Benefits > Potential 5% decrease in future travel time > Improved corridor safety (reduced conflicts) > Reduced traffic demand on 17th Avenue and 49th S o Future project considerations > Planned expansion from 2 to 5 lanes from Ammon Road to 45th E should include access restrictions wherever possible > Implement east-west signal timing coordination along the corridor > Feasibility study and preliminary design for future interchange expansion at I-15/Sunnyside Road \u2022 Lincoln Road Strategic Arterial Re-classification o Benefits > Potential 5% decrease in future travel time > Improved corridor safety (reduced conflicts) > Reduced traffic demand on Iona Road and 1st Avenue o Future project considerations > Coordinate west tie-in with old US 20 corridor future configuration > Leverage existing roundabouts (u-turns) to limit access to right-in/right-out where feasible HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 29 > Build future widening project from Ammon Road to 45th E to strategic arterial cross section and access standards \u2022 49th N Strategic Arterial Re-classification o Benefits > Potential 25% decrease in future travel time > Improved corridor safety (reduced conflicts) > Reduced traffic demand on Iona Road o Future project considerations > Coordinate with ITD US 26 corridor project at Beaches Corner to facilitate east-west arterial travel > Ensure incoming schools along the corridor prioritize local roadway access over connection to 49th N \u2022 Old Butte Road Strategic Arterial Re-classification o Benefits > Potential 5% decrease in future travel time > Improved corridor safety (reduced conflicts) > Reduced intra-city travel on I-15 o Future project considerations > Ensure any future extension of Old Butte Road meets strategic arterial access restrictions > Consider alternate (narrower) cross sections for segments with potential FAA/Airport conflicts \u2022 25th E Strategic Arterial Re-classification o Benefits > Potential 5% decrease in future travel time > Improved corridor safety (reduced conflicts) > Reduces future traffic demand on Ammon Road and Woodruff Ave o Future project considerations > Ensure widening projects south of Sunnyside Road meet strategic arterial access restrictions \u2022 45th E Strategic Arterial Re-classification o Benefits > Potential 10% decrease in future travel time > Improved corridor safety (reduced conflicts) > Reduced traffic demand on Ammon Road o Future project considerations > Consider adding a north-south residential roadway from railroad tracks to Iona Road east of 45th E, providing properties currently fronting 45th E with alternate access > Support roundabouts at key intersections along the corridor with corresponding access restrictions HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY STUDY \u2022 ALTERNATIVES MEMORANDUM \u2022 AUGUST 2024 30 \u2022 5th W (re-classify to Principal Arterial) o This corridor shows increased future traffic and congestion, mostly due to the proposed I-15/US 20 connector project. To accommodate this increased traffic, the 5th W classification is recommended to be upgraded to Principal Arterial, and a new project should be considered to widen this corridor to five lanes from the existing five-lane section near MK Simpson Blvd to 65th N. This improvement should be coordinated with the I-15/US 20 Connector project. The initial findings and recommendations from the evaluation of alternatives were shared with the local jurisdiction staff and elected representatives. Further input was received regarding ROW constraints, expressway viability, and needed connections, and this input was used to develop the Final Recommended High-Capacity Roadway Network. FINAL HIGH-CAPACITY ROADWAY NETWORK The input received from local jurisdictions throughout the BMPA indicated ROW and land use constraints that rendered the West Expressway alternative inviable. Therefore, the 45th W and 33rd N Strategic Arterials were added back into the High-Capacity Roadway system as part of the final recommendation. The key benefits and future project considerations for these corridors are summarized as follows: \u2022 45th W Strategic Arterial Re-classification o Benefits > Potential 25% decrease in future travel time > Improved corridor safety (reduced conflicts) > Reduced intra-city travel on I-15 o Future project considerations > Plan for future interchange at US 20/45th W \u2022 33rd N Strategic Arterial Re-classification o Benefits > Potential 5% decrease in future travel time > Improved corridor safety (reduced conflicts) > Reduced traffic demand US 20 (I-15 to 45th W) \u2022 Future project considerations o If the I-15 to US 20 connector contains a full access west side connection at I-15, ensure that this access connects to 33rd W Additional adjustments were made to the reclassification recommendations for the other strategic arterial corridors, ensuring all strategic arterials start and end at either equal or higher classification facilities. The South Expressway concept was further refined, with a preliminary alignment and initial interchange footprint concepts added to develop an estimated range of potential impact for the corridor. This area is shown in Figure 15.

      "Harsher penalties, civil suits possible for speeding drivers in DC under newly passed bill\n\nThomas Robertson  | trobertson@wtop.com\n\nFebruary 7, 2024, 6:12 AM\nD.C. would have the authority to boot and tow vehicles repeatedly caught speeding by cameras under new legislation unanimously passed by the city\u2019s council Tuesday.\nCouncil member Charles Allen introduced the Strengthening Traffic Enforcement, Education, and Responsibility (STEER) Act of 2024. The bill would also allow for \u201cspeed governors,\u201d devices that can prevent drivers from exceeding a certain speed, to be installed in certain vehicles.\nPassage of the STEER Act comes after the District saw 52 traffic deaths in 2023, an increase from 35 in 2022.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious right now that a significant number of drivers do not fear accountability for speeding, driving recklessly, or driving drunk. And why should they? Nothing about their experience tells them there are consequences,\u201d Allen said in a news release. \u201cThat\u2019s about to change now that the Council has spoken clearly.\u201d\nThe STEER Act would establish a new points system for vehicles repeatedly caught speeding. If a vehicle accumulates 10 points in a six-month window, it immediately becomes eligible for booting and towing. Under the bill, points are accumulated as follows:\nAllen\u2019s office said in a news release that D.C. cameras issued more than 1 million tickets for cars going 11-15 mph over the speed limit.\nThe point system would apply to any vehicle, regardless of where it\u2019s registered.\n\u201cSpeed governors\u201d would come into play for drivers whose license was suspended or revoked because of excessive speeding, including reckless driving. The first time a driver is required to enroll in the program, they would have to use the device for one year. The length of enrollment increases by one year for each subsequent conviction, with a fourth conviction resulting in lifelong enrollment.\nThe STEER Act would also empower D.C.\u2019s Office of the Attorney General to bring civil suits against drivers from anywhere who have large balances of unpaid moving violations.\n\u201cWe must redouble our efforts to crack down on dangerous drivers who put pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers at risk,\u201d D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb said.\nIt was revealed in November that 335 drivers who should have been enrolled in D.C.\u2019s Ignition Interlock Program did not have the devices installed in their vehicles. Allen\u2019s office said the bill would address the Department of Motor Vehicles\u2019 notification failures that led to offending drivers slipping through the cracks.\n\u201cDangerous driving is far too common in every DC neighborhood,\u201d Allen said in a news release. \u201cThe bill approved today will create real, common sense accountability measures to reduce speeding and reckless behavior in our neighborhoods and close loopholes blocking accountability.\u201d\nMayor Muriel Bowser and Congress still need to sign off on the legislation before it becomes law.\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\u00a9 2024 WTOP.

Tech, Ph.D, Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology Chennai, India Abstract AI-powered transportation systems represent a transformative leap in urban mobility management, leveraging real-time data processing to dynamically adjust traffic flow, significantly reducing fuel consumption, emissions, and idling times. These systems excel in swiftly responding to potential hazards at intersections, minimizing accidents by identifying risks and prioritizing emergency vehicles for immediate clearance, potentially saving lives. Their adaptability and learning capabilities optimize commute times, energy consumption, and traffic efficiency at intersections, fostering sustainable urban environments. Through machine learning algorithms, they pre-emptively address bottlenecks, refining traffic dynamics, and enhancing economic productivity. Additionally, by facilitating seamless vehicle-infrastructure communication, these systems enable personalized route recommendations, optimized traffic signal timings, and rerouting strategies, paving the way for a smart, interconnected urban ecosystem prioritizing efficiency, safety, and sustainability, revolutionizing urban transportation management. Keywords: Traffic System, Management, Vehicle Monitoring, Intelligent Traffic Monitoring System, Fuzzy Logic, Machine Learning. I. INTRODUCTION Achieving a more precise and adaptive estimate of green signal time is crucial for optimizing traffic flow and minimizing delays in metropolitan cities. To achieve it a unique approach is used, dividing vehicles into distinct categories and employing advanced object detection techniques like YOLO (You Only Look Once). Object detection algorithms like YOLO enable the system to accurately identify and count the number of vehicles in real-time. This process provides valuable data on the volume and distribution of vehicles in each direction at a particular intersection. By categorizing vehicles, the system gains a nuanced understanding of the diverse traffic mix, considering the varying sizes, speeds, and acceleration characteristics of different vehicle types. Once this real-time data is obtained, the system becomes adaptive, dynamically adjusting the timers of traffic signals based on the observed volume of vehicles in each category and direction. This adaptability is a key feature that distinguishes the system from traditional static traffic signal setups. Rather than relying on predetermined signal timings, the system responds in real-time to the actual traffic conditions, maximizing the efficiency of the green light duration. The adaptive adjustment of signal timings has several advantages. Firstly, it minimizes unnecessary International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240214871 Volume 6, Issue 2, March-April 2024 2 delays and waiting times for vehicles at the intersection. By precisely tailoring the green signal duration to the current traffic demands, the system ensures that traffic is cleared more swiftly than it would be under a static signal system. This not only reduces congestion but also enhances overall traffic throughput. Furthermore, the dynamic adjustment of signal timings has a cascading effect on fuel consumption and pollution. With reduced waiting times and smoother traffic flow, vehicles spend less time idling at intersections, leading to lower fuel consumption and emissions. This environmental benefit aligns with the broader goal of creating a more sustainable and eco-friendly urban transportation system. In summary, the integration of object detection techniques and adaptive signal timing based on real- time traffic data represents a sophisticated and effective approach to traffic management. By leveraging technology to categorize and quantify vehicles, and subsequently optimizing signal timings, the system significantly improves traffic efficiency, reduces congestion, lowers fuel use, and contributes to a cleaner and more sustainable urban environment. II. LITERATURE REVIEW 1. proposes a solution using video processing. The video from the live feed is processed before being sent to the servers where a C++ based algorithm is used to generate the results. Hard code and Dynamic coded methodologies are compared, in which the dynamic algorithm showed an improvement of 35%. 2. The paper [4] has proposed an MPC (Model predictive control) which will be used on the highway and focuses on roadside control. The pa- per basically provides information on how MPC can be applied for speed control and lane allocation. It basically works with the lane requirements and speed allocation. x The paper states that every car running on the highway can be allocated a certain speed for the particular time. x The time span given and the lane given to the vehicle is independent. 3. System developed for the main intersections of the road. Microcontroller used is Beagle Bone Black/Rasp Pi, algorithm used is Haar Cascade. The system proves that it can minimize traffic mobbing and reduce waiting time of vehicles in front of traffic signals. To make real time analysis of traffic in modern cities,the authors of this project have configured and coupled actual traffic images taken with micro controller and guarantees that the average waiting time of vehicles in front of traffic signal will be lesser than the present traffic control system. 4. Smart Traffic the board framework is a one of the significant elements for a brilliant city. As of now traffic the executives and ready frameworks are not fulfilling the needs of STMS. It is more costly and profoundly configurable to offer better assistance for traffic executives. This paper proposes a minimal expense Real-Time brilliant traffic Management System to offer better support by sending traffic markers to refresh the traffic subtleties right away. Minimal expense vehicle identifying sensors are implants in the street for each 500 meters or 1000 meters. IoT is being utilized to get traffic information rapidly and send it for handling. 5. In order to perform intelligent decision- making based on the traffic circumstances on the present lane and its neighboring lane in a four-lane intersection, Mittal and Chawla (2020) proposed a hybrid neuro- fuzzy adaptive traffic light system. The ANFIS system was implemented using Sugeno. The system was broken down into three parts: lane selection, timing adjustments for the green signal extension, and system training. ANFIS model performance was compared to those of fuzzy systems and fixed timing systems. The experimental findings demonstrated that the suggested ANFIS system International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240214871 Volume 6, Issue 2, March-April 2024 3 outperformed other systems in terms of efficiency. III. EXISTING SYSTEM Real-time Adaptability and Responsiveness: Traditional traffic management systems often operate on fixed schedules, lacking the agility to swiftly respond to dynamically changing traffic conditions. This limitation results in suboptimal traffic flow, heightened congestion, and prolonged wait times at intersections The introduction of real-time adaptability revolutionizes this landscape by enabling traffic signals to dynamically adjust based on the current volume and distribution of vehicles. This not only improves overall traffic efficiency but also significantly reduces delays, leading to a more responsive and adaptive urban transportation system. Environmental Efficiency One of the critical drawbacks of existing traffic systems is their reliance on predetermined schedules, which may lead to inefficiencies during unexpected traffic congestion or periods of low vehicle volumes. Real-time adaptability in traffic signals addresses this issue by optimizing green light durations based on actual demand. This dynamic adjustment minimizes unnecessary stops and idling, contributing to improved environmental efficiency. Reduced fuel consumption and emissions become tangible benefits of this adaptive approach, aligning with broader sustainability goals for urban environments. Enhanced Safety Features: The reliance of traditional traffic management on basic sensors and manual interventions poses challenges in rapidly changing or emergency situations. Real-time adaptive systems, however, enhance safety features by quickly analyzing and responding to evolving traffic conditions. This proactive approach significantly lowers the likelihood of accidents, fostering a safer urban transportation landscape. The integration of advanced technologies for real-time decision-making marks a crucial step toward achieving a transportation system that prioritizes the well-being of commuters and pedestrians. Automated Response to Emergency Vehicles: Existing traffic systems often rely on manual activation of emergency signals and limited pre- emption systems, which can be insufficient in heavy traffic or densely populated areas. Real-time adaptive systems bring a transformative shift by autonomously detecting and prioritizing emergency vehicles. This automated response ensures immediate and seamless clearance at intersections, facilitating the swift movement of emergency services through traffic. In emergency situations, this capability can prove critical, potentially saving lives by expediting the timely arrival of crucial services. In conclusion, the shift from fixed-schedule traffic management systems to real-time adaptive systems represents a significant advancement in urban transportation. This evolution addresses inefficiencies, enhances environmental sustainability, improves safety features, and automates responses to emergency situations, collectively contributing to a more efficient, responsive, and safer urban transportation infrastructure. IV. PROPOSED SYSTEM Upon implementing the proposed model, a paradigm shift occurs in the way we assess the time for a vehicle to reach its destination. The system utilizes advanced technologies, such as real-time traffic International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240214871 Volume 6, Issue 2, March-April 2024 4 data, object detection techniques, and adaptive signal timings. It dynamically adjusts estimations based on the current volume, distribution of vehicles, and other relevant factors. This ensures a more accurate and responsive assessment of the time needed for vehicles to traverse specific routes. Following implementation, a crucial step involves comparing the time periods before and after the introduction of the model. This comparative analysis allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's effectiveness in optimizing traffic flow, reducing delays, and improving overall transportation efficiency. By identifying the areas of improvement, city planners and traffic management authorities can fine-tune the model for further enhancements. A notable feature of the proposed model is its ability to create a \"Green Corridor\" for emergency vehicles. Traditional systems may require manual activation of emergency signals or face limitations in heavy traffic. The new model, however, autonomously detects and prioritizes emergency vehicles, dynamically adjusting traffic signal timings to facilitate their swift passage. This not only ensures rapid response times during emergencies but also contributes to enhanced safety and potentially life- saving intervention. 1.

      "Factory Ordering a Car? These Are Wait Times We\u2019re Seeing in 2024\nFactory Ordering a Car? These Are Wait Times We\u2019re Seeing in 2024\nWhat vehicle are you interested in?\nWhat's your zip code?\nWe track new car inventory monthly, and it\u2019s been encouraging to see automakers like Ford and Toyota having more cars shipped to dealers. Still, automakers are selling every car they can make. With that said, more drivers are placing factory orders for vehicle builds that might not arrive until well into next year, or worse. Here\u2019s how long car buyers are waiting for the vehicle they want.\nImportant note: These times are strictly for factory ordered cars. Many of these models are now available on dealer lots.\nKia and Hyundai Wait Times\nHyundai Motors owns 51% of Kia, and the two Korean automakers have grown increasingly close over the past decade. Today, many of their vehicles share components, and therefore have been similarly impacted by supply chain constraints.\nThese are the factory order wait times our team of Car Coaches is hearing in 2024:\nSubaru Wait Times\nRight now, buyers placing orders for a Subaru are regularly being told that the wait time for delivery will be between one and four months, and in some cases longer. Subaru was hit hard by the chip shortage, and has yet to pull out of the slump. These are the Subaru factory wait times we\u2019re hearing today:\nToyota Factory Order Wait Times\nHow long you should expect to wait depends on the Toyota model and spec that you\u2019ve ordered. For Toyota hybrids and plug-in hybrids, wait times are much longer. For the Toyota RAV4 Prime and Prius Prime, wait times are longest.\nIn 2024, these are common Toyota factory order wait times our team is hearing:\n4Runner: 2-4 monthsGR86: 5-8 monthsCamry: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsCorolla: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsHighlander: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsPrius: 4-6 months / Prime 8+ monthsRAV4: 2-4 months / Hybrid or Prime 8+ monthsSequoia: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsSienna: 2-5 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsTacoma: 2-4 monthsTundra: 2-4 months / Hybrid 6+ monthsVenza: 2-4 months\nHonda Wait Times\nOn average, Honda factory orders placed today can expect a four month wait before delivery. For the popular, newly redesigned Civic, the wait is more likely to be six months. Honda has been hit particularly hard by the chip shortage and pandemic-related disruptions. Japanese automakers were even dealt a blow from an earthquake earlier this year.\nThese are the Honda factory order wait times we\u2019re seeing in 2024:\nAccord: ImmediateCivic: 1-2 monthsCR-V: 1-2 monthsCR-V Hybrid: 3+ monthsOdyssey: 2-4 monthsPilot: 1-2 monthsRidgeline: Immediate\nIn 2024, the Honda Prologue electric crossover will arrive. Pre-orders are expected to open soon, so keep an eye out for that if you want to be first on the list for this GM-built Honda EV. It will qualify for at least half of the new EV tax credit.\nSee which new electric vehicles qualify for the new EV tax credit\nRam and Jeep Wait Times\nFor Jeep and Ram factory orders, wait times depend on what model and trim you want. Waiting three to four months for a Ram 1500 or Jeep Grand Cherokee is a lot easier to swallow if you\u2019re getting a better deal with incentives.\nThese are the Ram truck factory wait times our team is encountering in 2024:\n1500: 1-3 months2500: 2-4 months3500: 2-4 months\nFord Factory Orders Wait Times Faring Slightly Better\nThese are the Ford factory order wait times we\u2019re seeing this year:\nBronco: 3+ monthsBronco Sport: 1-3 monthsF-150: 1-3 monthsF-250: 2-3 monthsF-350: 2-3 monthsF-450: 2-6 monthsMustang: ImmediateMustang Mach E: 1-3 months\nHybrids, Plug-In Hybrids and EVs Have the Longest Wait Times\nWe\u2019re seeing wait times for popular hybrid vehicles extending up to one year for several automakers. It\u2019s easy to forget that gas prices were over $5.00/gallon nationally just a few months ago, and that caused a massive spike in orders for more fuel-efficient vehicles.\nNot only is demand higher, but OEMs are rationing their supplies of semiconductor chips and in some cases, even batteries.\nIn a silver lining to the confusing new EV tax credit, America will soon have its first used EV tax credit. The used EV tax credit began in January 2023, but only used EVs under $25,000 will qualify (if sold by a dealer, and the buyer meets income restrictions.) Learn more about the used EV tax credit and eligibility here.\nTesla Wait Times\nTesla regularly updates wait times for the Model Y, Model 3, Model S and Model X. As of 2024, here are Tesla wait times as shared on Tesla.com. Note that there are many possible configurations that affect estimated delivery dates, so check Tesla\u2019s configurator for the most accurate estimate.\nTaking Delivery After a Long Wait? Beware of the Infamous Dirt Mountain\nAlthough Ford has somewhat improved factory order wait times in recent months, customers are still taking delivery of Broncos that had spent months waiting around at the so-called Dirt Mountain in Michigan. How could that impact those taking delivery of their beloved Ford Bronco? Field mice.\nAnytime vehicles sit idly for months at a time, there\u2019s the risk of rodents making the car their home. Before taking delivery, have all wires under the hood checked for signs of gnawing rodents. Ford even admitted in their earnings report that their number one challenge right now is quality control, and the infamous Dirt Mountain issues are certainly part of that.

      "Safety Stock Inventory: Essential Tips and Calculations\nToday, keeping the right level of safety stock is key to good inventory management and customer satisfaction. Safety stock is a buffer against supply chain uncertainty, so you can meet customer demand even when things go haywire.\nThis post will cover some tips and calculations for determining the right amount of safety stock and formulas and methods to minimize inventory costs and avoid stockouts.\n\ud83d\udcd6 Key takeaways\nWhat is Safety Stock?\nSafety stock is the buffer in your inventory management strategy that accounts for the unknowns in your supply chain. Think of safety stock as your insurance policy for when things go wrong, whether it\u2019s demand fluctuations, supplier delays, or unexpected events.\nSo, if you get your safety stock right based on actual calculations, then you can mitigate the risk of stockouts, and your supply chain will keep on running smoothly.\nBuffer Stock and Backup Inventory\nSafety stock is also known as \u201cbuffer stock\u201d or \u201cbackup inventory.\u201d Whatever the name, the purpose is the same: to provide an extra buffer to absorb demand variability without running out of stock.\nThis is particularly relevant in industries with fluctuating sales patterns, like electronics or seasonal products, where customer satisfaction is critical.\nSafety Stock and Signal Stock\nBesides buffer stock, there is also the concept of \u201csignal stock\u201d. Signal stock is a smaller amount of inventory that is an indicator of reordering more material.\nIt\u2019s a signal for replenishment and helps you avoid stockouts without having too much buffer stock.\nFor example, if you sell high-demand products with demand variability, the signal stock will be the amount of that product you will have on hand (let\u2019s say 500 pieces) to signal when to reorder. So when the inventory of that product becomes 500 pieces, it will give you a signal to start ordering or producing more of that product.\nWith safety stock, you will have better inventory management by having enough stock to fulfill orders without having too much sitting in your warehouse.\nSafety stock is a larger amount of inventory that is a buffer against unexpected events or demand changes. It\u2019s a safety net to ensure there\u2019s enough stock even if there\u2019s a production delay or unexpected demand surge.\nWhy Do You Need Safety Stock?\nYou might wonder why safety stock is essential. When you experience a stockout, you can lose sales, dissatisfy your customers, and a worse reputation for your company.\nFor example, imagine running a retail store, and suddenly, you run out of stock for a popular item just before a holiday sale because there was higher pre-holiday demand. This could mean lost revenue and frustrated customers who may choose to shop elsewhere.\nSo, even I usually look at safety stocks as a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d because companies usually use them to cover problems inside their own processes or supplier\u2019s processes. Still, until you work on process improvements, you must use stocks that will be for safety purposes.\nLet\u2019s look at why these stocks are important.\n1. You Won\u2019t Lose Sales and Revenue\nIf you run out of stock, it will hurt your business, losing your sales and revenue.\nImagine if you have a high-demand product, but because of unexpected demand spikes, your stock runs out. Customers can\u2019t find what they\u2019re looking for and will go to competitors, resulting in immediate sales drop and potential long-term loss of customer loyalty.\nSo, having enough safety stock will prevent you from these stockouts and ensure you meet the demand consistently, thus protecting your revenue.\n2. You Will Increase Customer Satisfaction\nSafety stock is key to customer satisfaction. When customers know they can count on your business to provide the products they need, even during peak demand or supply chain disruptions, their trust in your brand increases.\nFor example, if you have an online store, having safety stock means that even during a holiday rush or supply chain problem, your customers will get their orders on time. This will improve their overall shopping experience.\n3. You Will Be Prepared for the Unexpected\nThe value of safety stock is seen during unexpected events such as sudden demand surges, supplier delays, or natural disasters that affect logistics and the supply chain. Having safety stock allows you to manage and mitigate these challenges without disrupting your operations.\nFor example, if a key supplier shuts down temporarily, your safety stock acts as a buffer, giving you time to find alternative solutions without stopping production or sales. This preparedness makes your business more resilient to supply chain uncertainties.\n4. You Will Keep Operations Running\nSafety stock is a buffer that absorbs the demand and supply variability so your business can keep running smoothly. If you have safety stock, you ensure your production lines keep running, your shelves stay stocked, and your services are uninterrupted.\nThis continuity is key to meeting demand, customer satisfaction, and, ultimately, your business\u2019s resilience to unexpected challenges.\nWhat Impact On How Much Safety Stock You Need?\nTo calculate safety stock for your business, you must consider various factors such as lead time variability, customer demand variability, and desired service level.\nFor example, if you operate in a sector with high demand variability, your safety stock levels will need to be higher to accommodate potential spikes in sales. Utilizing formulas that factor in lead times, average demand, and service levels will help you find a balance that aligns with your operational goals.\nLead Time\nLead time variability refers to how consistent or unpredictable your supplier\u2019s delivery times are. If there are frequent delays or variations in lead times, you may need a higher safety stock level to compensate for these discrepancies.\nLet\u2019s take an example. If you are a company that produces shoes for sale and you purchase the sole of the shoes according to specifications, you send them to your supplier. So, you can never be sure of how long the delivery will take after you place an order. Sometimes, it will require several days, sometimes weeks.\nHowever, you have historical data, and an analysis of the last ten orders released by your sole supplier reveals that out of the ten orders, one took seven days, two took eight days, four took nine days, two took ten days, and one took eleven days. From these data, we can see that there is variability in delivery time, with a minimum value of 7 days and a maximum value of 11 days. The average lead time is 9 days.\nSo, now, we can easily calculate the probability that the order will be received in 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 days. You can get these numbers if you dive the frequency for each delivery time with the total cases, in our case, the last ten orders.\nFor example, for a 7-day lead time, we have one order, and if you dive this one order with 10 cases, then the lead time probability of seven days will be 0.1. Or, if we have 4 cases when we receive the order in nine days, the probability will be 0.4.\nDemand Rate\nThe variability in demand, however, looks at how much sales fluctuate over time. A product or service with high demand variability will require a larger safety stock to ensure you can meet customer demand during periods of high sales.\nLet\u2019s continue with our example related to shoes. The demand rate for the shoes also varies between 150 and 190 pairs per day. You can see the frequency and probability of the demand rate that you can calculate in the same way as in lead time.\nThere is a 0.2 probability of the demand rate being 150 pairs per day, a 0.2 probability of demand being either 160, 180, or 190 pairs per week, and a 0.3 probability of demand being 170.\nNow, when you have this data for both lead time and demand rate, you want to find how much stock you must produce and restock the inventory of your shoes. So, now we must create a lead times matrix using both factors that can impact safety stock calculations.\nLead Times Usage Matrix\nSimply, this matrix ensures that the safety stock is calculated for each pair of events regarding the demand and lead time.\nFor example, if the demand is 150 pairs (first raw) and the lead time is 7 days, the lead-time usage will be 7 days \u00d7 150 = 1050 pairs. Because there is a 0.1 probability of the lead time being seven days and a 0.1 probability of the demand rate being 150 pairs, the probability of both these events occurring is 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 = 0.01. So, if we always have 7 days to get repromaterials and the demand is 150 pairs per day, we will need to have 1050 pairs of safety stocks. You can also see that if the lead time is at the maximum value of 11 days and the demand is a maximum of 190 pairs daily, the safety stock should be 2090 pairs.\nNow, we know that the safety stock level must be between 1050 and 2090 pieces. If we choose 2090 pairs as safety stock, we will cover all other events, but more safety stock will increase inventory costs. If we select 1050 pairs as safety stock, if we have a case with higher lead time and actual demand, it will automatically produce lost sales.\nEconomic Order Quantity (EOQ)\nAs you can see, if you analyze and forecast demand and know the order costs per order, costs of storage and keeping of stocks, and value of the products on stock, you can easily calculate economic order quantity using the following formula.\nThe result you will get is the most economical or optimal order quantity that will have the lowest ordering costs and storage costs.\nWhat Will Be the Optimal Amount of Safety Stock Levels?\nSo, now, the question is: What will be the optimal amount of safety stock? Because of variability in both factors, we must select one optimal level of safety stock. Logically, we can keep 2090 pieces of safety stock; however, these are not optimal safety stock levels.\nThe optimal safety stock level is a safety inventory level that minimizes inventory costs and increases the rate of demand satisfaction for the company.\nSo, let\u2019s look at probabilities for different intervals of demand.\nWe can use safety stock intervals, for example, 1000-1199, 1200-1399, etc. To calculate the probability of each interval, we will need to add up the sums of all the probabilities that fall into that interval. For better presentation, in our matrix, different intervals are with different colors.\nYou can see that we have three cases for intervals of 1000-1199 pairs in safety stocks, with 0.01 probability for 1050, 0.02 for 1120, and 0.03 for 1190. If we sum these probabilities, we will get the probability of happening these events in an interval of 1000-1199, which is 0.06 (0.01+0.02+0.03). If we repeat for each interval the same process, we will get the following results:\nHowever, we need cumulative probabilities if we want to predict the likelihood of stock-out, which is the main purpose of keeping safety stocks.\nThis table will show us that if we have 1000 pairs of safety stock, there is a 100% chance that we will have stock out and will not satisfy the demand. On the other extreme, if we have 2200 pairs of safety stocks, the chance that we will experience stock out is 0%.\nNow, if the probability of a stock-out is acceptable to be less than 10%, the stocks for safety can be 2000 pairs. So, now we have much clearer information.\nDesired Service Factor\nAlso, the desired service factor is crucial in calculating the safety inventory level. This factor considers the level of service you want to provide to your customers, such as maintaining a specific fill rate or avoiding stockouts for the most important customers. The higher this factor, the larger your safety stock needs to be.\nFor example, if the customer\u2019s priority is between 1 and 5, you want to ensure you will satisfy the full demand, so you will always want to have a 100% stock standard. However, you will have customers or products with less importance, and then you can have less stock standards (image below). You can read more about this in our article about how to find customers with the right purchase intent.\nHow to Calculate Safety Stock?\nWhen it comes to calculating the right safety stock inventory level, using safety stock formulas is an easier way. These equations simply help you estimate an optimal quantity of safety inventory that aligns with your business needs.\nWith these formulas, you can ensure that your inventory levels are neither too high, leading to increased holding costs, nor too low, resulting in potential stockouts and lost sales.\nBasic Safety Stock Formula\nThe most simple and basic formula that can be used to calculate safety stock comes from our simple goal to have a secure amount of days of supplies. So, we need first to calculate how many safety days we need and multiply it with the average daily demand.\nFor example, if we have 172 pairs of shoes as the average demand and the lead time varies between 7 and 11 days, we must decide what our company safety days are. So, you don\u2019t need to take average days like, in our case, 9 days, but you need to estimate how many days you want to ensure stocks for safety purposes. This means that average lead time differs from safety days. It can help us for better estimation, but we don\u2019t need to use it in calculation.\nLet\u2019s say that we want to keep stocks for ten safety days, and in this case, we will have the following:\nSS = 172 x 10 = 1720 pairs of shoes\nStandard Deviation Safety Stock Formula\nWhen you deal with multiple uncertain variables, the standard deviation safety stock formula is more effective. This method involves calculating the standard deviation of both demand and lead time to determine the appropriate safety stock level.\nThis formula calculates safety stock by considering both the variability in demand and the variability in lead time by:\nSo, the formula is the following:\nHere, Z represents the service factor, indicating your desired level of service. This factor represents the desired service level, indicating the probability of not running out of stock during the lead time. The Z-score is derived from the standard normal distribution. You can easily calculate the Z-score for different desired service levels with Excel or Google Sheets using the NORMSINV() function (see image below).\nFor example, if you aim for a high service level and use a Z-value of 3, you are ensuring that your safety stock covers three times the standard deviation of both demand and lead time.\nLet\u2019s say that we want a 99.99% service level, and in this case, the Z-score will be 3.72. The average lead time is 9 days, and the average sales on a daily basis is 172 pairs of shoes. Using this formula, we will get the safety stock to be 753.09, or 754 pieces.\nAverage-Max Method Safety Stock Calculation\nThis formula is the easiest method that allows you to calculate safety inventory level by considering your maximum daily usage and maximum lead time, subtracting the average daily demand and lead time.\nFor example, if your maximum daily usage is 190 units and your maximum lead time is 11 days, while your average lead time is 9 days and your daily usage is 172 pairs of shoes, you can calculate your safety inventory as follows:\nSafety Stock = (190 x 11) \u2013 (172 x 9) = 2090 \u2013 1548 = 542\nThis calculation ensures that you have enough buffer stock to meet average demand. However, as you can see here, we don\u2019t have enough samples (we use 10 days), and we don\u2019t use the probability of the events regarding actual demand or demand forecasts; we only use maximum and average values. Our above calculation says that the results with this formula are something that will definitely bring stock out.\nAlso, this formula doesn\u2019t take into account the service level, which, as we already discussed, is an additional variable that must be taken into account. The probability we have in our previous calculations is based on a 100% service level that is not possible in practice.\nCommon Safety Stock Challenges\nThere are several challenges when it comes to the selection of the right amount of safety stock. However, the three most important challenges that will require your focus are the following:\nHow to Balance Stock Levels?\nOne of the primary issues related to keeping safety stock is finding the right balance between holding too much and too little inventory for safety purposes.\nExcessive safety stock can lead to high carrying costs and tie-up capital that could be used elsewhere in your business. On the other hand, insufficient safety stock increases the risk of stockouts, which can lead to lost sales and dissatisfied customers.\nSo, you must ensure that you find the right balance between both larger and smaller amounts of stocks for safety. If you want to implement zero inventory or a just-in-time inventory model, then you will decrease the need to keep stocks on inventory over time. However, these models will require working on improvements and decreasing variability in factors that impact the safety stock that we talk about here.\nHow to Incorporate Strategic Safety Stock Planning?\nWhen developing your safety stock strategies, you must consider several factors that can impact your inventory levels covered above.\nYou can analyze your historical sales data and your supplier performance so you can have an accurate forecast of future demand and adjust your safety stock accordingly.\nFor example, suppose you operate in an industry with seasonal demand, such as fashion. In that case, you should increase your safety stock ahead of the peak season to accommodate the expected surge in customer demand. Implementing a strong forecasting model can help you maintain optimal safety stock levels while minimizing costs.\nWhat About The Risks of Setting Safety Stock to Zero?\nWhile setting your safety stock to zero might seem like an attractive solution to reduce excess inventory and costs while leaving your business processes open to discover areas for improvement, it can still bring the risks associated with not having a buffer to handle fluctuations in demand or supplier delays.\nWithout safety stock, you leave your supply chain vulnerable to disruptions. If there is a little supply chain failure on the supply side of the chain, you will have problems satisfying the demand fluctuations.\nTo manage this challenge, consider adopting a flexible safety stock policy that allows for adjustments based on real-time data using inventory management software and changing market conditions. This approach will ensure you have enough buffer stock to manage uncertainties without overcommitting resources.\nInventory Management Software for Safety Stock\nToday, available technology, in large part, can help you manage inventory, conduct accurate forecasts, or even make predictions across the whole supply chain, etc. So, inventory management software can help you to optimize the level of your safety stock, ensuring you maintain the right balance between too much and too little inventory.\nFor example, imagine managing a retail business with fluctuating seasonal demand. With inventory management software, you can set parameters that automatically adjust your safety stock levels based on expected demand spikes during high-demand level seasons. Such a proactive approach ensures you have enough inventory to meet customer demand without overstocking.\nAdditionally, inventory management software allows you to monitor your net inventory effectively. This is the stock on hand minus any backorders, giving you a real-time view of your inventory levels. If you succeed in keeping this figure above the reorder point, you can prevent running out of stock and maintain seamless operations. For example, if your reorder point is 500 units, the software can alert you when your net inventory approaches this threshold, prompting timely reordering and avoiding potential stockouts.\n Related Posts \n\nThe Complete Guide to Incoterms Explained: Understanding International Commercial Terms\n\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio: Increase Your Business Efficiency\n\n\nStreamlining Your Business with The Right Storage Solutions\n\n\nRunning a Commercial Fleet?

Utilizing formulas that factor in lead times, average demand, and service levels will help you find a balance that aligns with your operational goals.\nLead Time\nLead time variability refers to how consistent or unpredictable your supplier\u2019s delivery times are. If there are frequent delays or variations in lead times, you may need a higher safety stock level to compensate for these discrepancies.\nLet\u2019s take an example. If you are a company that produces shoes for sale and you purchase the sole of the shoes according to specifications, you send them to your supplier. So, you can never be sure of how long the delivery will take after you place an order. Sometimes, it will require several days, sometimes weeks.\nHowever, you have historical data, and an analysis of the last ten orders released by your sole supplier reveals that out of the ten orders, one took seven days, two took eight days, four took nine days, two took ten days, and one took eleven days. From these data, we can see that there is variability in delivery time, with a minimum value of 7 days and a maximum value of 11 days. The average lead time is 9 days.\nSo, now, we can easily calculate the probability that the order will be received in 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 days. You can get these numbers if you dive the frequency for each delivery time with the total cases, in our case, the last ten orders.\nFor example, for a 7-day lead time, we have one order, and if you dive this one order with 10 cases, then the lead time probability of seven days will be 0.1. Or, if we have 4 cases when we receive the order in nine days, the probability will be 0.4.\nDemand Rate\nThe variability in demand, however, looks at how much sales fluctuate over time. A product or service with high demand variability will require a larger safety stock to ensure you can meet customer demand during periods of high sales.\nLet\u2019s continue with our example related to shoes. The demand rate for the shoes also varies between 150 and 190 pairs per day. You can see the frequency and probability of the demand rate that you can calculate in the same way as in lead time.\nThere is a 0.2 probability of the demand rate being 150 pairs per day, a 0.2 probability of demand being either 160, 180, or 190 pairs per week, and a 0.3 probability of demand being 170.\nNow, when you have this data for both lead time and demand rate, you want to find how much stock you must produce and restock the inventory of your shoes. So, now we must create a lead times matrix using both factors that can impact safety stock calculations.\nLead Times Usage Matrix\nSimply, this matrix ensures that the safety stock is calculated for each pair of events regarding the demand and lead time.\nFor example, if the demand is 150 pairs (first raw) and the lead time is 7 days, the lead-time usage will be 7 days \u00d7 150 = 1050 pairs. Because there is a 0.1 probability of the lead time being seven days and a 0.1 probability of the demand rate being 150 pairs, the probability of both these events occurring is 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 = 0.01. So, if we always have 7 days to get repromaterials and the demand is 150 pairs per day, we will need to have 1050 pairs of safety stocks. You can also see that if the lead time is at the maximum value of 11 days and the demand is a maximum of 190 pairs daily, the safety stock should be 2090 pairs.\nNow, we know that the safety stock level must be between 1050 and 2090 pieces. If we choose 2090 pairs as safety stock, we will cover all other events, but more safety stock will increase inventory costs. If we select 1050 pairs as safety stock, if we have a case with higher lead time and actual demand, it will automatically produce lost sales.\nEconomic Order Quantity (EOQ)\nAs you can see, if you analyze and forecast demand and know the order costs per order, costs of storage and keeping of stocks, and value of the products on stock, you can easily calculate economic order quantity using the following formula.\nThe result you will get is the most economical or optimal order quantity that will have the lowest ordering costs and storage costs.\nWhat Will Be the Optimal Amount of Safety Stock Levels?\nSo, now, the question is: What will be the optimal amount of safety stock? Because of variability in both factors, we must select one optimal level of safety stock. Logically, we can keep 2090 pieces of safety stock; however, these are not optimal safety stock levels.\nThe optimal safety stock level is a safety inventory level that minimizes inventory costs and increases the rate of demand satisfaction for the company.\nSo, let\u2019s look at probabilities for different intervals of demand.\nWe can use safety stock intervals, for example, 1000-1199, 1200-1399, etc. To calculate the probability of each interval, we will need to add up the sums of all the probabilities that fall into that interval. For better presentation, in our matrix, different intervals are with different colors.\nYou can see that we have three cases for intervals of 1000-1199 pairs in safety stocks, with 0.01 probability for 1050, 0.02 for 1120, and 0.03 for 1190. If we sum these probabilities, we will get the probability of happening these events in an interval of 1000-1199, which is 0.06 (0.01+0.02+0.03). If we repeat for each interval the same process, we will get the following results:\nHowever, we need cumulative probabilities if we want to predict the likelihood of stock-out, which is the main purpose of keeping safety stocks.\nThis table will show us that if we have 1000 pairs of safety stock, there is a 100% chance that we will have stock out and will not satisfy the demand. On the other extreme, if we have 2200 pairs of safety stocks, the chance that we will experience stock out is 0%.\nNow, if the probability of a stock-out is acceptable to be less than 10%, the stocks for safety can be 2000 pairs. So, now we have much clearer information.\nDesired Service Factor\nAlso, the desired service factor is crucial in calculating the safety inventory level. This factor considers the level of service you want to provide to your customers, such as maintaining a specific fill rate or avoiding stockouts for the most important customers. The higher this factor, the larger your safety stock needs to be.\nFor example, if the customer\u2019s priority is between 1 and 5, you want to ensure you will satisfy the full demand, so you will always want to have a 100% stock standard. However, you will have customers or products with less importance, and then you can have less stock standards (image below). You can read more about this in our article about how to find customers with the right purchase intent.\nHow to Calculate Safety Stock?\nWhen it comes to calculating the right safety stock inventory level, using safety stock formulas is an easier way. These equations simply help you estimate an optimal quantity of safety inventory that aligns with your business needs.\nWith these formulas, you can ensure that your inventory levels are neither too high, leading to increased holding costs, nor too low, resulting in potential stockouts and lost sales.\nBasic Safety Stock Formula\nThe most simple and basic formula that can be used to calculate safety stock comes from our simple goal to have a secure amount of days of supplies. So, we need first to calculate how many safety days we need and multiply it with the average daily demand.\nFor example, if we have 172 pairs of shoes as the average demand and the lead time varies between 7 and 11 days, we must decide what our company safety days are. So, you don\u2019t need to take average days like, in our case, 9 days, but you need to estimate how many days you want to ensure stocks for safety purposes. This means that average lead time differs from safety days. It can help us for better estimation, but we don\u2019t need to use it in calculation.\nLet\u2019s say that we want to keep stocks for ten safety days, and in this case, we will have the following:\nSS = 172 x 10 = 1720 pairs of shoes\nStandard Deviation Safety Stock Formula\nWhen you deal with multiple uncertain variables, the standard deviation safety stock formula is more effective. This method involves calculating the standard deviation of both demand and lead time to determine the appropriate safety stock level.\nThis formula calculates safety stock by considering both the variability in demand and the variability in lead time by:\nSo, the formula is the following:\nHere, Z represents the service factor, indicating your desired level of service. This factor represents the desired service level, indicating the probability of not running out of stock during the lead time. The Z-score is derived from the standard normal distribution. You can easily calculate the Z-score for different desired service levels with Excel or Google Sheets using the NORMSINV() function (see image below).\nFor example, if you aim for a high service level and use a Z-value of 3, you are ensuring that your safety stock covers three times the standard deviation of both demand and lead time.\nLet\u2019s say that we want a 99.99% service level, and in this case, the Z-score will be 3.72. The average lead time is 9 days, and the average sales on a daily basis is 172 pairs of shoes. Using this formula, we will get the safety stock to be 753.09, or 754 pieces.\nAverage-Max Method Safety Stock Calculation\nThis formula is the easiest method that allows you to calculate safety inventory level by considering your maximum daily usage and maximum lead time, subtracting the average daily demand and lead time.\nFor example, if your maximum daily usage is 190 units and your maximum lead time is 11 days, while your average lead time is 9 days and your daily usage is 172 pairs of shoes, you can calculate your safety inventory as follows:\nSafety Stock = (190 x 11) \u2013 (172 x 9) = 2090 \u2013 1548 = 542\nThis calculation ensures that you have enough buffer stock to meet average demand. However, as you can see here, we don\u2019t have enough samples (we use 10 days), and we don\u2019t use the probability of the events regarding actual demand or demand forecasts; we only use maximum and average values. Our above calculation says that the results with this formula are something that will definitely bring stock out.\nAlso, this formula doesn\u2019t take into account the service level, which, as we already discussed, is an additional variable that must be taken into account. The probability we have in our previous calculations is based on a 100% service level that is not possible in practice.\nCommon Safety Stock Challenges\nThere are several challenges when it comes to the selection of the right amount of safety stock. However, the three most important challenges that will require your focus are the following:\nHow to Balance Stock Levels?\nOne of the primary issues related to keeping safety stock is finding the right balance between holding too much and too little inventory for safety purposes.\nExcessive safety stock can lead to high carrying costs and tie-up capital that could be used elsewhere in your business. On the other hand, insufficient safety stock increases the risk of stockouts, which can lead to lost sales and dissatisfied customers.\nSo, you must ensure that you find the right balance between both larger and smaller amounts of stocks for safety. If you want to implement zero inventory or a just-in-time inventory model, then you will decrease the need to keep stocks on inventory over time. However, these models will require working on improvements and decreasing variability in factors that impact the safety stock that we talk about here.\nHow to Incorporate Strategic Safety Stock Planning?\nWhen developing your safety stock strategies, you must consider several factors that can impact your inventory levels covered above.\nYou can analyze your historical sales data and your supplier performance so you can have an accurate forecast of future demand and adjust your safety stock accordingly.\nFor example, suppose you operate in an industry with seasonal demand, such as fashion. In that case, you should increase your safety stock ahead of the peak season to accommodate the expected surge in customer demand. Implementing a strong forecasting model can help you maintain optimal safety stock levels while minimizing costs.\nWhat About The Risks of Setting Safety Stock to Zero?\nWhile setting your safety stock to zero might seem like an attractive solution to reduce excess inventory and costs while leaving your business processes open to discover areas for improvement, it can still bring the risks associated with not having a buffer to handle fluctuations in demand or supplier delays.\nWithout safety stock, you leave your supply chain vulnerable to disruptions. If there is a little supply chain failure on the supply side of the chain, you will have problems satisfying the demand fluctuations.\nTo manage this challenge, consider adopting a flexible safety stock policy that allows for adjustments based on real-time data using inventory management software and changing market conditions. This approach will ensure you have enough buffer stock to manage uncertainties without overcommitting resources.\nInventory Management Software for Safety Stock\nToday, available technology, in large part, can help you manage inventory, conduct accurate forecasts, or even make predictions across the whole supply chain, etc. So, inventory management software can help you to optimize the level of your safety stock, ensuring you maintain the right balance between too much and too little inventory.\nFor example, imagine managing a retail business with fluctuating seasonal demand. With inventory management software, you can set parameters that automatically adjust your safety stock levels based on expected demand spikes during high-demand level seasons. Such a proactive approach ensures you have enough inventory to meet customer demand without overstocking.\nAdditionally, inventory management software allows you to monitor your net inventory effectively. This is the stock on hand minus any backorders, giving you a real-time view of your inventory levels. If you succeed in keeping this figure above the reorder point, you can prevent running out of stock and maintain seamless operations. For example, if your reorder point is 500 units, the software can alert you when your net inventory approaches this threshold, prompting timely reordering and avoiding potential stockouts.\n Related Posts \n\nThe Complete Guide to Incoterms Explained: Understanding International Commercial Terms\n\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio: Increase Your Business Efficiency\n\n\nStreamlining Your Business with The Right Storage Solutions\n\n\nRunning a Commercial Fleet?

The widely followed index finally hit a record high after two years in January, as momentum from late 2023 continued into the new year.\nEnthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI) continued to boost technology stocks, in particular semiconductor companies. However, unlike last year, the rally broadened out to the more cyclical areas of the market.\nThe strongest sectors included communication services, industrials, materials, energy, and financials. The broadening, driven by strong economic data, resilient corporate earnings, and expectations for rate cuts propelled the S&P 500 to new record highs 22 times during the quarter.\nMoss Adams Wealth Advisors Market View\nHere are our key takeaways on the economy and markets:\nRate Cut Expectations and the Fed\nOptimism was high heading into the new year with inflation having made significant progress toward the Fed\u2019s target in 2023. Heading into Q1, the bond market was pricing in a total of five interest rate cuts this year, with the first expected to be in March.\nHowever, the economy was stronger than expected, which is good news, but inflation turned out to be stickier than expected, which was not good news. This means Fed rate cuts have been pushed out to at least June 2024, with the market now pricing in just three rate cuts at best for 2024.\nStill, in our view, the number of rate cuts isn\u2019t as important as the fact that the Fed is able and willing to cut rates if needed or when they see more progress on inflation.\nAt the Fed\u2019s March open market meeting, the committee left rates unchanged as was expected and upgraded its economic outlook. The statement reiterated the Fed needs greater confidence that inflation is returning to target before easing.\nThe highly watched dot plot continued to show the majority of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members expecting as many as three rate cuts in 2024; however, the number of expected rate cuts in 2025 was reduced from four to three, highlighting that policy easing is likely to be gradual.\nInvestors quickly adjusted to the idea of fewer rate cuts and longer-term interest rates moved higher, causing fixed rate bonds to decline in price. Even with the uptick in interest rates, equities charged higher setting multiple new highs, underscoring the strength in the economy and attractive fundamentals for corporate earnings.\nWith market expectations and Fed messaging now looking aligned for rate cut expectations, it will take a significant change in the economic outlook, particularly inflation trends, to significantly move rates meaningfully one way or the other in the near term.\nFixed Income\nInterest-rate volatility increased in Q1 as strong economic data, stubborn inflation, and reduced rate-cut expectations pushed yields higher, stalling the bond rally seen in late 2023.\nFor the longer term, we expect bonds to resume their rally as inflation and rates decline later this year, albeit at a much slower rate. Within the credit segment, we continue to favor high quality bonds.\nInflation\nHeadline inflation has declined significantly since mid-2022.\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index,\u00a0which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, fell from a peak of 7.1% year-over-year growth in June 2022, to just 2.4% as of February 2024, putting it very near the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\nWhile progress in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which has some methodological differences from PCE, has been dramatic, moving from 8.9% at the peak to 3.2% year-over-year as of February, improvements for this indicator have stalled. The CPI has stubbornly hovered around 3.2% since October, sparking concern that it won\u2019t have further meaningful decline.\nWe believe there were seasonal factors elevating the CPI readings in Q1 and the disinflationary forces we saw in 2023 are still intact.\nCore goods prices trended lower in 2023, as supply chain distortions related to the pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine continued to fade.\nEven with the recent conflict in the Middle East, supply chains are still in good shape, and goods prices should remain well behaved. Within the more volatile components, energy prices have risen in recent months while food prices continue to ease.\nOverall, the disinflationary trend established in 2023 should continue into 2024. While the ride down may take slightly longer than anticipated, the Fed should feel reasonably confident that inflation can fall to close to their 2% target later this year.\nA Soft Landing Is Our Base Case\nOur base case is that inflation will return to normal in 2024, even as real gross domestic product (GDP) growth remains positive.\nOver the past year, inflation has fallen significantly, even as real GDP growth has accelerated, defying predictions that an economic slump or recession would be needed to resolve entrenched inflation.\nThe most recent measure of real GDP quarter-over-quarter of 3.4% was higher than the long-term average of 3.19%, so quite strong even as inflation trends improved.\nWhile the lagged effects of higher for longer interest rates will likely slow GDP growth in 2024, we believe the trend will continue to be positive\u2014meaning no recession\u2014as inflation recedes toward the 2% target.\nEmployment\nWhile the labor market has normalized from its post-pandemic boom, the US economy still added 250,000 jobs per month in 2023 and sustained this pace into early 2024.\nThe unemployment rate has remained at or below 4% since December 2022\u2014the longest streak of low unemployment since the late 1960s.\nDespite fears of an economic slowdown, strong growth in the US labor supply has allowed employers to steadily hire workers and narrow the gap between supply and demand.\nAfter falling sharply during the pandemic, labor supply in the US staged an impressive recovery over the last two years, largely due to increased immigration.\nLabor market resiliency is key to our soft-landing narrative.\nLooking Forward\nA positive January for US stocks is typically a prelude to a positive year, with that correlation holding true 80% of the time since 1928.\nIn our view, 2024 looks set to be another year of economic expansion supported by:\nTailwinds from federal government initiatives supporting infrastructure spending. We believe the historical signal of a strong start, combined with what\u2019s likely to be peak interest rates, economic expansion, and positive earnings guidance, bodes well for risk assets for the balance of 2024.\nPotential Opportunities\nCash has built up in money market funds over the past two years as the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates to the most attractive levels in over a decade. With central banks around the world indicating their intention to cut rates, there\u2019s an opportunity cost to holding too much cash. Money intended for the long term should be invested in longer-duration assets.\nEconomies around the world continue to grow as inflation wanes and secular tailwinds should continue to support long-term assets such as stocks and bonds.\nThe potential for AI, both for the companies who produce the infrastructure as well as for the companies who will benefit from its potential productivity enhancements is expected to be wide ranging.\nWe believe the market rally can broaden beyond technology as more sectors adopt AI, and as market confidence is buoyed by recent Fed messaging and falling inflation. Some portions of the market are richly valued versus history, so diversification is key.\nIn addition to publicly traded assets, private investment opportunities can provide diversification through different and less correlated sources of return, while lowering overall volatility of a portfolio.\u00a0 We see opportunities in private equity, credit, and real assets.\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to predict what will happen to markets in the short term, markets have historically done well following a peak in inflation, the conclusion of a Fed tightening cycle, and a trough in consumer confidence.\nWe\u2019re constructive on both stocks and bonds as the economy normalizes and deflationary tailwinds continue.\nWe\u2019re Here to Help\nFor more information about the economic landscape and what it means for investors, contact your Moss Adams professional.\n\n                                Moss Adams Private Client services may include investment advisory services provided by Moss Adams Wealth Advisors LLC, an SEC-registered investment adviser, and/or accounting, tax, and related services provided by Moss Adams LLP.

      "The State of Fashion 2024 report | McKinsey\nSkip to main content\nThe State of Fashion 2024: Finding pockets of growth as uncertainty reigns\n==============================================================================\nNovember 29, 2023 | Report\nFashion companies will face economic headwinds, technology shifts, and an evolving competitive landscape in 2024. However, shifting consumer priorities will continue to offer opportunities.\n\nThe State of Fashion 2024\n(128 pages)\nStorm clouds are gathering, but the experience of recent years shows how the fashion industry may ride out the challenges ahead. In 2022, the industry again showed its resilience, almost equaling the record economic profit of 2021, the McKinsey Global Fashion Index shows. Echoing the pattern of the previous year, the luxury sector outperformed, with a 36 percent rise in economic profit that offset weakness in other segments. Yet even the non-luxury sector was ahead of its long-term average. Strong margin performance meant the industry in 2022 achieved more than double the economic profit than in all years between 2011 and 2020, except for one.\nIn 2023, the industry faced challenges that were both persistent and deepening. On a regional basis, Europe and the United States saw slow growth throughout the year, while China\u2019s initially strong performance faded in the second half. Though the luxury segment initially fared well, it too began to feel the effects of weaker demand in the latter part of the year, leading to slowing sales and uneven performance.\nAbout the authors\n\nThis article is a collaborative effort by Imran Amed, representing views of Business of Fashion, and Anita Balchandani, David Barrelet, Achim Berg, Gemma D\u2019Auria, Felix R\u00f6lkens, and Ewa Starzynska, representing views from McKinsey\u2019s Retail Practice.\nLooking toward 2024, the most prominent sentiment among fashion industry leaders is uncertainty, reflecting the prospect of subdued economic growth, persistent inflation, and weak consumer confidence. Against this backdrop, businesses will be challenged to identify pockets of value and unlock new drivers of performance.\nAccording to McKinsey\u2019s analysis of fashion forecasts, the global industry will post top-line growth of 2 to 4 percent in 2024 (exhibit), with regional and country-level variations. Once again, the luxury segment is expected to generate the biggest share of economic profit. However, even there, companies will be challenged by the tough economic environment. The segment is forecast to grow globally by 3 to 5 percent, compared with 5 to 7 percent in 2023, as consumers rein in spending after a postpandemic surge. European and Chinese growth is set to slow, while US growth is expected to pick up after a relatively weak 2023, reflecting the slightly more optimistic outlook there.\n\nBeyond luxury, growth of 2 to 4 percent is predicted for the year ahead, in line with the probable outcome in 2023. The European market will likely expand by just 1 to 3 percent, compared with 5 percent in the first half of 2023 and 1 to 3 percent in the second half. Slumping consumer confidence and declining household savings are expected to be the most probable causes of restrained spending. In the United States, nonluxury sector growth of 0 to 2 percent is forecast. And China is expected to be similarly challenged amid 4 to 6 percent growth, which is a slight uptick from the end of 2023 but slow when considered on a historical basis.\nThese are just some of the findings from The State of Fashion 2024, published by the Business of Fashion (BoF) and McKinsey. The eighth report in the annual series discusses the major themes shaping the fashion economy and assesses the industry\u2019s potential responses. Reflecting in-depth research and many conversations with industry leaders, it reveals the key trends that could shape the fashion landscape in the year ahead.\n\n\nExplore COP29 with McKinsey\nJoin our series of dynamic virtual events during COP29. Discover new research, practical strategies, and collaborations across sectors to move climate action beyond why to how.\nRegister\nUncertainty in the face of headwinds\nWith conflicts in Europe and the Middle East and strained international relations elsewhere, geopolitics is the number-one concern for fashion industry executives going into 2024, followed by economic volatility and inflation. Some 62 percent of executives in this year\u2019s survey, conducted in September, cite geopolitical instability as the top risk to growth. Economic volatility is cited by 55 percent and inflation is mentioned by 51 percent (compared with 78 percent last year). The global average headline rate of inflation is predicted to moderate to 5.8 percent\u2014still high on a historical basis\u2014from 6.9 percent in 2023.1_World economic outlook update: Near-term resilience, persistent challenges_, International Monetary Fund, July 2023.\nAgainst a challenging economic backdrop, executive views of the industry\u2019s prospects are more divided than in any year since the launch of the BoF\u2013McKinsey Executive Survey in 2017. While 26 percent of survey respondents say they expect conditions to improve year on year, 37 percent see them remaining the same and 38 percent think they will worsen.\nUncertainty within the industry reflects the broader economic situation, albeit with regional divergence. Going into 2024, pressure on household incomes is expected to dampen demand for apparel and prompt trading down across categories. Still, there are geographic outliers that may offer comfort. One is India, where consumer confidence hit a four-year high in September 2023.2\u201cConsumer confidence survey,\u201d Reserve Bank of India, October 6, 2023. India-based executives are more optimistic than those in Western countries, with 85 percent of respondents to McKinsey\u2019s Global Economics Intelligence survey\u00a0saying that conditions have improved in the past six months.3Ryosuke Hanada, \u201cIndia\u2019s consumer sentiment rebounds past pre-COVID levels,\u201d Nikkei Asia, July 18, 2023. China\u2019s economy is facing challenges, but the country\u2019s consumers show a higher intent to shop for fashion in 2024 than consumers in both the United States and Europe.\nTen themes for 2024\nTo prepare for challenges and be alert to opportunities, leading fashion companies will likely prioritize contingency planning for the coming year. A key theme will be companies keeping a firm grip on costs and inventories while driving growth by precisely managing prices. Brands and suppliers can expect an increasingly competitive environment. But they will also have opportunities, with consumers discovering new styles, tastes, and priorities\u2014all presenting routes to value creation. As previously done, this year\u2019s report highlights ten emerging themes that will be high on leadership agendas.\n\n\nGlobal economy:\n\nFragmented future. In 2024, the global economic outlook will continue to be unsettled, as financial, geopolitical, and other challenges weigh on consumer confidence. Fashion markets in China, Europe, and the United States will likely face headwinds, some of which reflect individual regional dynamics. Suppliers, brands, and retailers may need to bolster contingency planning and manage for uncertainty.\nClimate urgency. The frequency and intensity of extreme weather-related events in 2023 mean the climate crisis is an even more urgent priority than in previous years. With physical and transition risks rising across continents, the industry must not delay in tackling emissions and building resilience into supply chains.\n\nConsumer shifts:\n\n\nVacation mode. Consumers are gearing up for the biggest year of travel since before the pandemic. But a shift in values means expectations are evolving, even as shopping remains a priority. Brands and retailers should refresh distribution and category strategies to reflect the new reality.\n\nThe new face of influence. It\u2019s time for brand marketers to update their influencer playbooks, as a new guard of creative personalities wins fans. Working with opinion leaders in 2024 will require a different type of partnership, an emphasis on video, and a willingness to loosen the reins on creative control.\nOutdoors reinvented. Technical outdoor clothing and \u201cgorpcore\u201d are in demand as consumers embrace healthier lifestyles. In 2024, more outdoor brands are expected to launch lifestyle collections. At the same time, lifestyle brands will likely embed technical elements into collections, blurring the lines between functionality and style.\n\nFashion system:\n\n\nGenerative AI\u2019s creative crossroads. After generative AI\u2019s (gen AI) breakout year in 2023, more use cases are emerging across the industry. Capturing value will require fashion players to look beyond automation and explore gen AI\u2019s potential to enhance the work of human creatives.\n\nFast fashion\u2019s power play. Fast-fashion competition is set to be fiercer than ever. Challengers, led by Shein and Temu, are bringing new tactics on price, customer experience, and speed. Success for disruptors and incumbents could hinge on adapting to new consumer preferences while navigating the regulatory agenda.\nAll eyes on brand. Brand marketing is expected to be back in the spotlight as the fashion industry manages a switch away from performance marketing. Brands may benefit from forging emotional connections with consumers as marketers rewrite playbooks to emphasise long-term brand building.\nSustainability rules. The era of fashion industry self-regulation is drawing to a close. Across jurisdictions, new rules will have significant effects on both consumers and fashion players. Brands and manufacturers may consider revamping business models to align with the changes ahead.\nBullwhip snaps back. Shifts in consumer demand have created a \u201cbullwhip effect,\u201d by which order volatility reverberates unpredictably through supply chains. Suppliers will likely face pressure as brands and retailers focus on transparency and strategic partnerships.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead\nAs the industry continues to be challenged by geopolitical and economic headwinds, fashion leaders in 2024 will look to strike a careful balance between managing uncertainty and seizing opportunities. With cost-saving tactics mostly exhausted, companies may focus on growing sales, underpinned by new pricing and promotion strategies. Across the industry, net intent to raise prices is more than 50 percent, according to the BoF\u2013McKinsey Executive Survey. At the same time, reduced cost pressures could provide a potential boost to performance.\nAs climate change brings increasingly extreme weather events and global temperatures rise, the coming year is likely to mark a heightened industry focus on environmental, social, and governance issues. Our survey shows that the topic is seen as both the number-one priority and number-one challenge for industry executives. The most successful companies will find a balance between sustainability initiatives, risk management, and commercial imperatives.\nIn an uncertain world, consumer discretionary spend will be weighted toward trusted categories and brands. Hard luxury goods\u2014jewelry, watches, and leather\u2014will likely be in demand, reflecting their potential investment value in tough economic times. Consumers are expected to travel more and continue spending more time outdoors. And they prefer emotional connections and authenticity over celebrity endorsements.\nAll told, executives are bracing for a strategically complex year ahead. To counter uncertainty, leading companies will prepare for a range of outcomes. The most successful will become more resilient, better equipped to manage the challenges, and ready to accelerate when the storm clouds begin to clear.\nAnita Balchandani is a senior partner in McKinsey\u2019s London office, where Ewa Starzynska is a consultant; David Barrelet is an associate partner in the Munich office; Achim Berg is a senior partner in the Frankfurt office; Gemma D\u2019Auria is a senior partner in the Milan office; and Felix R\u00f6lkens is a partner in the Berlin office.

      "US Gas Price Map Shows States Where Costs Falling Fastest\nGas prices are falling across the U.S.\u2014but some states are faring better than others.\nAccording to the American Automobile Association (AAA), as of Thursday, the national average for gas prices is $3.242 per gallon. This represents a decrease from last month's average of $3.443 per gallon for regular gas and an even larger drop from September of last year, when prices were at $3.836 per gallon. Data from GasBuddy also shows that a decline in prices has been consistent for the past six weeks.\nThis downward trend in gas prices will provide some relief to motorists, who have been facing higher than usual fuel costs in recent years, with averages in some states exceeding $5 per gallon in 2022.\nMore From Newsweek Vault: Earn up to 5% Cash Back With a Gas Credit Card\nThe nationwide average for a gallon of regular fuel is expected to fall under $3 as early as October, for the first time in three years. The last time gas prices were recorded below a $3 average was in April 2021.\nWhere Are Gas Costs Falling Fastest?\nFrom September 2023 to Sept. 13, 2024, gas prices have fallen most significantly in Western states, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA).\nThere are two states in which gas prices have fallen by more than a dollar. In Arizona, where the biggest drop has been recorded, gas prices have fallen by $1.073. Last September, a gallon would have set you back $4.490 - but now it costs $3.417.\nMore From Newsweek Vault: Online Banks vs. Traditional Banks: Learn the Differences\nIn Oregon, a gallon of regular fuel is almost a dollar cheaper now than it was at this time in 2023, down to $3.755 from $4.715 - a difference of 97 cents. Neighboring Washington has had similar luck, with prices falling by 91 cents from $5.061 to $4.151.\nBucking the trend of fast dropping prices being concentrated in the Western states, Oklahomans are also paying nearly a dollar less for fuel now. A drop of 95 cents has been recorded there - the third-largest decline in the country. Minnesota has also seen a dramatic decline, of 93 cents.\nMore From Newsweek Vault: Learn About the Best High-Yield Checking Accounts\nOutside of the contiguous U.S., in Alaska gas costs have dropped from $4.597 to $3.722 - 87 cents from September to September.\n\"There are an ever-increasing number of states east of the Rockies that have some retail gas locations selling regular for under $3 a gallon, so drivers will have more in their wallets with autumn approaching,\" said Andrew Gross, an AAA spokesperson. \"Should the national average fall below $3, it will be the first time since May 2021.\"\nWhile the trend for declining prices has been observed in every U.S. state, some haven't seen such significant drops. The lowest recorded fall is in Hawaii, where gas is only 16 cents cheaper now than it was in September 2023.\nComparatively slow declines have also been reported in Michigan, dropping from $3.634 to $3.276 - just 36 cents less expensive than a year ago. Other Eastern states haven't seen gas prices drop by nearly as much as in the West, with drops ranging between 40 cents to 66 cents across the region.\nfairness meter\nfairness meter\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter. \nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter. \n\nTop stories\n\nTrump Is Picking the 'Avenger Squad' for Cabinet, Charlie Kirk Says\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nTrump Allies React to Biden Allowing Ukraine to Hit Russia With US ATACMS\n\nTrump Picks FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr To Lead the Agency\nAbout the writer\nAliss Higham is a Newsweek reporter based in Glasgow, Scotland.

With the demand for transported goods and materials only increasing, trucking organizations are consistently tasked with making deliveries nationwide on tighter deadlines and against a growing number of competitors, which puts a strain on organizations focused on operating safely and responsibly.\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the transportation and logistics sector, and its effects still reverberate today. The increased pressure on daily operations requires more commercial vehicles and drivers \u2014 despite shortages in both \u2014 and, while many fleets have reallocated vehicles, maintaining daily operations remains challenging. Rising costs threaten companies' bottom lines, and the ever-increasing adoption of technology opens organizations up to a host of unknown risk factors during this time of innovation in the industry.\nThe opportunities for growth paired with the industry's evolving concerns create an unprecedented landscape that trucking organizations have to navigate. Planning for the future can seem like a balancing act. But, one way for organizations to prepare is to fully understand the industry's current and future challenges and, more specifically, how these challenges will impact their businesses.\nIn this market outlook, we will explore the current state of the transportation industry, identify some emerging opportunities and challenges, and provide insights into proven risk mitigation strategies.\nCurrent and future industry challenges\nReducing fleet management costs is crucial for trucking organizations going forward. With rising fuel and equipment costs, employee salaries, and claims and litigation costs, organizations need to ensure that each aspect of their business is functioning as efficiently as possible. As suppliers and banks grow more risk-averse, running fleets cost-effectively means prioritizing safety measures to minimize accidents and decrease risk exposure.\n\nSafety awareness, training, and reinforcement are vital at every level of an organization. Best-in-class trucking operations continuously focus on overall safety, specifically while operating trucks on the road. Road conditions, weather, driver shortages, and just-in-time delivery requirements all impact the business, but safely operating the vehicle should be a trucking organization's prime directive.\nInsurance and claims can be among the top costs for a trucking company. The best way to reduce these costs is to have fewer or, ideally, no claims, which stems directly from safety on the road. Recent innovations and investments in the operation procedures, such as electronic logs, drive cams, and collision avoidance technology, have created awareness of driver behavior and management. Additionally, cloud-based systems provide real-time operational insights, thereby streamlining fleet management and saving time and money. These improvements enable fleets to be run more efficiently and proactively, ensuring a more cost-effective approach to fleet management.\nIn recent years, the transportation industry has become a target defendant for the plaintiff's bar, which has stemmed from a growing trend of rising verdict damages and a number of six- and seven-figure settlements, thus raising the alarm from a risk and claims management standpoint. In addition, the transportation industry has been facing increased scrutiny, which results in targeted litigation due to the high requirement of insurance limits and the lack of adequate tort reform.\nImmediately following an incident, organizations are responsible for mobilizing internal and external stakeholders to relay information to key decision-makers as it becomes available in real time. Getting boots on the ground as quickly as possible will help maintain the integrity of the evidence and the investigation as well as the confidentiality of information to protect business reputation.\nEvery investigation requires the appropriate experts in place to preserve evidence and protect information. Investing in the right multidisciplinary team, which would include experienced claims professionals, lawyers who understand the context of similar claims, independent adjusters, and public relations representatives, can prove the difference between resolution and a drawn-out, far more expensive settlement. But the best defense against litigation is the prompt and accurate handling of claims by experienced industry professionals.\nThe American Trucking Association recently predicted that the truck driver shortage could potentially reach 160,000 drivers by 2030. The industry also needs to recruit nearly 1 million new drivers over the next decade to compensate for an aging and retiring workforce, combat voluntary and involuntary quitting, and support industry development.\nThe average age of truck drivers is 46, with much of the driver population set to retire soon and not enough young certified drivers to replace this group. Attracting young and/or highly trained personnel is an ongoing challenge for several industries, including transportation, but a lack of skilled drivers threatens the nationwide economy's infrastructure and organization, as well as the ability of industries to grow. Inexperienced drivers on the road have the potential to increase the opportunity for catastrophic claims and generally the exposure for organizations to more frequent, severe claims.\nThe current administration has proposed a plan to alleviate the shortage, which includes reducing the time it takes to obtain a commercial driver's license and providing incentives for companies to create apprenticeship programs. Younger, less experienced drivers on the road can increase the risk organizations face in terms of claims frequency and severity. Any changes that require new drivers to complete less training and fewer hours behind the wheel are likely to create even more complex risk management challenges for organizations focused on minimizing risk by operating trucks safely on all roadways. Long-term solutions will likely need to address increased pay, regulatory changes, and modifications to the business practices of shippers, receivers, and carriers. These solutions mean investing in programs that attract younger people to the profession and providing them with a path to a career.\nAutomation also has the potential to revolutionize the industry. Previously, around 80% of warehouse activities were done by hand, but as demand increases, organizations may need to automate more actions or augment manual labor with technology to work more efficiently and effectively. The transportation industry will need to adapt to implement this sort of technology for drivers to use so that the future state of trucking can be realized. Organizations need to invest in technology and tools that empower drivers while also providing training and education programs that will attract the workforce of the next generation to careers in the transportation industry.\nRegardless of the strategy, trucking companies are responsible for providing their employees with proper training and making sure safety protocols are in place. They need to use the available technology and data to continuously evaluate and develop these practices so that drivers, warehouse workers, and the public are protected.\nArtificial intelligence is driving the evolution of claims and risk management in the transportation industry. Increasingly, risk managers have to be proactive and fully invest themselves in understanding how the metrics produced from the technologies in the truck are predictive and can help analyze and prevent accidents. For example, if a risk manager sees that a driver continually speeds, frequently brakes hard, and erratically changes lanes, the manager can proactively intervene before a serious accident occurs.\nWith immediate access to this critical claims and risk information, organizations can prepare for adverse events ahead of time and, better yet, prevent them from happening in the first place. Technology is creating safer, faster, and smarter transportation practices and empowering businesses to evolve quickly.\nHowever, many transportation organizations are still figuring out how to handle information technology systems and the insights they provide. For starters, the cost of implementing modern technology as well as the logistics of implementing it during everyday operations presents a challenge for companies of all sizes. Organizations then also need to be equipped to handle the influx of electronic data (for both storage and claims purposes), potential technological problems or defects, and the implementation of cybersecurity. Vulnerabilities in technology and data security pose a significant threat to any industry, but for transportation, as a critical piece of the supply chain, a cyber-based vulnerability could be devastating for operations and the economy at large. The \"usual\" security concerns \u2014 sensitive data, such as inventory and customer information, employee records, banking information \u2014 make trucking companies a target, and with the rapidly changing tech landscape within the transportation industry, protecting this information becomes even more critical.\nIn the coming years, organizations must balance the push for the adoption of technology, with its unique \u2014 and perhaps new \u2014 challenges, and how it slots into their growth goals. Trucking companies should continuously review their operations and make any necessary changes as their needs and the needs of their customers change.\nConclusion\nThe transportation industry is poised for significant change in the coming years as new technologies and dynamic regulatory landscapes continue to reshape day-to-day business operations. Trucking organizations should prioritize risk mitigation strategies and preventive safety measures to help control costs and reduce the risk of incidents on the road. If challenges within the industry necessitate reducing the time it takes to obtain a license in order to attract new talent and meet driver demand, trucking organizations should review and perhaps re-prioritize their training methodologies to mitigate future exposure. In the face of so many challenges, choosing the right claims and risk management partner is essential to continuing the positive growth and success of organizations in the future.\nTo learn more about Gallagher Bassett's partnered approach for the transportation industry, visit our transportation industry solutions page.\nFlynn, Jack. \"The State of American Transportation,\" Zippia, 16 Feb 2023.\n\"Total Revenue of the Trucking Industry in the United States from 2014 to 2021,\" Statista, accessed Dec 2023.\n\"Transportation Services in North America,\" MarketLine, Sept 2017.\n\"Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics Survey for Transportation and Warehousing,\" U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed Dec 2023.\nCostello, Bob and Alan Karickhoff. \"Truck Driver Shortage Analysis,\" American Transportation Associations, Jul 2019.

With normal seasonality, the index will fall about 3% y/y in October and 4%-5% in 2024.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSee the Methodology for the Cass Freight Index\n\u00a0\nCass Freight Index\u00a0-\u00a0Expenditures\nThe expenditures component of the Cass Freight Index, which measures the total amount spent on freight, rose 2.4% m/m in September despite another decline in fuel prices. The y/y decline in expenditures moderated to 6.6% from 9.0% in August.\nWith shipments down 1.7% m/m, we infer the 2.4% increase in expenditures included rates up 4.2% m/m in August (see our inferred rates data series below).\nThis index includes changes in fuel, modal mix, intramodal mix, and accessorial charges, so is a bit more volatile than the cleaner Cass Truckload Linehaul Index\u00ae.\nThe expenditures component of the Cass Freight Index fell 19% in 2023, after a record 38% surge in 2021 and another 23% increase in 2022. It declined another 16% in 1H\u201924, and assuming normal seasonal patterns from here, will decline 11%-12% this year.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInferred Freight Rates\nThe rates embedded in the two components of the Cass Freight Index declined 1.4% y/y in September, after a 7.2% y/y drop in August.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nCass Inferred Freight Rates are a simple calculation of the Cass Freight Index data\u2014expenditures divided by shipments\u2014producing a data set that explains the overall movement in cost per shipment. The data set is diversified among all modes, with truckload (TL) representing more than half of the dollars, followed by less-than-truckload (LTL), rail, parcel, and so on.\n\u00a0\nDownload the Data\nTruckload Linehaul Index\nThe Cass Truckload Linehaul Index\u2014a measure of the movement in linehaul rates\u2014rose 0.3% m/m in September, the first increase after four straight monthly declines.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nSee the Methodology for the Cass Truckload Linehaul Index\n\u00a0\nFreight Expectations\nThe key theme we\u2019ve been highlighting for more than a year now is the insourcing of freight from the for-hire market to private fleets, which has perhaps been the defining feature extending the soft freight cycle in an economy that has surpassed expectations. The resilience of owner-operators is of course an important part of the story, but operating authority revocations continue apace. \u00a0\nLower equipment supply, particularly by private fleets, may play a key role in a market turn in 2025, in our view. And next month, an FMCSA regulation could potentially downgrade tens of thousands of CDL holders in states who have not heretofore been required to enforce the FMCSA\u2019s Drug & Alcohol Clearinghouse.\nThis is a tough one to quantify. Our industry contacts suggest there is definitely some number of drivers in violation on the road. Not at the large, high-quality fleets, but it\u2019s happening. See a recent Q&A here. When state driver\u2019s license authorities downgrade a large number of CDLs on November 18th, it should have two measurable effects: making our roads safer, and leading truckload rates higher.\u00a0\nOur outlook through 2026 is detailed in the ACT Research Freight Forecast. This service provides in-depth analysis and forecasts for a broad range of U.S. freight measures, including the Cass Freight Index, Cass Truckload Linehaul Index, DAT spot and contract rates by trailer type, LTL, and intermodal price indexes. We provide monthly, quarterly, and annual predictions for over forty data series over a two- to three-year time horizon, including capacity, volumes, and rates. The ACT Research Freight Forecast is released monthly in conjunction with the Cass Transportation Index report.\nHow have ACT Research\u2019s freight forecasts performed? For 2023, ACT\u2019s forecasts for the shipments component of the Cass Freight Index were 96.9% accurate on average for the 24-month forecast period.\u00a0\n(As a reminder, ACT Research\u2019s Tim Denoyer writes this report.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nACT Research\u2019s 2023 forecasts for the Cass Truckload Linehaul Index were 96.6% accurate on average over the past 24 months, and 98.5% accurate over the past 12 months. The Cass Truckload Linehaul Index averaged 143.8 in 2023, precisely in line with our July 2023 estimate.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRelease date: We strive to release our indexes on the 13th of each month. When this falls on a Friday or weekend, our goal is to publish on the next business day.\nAbout the Indexes\n\u00a0\nAbout the Author: Tim Denoyer, ACT Research\nTim Denoyer joined ACT Research in 2017 after spending fifteen years in equity research focused primarily on the transportation, machinery, and automotive industries.

      "U.S. Department of Transportation Updates DBE and ACDBE Regulations\nShare\nThe DBE and ACDBE programs are designed to allow small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to compete fairly for DOT-funded contracts led by state and local transportation agencies and in airport concession opportunities. As recipients of DOT funding, states implement the federal DBE program and transportation agencies and airports, called \u201cSponsors,\u201d develop their own DBE contracting goals in accordance with DOT regulations, found at 49 C.F.R. Parts 23 and 26.[1] The DOT reports nearly 50,000 certified DBEs and 3,500 certified ACDBEs.[2] State and local agencies that implement the DBE program\u2014which includes 53 departments of transportation, more than 500 transit agencies, and 3,200 eligible airport sponsors[3]\u2014certify these firms.\nThe rules governing DBE certification in every state are set in 49 C.F.R. Parts 26. For the first time in a decade, the DOT has modernized the DBE program, including streamlining the DBE and ACDBE certification and eligibility process, aligning DBE and ACDBE program definitions, implementing COVID-19 flexibilities, and expanding reporting requirements for DOT-funding recipients.\nThis GT Alert summarizes some of the key changes to the DBE program that DBE firms and applicants should be aware of.\nA. Personal Net Worth\nThe changes include an update to the personal net worth and program size thresholds for the DBE program. Taking into account inflation and most common forms of wealth, DOT has increased the personal net worth limit from $1.32 million to $2.047 million.[4] Furthermore, personal net worth will now exclude retirement assets and 100% of the personal property in a DBE-owner\u2019s primary residence (which is lowered to 50% if the owner lives with a spouse or domestic partner).[5] State marital and community property laws will also no longer have an effect on personal net worth, a change that may increase predictability and level the playing field for DBEs in every jurisdiction.[6]\nB. DBE/ACDBE Size Standards\nGenerally, a firm and its affiliates must be a small business, as defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA).[7] It must not have annual gross receipts in excess of the DBE size limits and must meet the size standard appropriate to the type of work to be performed on the specific DOT-assisted contract, which continues to be determined by the applicable NAICS Code.[8] Starting March 1, 2024, DOT adjusted the business size limit for applicants and certified DBEs seeking FHWA and FTA-assisted contracts for inflation from $30.40 million to $30.72 million.[9] The adjusted gross receipts cap does not apply to determining a firm\u2019s eligibility for FAA-assisted projects.[10]\nFor the ACDBE program, DOT considers a firm a small business if its gross receipts, in accordance with 13 CFR 121.104, averaged over the firm\u2019s previous five fiscal years, does not exceed $56.42 million.[11] The new final rule requires ACDBEs that are parties to a joint venture to now include the proportionate share of joint venture receipts in its gross receipt calculation.[12]\u00a0\nC.\u00a0Ownership\nAdditional key updates to the DBE program include an overhaul of the ownership requirements for certification eligibility. The new DBE rules frame ownership in terms of \u201cinvestments\u201d and provide detailed guidance on which types of investments in ownership make a firm eligible for certification.[13] DOT considers transactions/transfers such as purchases, capital contributions, and certain gifts ownership investments.[14]\nNotably, the final rule clarifies that contributions of time, labor, and services (also referred to as \u201csweat equity\u201d) do not qualify as investments.[15] Purchases, capital contributions, and gifts are considered investments if they have real economic effect and meet specified standards regarding maintenance and proportionality.[16] The disadvantaged owner cannot withdraw their investment and must maintain its proportion relative to those of other owners.[17] Moreover, no owner can derive benefits and burdens disproportionate to their ownership share.[18] The new rule also removes the marital property provisions, previously codified at 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 26.69(i), from the determination of DBE ownership.\nLastly, the final rule addresses debt-financed investments, which have presented a practical challenge to certifiers. Borrowing to finance a disadvantaged owner\u2019s investment in the DBE firm is acceptable and will not prevent certification, provided it does not exceed 85% of the total value of the investment, the firm itself is not the lender or guarantor, and the loan is arms-length and enforceable.[19]\nD. Control\nThe amendments related to control of a DBE firm have a dual objective of removing obstacles from applicant firms while ensuring that states and local agencies only certify those firms that are genuinely controlled by disadvantaged owners.[20] The primary question certifiers must now ask is: does the disadvantaged owner run the show?[21] The final rule puts this responsibility on the certifier, recommending more in-depth inquiries (including interviewing employees) over a simple review of an operating agreement. DOT encourages certifiers to make the following inquiries:\nThe final rule includes specific governance requirements, e.g., the disadvantaged owner must hold the highest officer position, as well as prohibitions, e.g., quorum requirements for a board of directors must not block the disadvantaged owner from calling a meeting to act on business of the firm.[22]\nE.

      "2024 Preview: Four New Trucking Regulations to Watch\nThere are some major changes on the horizon for commercial trucking. Is your fleet prepared? As 2023 draws to a close, it\u2019s critical that organizations set aside time research the many regulatory updates that could take place throughout 2024.\nBelow, we explore some of the most significant regulations and the proactive steps you can take to ready your commercial drivers.\u00a0\n1. FMCSA Safety Measurement System (SMS) Updates\u00a0\nPerhaps the largest potential shift in commercial transportation is the\u00a0updated\u00a0FMCSA Safety Measurement System (SMS). The FMCSA has proposed nine major changes to their methodology, including (but not limited to): \u00a0\nThese wide-reaching changes will have major impacts on all carriers. We explore some of the finer details in a recent webinar, \u201cExpert Perspectives: Navigating FMCSA\u2019s Proposed Methodology Changes.\u201d\u00a0\n2. CDL Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse: Return to Duty Process \u00a0\nPer Title 49 CFR parts 40 and 382, drivers with drug or alcohol violations are given \u201cprohibited\u201d status in the FMCSA\u2019s Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse. As of November 18, 2024, all prohibited drivers will lose either existing commercial driving privileges or their approval for a Commercial Learners Permit (CLP). \u00a0\nDrivers will be required to undergo a rigorous re-evaluation to return to good standing. Prohibited drivers must: \u00a0\nTo prevent potential suspension, drivers and fleet managers alike must learn the ins and outs of Clearinghouse procedures, including pre-employment drug and alcohol testing, how to access records and what data must be reported to the FMCSA.\u00a0\n3. Mandatory Speed Limiters\nA redacted DOT report ruffled feathers this fall, suggesting that commercial vehicle speeds would soon be limited to 68 mph on interstates and highways. The organization quickly backtracked and explained that the specific speed limit was yet to be determined. Evaluation is still underway, however, and the official proposal will be published on Friday, December 29, 2023. In addition to the maximum speed limit, the documentation will also outline which types of vehicles are subject to the new regulations. It\u2019s widely believed that speed limiters will only be required for vehicles made after 2003 that weigh 26,000 pounds or more.\nIt will likely take a while before speed limiters affect day-to-day operations, but it\u2019s always a good idea to remind drivers about safe driving practices like speed management. These seven safety messages can help create positive habits.\n4. Competency and Skills Testing\nIn 2009, the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety submitted a proposal urging the FMCSA to implement a competency test for commercial drivers, ensuring that all commercial drivers on American roadways are qualified, properly trained and well-versed in federal regulations. The petition sat in limbo for the next 14 years. In\u00a0August of 2023, to the surprise of many, the FMCSA issued an Advance Notice of Potential Rule Making (ANPRM) indicating their intent to pursue the motion. \u00a0\nAlthough this new regulation has not yet gone into effect, it\u2019s in commercial carriers\u2019 best interest to revisit their approach to training and hiring in 2024. Routine training is valuable for new drivers and seasoned professionals alike. In fact, SambaSafety data shows that fleets who undergo monthly training have 50% fewer violations that those who train twice a year. An effective driver training program should incorporate a healthy blend of topics \u2014 like space management, distracted driving and defensive driving \u2014 that are relevant to people of all skill levels. \u00a0\nCommercial carriers should also maintain strict hiring practices to mitigate problems before they happen. Vetting drivers carefully will quickly identify high-risk candidates, ensuring only the safest and most skilled drivers are behind the wheel. \u00a0\nNavigating New Trucking Regulations\nDon\u2019t underestimate the power of advanced preparation. Dedicating time to explore all new trucking regulations the only way fleet managers can set their organizations up for ongoing success in the coming year. Luckily, we\u2019ve done some of the heavy lifting for you.

      " Article\n Mid-Year Update: Logistics & Freight Key Themes For 2024\n Logistics & Freight Transport / Global / Tue 09 Jul, 2024\nAt the midpoint of 2024, we reassess the performance of our Logistics & Freight Key Themes for 2024, as outlined in December 2023.\nMost of our projections are materialising as expected, with intensified risks impacting Red Sea-bound shipping and climatic challenges tightening global container capacity, resulting in a significant surge in freight rates over H1 2024. Despite this, rates have not surpassed pre-pandemic highs, largely due to a record influx of new container ships being launched in 2024, extending into 2025. \u00a0Escalating geopolitical tensions and security threats in the Middle East, notably the Houthi militants' threats to maritime vessels in the Red Sea, are further straining maritime trade routes and raising risk of delays and insurance costs for shippers. The extensive fleet expansion anticipated for 2024 is being quickly absorbed as additional vessels are needed to maintain delivery schedules, now complicated by Red Sea diversions.\u00a0The most acute recent shipping price surges are concentrated on trade from Mainland China to West-bound routes, partly driven by a rebound in global demand as trade recovers following a sluggish 2023. \u00a0Supply chain dynamics throughout 2024 are shifting in response to trade and investment policy changes, climate risks and national security concerns. As global supply chains continue to de-risk, transformations such as nearshoring and reshoring will become more prevalent. Logistics operators are also increasingly investing in clean energy in line with strict decarbonisation mandates, supporting the sector's drive towards sustainability. Finally we still expect reduced labour disturbances in transportation compared to 2023, thanks to easing cost of living pressures and the advancement of automation technologies.\nEast-West Shipping Costs Climb as Trade Rebounds and Red Sea Threats Loom\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPanama Canal's Rain-Dependent Revival Will Ease Global Shipping Risks;\u00a0\nDecoding Global Risks: Insights from Our Red Sea Crisis Webinar\nMorocco's Greenfield Port To Relieve Western Mediterranean Congestion\nMexico Rides Investment Wave To Reach Record-High FDI Inflows In 2023\nGreen Corridors Expand, As Asia Remains At The Forefront Of Hydrogen Shipbuilding\nGreen Hydrogen Trade: Highlighting The Global Leaders\nYemeni Houthis Will Continue To Threaten Maritime Trade So Long As Fighting Continues In Gaza\nIsrael Hamas War Update: Notable Risks From Israeli Tensions With Hezbollah And Rising Social Discontent\nTrump Second Term Scenario: Myriad Obstacles To Rapprochement With Russia\nBreakdown Of US East Coast Dockworker Negotiations Risks Freight Disruptions, Higher Costs\nCanada Cargo Volumes At Risk From Potential Rail, Port, And Customs Strikes\nKey View:\u00a0The record number of containerships coming online in 2024 have been quickly absorbed so far, largely due to Red Sea diversions as more ships are facing longer distances and concomitant delays. Freight rates spiked sharply in H1 2024 and will remain structurally high over the remainder of 2024 as the global trade outlook remains supportive and shippers continue to frontload they cargo requirements ahead of the usual peak season of East-West trade. We believe that container freight rates will remain below pandemic era highs as more capacity comes online and carriers readjust schedules. Rates will likely come down from Q3 2024 highs over Q4 2024 as we anticipate subdued demand later in the year.\nMid-Year Update: While there will still be a record number of new containerships being brought into service in 2024, the capacity brought online by containerships in H12024 has already been snapped up by the Red Sea diversions. The longer route around the Cape of Good Hope has necessitated an uptick in the number of ships required to meet recovering global trade demand. There would have been significant overcapacity if the Red Sea crisis were to be solved in the near term; however, we do not expect an easing of the attacks for the remainder of the year. As a result, diversions around the Cape of Good Hope are likely to remain the norm across H2 2024 given that carriers have adjusted their routes to best accommodate circumventing the Suez Canal route.\nPerfect Storm Of Diversions And High Demand Fueling Freight Rate Increases\nSelected Routes - Freight Rates, USD per 40ft container\nWe initially expected relatively low freight rates for 2024 when we wrote our key themes in November 2023, reflecting our belief of a wide disconnect between supply and demand for containerised goods. However, we note four key reasons behind elevated freight rates for the remainder of the year:\u00a0\nKey View:\u00a0For the remainder of 2024, we anticipate an increase in the number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals in the transport sector, driven by the acquisition of smaller players. However, average deal values are expected to be smaller. Larger companies will continue acquiring to enhance their reach and efficiency, and adapt to near-shoring and broader supply chain shifts, while smaller players face tough financial conditions.\nMid-Year Update: In H1 2024, the global transport sector recorded 137 M&A deals with an average value of USD62.2mn per deal, marking an 81.9% drop from the average half-yearly deal values of USD344.2mn seen in 2021 and 2022, according to Bloomberg. This trend of increasing M&A deals but shrinking deal values is evident across maritime, road, rail \u00a0and air transport. Larger companies acquiring smaller, financially struggling players drive this pattern, which is expected to persist throughout 2024. In H1 2024, the maritime sector dominated M&A activity, accounting for 63.9% of deal value. According to Bloomberg, larger players like Maersk and Cosco reported strong financial rebounds, with Maersk's net profits up 145.6% to USD208mn and Cosco's profits increasing by 277.6% to USD1.1bn in Q1 2024 from Q4 2023 levels.\u00a0\nGeopolitical events in the Red Sea pushed freight rates up due to closed traditional shipping lanes and increased risks. This situation benefited larger freighters who managed extra mileage and fuel costs effectively, unlike smaller operators who faced rising operational costs and could not easily capitalise on higher freight rates. Consequently, companies like ADNOC Logistics & Services, which acquired Navig8 Topco Holdings Inc, and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co SA, which acquired Gram Car Carriers ASA, have been acquiring smaller operators to enhance efficiency and scale throughout H1 2024.\nM&A Activity Defined By More Deals, Lower Values And Smaller Targets\nGlobal Transport Sector - M&A Deal Count & Avg Value Per Deal (USDbn)\nThe road transport sector experienced 36 deals valued at USD2.5bn in H1 2024, primarily in Asia, according to Bloomberg. The focus is on expanding service offerings and geographic reach, particularly in cold chain logistics and specialised transport services. Nearshoring, friend-shoring, and reshoring trends are driving these acquisitions to improve supply chain resilience and efficiency. Asia and Europe are leading regions for M&A activity in the transport sector, accounting for 34.9% and 31.1% of all deals, respectively, in H1 2024, totalling 444 deals globally. Europe remains at the top in terms of deal value, making up 54.2% of the total. Europe\u2019s interconnected markets and regulatory frameworks attract cross-border acquisitions, fostering economic cohesion. Asia, particularly Mainland China and Southeast Asia, is pivotal due to its manufacturing capabilities and evolving logistics networks. Strategic initiatives like nearshoring and friend-shoring in these regions aim to enhance supply chain agility and reduce dependency on distant markets.\nLooking ahead, we expect the volume of M&A deals in the transport sector to continue growing in 2024, though the average deal value will likely remain below historical levels. The drive for nearshoring and strengthening supply chains, especially in Europe, the US and Asia will sustain M&A activity, with larger companies acquiring smaller players to enhance their reach and efficiency. In H1 2021, global transport sector M&A deals totalled USD69.5bn but have since fallen to USD8.5bn in H1 2024. We foresee modest growth in deal values for the remainder of 2024.\nM&A Target Regions Amidst Reshoring And Supply Chain Strengthening\nGlobal Transport Sector - M&A Activity By Target Region (H1 2024)\nKey View: The pace of global supply chain de-risking will accelerate, primarily catalysed by emerging trade and investment policy regulations, climate-related risks, and security considerations. Concurrently, supply chain transformations such as nearshoring and reshoring will take place.\nMid-Year Update: The post-pandemic supply chain shift from \u2018just-in-time\u2019 to \u2018just-in-case' strategic investment flows into operations will continue over the coming quarters largely driven by new trade and investment policy rules and national security considerations (particularly surrounding energy and advanced technology sectors). Despite a reduction in supply chain stress since the pandemic's peak, global networks remain more disjointed compared to pre-pandemic levels. In response, companies will aim to reduce reliance on distant suppliers and protect against trade restrictions and geopolitical risks, while expanding their operations into low-cost manufacturing hubs. Nearshoring, reshoring and friend-shoring of supply chains will gain pace with markets in Europe, North America and Asia (excluding Mainland China) being the key beneficiaries of these trends.\nOver 2024, we expect growth in port throughput in East and South East Asia, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, well-integrated parts of Western Europe, the Gulf States as well as Canada and Mexico. Consequently, region-centric carriers with exposure to these markets across the logistics space are well-placed to leverage regionalisation-supportive policies to support revenues, as the global economy improves in 2024.\nClimate change impacts will also play a role in altering freight flows and route selection, as demonstrated by extreme weather events such as El Nino. Drought and flood risks can negatively affect some of the world's busiest ports as well as inland waterways such as the Rhine, Danube, Mississippi and the Yangtze rivers, by slowing freight flows and limiting load capacity on barges or feeders.\u00a0The 2023 El Ni\u00f1o-triggered drought severely disrupted Panama Canal transits, a critical artery for global trade. As water levels dropped, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) imposed draft and transit restrictions. This compelled bulk carriers and tankers to navigate around the Cape of Good Hope, to avoid congestion and delays. Nevertheless, the Panama Canal has shown a resurgence in trade activity in H1 2024, due to increased rainfall improving water levels. The ACP has been increasing daily transit slots, supporting a rebound in trade flow and boosting confidence in the canal's prospects for H2 2024. Yet, while Lake Gatun's water levels are on the rise, achieving historical averages is still reliant on ample rainfall. Therefore, drought risks pose a threat to consistent freight flows through Panama.\nKey View: The adoption of sustainable fuels is ongoing within the transport sector, in line with more stringent emissions regulations. Logistics companies are investing in advanced carbon reduction technologies to reduce their emissions while techniques to modify operations such as slow steaming are being undermined by Red Sea challenges.\nMid-Year Update: Carriers are ramping up investments in carbon reduction and clean-energy innovations to align with the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) stringent decarbonisation rules and net-zero GHG emissions targets. Key targets for reducing emissions are set for 2030 and 2040, aiming for net zero by 2050, using 2008 as the baseline. The IMO's two-pronged strategy to reduce maritime emissions incorporate a technical standard for lowering the greenhouse gas intensity of marine fuels and an economic policy involving carbon pricing tied to fuel emissions levels. Recent key measures include the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI), Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP).\u00a0\nOn a regional level, the the EU is advancing its environmental regulations with initiatives like the Fit for 55 package, which includes the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and FuelEU Maritime. These programmes require companies to financially account for their emissions. Specifically, the ETS will enforce a gradual rise in the emissions shippers must cover, starting at 40% in 2024, increasing to 70% in 2025 and reaching 100% coverage by 2026. Major carriers such as CMA CGM, Maersk, and Hapag-Lloyd have outlined plans to introduce surcharges to progressively pass on compliance costs, in an effort to\u00a0manage the new carbon pricing mechanisms. Meanwhile, shipping companies that considered slow steaming to cut emissions and manage vessel supply are facing challenges from the Red Sea crisis. Longer detours and accelerated speeds to offset delays, especially on Asia-Europe bound routes, are undermining this emission-reduction strategy.\nLogistics operators are investing in cleaner energy solutions in the coming years, particularly those operating larger vessels between EU ports. Many large ports in the region are making investments in the near term as EU\u2019s recently adopted Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) sets a pivotal requirement for maritime ports within the bloc, mandating them to offer shore-side electricity for vessels by the year 2030. Key logistics hubs in Asia and Europe, namely Singapore and the Netherlands, are creating partnerships to establish green shipping lanes. Meanwhile, the US is enhancing its sustainable port operations by providing funds for zero-emission equipment and infrastructure.\nCarriers are increasingly adopting alternative fuels as a decarbonisation technique, with liquefied natural gas (LNG) leading the way due to its environmental and economic benefits. Despite the emergence of dual-fuel methanol and ammonia engines, LNG's price competitiveness, abundant supply \u00a0and established infrastructure render it a more feasible option. The global fleet already includes over 2,400 LNG-fueled vessels with\u00a0LNG being most dominant among container ships compared to other ship types.\u00a0According to data from DNV on July 3 2024, there were 597 LNG-fueled ships added to the global fleet up from 357 in 2023 (marking a 101% increase), 141 LPG ships, 53 methanol ships and 19 hydrogen ships. LNG bunkering is expanding, which further supports the adaption of LNG fuelled fleets. However, environmental challenges remain, notably methane slip during bunkering (gaseous methane emissions) which requires stringent standards and efficient technology to mitigate. Overall, the shipping sectors adoption of LNG as an alternative fuel reflects its strategic effort to balance immediate environmental benefits with long-term sustainability and regulatory compliance.\nCleaner Alternative Fuels Gaining Traction\nGlobal Shipping Fleet - Alternative Fuel Uptake By Number Of Ships\nKey View:\u00a0Heightened security threats to cargo ships in proximity to conflict zones will drive up insurance premiums, in addition to the supplementary costs and delays incurred from implementing preventive measures. The likelihood of disruptions and losses induced by conflict will be most prominent within the Red and Black Sea maritime regions.\nMid-Year Update: We anticipate that shipping and transport companies will face higher insurance premiums and operational costs due to increased geopolitical and conflict-related risks, particularly in the Red Sea. The conflict between Israel and Hamas, which escalated in October 2023, has created a tense regional environment as of mid-2024. Actions by Houthi forces in Yemen, including firing ballistic missiles toward Israel and attacking cargo ships in the Red Sea, have significantly decreased traffic along key maritime routes. As a result, shipping companies face heightened risks through the Suez Canal and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. According to IMF port watch data, the number of cargo and tanker ships transiting these routes has decreased by 53.7% and 63.7%, respectively, from November 2023 to May 2024. These increased risks have driven up insurance costs and many companies have rerouted to bypass the affected lanes resulting in less efficient, costlier routes, delayed transit times and rising fuel costs.\u00a0\nShipping Re-Routed Amid Red Sea Disruptions\nSelected Shipping Routes - Monthly Number of Cargo & Tanker Ship Transits\nOne key alternative route is via the Cape of Good Hope. Despite its longer transit time and higher fuel costs, this route has experienced an 80% increase in cargo and tanker ship traffic from November 2023 to May 2024, underscoring the impact of conflicts in the Red Sea region. This shift creates investment opportunities in port facilities along the Atlantic-facing coast and potential growth for alternative land corridors like the Middle Corridor through Central Asia to Europe. While these routes will not significantly absorb canal traffic in the short-to-medium term, they offer viable alternatives to mitigate risks associated with conflict zones. Shipping in the Black Sea faces high insurance premiums due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, with naval blockades, missile strikes and sea mines contributing to elevated risks and freight rates. Ships are taking longer, costlier routes, resulting in delays and higher fuel consumption. Damage to Ukrainian port infrastructure has reduced export capacities, disrupting global supply chains and increasing costs. Sanctions and countersanctions further complicate logistics.\nConflicts along key maritime routes have forced shipping companies to use larger vessels on longer transits, increasing risks of incidents, port congestion and impacting global supply chains. Geopolitical tensions have increased costs for shipping and transport companies in 2024, and we expect these costs to remain elevated. Factors such as higher insurance premiums, longer and costlier routes, and increased security measures will continue to drive expenses.\nKey View:\u00a0We anticipate a reduction in labour disruption risks impacting logistics and freight operations. This will be largely attributable to the decline in cost of living pressures and the more careful negotiations of labour contract agreements in 2024 in order to avoid significant disruptions to supply chains as was the case in 2023.\u00a0\nMid-Year Update: Global inflation is trending downwards, driven largely by DMs, which should lower the risk of disruptions to logistics networks. Many impactful labour unrest incidents in 2023 was a direct result of the cost-of-living crisis in DMs, prompting workers to push for higher wages. While large scale disruptions to major logistics and port activities have so far in 2024 been averted, there remains clusters of logistics workers demanding higher levels of compensation, demanding better working conditions, and pushing back against automation. The main risk for H2 2024 is expiry of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association agreement, which covers 45,000 dockworkers at major US East and Gulf Coast ports, on September 30 2024. Progress on sealing a new deal came to a halt in June 2024, when talks were suspended by the union.\nOther labour unrest risks across H2 2024 include rail workers from Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Kansas City, Tata Steel workers at the UK\u2019s Port Talbot, and new collective labour agreements for workers at Germany\u2019s ports of Hamburg, Bremen, Bremerhaven, Brake, and Emden. Furthermore, we anticipate that geopolitical risks and their associated implications, as detailed in our Geopolitical Risks theme, will give rise to demands for hardship or hazard compensation for shipworkers traversing the Red Sea. There are also the risk of pro-Palestinian activist strikes in and around ports - Italy\u2019s Port of Genoa was blocked in a strike in June 2024, with similar protests happening earlier in the year in Australia and Canada, though they are generally small in scale.\nUptick In Unrest Should Subside In H2 2024\nGlobal - Number Of Demonstrations By Civilians & Protestors\nAutomation is increasingly seen as a solution to labour shortages and unrest in the logistics sector, particularly in DMs. While automation is expected to reduce labour needs and operational disruptions caused by strikes, resistance from workers and unions remains a significant barrier, especially in Europe and North America. According to our Megatrends Survey, a majority of transport and logistics industry respondents recognise technology and automation as major disruptors through 2025 and are preparing for this shift, with over a quarter already investing in artifical intelligence and automation to enhance resilience against workforce challenges.\nAutomation Underway In Supply Chain Management\nGlobal - Annual Installations Of Industrial Robots (2017-2026)\n This commentary is published by BMI, a Fitch Solutions company, and is not a comment on Fitch Ratings Credit Ratings.

      "Why 2024 is the year sustainability develops a business case | World Economic Forum\n\nNature and Biodiversity\nWhy 2024 is the year sustainability develops a credible business case\nJan 26, 2024\n\nResearch shows a significant change in. the understanding of the business case for sustainability among top leaders globally Image:\u00a0Getty Images/iStockphoto\nCyril Garcia\nHead, Sustainability Services and Corporate Responsibility, Capgemini\nThis article is part of: Centre for Nature and Climate\n\nThe number of executives globally who understand the business case for sustainability tripled between 2022 and 2023.\nNew research suggests that business leaders are clear on the return on investment (ROI), and a significant proportion of companies will increase sustainability investments in 2024.\nOrganizations can make a substantial impact by progressing on reporting emissions, implementing circular economy practices and leveraging climate technology.\n\nAs we step into 2024 and the world grapples with an increasing number of climate disasters and their ever-growing cost, a paradigm shift is underway among global organizations.\nIn 2023, we saw a significant change in the understanding of the business case for sustainability among top leaders globally. The proportion of executives who thought it was clear tripled compared to 2022, as per the Capgemini Research Institute report.\nInvestments in sustainability initiatives remained flat between 2022 and 2023 and represented less than 1% of total revenue in 2023, while marketing budgets were equivalent to 9.1% of annual revenue on average.\n\nImage: Capgemini Research Institute, A World in Balance Surveys Nov 2022 and Nov 2023\nFast-forward to now, and sustainability is becoming a priority investment area, increasingly viewed as an opportunity to create value. At the end of 2022, only a third of organizations intended to increase their sustainability investments. Today, the proportion is over half.\n\nImage: Capgemini Research Institute, Embracing a brighter future, Jan 2024\nIt is good news that the private sector is fully grasping its responsibility to contribute to the transition towards a more sustainable economy and that it understands it is the only way to create sustainable value.\nHave you read?\nCompanies must lay the foundations for sustainable transformation\nIn the last year, we have seen a major surge in optimism among executives about the future of their organizations. Where business outlooks are positive, investments generally follow. But while over half say they\u2019ll earmark more funds for sustainability in 2024, they must hone in on areas where they can make the most impact.\nFirst, you can't manage what you can't measure, so companies' sustainability reporting capabilities need attention. While most organizations have a handle on their Scope 1 and 2 emissions, understanding and cutting Scope 3 emissions remains challenging: the proportion of companies that confidently measure Scope 3 emissions dropped in 2023. It's understandable, as these emissions are not within the company's direct control, but they also tend to be far greater than the organization's own emissions. It is paramount to ensure the company has internal and/or external resources to track them and ensure they go down properly.\nOrganizations can reap major benefits by putting funds towards implementing circular economy principles and sustainable product design. They can also implement more sustainable products and services.\nDiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring sustainable global markets?\nShow more\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Platform for Shaping the Future of Trade and Investment informs business and policy action on critical international trade and investment choices, driving inclusive growth and development by working with companies, governments, and civil society.\nLoading...\n\nThe Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation is cutting trade costs by delivering trade facilitation projects in 30 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia.\nThe Forum piloted sustainable investment facilitation in Cambodia, Ghana and Kenya to unlock foreign direct investment for development.\nThe Forum\u2019s Digital Trade work drives coherence and interoperability in TradeTech and Digital Economy Agreements.\nThe Forum\u2019s Green Trade and Supply Chain Sustainability community identified 25 technologies to cut global emissions.\n\nContact us for more information on how to get involved.\nExpectations are high for climate technology\nClimate technologies (renewables, batteries, low-carbon hydrogen, carbon capture, and alternative fuels, among others) are an essential complement to behaviour changes.\nThree-quarters of business leaders see them as a key lever to decarbonize their value chains and create new industries and business models. We see a significant dynamic in this area, whether in terms of innovation or investment, supported by political momentum, particularly in the United States, China and the European Union. However, as of now, a key hurdle is the added cost of these technologies. Innovations, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, are still costly, which, in turn, increases product pricing. And, while organizations say they would be willing to pay a 'green premium' of around 9%, the expense of low-carbon cement produced using carbon capture is estimated to be 75% to 140% higher than conventional cement.\nAt the same time, there are industries and products \u2013 such as electric vehicles (EVs) \u2013 where green premiums have fallen drastically, inspiring climate tech adoption. Unsurprisingly, our research confirms that the climate techs that are scaling up, such as EVs, solar power, wind and batteries, are mature from a technology standpoint, supported by incentives and favourable policy and close to parity with traditional tech in terms of costs. But to be scaled, climate tech must be made commercially viable. We will need significant mobilization across industries and borders, starting with governments.\nBesides climate tech, companies should also leverage digital technologies, such as AI, digital twins and additive manufacturing. When adopted at scale, they will be essential in reducing development costs, increasing efficiencies and speeding up innovation processes.\nWe are seeing the emergence of an eco-digital era\nOver half of organizations believe in the transformative power of technology to accomplish sustainability objectives and digital investment is set to double as a proportion of revenue over the next five years. If properly targeted, this increased digital adoption could achieve considerably more reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption than it already has.\nThese evolutions will shape an eco-digital eraTM: a new and emerging business landscape that is more interconnected, data-driven, accessible, and sustainable. With the integration of mainstream digital technologies \u2013 such as data, analytics and cloud \u2013 coupled with innovative advancements, such as generative AI, augmented reality and virtual reality, we will see reimagined business models contributing to a broader societal impact.\nNavigating the opportunities presented by the eco-digital eraTM requires a new, strategic approach. Organizations need to:\n\u2022 Focus on identifying efficiencies to streamline processes and drive significant cost savings.\n\u2022 Ensure a harmonious integration of immediate wins and long-term sustainability.\n\u2022 Invest newly unlocked resources into digital and sustainable transformation initiatives.\n\u2022 Make sustainability an intrinsic part of products and services.\n\u2022 Forge partnerships that amplify sustainability efforts and contribute to the broader ecosystem of positive change.\nOrganizations have only scratched the surface of what can be achieved by harnessing digital technologies. One thing is for sure, the sum will be greater than the parts and will be key to unlocking a sustainable future.\nLoading...\nDon't miss any update on this topic\nCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.\nSign up for free\nLicense and Republishing\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.\nStay up to date:\nClimate and Nature\nFollow\nRelated topics:\nNature and BiodiversityForum Institutional\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Crowdsource Innovation ##### Get involved with our crowdsourced digital platform to deliver impact at scale\n\nGlobal Agenda\nThe Agenda Weekly\nA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agenda\nSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

In early 2024, geopolitical developments and technological advances continue to affect how supply chains and companies conduct business. Internally, businesses must also adjust to more staff reductions and retirements and further develop their new and mid-career supply chain staff. Organizations continue to re-evaluate their approaches and look for ways to improve.\nAt the beginning of 2024, APQC concluded its 10th annual Supply Chain Management Priorities and Challenges research, including a survey of more than 350 professionals from around the world and across multiple industries. As in previous years, the research examined organizations\u2019 supply chain management priorities, performance, and anticipated trends.\nThe results reveal that fewer organizations achieved their business goals in 2023. Yet organizations remain focused on the future, with many anticipating further digital developments and investments in their supply chains.\nSee the related APQC Infographic: Preparedness in 2024\n2023 was not an easy year\nAlthough many aspects of business returned to something resembling a pre-pandemic state in 2023, the majority of organizations in APQC\u2019s research did not achieve all of their business goals for the year (Figure 1). Looking back on 2023, we see that a majority of organizations (62%) missed their 2023 targets, and four in five organizations reported falling short of their competitors\u2019 or peers\u2019 performance.\nThese drops in performance reflect the ongoing uncertainty that supply chains have been facing and continue to face. These results are a cause for concern given that a larger proportion of organizations fared worse in 2023 than in previous years. In 2024, as organizations try to catch up to their peers, they will need to seek new ways to meet their goals while dealing with new and different challenges. Organizations should evaluate which factors make the most impact on their business and determine whether there is the potential for these to affect business goals long-term.\nDiving deeper into the data, APQC finds that compared to the previous few years, organizations are trending more positively in terms of performance on specific goals related to customer satisfaction and return on investment (ROI). It is an encouraging sign to see performance on several additional goals trending upward from 2022 to 2023, even though overall achievement remains low. To continue to see improvement in these goals, 2024 needs to be a year of improved flexibility and adaptability for supply chains as global uncertainty continues.\nMajor trends affecting supply chains in 2024 and beyond\nIn terms of trends affecting supply chains, research participants anticipate that technological advancements and stronger data and process management practices will make the biggest impact over the next three years (Figure 2). Big data and advanced analytics, supply chain digitization, data management, and process standardization make up the top four trends anticipated to make the greatest impact.\nFor the third year in a row, big data and advanced analytics is in the top spot. Emerging technologies are helping supply chain professionals make sense of ever-increasing amounts of data, but it\u2019s hard to keep pace with all the internal and external sources. With the digital supply chain, organizations are integrating physical processes with digital data and implementing digital workplace tools, focusing on achieving the desired ROI from these investments.\nStrengthening foundational data and processes are in the third and fourth spots for anticipated impacts on supply chain. In its first year on the survey, data management highlights the importance of having well-managed underlying data models, clear data governance, and more critical data-related processes. If the underlying data is not reliable, the decisions the organization makes based on that data are questionable. Just as organizations need a good data foundation, they also need a solid process foundation to maximize efficiency and technology investments. Standardized processes are also key for effective business continuity plans as organizations cope with continued uncertainties and rapid changes in the external environment.\nFigure 1: Performance on business goals\nSource: APQC\nChanges in legal and regulatory requirements and pressure from other stakeholders (e.g., customers, and investors) are driving the impact of sustainability and environmental and social issues on supply chains. But as organizations make public net zero promises, many of them are scrambling to create an actionable plan to hit those targets in time, especially for the more complex Scope 3 emissions from the value chain.\nIn addition, it is notable that the percentage of respondents anticipating these trends to have a major impact on supply chains has increased substantially over the last year. In the previous year\u2019s research, 34% of respondents expected that big data and advanced analytics would make a major impact, whereas in the most recent survey, an astounding 65% of respondents said this would make a major impact. Similarly, 41% of respondents last year believed supply chain digitization would make a major impact within the next three years, and in the latest survey, that amount jumped to 64%.\nFigure 2: Top five trends, innovations, and developments affecting supply chains by 2027\nSource: APQC\nObstacles to improvement\nAPQC also asked supply chain professionals about obstacles to improving their organizations\u2019 supply chain processes. The top four obstacles experienced by respondents are the following:\nGiven that technology had such a prominent spot among trends for the next three years, it is not a surprise that the implementation of new technologies has surfaced as an obstacle for 52% of survey respondents. There has been a lot of buzz around new technologies such as the internet of things (IoT), AI, and autonomous vehicles. It can be difficult to identify how to operationalize these technologies within the supply chain, especially AI. Additionally, with the adoption of any new technology comes the need for organizations to address cybersecurity to prevent disruptions caused by security breaches. This obstacle also reflects the increased need for strong change management as organizations sort out their process changes, new roles and responsibilities, and more.\nFifty percent of research participants rated a lack of collaboration across functions and externally as an obstacle to improvement. This obstacle has consistently been rated highly in APQC\u2019s annual research. To address this challenge, APQC advocates for using knowledge management approaches and techniques to provide support and guidance for collaboration. Disconnects in the supply chain can lead to ripple effects that impact customers and their ability to receive orders on time, in full, damage-free, and with accurate documentation. With increased uncertainty, supply chain leaders need effective collaboration to be resilient and responsive. Poor data management and governance also present a foundational issue to supply chains. Having clean, well-managed data is critical to the success of systems across the organization. Having inaccurate data can affect a company\u2019s ability to use analytics effectively, automate activities, and more.\n\u201cWith the adoption of any new technology comes the need for organizations to address cybersecurity to prevent disruptions caused by security breaches.\u201d\nLast year, labor concerns held the top ranking for organizational obstacles. Although 2024 has already had its share of labor challenges, supply chains are not alone when it comes to dealing with labor concerns like strikes, lack of qualified candidates, unfilled vacancies, layoffs, etc. However, given the business-critical role that supply chain plays in getting products and services to the customer, addressing this obstacle needs to be an organizational priority.\nOvercoming obstacles\nAPQC found that organizations are taking a variety of measures to address their supply chain obstacles. Most try to be adaptable in the face of volatile conditions, with 84% of respondents saying that their organizations have re-evaluated or modified their supply chain strategy to overcome obstacles.\nIn addition, 55% expect to increase their budget for supply chain tools, technology, innovation, and initiatives in 2024. In light of the inflationary environment for businesses, this ensures that supply chains can continue to meet the needs of the business while implementing and operationalizing new technologies.\n2024 focus areas\nIn addition to examining major trends and supply chain obstacles, APQC\u2019s annual research includes insights about organizations\u2019 overall supply chain areas of focus for 2024. An area of focus is one targeted for investing resources, innovation, and hiring. For each area of focus, respondents provided two more detailed priority areas. Figure 3 shows the top five areas of focus for 2024, as well as the corresponding results from 2023.\nThe 2024 top five areas of focus are the same as in 2023, but in the most recent research more organizations indicated each as a priority. The top area of focus, supply chain planning, was named an area of focus by 90% of respondents\u2014a 4% increase from 2023. For all other areas, there was at least a 12% jump in the percentage of respondents rating each as an area of focus. This increased focus marks an important time for the profession. Supply chains are in the spotlight; now they have to shine and rise to the occasion.\nFigure 3: Top five annual focus areas\nSource: APQC\nSupply chain planning. Respondents focusing on supply chain planning indicated integrated business planning and demand planning and forecasting as their top two priority areas. To address disruptions and global uncertainty, companies need to pull their resources together to ensure that they align business goals and supply chain operations. This leads to the creation of an effective consensus forecast and supports scenario planning to prepare for potential disruptions.\n\u201cTo make these process improvements stick, leaders must adopt change management practices that address staff concerns and resistance.\u201d\nOrganizations intend to conduct benchmarking against similar companies, improve collaboration, implement new technologies, and standardize processes to start addressing their supply chain planning priorities.\nSourcing and procurement. Respondents focusing on sourcing and procurement named supplier relationship management, risk mitigation, and sustainability as their top priority areas within this function. Supplier relationship management has consistently been a top priority area within procurement over the years.\nThis speaks to the need for companies to focus on developing close relationships with key suppliers. APQC advocates for shifting procurement from a focus on transactions to fostering strategic relationships that benefit all parties involved. With increasing regulation related to sustainability, voluntary disclosure in the past has now become required. Many businesses now must disclose and verify their suppliers\u2019 sustainability data or face the threat of financial penalties or disrupted shipments.\nThe actions organizations intend to take with procurement include implementing new technology and capabilities to increase supply chain visibility. They also intend to further standardize their procurement processes and identify and implement proven practices.\nInnovation. Innovation helps organizations stay ahead of the curve even when facing rapid changes, multiple disruptions, and rapid technological advancements in a global context. The top focus area in innovation for 2024 is operational or process innovation, which enables organizations to find new, different, and more effective ways of going to market and operating their organizations and supply chains. It is followed by product and service innovation and creativity as top priorities. There is a large difference between the percentage of respondents selecting operational or process innovation (46%) and those selecting product and service innovation (30%). This speaks to the desire organizations have to find better ways to drive more effective supply chains versus introducing new products or services. To make these process improvements stick, leaders must adopt change management practices that address staff concerns and resistance.\nOrganizations intend to integrate innovation into organizational goals and implement new technology and capabilities to meet their priorities. They also intend to increase open innovation ecosystem collaboration, embrace new business models, and identify and implement best practices. Overall, companies are looking for new, more collaborative ways to innovate and drive supply chain and enterprise-wide improvements.\nA culture of preparedness\nAPQC\u2019s latest research in priorities and trends for supply chain professionals indicates that 2024 is shaping up to be another challenging year for supply chains. Disturbances continue, such as the volatile freight costs caused by shipping disruptions at the Suez and Panama Canals.\nAs such, supply chain professionals anticipate that a greater number of trends will make a major impact on supply chains. To address potential obstacles, at least 55% of organizations plan to increase their supply chain budgets. They are also focusing attention on more aspects of the supply chain in 2024.\nThe theme for supply chains this year is preparation in the face of uncertainty. To support resilience, organizations aim to tackle data governance and management and to leverage new technologies that enable greater visibility and create more effective scenario plans. They also aim to tighten their processes to support clear roles and responsibilities.\nIn a recent article, Supply Chain Management Review (SCMR) discussed the need for organizations to consider disruptions to be the new norm, and APQC agrees. Strong organizational leadership remains essential for supply chain preparedness and talent management. Leaders can support supply chain professionals who collaborate effectively while embracing the full use of technology. They should also create a culture of preparedness that ensures the entire organization is ready to face almost certain uncertainty. \u2022\nAbout APQC\nAPQC helps organizations work smarter, faster, and with greater confidence.

A critical issue for 2024 is whether they will continue to heal and bring down goods inflation. Supply chains are transforming in the face of global fracturing and frequent disruptions; that transformation will mean more fragile supply chains for the foreseeable future. This article looks at five key trends that are shaping supply chains\u2019 impacts on the global economy in 2024:\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Increased focus of central banks on supply chain operations: Pandemic-era disruptions of supply chains made it evident that supply chains have become a potential source of inflation for the global economy. Though the jury is still out as to how much supply-driven inflation will factor into central bankers\u2019 decisions, several officials from the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have begun to discuss supply chains and their role in driving inflation. Supply chains and their operations will be more closely scrutinized by central bankers. We have raised our expectations for the Federal Reserve\u2019s terminal rate to 2.875%, as well as other central bank\u2019s terminal rates, on the expectation that supply chains, combined with demographics and demand components, could put a floor under inflation.\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Transportation flexibility: Supply chain managers are emphasizing flexibility in their logistics, rather than in their sources of supply. For example, the Baltimore bridge collapse had a significant impact on maritime and trucking logistics. The spike in congestion following the tragedy had doubled or tripled some truckers\u2019 route times as there are few alternatives to going through Baltimore. To mitigate the impact, truckers were permitted to work longer hours while waiting for the trucking channel to be restored; rail companies ran more trains between Baltimore and New York; freight forwarders added more capacity and the Ports of Virginia and New York absorbed diverted cargo. The need for flexibility cannot always be met when we struggle to ramp up capacity. Air carriers are expecting a record-breaking year given the disruptions in maritime shipping and the growth in demand for de minimis shipments from e-commerce platforms. Cargo commitments for airlines operating from Asia to the US and Europe are already tight; air cargo traffic is expected to grow 5% in 2024.\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A new operational norm for maritime: The Red Sea shipping crisis and the increase in shipping around the Cape of Good Hope have spurred companies to preempt disruptions. Increased costs from disruptions are being baked into maritime shipping rates at a faster pace than in the past. The supply chain disruptions from both the 2003 SARS outbreak and the Covid-19 pandemic took over a year to absorb; the Red Sea shipping costs took only a few weeks before total global maritime capacity was cut by about 15%. New rounds of tariffs from the US on products like semiconductors and electric vehicles prompted a rush of imports to stock up under the wire. Spot maritime rates rose 50% month-over-month in May as importers rushed to stock up on affected products and get orders in early for the holiday season, both increasing goods demand from China.\n4.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 More frequent disruptions: 2024 will continue to be a year of more frequent disruptions to supply chains from labor, geopolitics, cyber attacks and climate change.\no\u00a0\u00a0 Disruptions have become more frequent from labor strikes. Potential longshoremen strikes later this year in the US on the East Coast and Gulf ports, as well as ongoing farmers\u2019 strikes in multiple regions have added to capacity issues.\no\u00a0\u00a0 Geopolitical conflict, particularly in key corridors or pinch points of supply, is an ongoing risk. The conflict in the Middle East has led to the ongoing Red Sea shipping crisis.\no\u00a0\u00a0 Cyber strikes have risen in frequency; annual monetary damages as reported by the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center rose to $12.5 billion in 2023, a 21% increase from 2022. That compares to just $3.5 billion in 2019 prior to the pandemic.\no\u00a0\u00a0 Damages and disruptions from weather-related disasters remain at the forefront; ongoing disruptions continue from droughts, fires, flooding and La Ni\u00f1a.\no\u00a0\u00a0 The 2024 hurricane season will likely be \u201cone of the most active on record\u201d with 25 named storms and 12 hurricanes forecasted.\n5.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) review comes into focus: We have seen a growing trend of supply chain realignment toward closer geopolitical allies (\u201cnear-shoring\u201d and \u201cfriend-shoring\u201d) in the wake of the pandemic disruptions and the Russia-Ukraine war. Mexico has been the clear winner in the race to secure US supply chains, but the 2024 election year will be key to learning the fate of these investments in Mexico as they could be affected by the USMCA free trade deal\u2019s sunset review on July 1, 2026. If one or more of the three parties does not renew the agreement in 2026, that will kick off the process of conducting joint reviews every year, potentially accelerating toward a 2036 expiration. Sectors that require significant cross-border investment, like vehicle and semiconductor production, are heavily impacted by this uncertainty. All three countries will have different government leaders at the table for the 2026 meetings. The US presidential election in November is particularly influential; the US will likely have the largest sway in the review process, which makes who the president is sitting at the negotiating table crucial.\nThe latter half of 2024 is expected to be bumpy for supply chains as geopolitical tensions, weather disasters and labor strikes continue to unfold.\nMeagan Schoenberger, KPMG Senior Economist\nBottom Line:\nCentral banks have begun to cut interest rates, but the glide path is much slower than expected. One of the issues has been the US and the healing of supply chains and whether that can continue. The latter half of 2024 is expected to be bumpy for supply chains as geopolitical tensions, weather disasters and labor strikes continue to unfold. More frequent supply chain disruptions have increased the need for agility among importers and logistics companies.\nSubscribe to insights from KPMG Economics\nKPMG Economics distributes a wide selection of insight and analysis to help businesses make informed decisions.\nExplore more\nGlobal Navigator from KPMG Economics\nAnatomy of an oil shock\nKPMG Economics\nA source for unbiased economic intelligence to help improve strategic decision-making.\nStronger dollar contributes to trade deficit\nWe expect trade to be a drag on growth.\nMeet our team\nThank you\nSubscribe to insights from KPMG Economics\nBy submitting, you agree that KPMG LLP may process any personal information you provide pursuant to KPMG LLP's Privacy Statement.\nKPMG.

      "Industrial product and raw materials price indexes, August\u00a02024 Released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time in The Daily, Friday, September 20, 2024 Prices of products manufactured in Canada, as measured by the Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI), decreased\u00a00.8% month over month in August and rose\u00a00.2% on a yearly basis. Prices of raw materials purchased by manufacturers operating in Canada, as measured by the Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI), declined\u00a03.1% month over month in August and fell\u00a02.5% year over year.\nChart 1 Prices for industrial products decrease in August index (January 2020=100) 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 Aug.\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Aug.\n2024 Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) IPPI excluding energy and petroleum products Source(s):\u00a0Table 18-10-0265-01.\nIndustrial Product Price Index On a monthly basis, the IPPI decreased\u00a00.8% in August, following a\u00a00.1% decline in the previous month. Lower prices for energy and petroleum products were mainly responsible for the decline. Excluding energy and petroleum products, the IPPI decreased\u00a00.2%.\nPrices for energy and petroleum products declined\u00a05.0% in August, the largest month-over-month decrease since December\u00a02023\u00a0(-9.1%). The decline in this group in August\u00a02024\u00a0was mostly due to lower prices for refined petroleum energy products, particularly diesel fuel (-7.4%) and finished motor gasoline (-4.2%).\nThe Daily, Friday, September 20, 2024 Component of Statistics Canada catalogue no. 11-001-X 2 Prices for primary non-ferrous metal products fell\u00a01.6% month over month in August. Unwrought gold, silver and platinum group metals and their alloys (-1.3%) and unwrought copper and copper alloys (-4.7%) led the decrease.\nConcerns about economic conditions in China, the world's largest copper consumer, contributed to the monthly decline in copper prices.\nThe prices of meat, fish and dairy products declined for the second month in a row, down\u00a01.7% in August, as fresh and frozen beef and veal (-4.9%) posted its largest single month-over-month decline since January\u00a02024\u00a0(-5.6%).\nSlower seasonal demand partly contributed to the monthly decrease. Despite the price drops in July and August, beef prices remained at a high level.\nThe IPPI's monthly decline in August was moderated by higher prices for several commodities, with lumber and other wood products and chemicals and chemical products being the largest upward contributors.\nPrices for lumber and other wood products rose\u00a02.1% in August. Softwood lumber was the main driver of the higher prices in this group, rebounding\u00a07.7% in August after four consecutive monthly declines.\nPrices for chemicals and chemical products were up\u00a01.0% month over month in August, mainly due to higher prices for plastic resins (+4.1%). Rising input costs and constrained supplies in the United States drove up resin prices.\nYear over year The IPPI rose\u00a00.2% year over year in August, the fifth straight year-over-year increase.\nKey upward year-over-year movements in the IPPI in August included unwrought gold, silver, and platinum group metals, and their alloys (+24.0%), unwrought aluminum and aluminum alloys (+33.2%), and petrochemicals (+12.2%). Precious metal prices were frequently supported by economic and geopolitical uncertainty over the\u00a012\u00a0months ending in August.\nOn the other hand, prices decreased on a yearly basis in August for diesel fuel (-17.1%), finished motor gasoline (-11.8%), and grain and oilseed products, n.e.c. (not elsewhere classified) (-26.9%).\nRaw Materials Price Index The RMPI declined\u00a03.1% month over month in August, led by lower prices for crude energy products (-5.0%).\nExcluding crude energy products, the RMPI fell\u00a01.8%.\nPrices for crude energy products declined\u00a05.0% in August, mostly due to lower prices for conventional crude oil (-5.6%) and synthetic crude oil (-3.5%). Increasing market concerns over economic growth and oil demand, particularly in China, put downward pressure on crude prices.\nThe prices of crop products fell\u00a06.1% in August, the third consecutive monthly decline and the largest decline since July\u00a02022\u00a0(-9.2%). The decrease in August\u00a02024\u00a0was primarily driven by lower prices for canola (-8.9%). Strong global production of canola and other oilseeds pressured prices downward. In August, the United States Department of Agriculture made upward revisions to its projections for global oilseed output, supply, and stocks for the\u00a02024/2025\u00a0crop year.\nPrices for metal ores, concentrates and scrap decreased\u00a02.3% from July to August. Lower prices for gold, silver, and platinum group metal ores and concentrates (-2.5%) were the main contributor to the monthly decline.\nYear over year Year over year, the RMPI decreased\u00a02.5% in August, following a\u00a04.1% gain in July.\nThe Daily, Friday, September 20, 2024 Component of Statistics Canada catalogue no. 11-001-X 3 Lower prices for crude energy products, including conventional crude oil (-5.9%) and synthetic crude oil (-8.5%), were the main reason for the year-over-year decline in August. Other product groups that experienced notable year-over-year price decreases in August include canola (-26.5%) and nickel ores and concentrates (-19.1%).\nSupply was often elevated in the canola and nickel markets over the\u00a012-month period ending in August.\nOn the other hand, product groups that experienced relatively large price increases in August\u00a02024\u00a0relative to August\u00a02023\u00a0include gold, silver, and platinum group metal ores and concentrates (+25.9%) and cattle and calves (+11.2%).\nChart 2 Prices for raw materials fall in August index (January 2020=100) 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 Aug.\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Aug.\n2024 Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) RMPI excluding crude energy products Source(s):\u00a0Table 18-10-0268-01.\nBasket Update The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) and Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) have updated their baskets.\nAs of the August\u00a02024\u00a0reference month, the weights of the index values will reflect\u00a02019\u00a0production values of Canadian manufacturers, based on data from the Supply and Use Tables, the Annual Survey of Manufacturing and Logging and alternative data sources. The IPPI and RMPI series have been migrated from the North American Product Classification System (NAPCS)\u00a02017\u00a0Version\u00a02.0\u00a0to NAPCS\u00a02022\u00a0Version\u00a01.0 as part of the basket update process. IPPI series aggregated according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)\u00a02017\u00a0Version\u00a03.0\u00a0have been migrated to NAICS\u00a02022\u00a0Version\u00a01.0. This process resulted in several modifications including the addition of new series, the termination of series, and updates made to titles and definitions. Series that existed in our previous basket and did not experience a code change will continue to be calculated relative to the same base period (January\u00a02020=100). New series introduced under the classification system migration have a base period of July (July\u00a02024=100).\nThe Daily, Friday, September 20, 2024 Component of Statistics Canada catalogue no. 11-001-X 4 Did you know we have a mobile app?\nDownload our mobile app and get timely access to data at your fingertips! The StatsCAN app is available for free on the App Store and on Google Play.\nNote to readers The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) and the Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) are available at the Canada level only. Selected commodity groups within the IPPI are also available by region.\nWith each release, data for the previous six months may have been revised. The indexes are not seasonally adjusted.\nThe IPPI reflects the prices that producers in Canada receive as goods leave the plant gate. The IPPI does not reflect what the consumer pays. Unlike the Consumer Price Index, the IPPI excludes indirect taxes and all costs that occur between the time a good leaves the plant and the time the final user takes possession of the good. This includes transportation, wholesale and retail costs.\nCanadian producers export many goods. Canadian producers often indicate goods' prices in foreign currencies, especially in US dollars, which are then converted into Canadian dollars. This is particularly the case for motor vehicles, pulp and paper products, and wood products. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar against its US counterpart affect the IPPI. However, the conversion to Canadian dollars reflects only how respondents provide their prices. This is not a measure that takes into account the full effect of exchange rates.\nThe conversion of prices received in US dollars is based on the average monthly exchange rate established by the Bank of Canada and available in Table\u00a033-10-0163-01\u00a0(series v111666275). Monthly and annual variations in the exchange rate, as described in the release, are calculated according to the indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for example, CAN$1\u00a0= US$X).\nThe RMPI reflects the prices paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw materials. Many of those prices are set on the world market.\nHowever, as few prices are denominated in foreign currencies, their conversion into Canadian dollars has only a minor effect on the calculation of the RMPI.\nProducts Statistics Canada launched the Producer Price Indexes Portal as part of a suite of portals for prices and price indexes. This webpage provides Canadians with a single point of access to a variety of statistics and measures related to producer prices.\nThe video \"Producer price indexes\" is available on the Statistics Canada Training Institute webpage. It introduces Statistics Canada's producer price indexes: what they are, how they are made and what they are used for.\nNext release The industrial product and raw materials price indexes for September will be released on October\u00a022.\nThe Daily, Friday, September 20, 2024 Component of Statistics Canada catalogue no. 11-001-X 5 Table 1 Industrial Product Price Index \u2013 Not seasonally adjusted Relative importance1 August 2023 July 2024r August 2024p July to August 2024 August 2023 to August 2024 % (January 2020=100) % change Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) 100.00 126.5 127.8 126.8 -0.8 0.2 IPPI excluding energy and petroleum products 89.36 123.9 126.8 126.5 -0.2 2.1 Aggregation by commodities Meat, fish and dairy products 6.99 119.0 122.5 120.4 -1.7 1.2 Fruit, vegetables, feed and other food products 8.03 135.6 131.8 131.0 -0.6 -3.4 Beverages (except juices) 1.91 119.3 124.8 124.7 -0.1 4.5 Tobacco products 0.31 123.7 130.9 130.9 0.0 5.8 Textile and leather products 0.46 121.5 119.6 120.6 0.8 -0.7 Clothing, footwear and accessories 0.41 114.3 116.1 116.2 0.1 1.7 Chemicals and chemical products 8.14 121.0 124.2 125.4 1.0 3.6 Plastic and rubber products 2.84 127.7 127.0 125.5 -1.2 -1.7 Lumber and other wood products 4.24 126.8 120.2 122.7 2.1 -3.2 Pulp and paper products 4.34 115.3 121.7 121.1 -0.5 5.0 Energy and petroleum products 10.64 148.3 136.6 129.8 -5.0 -12.5 Primary ferrous metal products 2.94 147.2 139.0 138.2 -0.6 -6.1 Primary non-ferrous metal products 7.14 137.0 159.4 156.9 -1.6 14.5 Fabricated metal products and construction materials 4.08 142.0 139.4 139.9 0.4 -1.5 Motorized and recreational vehicles 19.73 111.8 113.4 113.6 0.2 1.6 Machinery and equipment 6.33 117.4 121.1 121.0 -0.1 3.1 Electrical, electronic, audiovisual and telecommunications products 3.6 129.5 134.8 133.1 -1.3 2.8 Furniture and fixtures 1.48 113.2 110.3 110.0 -0.3 -2.8 Cement, glass and other non-metallic mineral products 2.24 126.5 136.8 137.8 0.7 8.9 Packaging materials and containers 2.12 129.3 131.9 132.1 0.2 2.2 Miscellaneous products 2.03 115.3 121.0 121.0 0.0 4.9 r revised p preliminary 1.

For many industrial manufacturers, the response of the supply network to the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical challenges, and natural disasters thrust supply chain resilience into the limelight. But the pendulum appears to be swinging back, with costs and margin pressures once again at the forefront as companies reevaluate their supply chains.\nAs of early 2024, supply chain pressures have fallen from the unprecedented levels following the COVID-19 pandemic.1 The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) Manufacturers\u2019 Outlook Survey for fourth quarter of 2023 revealed that, in the last two years, 86.2% of respondents have worked to de-risk their supply chains.2 Many companies are now prioritizing a resilient yet efficient supply chain. They are working to optimize the balance between performance and cost by restructuring their supply chain. These approaches include expanding to locations in the United States, or to locations closer to end consumers, and also working more closely with free trade partners of the United States.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nIndustrial manufacturers are finding advantages in countries across North America and Asia. They are exploring both \u201cnearshoring\u201d options in Canada and Mexico and \u201creshoring\u201d options in the United States. The share of US trade in goods with China has declined from 21.2% in 2018 to 13.9% in 2023. While Mexico has overtaken China to become the lead US trading partner, accounting for a 15.4% share (figure 1), Mexican trade with China has simultaneously increased.3 Now, manufacturers are likely exploring ways to ensure that their Tier 2 and Tier 3 supply networks are sufficiently networked to reduce their raw material and key component exposure.\nOther nearshoring options such as Canada, as well as potential Asian trading partners like India, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, have experienced growth. This restructuring is occurring globally and is not exclusive to the United States, nor is it a North American phenomenon. In fact, at the end of 2023, 97% of companies surveyed in the Economist Impact\u2019s \u201cTrade in Transition 2024\u201d project stated they were reconfiguring their supply chains in some way, as compared to 92% in 2022.4\nThese changes beg the questions: What are industrial manufacturing and construction companies considering with respect to performance and cost as they restructure their supply chains? And how are they doing the restructuring?\nShare image\nOr copy link\nSupply chain efficiency is motivating industrial manufacturers to restructure their supply base\nAs global supply chains have normalized\u00a0following the pandemic, chief executive officers are likely beginning to shift their strategic focus toward profitable growth.5 Part of the strategy for many, for maintaining healthy margins, is rooted in reducing company exposure to supply chain disruption while employing cost reduction techniques and capitalizing on government policies supporting domestic growth.\nGeopolitical instability and disruptions keep the focus on delivery and lead times\nAs CEOs look to keep their company exposure low, their concerns over the indirect impacts of geopolitical instabilities on supply chains have grown.6 And, after a period of decline, the end of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 saw an uptick in supply chain challenges as a primary business issue for manufacturers (figure 2).7 This, in turn, has led to increased transit times worldwide.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nIndustry leaders expect that global shipping may experience up to 20-day delays in deliveries in the coming months.8 Deloitte\u2019s US economic forecast for the first quarter of 2024 suggests that the situation in the Red Sea may persist,9 potentially upending the progress made in lead times since 2022. In particular, the average lead time of production materials in April 2024 was 79 days. While this is a 21% reduction from the peak of 100 days reached in July 2022, it is still higher than 2019 levels, which averaged around 65 days (figure 3).10\nLonger lead times can threaten manufacturing processes, and ultimately business continuity, for companies across the value chain. In the face of recent disruptions, the Manufacturing Supplier Deliveries Index rose to 48.9 in April 2024 from 47 in December 2023.11 The increase in the index signals a slowdown in the delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations, largely due to raw material supply chains.12 While delivery performance showed a trend of significant improvement with average delivery decreases of 72.8 in 2021 to 57.3 in 2022 and 46 in 2023, it increased in the first quarter of 2024 to 49.7.13 This increase will likely motivate companies to maintain focus on resilience.\nShare image\nOr copy link\nSupply chain strategies to account for rising costs\nTo help reduce exposure to global disruptions and both maintain and boost margins, some manufacturers are looking to be strategic in their supply base restructuring by identifying and targeting specific components of a broader cost equation. Leading companies are exploring ways in which they can balance workforce requirements with labor costs and delivery times with shipping costs, all while ensuring the highest product quality.\nCompanies are still likely to heavily lean into labor costs as their main motivation for cost-based restructuring. This, of course, is not a new trend. In 1982, on average, US multinationals had 30% of their workforce abroad. Over the last several decades, companies have generally seen this percentage increase.14\nIn 2003, a Chinese employee in manufacturing made approximately 3% of their American counterpart while a Mexican employee made approximately 11%.15 As time progressed, Chinese manufacturing expertise increased and so too did accompanying wage rates. Between 2022 and 2023, a wage rate comparison reveals that a Chinese manufacturing worker makes the equivalent of approximately 26% of their American counterpart, while a Mexican worker makes approximately 14%.16 Today, workers in Malaysia and Thailand make approximately 1% and 15% of US hourly wages, respectively, and workers in India earn approximately 4-5% of US hourly wages.17\nThe inputs to the labor equation for companies have changed and so too have their supply chain practices. For instance, Mexico is currently proving to be a viable competitor to China as costs and trade policies are driving a growth of nearshoring for automotive and electronics manufacturers.18\nSome companies are taking a methodical approach to capitalizing on labor cost advantages by gradually restructuring their bases. In such a scenario, these companies can achieve labor cost efficiencies while adding resilience to their supply base through expansion.\nMany of the current cost-motivating factors are interesting from a labor arbitrage perspective. As the modern world of smart factories grows and expands, the role of labor costs will likely diminish as the entire cost equation changes. As organizations continue to incorporate automation and leverage sustainable technologies, they are likely to begin reconsidering the motivating factors for supply chain restructuring.\nFinally, the most recent supply chain disruptions have spotlighted the costs associated with shipping and logistics. As of February 1, 2024, the rate for shipping from China to the East Coast of the United States was US$6,589 forty-foot equivalent unit, a 193% rate increase since October 2023.19 Additionally, these disruptions are likely to have ripple effects down the road. The NAM manufacturers\u2019 outlook survey for the first quarter of 2024 indicated that raw material prices may increase by 2.38% over the next 12 months.20\nThe growing importance of industrial policy for profitable growth\nAmid the exposure to increased delivery times, differing labor costs, and higher transportation costs, many companies are already shaping their restructuring approaches to take advantage of evolving industrial policy. Governments across the globe are actively adapting policy to favor domestic industrial activity and consequently incentivizing reshoring and nearshoring activities. These industrial policies are likely to continue to accelerate changes in supply chains21 and could play a major role in driving decisions regarding restructuring in the coming years.\nPrivate fixed investment in manufacturing increased nearly 2.5 times in 2023 from 2021, to reach US$799.2 billion.22 As of September 2023, US$430 billion of this investment spike is attributed to several key pieces of US legislation\u2014specifically, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).23\nIn January 2024, the US Department of Defense unveiled its National Defense Industrial Strategy. One priority of this strategy is the development of resilient supply chains enabling the nation to securely acquire products, services, and technologies for defense applications. Such government strategies can facilitate the restructuring of supply chains to meet both current and future needs at speed, scale, and cost.24\nIn fact, according to data from the Reshoring Initiative 1H 2023 Report, the top reason companies reshore or conduct foreign direct investment (FDI) is government incentives.25 From free trade agreements and tariffs to tax incentives and subsidies, the United States and a host of other countries are putting policy in place to entice companies and ensure the growth of domestic regional supply chains.\nEconomic data indicates that free trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement), are likely driving greater regionalization of supply chains as there are increased incentives for sourcing goods and materials in North America.\nSince USMCA\u2019s origination in 2020, FDI into North America has grown 134% to approximately US$219 billion.26 FDI in Mexico landed at nearly US$19 billion in the first quarter of 2023,\u00a0a 48% year-over-year increase.27 Of this investment, 53% was in the manufacturing sector (compared to 24% in the first quarter of 2022),28 which emerged as one of the top two industries for direct investment in both the United States and USMCA.29 Nearly half of the total FDI was led by North American companies from automotive, aerospace, electronics, and telecommunications.30\nInclusive of Mexico and Canada, the United States has free trade agreements with a total of 20 countries.31 These agreements are intended to provide opportunities for global industrial manufacturing and construction companies to benefit from reduced tariffs\u00a0on an array of goods and strengthen supply chains on the most critical items.32\nFor example, with the US-Japan Trade Agreement and the more recent agreement on strengthening critical mineral supply chains, the United States is encouraging companies to restructure their supply bases into Japan. These agreements provide companies access to more favorable tariffs for industrial goods such as machine tools and steam turbines and better access to tax incentives for mineral-based technologies.33\nFinally, governments may use tariffs as a lever to help encourage diversification away from certain markets, thereby driving restructuring activity. In combination with free trade agreements like the USMCA, these tariffs have likely led to global supply chain restructuring and new trade activity. Three years following the enactment of the USMCA, the total value of North American trade in 2023 had grown by nearly US$500 billion.34 At that point, North American trade exceeded US$1.57 trillion, placing Mexico and Canada as the top trade partners with the United States.35\nThe US government is incentivizing businesses across the industrial manufacturing and construction sector to reshore their most advanced operations with a number of tax and investment opportunities. Many of these incentives fall under bolstering critical minerals, green energy technologies, and advanced manufacturing.\nThe IRA, a US$370 billion investment program, demonstrates the US government\u2019s commitment to domestically advance clean technology manufacturing, ranging from clean energy and clean vehicles to sustainable construction materials and advanced manufacturing.36 This includes US$2.1 billion for the US General Services Administration to use materials and products with low embodied carbon37 and an advanced manufacturing tax credit to incentivize domestic production of solar and wind energy components, qualified battery components, and up to 50 critical minerals.38\nThe IRA opportunities range from direct funding to tax credits. These opportunities are attracting new investments in the United States. For example, in February 2023, Holcim Limited, used a US$1.29 billion purchase of a US roofing system company to expand its presence the United States.39\nSeparately, with the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, the US government committed US$52.7 billion of investments into domestic chip production and advanced semiconductor research and development.40 The legislation further incentivizes a push for companies in advanced manufacturing for semiconductor technology through a 25% tax credit on eligible capital investments.41\nThe impact in developing a domestic semiconductor supply chain was immediate as a number of chipmakers, including foreign companies, are building fabrication facilities. Leveraging incentives from the CHIPS Act, America\u2019s Intel Corporation announced plans to spend US$20 billion to build two fabrication plants in Ohio.42 Additionally, a Taiwanese chipmaker is building two fabrication plants in the United States43 in a move that not only enables greater access to customers but can also help de-risk supply chain operations.\nBeyond the United States, both Japan and India are using their own governments\u2019 subsidies to incentivize regional production of semiconductors. And much like in the United States, these incentives are resulting in investments.\nIn Japan, a major chipmaker is using significant subsidies from the Japanese government to help build two semiconductor fabrication plants.44 Further, a Taiwan-based foundry, in collaboration with a leading precision and electronics manufacturer from India, is utilizing Indian subsidies of approximately US$15 billion to expand its semiconductor fabrication. This expansion aims to satisfy local demand in India and build supply chain resilience for global end users.45\nCompanies deploy differentiated strategies to help achieve supply performance\nMany global industrial manufacturing and construction companies spent years employing resilience strategies like overbuying to help reduce production delays, often to the detriment of margins. Now they are employing everything from traditional strategies to advanced technologies in a quest to realize value in their supply chains.\nWhile many of these strategies are not new, recent external supply chain risks have made them a primary focus for industrial manufacturing and construction companies. These strategies can help ensure business continuity by reducing bottlenecks, balancing cost opportunities with innovation potential, and allowing access to the most favorable regulatory environments.\nTechniques to diversify sources and reduce concentration issue\nIndustrial manufacturing companies are using dual sourcing, or \u201csupplier + 1,\u201d to reduce their supply chain reliance on a single supplier or country. This is achieved by incorporating an additional supplier from the same or a different location to satisfy a portion of the supply requirement. According to a Gartner supply chain survey, 57% of industrial manufacturers with operations in China are considering the \u201csupplier + 1\u201d strategy.46\nIn some instances, companies are working to achieve extensive risk mitigation and diversification by employing a multi-sourcing strategy, where they employ three or more suppliers to satisfy a supply requirement. (To see how multi-sourcing is helping shape the advanced air mobility industry, see sidebar, \u201cEmerging industries have an opportunity to build resilient supply chains from scratch.\u201d)\nEmerging industries have an opportunity to build resilient supply chains from scratch\nEvolving industries like advanced air mobility have an opportunity to both develop and shape resilient, robust, and efficient supply chains of the future. Learning from electric vehicle industry experiences, Lilium, an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) manufacturer, is mitigating risks associated with battery production by adopting a multi-sourcing strategy.47\nFurther, Archer, another eVTOL manufacturer, has signed a Space Act Agreement with NASA to study high-performance battery cells for advanced air mobility and space applications. Archer anticipates that this study will drive progress in the evolving supply chain for electric aircraft.48\nTo mitigate the risks associated with quality and lead time, industrial manufacturing companies are gradually building capacity at new supplier locations while reducing capacity from an existing supplier. These approaches can help address business continuity challenges during uncertain times and diversify away from existing dependencies. Such measures can also enhance the overall capabilities of the particular destination country, setting the stage for future operations opportunities. Additionally, these strategies may provide companies greater access to end users or governmental incentives.\nA trifecta of restructuring options\nIn addition to expanding their supply bases through dual-or multi-sourcing strategies, industrial manufacturing companies are employing mergers and acquisitions (M&A), strategic partnerships, and new supplier investment agreements, and expanded internal capabilities to restructure and build resilience into their supply chains.\nHorizontal integration, by merging or acquiring other companies, can help companies expand their supply base as well as their customer base, while gaining access to new markets, increasing their market share, and potentially benefiting from economies of scale.\nVertical integration can be useful when manufacturers seek greater control of certain stages of the supply chain, from sourcing raw materials to delivering the final product or after-sales services. For instance, at the end of 2022, First Aviation Services Inc. acquired Associated Aircraft Manufacturing & Sales, Inc. (AAMSI). This move provided First Aviation the ability to access and integrate AAMSI\u2019s machining and electronics manufacturing operations into its supply chain.49 In the global market, AERO Vodochody AEROSPACE a.s. has bought one of the major suppliers of its new L-39NG aircraft, Technometra \u010cesk\u00fd Brod a.s.50\nAs M&A is typically capital intensive, some companies are exploring strategic partnerships and supplier investments to expand their supply bases. Strategic partnerships with new suppliers can facilitate shared strengths, mitigate risks, and are often accompanied by cost reductions and increased innovation. To ensure supply chain resilience, manufacturers may further invest in the growth and development of their suppliers. This investment can be in the form of technology transfers or financial investments.\nNew supplier investment agreements can mitigate risks with existing suppliers by enhancing internal capabilities and flexibility. These agreements can enable companies to address material flow and business continuity more readily.\u00a0(For considerations in the construction industry, see sidebar, \u201cThe construction industry may be able to emphasize collaboration and digital technologies to address supply chain issues.\u201d)\nThe construction industry may be able to emphasize collaboration and digital technologies to address supply chain issues\nConstruction input prices increased by 1.4% in February 2024, 0.4% in March 2024, and 0.5% in April 2024, with overall construction costs remaining approximately 2.3% higher than the previous year, primarily due to persistent inflation, energy costs, and escalating supply chain issues. Further, as of April 2024, the prices of crude petroleum, unprocessed energy materials, iron and steel, fabricated structural metal products, and steel mill products have surged by more than 50% compared to February 2020.51\nMoving forward, construction companies can collaborate closely with suppliers to understand risks well in advance, seek alternative sourcing options, and implement digital technologies. In the short term, some construction companies (particularly global companies) are considering local vendors for sourcing options. Additionally, while typically project-specific and not a historical trend, construction firms may purchase supplies across projects to unlock more competitive pricing by sourcing common materials from a smaller, consolidated supply base.\nImplementing digital supply chain technologies can allow construction companies to connect with suppliers in real time and can provide greater visibility and control over the supply chain by streamlining internal processes and improving overall efficiency. These proactive approaches can potentially address downtime during disruptions and manage lead time, finances, and customer confidence.\nFinally, industrial manufacturing companies are, in a sense, expanding their supply base by making substantial investments in their own capabilities. On the one hand, companies are adding new manufacturing sites or capacity to meet potential demand. On the other, they are enhancing their product capabilities and demand responsiveness by investing in new equipment and technologies, including advanced machinery such as 3D printers and specialized machines.\nEnhancing product capabilities goes beyond hardware as companies are introducing an array of software solutions. Industrial manufacturers are using technologies and digital solutions to enhance operational and supply chain resilience and increase visibility across the value chain.\nManufacturers are building digital twins of the supply chain for essential components, which can assist in identifying alternative suppliers or boosting robustness and agility to reduce dependency. As supply chains restructure, manufacturers are likely to find digitalization critical to help ensure visibility throughout supplier tiers. Deloitte\u2019s 2023 \u201cExploring the industrial metaverse\u201d revealed that 21% of those companies surveyed are incorporating metaverse technologies to improve their supply chain ecosystems.52\nDiving into specific technological applications, a study conducted by Augury revealed that supply chain management and optimization is the top use case for artificial intelligence, as reported by 41% of surveyed respondents.53 Further, the 2024 Material Handling Industry Annual Industry Report showed that respondents identified logistics, shipping and transportation, supplier selection and due diligence, and inventory management as the top three applications of AI.54\nThe modernization of existing facilities, incorporation of advanced technologies (both hardware and software), and support for suppliers to meet current demand are strategic moves that can help strengthen the supply chain for manufacturers and suppliers. (For thoughts on the aerospace and defense industry, see sidebar, \u201cThe aerospace and defense industry may further embrace agile supply chains digital technologies to meet projected demand increase.\u201d)\nThe aerospace and defense industry may further embrace agile supply chains digital technologies to meet projected demand increase\nThe aerospace industry faced significant challenges in meeting post-pandemic demand due to supply chain disruptions. Suppliers may need to be more agile moving forward to capture demand and may consider investing in emerging technologies and smart factory solutions to address supply chain challenges and optimize production capacity.\nInvesting in digital technologies can also provide greater supply chain visibility, foster innovation, and strengthen stakeholder relationships. These investments could improve efficiency and competitiveness, ultimately leading to cost and operational benefits.\nThe next phase of supply chains: Maximizing resilience while maintaining margins\nThe restructuring of the industrial manufacturing supply base reflects the sector\u2019s resilience and adaptability, particularly in the face of external uncertainties. Companies across the sector are continuously seeking opportunities to maximize resilience while keeping margins high. They are finding motivations for restructuring through delivery performance, cost reductions, and government incentives, all aimed at profitable growth.\nAs technology continues to advance, industrial manufacturing and construction companies are maintaining one eye on the future while working to ensure their supply systems of the past. Many new government policies are incentivizing advanced technology or products for future demand. However, these companies should maintain their procurement processes for legacy items. To do this, industrial manufacturing and construction companies are leveraging a multitude of strategies, ranging from diversifying their suppliers and seeking new agreements to bringing capabilities in-house and implementing digital technologies, all in an effort to help create resilient and efficient supply chains.\nChange your Analytics and performance cookie settings\nto access this feature.\nBY\nJim Kilpatrick\nCanadian Consumer Products Industry Leader\nCanada\nJim is the Global Supply Chain & Network Operations Leader for Deloitte Consulting, and the leader for Consumer Products Industry in Canada.

A critical issue for 2024 is whether they will continue to heal and bring down goods inflation. Supply chains are transforming in the face of global fracturing and frequent disruptions; that transformation will mean more fragile supply chains for the foreseeable future. This article looks at five key trends that are shaping supply chains\u2019 impacts on the global economy in 2024:\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Increased focus of central banks on supply chain operations: Pandemic-era disruptions of supply chains made it evident that supply chains have become a potential source of inflation for the global economy. Though the jury is still out as to how much supply-driven inflation will factor into central bankers\u2019 decisions, several officials from the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have begun to discuss supply chains and their role in driving inflation. Supply chains and their operations will be more closely scrutinized by central bankers. We have raised our expectations for the Federal Reserve\u2019s terminal rate to 2.875%, as well as other central bank\u2019s terminal rates, on the expectation that supply chains, combined with demographics and demand components, could put a floor under inflation.\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Transportation flexibility: Supply chain managers are emphasizing flexibility in their logistics, rather than in their sources of supply. For example, the Baltimore bridge collapse had a significant impact on maritime and trucking logistics. The spike in congestion following the tragedy had doubled or tripled some truckers\u2019 route times as there are few alternatives to going through Baltimore. To mitigate the impact, truckers were permitted to work longer hours while waiting for the trucking channel to be restored; rail companies ran more trains between Baltimore and New York; freight forwarders added more capacity and the Ports of Virginia and New York absorbed diverted cargo. The need for flexibility cannot always be met when we struggle to ramp up capacity. Air carriers are expecting a record-breaking year given the disruptions in maritime shipping and the growth in demand for de minimis shipments from e-commerce platforms. Cargo commitments for airlines operating from Asia to the US and Europe are already tight; air cargo traffic is expected to grow 5% in 2024.\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A new operational norm for maritime: The Red Sea shipping crisis and the increase in shipping around the Cape of Good Hope have spurred companies to preempt disruptions. Increased costs from disruptions are being baked into maritime shipping rates at a faster pace than in the past. The supply chain disruptions from both the 2003 SARS outbreak and the Covid-19 pandemic took over a year to absorb; the Red Sea shipping costs took only a few weeks before total global maritime capacity was cut by about 15%. New rounds of tariffs from the US on products like semiconductors and electric vehicles prompted a rush of imports to stock up under the wire. Spot maritime rates rose 50% month-over-month in May as importers rushed to stock up on affected products and get orders in early for the holiday season, both increasing goods demand from China.\n4.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 More frequent disruptions: 2024 will continue to be a year of more frequent disruptions to supply chains from labor, geopolitics, cyber attacks and climate change.\no\u00a0\u00a0 Disruptions have become more frequent from labor strikes. Potential longshoremen strikes later this year in the US on the East Coast and Gulf ports, as well as ongoing farmers\u2019 strikes in multiple regions have added to capacity issues.\no\u00a0\u00a0 Geopolitical conflict, particularly in key corridors or pinch points of supply, is an ongoing risk. The conflict in the Middle East has led to the ongoing Red Sea shipping crisis.\no\u00a0\u00a0 Cyber strikes have risen in frequency; annual monetary damages as reported by the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center rose to $12.5 billion in 2023, a 21% increase from 2022. That compares to just $3.5 billion in 2019 prior to the pandemic.\no\u00a0\u00a0 Damages and disruptions from weather-related disasters remain at the forefront; ongoing disruptions continue from droughts, fires, flooding and La Ni\u00f1a.\no\u00a0\u00a0 The 2024 hurricane season will likely be \u201cone of the most active on record\u201d with 25 named storms and 12 hurricanes forecasted.\n5.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) review comes into focus: We have seen a growing trend of supply chain realignment toward closer geopolitical allies (\u201cnear-shoring\u201d and \u201cfriend-shoring\u201d) in the wake of the pandemic disruptions and the Russia-Ukraine war. Mexico has been the clear winner in the race to secure US supply chains, but the 2024 election year will be key to learning the fate of these investments in Mexico as they could be affected by the USMCA free trade deal\u2019s sunset review on July 1, 2026. If one or more of the three parties does not renew the agreement in 2026, that will kick off the process of conducting joint reviews every year, potentially accelerating toward a 2036 expiration. Sectors that require significant cross-border investment, like vehicle and semiconductor production, are heavily impacted by this uncertainty. All three countries will have different government leaders at the table for the 2026 meetings. The US presidential election in November is particularly influential; the US will likely have the largest sway in the review process, which makes who the president is sitting at the negotiating table crucial.\nThe latter half of 2024 is expected to be bumpy for supply chains as geopolitical tensions, weather disasters and labor strikes continue to unfold.\nMeagan Schoenberger, KPMG Senior Economist\nBottom Line:\nCentral banks have begun to cut interest rates, but the glide path is much slower than expected. One of the issues has been the US and the healing of supply chains and whether that can continue. The latter half of 2024 is expected to be bumpy for supply chains as geopolitical tensions, weather disasters and labor strikes continue to unfold. More frequent supply chain disruptions have increased the need for agility among importers and logistics companies.\nSubscribe to insights from KPMG Economics\nKPMG Economics distributes a wide selection of insight and analysis to help businesses make informed decisions.\nExplore more\nGlobal Navigator from KPMG Economics\nAnatomy of an oil shock\nKPMG Economics\nA source for unbiased economic intelligence to help improve strategic decision-making.\nStronger dollar contributes to trade deficit\nWe expect trade to be a drag on growth.\nMeet our team\nThank you\nSubscribe to insights from KPMG Economics\nBy submitting, you agree that KPMG LLP may process any personal information you provide pursuant to KPMG LLP's Privacy Statement.\nKPMG.

      "California State\nEnergy Profile\nCalifornia Quick Facts\nLast Updated: May 16, 2024\nData\nLast Update: August 15, 2024 |\nNext Update: September 19, 2024\nAnalysis\nLast Updated: May 16, 2024\nOverview\nCalifornia has the largest economy in the nation, with a nearly $3.9 trillion GDP in 2023, and the fifth-largest in the world for the seventh year in a row.1,2 About one in nine U.S. residents live in California, and it is the most populous state in the nation.3 California also uses more energy than any other state except Texas.4 However, energy efficiency efforts have helped make California's per capita energy use the fourth lowest in the nation.5,6 California has abundant renewable energy resources, including solar energy, hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and biomass, and the state produces more electricity using renewable energy than every other state but Texas.7 California is also rich in mineral resources. Long known for gold and other precious minerals, the state has the nation's only rare earths mine.8 Additionally, California has significant crude oil reserves, and the state's petroleum refineries have one-tenth of the nation's total crude oil refining capacity.9,10\nPer capita residential and commercial sector energy use in California is lower than in all other states except Hawaii.\nCalifornia stretches two-thirds of the way up the U.S. West Coast. At its greatest distances, it is more than 1,000 miles long and 500 miles wide.11 With such great distances to travel, transportation accounts for the largest share of the state's energy consumption.12 Californians have more registered motor vehicles and travel more vehicle miles than residents in any other state.13 California accounts for one-tenth of U.S. motor gasoline consumption and about one-seventh of the nation's jet fuel consumption.14,15 Overall, the state's transportation sector accounts for nearly two-fifths of California's total energy consumption. The industrial sector uses about one-fourth of the state's total energy, the residential sector accounts for one-fifth, and the commercial sector uses slightly less than one-fifth.16 However, per capita energy consumption in both the residential and commercial sectors is lower than in all other states except Hawaii.17 Although California has a varied climate, most of the state's more densely populated areas are relatively mild for much of the year.18,19 Changes in weather patterns and climate have resulted in an increased use of cooling and almost three-fourths of California households have air conditioning.20,21\nElectricity\nCalifornia is the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth-largest electricity producer.\nIn 2023, California was the nation's fourth-largest electricity producer and accounted for about 5% of all U.S. utility-scale (1-megawatt and larger) power generation.22 Renewable resources, including hydropower and small-scale (less than 1-megawatt) customer-sited solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, supplied 54% of California's total in-state electricity generation in 2023. Natural gas-fired power plants provided 39% of the state's total net generation.23 Nuclear power's share of California's total electricity generation was about 7%. The state has one operating commercial nuclear power plant\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe two-reactor Diablo Canyon facility.24,25\nIn 2023, California was the nation's second-largest conventional hydroelectric power producer after Washington, and it is consistently among the nation's top four hydropower producers.26,27 Hydropower's contribution is highly variable and is dependent on rain and snowfall. After a very wet year in California in 2023, led in part by the highest mountain snowpack since the mid-1980s, the state's annual hydropower generation increased by more than 80% from 2022.28,29,30 Nonhydroelectric renewable resources, mainly solar and wind energy, provided 41% of California's total in-state electricity generation in 2023. Coal fuels only a small amount of California's in-state net generation, all of it from one 57-megawatt industrial cogeneration plant.31,32\nCalifornia imports more electricity than any other state and typically receives between one-fifth and one-third of its electricity supply from outside of the state.33 However, in 2023, in-state utility-scale electricity generation equaled about 90% of California's electricity sales, and the rest of the state's power supply came from out of state.34 Wildfires in California and surrounding states threaten both imports of electricity and transmission within the state.35\nAlthough California consumes more electricity than all other states except Texas and Florida, it uses less electricity per capita than any other state but Hawaii.36,37 In 2023, California had the nation's second-highest average price of electricity, after Hawaii.38 The commercial sector accounted for 47% of California's electricity sales in 2023. The residential sector, where three in ten California households use electricity for home heating, accounted for 35% of sales.39 About 18% of the state's electricity sales went to the industrial sector. Light rail, subways, and the iconic cable cars in California's transportation sector accounted for less than 0.3% of electricity use.40\nCalifornia has led the states in the most electric vehicles (EVs) and EV charging locations every year since 2016.41 California is part of the West Coast Green Highway, an extensive network of electric vehicle DC fast charging locations located along Interstate 5. The state has about 15,300 public charging locations.42,43 In 2022, California had about 783,000 registered battery electric vehicles, the most of any state.44 California also requires all public transit agencies to gradually transition to 100% zero-emission bus (ZEB) fleets. Beginning in 2029, all transit agency new bus purchases must be ZEBs.45\nRenewable energy\nCalifornia is the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top producer of electricity from solar and geothermal energy.\nCalifornia is second in the nation, after Texas, in total electricity generation from renewable resources. The state is the nation's top producer of electricity from solar energy and geothermal resources. In 2023, California was the nation's second-largest producer of electricity from biomass, after Georgia, and also the second-largest producer of conventional hydroelectric power, after Washington.46\nSolar energy is the largest source of California's renewable electricity generation.47 The state's greatest solar resources are in California's southeastern deserts, where all of its solar thermal facilities and several of its largest solar PV plants are located. However, there are solar PV facilities throughout the state.48 In 2023, utility-scale solar energy supplied 16% of the state's total electricity net generation. When small-scale solar generation is included, solar energy provided 28% of the state's total electricity generation.49 At the beginning of 2024, California had nearly 20,000 megawatts of utility-scale solar power generating capacity, more than any other state. When small-scale solar panel generating systems are included, the state had almost 36,500 megawatts of total solar capacity.50\nIn 2023, wind accounted for 6% of California's total in-state electricity generation, and the state ranked eighth in the nation in wind-powered generation.51,52 California wind power potential exists at several areas around the state, both onshore and offshore.53 The majority of the state's wind turbines are in six major wind resource areas: Altamont, East San Diego County, Pacheco, Solano, San Gorgonio, and Tehachapi.54 At the beginning of 2024, California had about 6,200 megawatts of wind capacity.55 The first wind power farm on California's coast, with 27 turbines and 95 megawatts of capacity, came online in Santa Barbara County at the beginning of 2024.56\nCalifornia is the nation's top producer of electricity from geothermal resources. In 2023, the state produced 67% of the nation's utility-scale geothermal-sourced electricity, and geothermal power accounted for about 4% of the state's total in-state generation.57,58 The state's operating geothermal power plants have a combined total capacity of nearly 1,900 megawatts.59 Four areas in California have substantial geothermal resources\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe coastal mountain ranges north of San Francisco, volcanic areas of north-central California, areas near the Salton Sea in southern California, and areas along the state's eastern border with Nevada. The Geysers, located in the Mayacamas Mountains north of San Francisco, is the largest complex of geothermal power plants in the world and has about 725 megawatts of installed generating capacity.60,61\nSuperheated geothermal brines in the Salton Sea geothermal resource area in southern California contain lithium, a critical mineral used to manufacture rechargeable batteries.62,63 The state has the only rare earth mine in North America. The Mountain Pass mine in southern California's Mojave Desert is the largest deposit of rare earth elements in the nation. Rare earths are used in the manufacture of electric vehicles, wind turbines, and batteries, among other applications.64,65 In 2023, the Mountain Pass mine produced almost 42,000 metric tons of rare earth concentrate, accounting for about 12% of global rare earth production.66,67\nCalifornia ranks second in the nation, after Georgia, in the most utility-scale electricity generation from biomass.68 In 2023, biomass fueled 2% of the state's total net generation, and more than half of that was from wood and wood-derived fuels.69 Nearly three-fifths of the state's 1,121 megawatts of utility-scale biomass generating capacity is fueled by wood and wood waste. Landfill gas, municipal solid waste, and other biomass sources fuel the remaining biomass capacity.70 California's biomass resources also provide feedstock to the two wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the state. Those plants can produce about 168,000 tons of pellets per year. Wood pellets are used for heating but can also be used for electricity generation.71 About 173,000 California households use wood as their primary fuel for space heating.72\nCalifornia consumes 1.4 billion gallons of fuel ethanol annually, which is one-tenth of the nation's fuel ethanol supply and 11 times more than the 128 million gallons that the state's three fuel ethanol plants can produce annually.73,74 Midwestern states provide most of the additional fuel ethanol California uses.75 California can produce a combined 80 million gallons of biodiesel annually from 4 production plants, which is about one-fourth of the nearly 282 million gallons of biodiesel consumed in the state each year.76,77 Several California petroleum refineries have added renewable diesel production, derived from biomass, manufacturing capacity.78,79 California accounts for 97% of the nation's renewable diesel consumption.80\nCalifornia's renewable portfolio standard (RPS), enacted in 2002 and revised several times since, required that 33% of electricity retail sales in California come from eligible renewable resources by 2020. The state met that goal three years before the target date.81 The RPS also requires that 60% of electricity sales come from renewables by 2030, and 100% by 2045.82 In 2022, the state legislature set intermediate targets of 90% renewable energy and zero-carbon electricity by the end of 2035 and 95% by the end of 2040 on the way to the eventual target of 100% by 2045.83\nPetroleum\nCalifornia was the seventh-largest crude oil producer among the states in 2023 and accounted for almost 2.5% of the nation's total onshore and offshore oil production.84 Although California's annual crude oil production has steadily declined from its peak of 394 million barrels in 1985, the state produced 112 million barrels of crude oil in 2023.85 Reservoirs along California's Pacific Coast, including in the Los Angeles basin, and those in the state's Central Valley contain major crude oil reserves, and the state holds about 3% of the nation's total proved crude oil reserves.86,87\nAssessments of California's offshore areas indicate the potential for large, undiscovered recoverable crude oil resources in the federally administered Outer Continental Shelf.88 However, in 1994, concerns about the risks of offshore crude oil and natural gas development resulted in a permanent moratorium on new offshore oil and natural gas leasing in state waters.89 Congress imposed a federal moratorium on oil and natural gas leasing in California federal waters in 1982, but it expired in 2008.90 No new California offshore federal lease sales have occurred since then, although there are 22 older crude oil and natural gas production platforms that remain active in federal waters and 11 in state waters off the coast of California.91,92,93\nForeign suppliers provide three-fifths of the crude oil refined in California.\nCalifornia has one-tenth of the nation's total crude oil refining capacity and ranks third after Texas and Louisiana.94 A network of pipelines connects California crude oil production to the state's 14 operating petroleum refineries, which are located primarily in the Los Angeles area, the San Francisco Bay area, and the San Joaquin Valley.95,96,97 As crude oil production in California and Alaska declined, the state's refineries increased their supply from foreign oil imports.98,99 Led by Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil, foreign suppliers provided three-fifths of the crude oil refined in California in 2023.100,101\nCalifornia requires that motorists use, at a minimum, a specific blend of motor gasoline called CaRFG (California Reformulated Gasoline) to reduce emissions from motor vehicles. California refineries produce cleaner fuels in order to meet state environmental regulations. Refineries in the state often operate at or near maximum capacity because of the high demand for those petroleum products and the lack of interstate pipelines that can deliver those cleaner fuels into the state. When unplanned refinery outages occur, the lack of CaRFG deliveries available from interstate pipelines means replacement supplies of CaRFG come in by marine tanker from out-of-state U.S. refineries or from other countries. It can take several weeks to find and bring replacement motor gasoline from overseas that meets California's unique specifications.102,103\nCalifornia is the nation's second-largest consumer of refined petroleum products, after Texas, and accounts for about 9% of U.S. total consumption.104 California is the nation's largest consumer of jet fuel and the second-largest consumer of motor gasoline, after Texas.105,106 The transportation sector uses about 85% of the petroleum consumed in the state. The industrial sector accounts for about 11% of state petroleum use, and the commercial sector consumes about 3%. The residential sector, where about 500,000 California households heat with petroleum products, mostly propane, uses about 1%. A small amount of petroleum is used for electricity generation.107,108\nNatural gas\nMost of California's natural gas reserves and production are in fields in the northern portion of the state's Central Valley.109 California's natural gas output has declined steadily since 1985, and the state now accounts for less than 1% of the nation's total natural gas reserves and production.110,111 California's natural gas production is less than one-tenth of the state's total consumption.112,113 Several interstate natural gas pipelines enter California from Arizona, Nevada, and Oregon and bring natural gas into California from the Southwest, the Rocky Mountain region, and western Canada.114 Although a small amount of natural gas is exported to Mexico, California consumes more than four-fifths of the natural gas delivered to the state.115 Some natural gas that enters the state is placed in California's 14 underground natural gas storage fields that together can hold about 600 billion cubic feet of natural gas, which accounts for about 7% of the nation's storage capacity.116\nCalifornia is the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest natural gas consumer, after Texas.\nCalifornia is the nation's second-largest natural gas consumer. Only Texas uses more.117 In 2023, about 32% of the natural gas delivered to California consumers went to the state's electric power sector, where it fuels about two-fifths of the state's total electricity generation.118,119 The industrial sector made up 31% of the state's natural gas consumption. The residential sector, where six in ten California households use natural gas for home heating, accounted for 23% of natural gas use. The commercial sector consumed about 13%, and the transportation sector used about 1% as compressed natural gas vehicle fuel.120,121\nCoal\nCalifornia does not have any coal reserves or production and has very little coal-fired electricity generation. All the generation is from one industrial facility in Trona, California.122,123 Almost all the coal consumed in California arrives by rail and truck from mines in Colorado and Utah. A small amount comes from Pennsylvania.124 In 2023, some coal produced in other states was exported to other countries from California ports.125\nEnergy on tribal lands\nCalifornia has the largest Native American population in the nation at about 535,000, and the state is home to more than 100 federally recognized tribal groups.126,127 Although tribal areas exist throughout California, they account for less than 1% of the state's land area.128,129 Many of the tribal lands are small, including the nation's smallest reservation, the 1.32-acre parcel that contains the Pit River Tribe cemetery.130 The largest is the forested Hoopa Valley Reservation, home of the Hupa people, in northern California's Humboldt County, with 102,000 acres.131,132\nCalifornia's diverse climate and geography give tribes access to a variety of renewable energy resources. One of the first utility-scale wind projects on tribal land in the nation is in southern California. In 2005, the Campo Kumeyaay Nation in southern California leased some of its land in San Diego County for the development of a 50-megawatt wind project.133,134 The Ramona Band of Cahuilla became one of the first tribes to make its reservation independent of the regional electric grid in 2009.135 In 2015, the Bear River Band of the Rohnerville Rancheria in Northern California became the first California tribe to install a hybrid solar, wind, and advanced energy storage microgrid for power generation.136\nSome reservations in California have abundant biomass potential. The Blue Lake Rancheria Tribe in Humboldt County has a 175-kilowatt biogas fuel cell system powered by gasified wood waste from the forestry industry.137,138 In 2019, the Rancheria extended use of its microgrid to the broader community, about 10% of the county's population, during a widespread wildfire-related utility power shutoff in northwest Humboldt County.139 In 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) awarded the Karuk Tribe $2 million to build a nearly 1 megawatt ground-mounted solar panel system and battery energy storage in northern California.140 In addition to the tribes that have abundant solar, wind, and biomass resources, some California tribal lands have geothermal electricity generation potential, particularly in the Imperial Valley in southern California, the Geysers area in northern California, and along the state's eastern border.141\nThe California Energy Commission (CEC) awarded a total of $2 million in grants to 10 Native American tribes in early 2021. The grants supported climate and energy planning efforts on tribal lands and in tribal communities, including studies related to the development of renewable resources, microgrids, and energy storage systems.142 In 2022, the CEC awarded one of its largest grants, $31 million, to the Viejas Tribe of Kumeyaay Indians for a long-duration energy storage system that will provide renewable backup power for the tribe. It will support statewide grid reliability in the event of an emergency.143 Since 2010, DOE has invested more than $21 million in about 40 California tribal renewable energy and energy efficiency projects.144\nEndnotes\n1 U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Regional Data, GDP and Personal Income, Annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by State, SAGDP2 GDP in current dollars, All Areas, All industry

Solar and wind account for more of our nation\u2019s energy mix than ever before.\nTo study America\u2019s growing renewable electricity capacity and generation, Climate Central analyzed historical data on solar and wind energy over a 10-year period (2014 to 2023).\nThe analysis shows that the amount of electricity produced from solar and wind power increased across the U.S. Our nation generated 238,121 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from solar in 2023 \u2014 more than eight times the amount generated a decade earlier in 2014. Wind power has more than doubled this decade, with 425,325 GWh coming from wind installations across the country in 2023. Together, these two renewable energy sources generated enough electricity in 2023 to power the equivalent of more than 61 million average American homes.\nThe most solar power generation came from California (68,816 GWh) and Texas (31,739 GWh) in 2023. Texas also led the country in power generated from wind (119,836 GWh).\nThese data \u2014 combined with federal capacity forecasts \u2014 show how renewable energy growth is driving America\u2019s progress toward net-zero carbon emissions targets in the U.S.\nThis report and supplementary data show:\nHow much solar and wind power increased from 2022 to 2023\nGrowth trends in solar and wind power over the past decade (2014-2023)\nWhich states are the biggest producers of solar and wind energy\nDownload the dataSee the full report\nRelated Climate Matters briefs including state-level graphics:\nA Decade of Solar Growth\nIndex\nIntroductionSolarSolar-powered States in 2023A Decade of Solar Growth Across the U.S., 2014-2023WindWind-powered States in 2023A Decade of Wind Growth Across the U.S., 2014-2023Clean Energy Growth Relative to U.S. Climate TargetsMethodology\nIntroduction #\nRenewable energy from solar panels and wind turbines is increasingly important in the United States, as costs for these technologies continue to rapidly decline. As the power grid grows to meet increasing electricity demand in the coming decades, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that most of the nation\u2019s new energy capacity will come from renewables like solar and wind \u2013 shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.\nLow-carbon renewable energy sources such as solar and wind provide electricity without producing heat-trapping gases or other air pollutants. Renewable energy projects create jobs, support local economies, and help meet U.S. commitments to reduce carbon pollution.\nSolar and wind are the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the U.S. In 2019, wind generation surpassed the amount of electricity generated from hydropower \u2014 a longtime leader in renewable energy. In 2022, solar overtook hydropower for the first time. Solar and wind energy will lead the growth in U.S. power generation for at least the next two years, according to EIA estimates.\nThis report uses data from the EIA to analyze solar and wind capacity and generation over the past decade (2014 to 2023) in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Recent data are compared across states and against historical figures to show which states have led growth in solar and wind energy.\nThe key terms in this report \u2014 capacity and generation \u2014 gauge renewable energy in the U.S.\nCapacity reflects the number and size of operational solar and wind installations. Renewable energy in the U.S. comes from both large utility-scale power plants and small-scale installations (which have less than 1 megawatt of capacity).\nGeneration reflects how much electricity is produced by those installations, which depends on the weather and number of daily sunlight hours.See Box 1. Key Terms for more details.\nTogether, capacity and generation data provide insight into renewable energy growth, by showing the new capacity that comes online each year as well as the amount of electricity generated with new installations.\nDownload datasets with all variables included in this report.\nCapacity: measure of the maximum rate at which electricity can be generated by equipment on the ground, reported here in megawatts (MW) for state totals and gigawatts (GW) (equal to 1,000 MW) for national totals.\nGeneration: the amount of electricity produced over a period of time, reported here in gigawatt-hours (GWh) (equal to 1,000 megawatt-hours). For reference, the average American household consumed 10.8 MWh of electricity in 2022.\nSmall-scale installations: power operations with less than 1 MW of capacity, usually located onsite or near where the electricity is used (e.g., residential rooftop solar panels or community solar projects). Note: The only small-scale installations discussed in this report are for solar power.\nUtility-scale installations: power plants with at least 1 MW of capacity.\nLearn more about U.S. electricity capacity and generation from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n01 / 01\nSOLAR #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 gigawatts from utility- and small-scale solar installations \u2014 an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 238,121 GWh of electricity from utility- and small-scale solar installations combined. This is an increase of 33,042 GWh or 16% compared to 2022.\nFigure 1: National solar electricity generation (GWh) in 2023 by state\nThe EIA considers a solar installation to be \u201csmall-scale\u201d if it has less than 1 MW of capacity. Most residential or commercial rooftop solar installations are small-scale, along with most community solar projects (those that provide electricity to multiple residents or businesses in an area).\nSmall-scale solar installations account for an estimated 48 GW (around 34%) of all solar capacity in the U.S. at the end of 2023. Nearly 8 GW of new small-scale solar capacity was brought online in 2023, representing a record 20% increase compared to 2022.\nDuring the past decade, small-scale solar capacity and generation have grown steadily, but at a slower pace than utility-scale. Small-scale capacity in 2023 was more than six times the amount compared to 2014; utility-scale saw an eight-fold increase. The EIA estimates that small-scale solar capacity could grow to 55 GW by the end of 2024.\nSmall-scale solar produced an estimated 73,619 GWh or about 31% of all solar generation in 2023 \u2014 compared to 164,502 GWh generated by utility-scale installations.\nCalifornia generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023, which accounts for around 41% of the state's total solar electricity generation for the year. On the East Coast, New York generated the most electricity from small-scale solar in 2023 (3,973 GWh) \u2014 accounting for nearly 62% of electricity generated from solar that year in the state. In the middle of the country, wind is typically a bigger source of electricity than solar; however, Illinois was the 10th highest small-scale solar generating state in 2023, with 1,536 GWh of electricity from small-scale operations \u2014 accounting for 44% of the state\u2019s solar electricity.\nUtility-scale solar accounts for around 8% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources (including renewables, nuclear, [1] and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas). In 2023, nearly4% of electricity in the U.S. was produced by utility-scale solar. A decade earlier in 2014, it accounted for less than 0.5% of the total electricity generated.\nCalifornia and Nevada are among the states for which utility-scale solar comprises a significant portion of the current electricity mix. In 2023, utility-scale solar contributed 19% (40,714 GWh) of electricity in California and 23% (9,733 GWh) of the electricity in Nevada.\nNevada\u2019s capacity for solar power is projected to increase during 2024, as the Gemini solar facility is scheduled to come online. The facility will add a planned 690 MW of solar capacity and 380 MW of battery storage \u2013 which is one way solar power facilities can capture and store some energy to meet evening electricity demand. It\u2019s expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational.\nNote: These data reflect total utility-scale energy sources only and exclude small-scale solar.\nSolar energy projects are bringing jobs and skills training to Nevada.

This means there was nearly eight times more solar capacity in 2023 than in 2014.\nThe amount of electricity produced from solar increased at a similar rate. In 2023, the U.S. generated over eight times more electricity from solar energy than in 2014 \u2014 an increase of more than 209,197 GWh or 723%.\nThe states with the most significant growth in solar capacity over the last 10 years include: California, which added 27,864 MW from 2014 to 2023; Texas (18,179 MW); Florida (10,203 MW); North Carolina (6,416 MW); and Nevada (4,313 MW).\nThese five states saw the most growth in generation, too (Table 2).

Seasonal weather plays an important role. The amount of electricity generated is influenced, in part, by when the sun shines or the wind blows.\nSolar generation in the U.S. peaks in the summer, when days are long and the sun\u2019s rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly. In 2023, solar electricity produced from utility- and small-scale installations (combined) peaked (Figure 3) in July (26,626 GWh) and August (25,372 GWh).\nWind energy generation is typically highest during the spring. In 2023, the most wind energy was produced across the U.S. in March (44,580 GWh) and April (43,072 GWh) (Figure 4).\n01 / 01\nFigure 3: Monthly solar generation (GWh) in the U.S. in 2023.

WeatherPower data provide a snapshot of solar and wind energy across the U.S., at local scales, on any given day. It can be used to generate figures relevant to any state, media market, county, or congressional district in the continental U.S.\nThis WeatherPower graphic shows estimates and forecasts for solar generation in North Carolina in March 2024.\nWIND #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 148 GW from utility-scale onshore and offshore wind installations \u2014 an increase of 6 GW or 4% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 425,235 GWh of electricity from utility-scale wind installations. This represents a slight drop of 9,062 GWh or 2% compared to 2022 due to lower average wind speeds, mostly in the Midwest.\nMost wind energy in the U.S. is produced onshore, in the middle of the country. However coastal states can take advantage of offshore winds to generate electricity. Offshore wind currently makes up a small portion of the national electricity mix, but it has the potential to grow substantially in the coming decades.\nIn 2023, only two states (Rhode Island and Virginia) had operational offshore wind facilities, which contributed 42 MW to the total national wind capacity (148 GW). Offshore wind capacity has already grown early in 2024. Vineyard Wind, a wind installation off the coast of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, began operating in February 2024 with 68 MW of capacity. This facility will have 800 MW of capacity when fully operational, which could happen as soon as late 2024. In March 2024, South Fork Wind Farm off the coasts of New York and Rhode Island began operating with around 130 MW of capacity \u2014 making it the country\u2019s largest operational offshore wind installation.\nRising costs have challenged the economic viability of offshore wind installations, delaying some projects. Financial incentives such as those in the Inflation Reduction Act could ease some of the economic burden. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, state policies are poised to support development of nearly 43 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040.

Arizona\u2019s capacity increased by 39% (238 MW added), and New York\u2019s by 25% (557 MW added).\nState\nWind Capacity (MW) 2023\nChange in Wind Capacity\n2022 to 2023\nWind Generation (GWh) 2023\nChange in\nWind Generation\n2022 to 2023\nTexas\n40,652\n3%\n119,836\n4%\nIowa\n12,803\n3%\n41,869\n-9%\nOklahoma\n12,245\n6%\n37,731\n0%\nKansas\n9,043\n10%\n27,462\n-7%\nIllinois\n7,874\n12%\n22,054\n-6%\nUnited States total\n147,640\n4%\n425,235\n-2%\nA Decade of Wind Growth Across the US 2014-2023 #\nThe U.S. added more than 83 GW of wind capacity during the last decade \u2014 an increase of around 130%. This means that wind capacity more than doubled from 2014 to 2023 (Figure 6).\nThe amount of electricity produced from wind increased at a similar rate. In 2023, the U.S. generated more than twice as much electricity from wind energy than in 2014 \u2014 an increase of 243,580 GWh or 134%.\nThe states with the most significant growth in wind capacity during this decade include: Texas, which added 26,658 MW from 2014 to 2023; Oklahoma (8,466 MW); Iowa (7,241 MW); Kansas (6,074 MW); and Illinois (4,347 MW).\nFour out of these five states saw the most growth in generation, too (Table 4). Present-day wind generation reflects these strong historical growth trends, as there is overlap with the highest wind-generating states in 2023.\nFigure 6: National wind capacity (GW) by year (2014-2023)\nTable 4.

As part of its commitment, the U.S. has set the following goals:\nBy 2030: reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels\nBy 2035: reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity\nBy 2050: achieving a net-zero emissions economy\nRecent landmark laws are fostering renewable energy growth and moving the U.S. toward its climate goals. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) contains hundreds of billions of dollars to boost clean energy and cut emissions. The IRA includes provisions such as tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives for renewable energy projects from the utility-scale to individual households.\nThe Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT), a project led by Princeton University scientists, estimates the potential impact of these policies, and tracks progress towards U.S. climate targets.By 2030, REPEAT estimates U.S. net annual emissions could be as low as 4.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2e), compared to 6.6 Gt CO2e in 2005: a reduction of around 40% compared to 2005 levels. Although this represents significant progress, the U.S. would still fall short of its 2030 target (50% below 2005 levels) (Figure 7).Solar and wind energy are key to reducing emissions and reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. If current policies are taken advantage of, a boom in solar and wind energy capacity is expected based on REPEAT analysis. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority (more than 50%) of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (Figure 8).In 12 states, wind and solar could make up over 80% of electricity capacity by 2035 by utilizing current policies. And New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming could have over 90% of their electricity capacity from wind and solar by 2035.\nExplore more data: State Solar and Wind Boom to Bring U.S. Toward Climate Targets\nMethodology #\nAll national and state-level data come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values for 2014-2022 are as reported in EIA\u2019s Historical State Data for each year. For 2023, utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values are for December 2023 as reported in EIA\u2019s Electric Power Monthly. Small-scale solar capacity for 2014-2022 are for December of each year, as reported in form EIA-861M. All generation values (wind, utility- and small-scale solar) for 2014-2022 come from EIA\u2019s electricity data browser.\nTo calculate the portion of total capacity and electricity generation contributed by solar and wind (as a percentage), we compared electricity capacity/generation for utility-scale solar and wind to all fuel sources and all energy sectors at the utility-scale level, which includes: renewable sources; nuclear; and fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar and wind 10-year growth is a direct comparison between capacity/generation in 2014 and 2023.\nClimate Central is an independent group of scientists and communicators who research and report the facts about our changing climate and how it affects people\u2019s lives.\nClimate Central is a policy-neutral 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\nNewsletter signup\nLooking for Climate Matters?

California Independent System Operator\n\nThe California Independent System Operator (CAISO), the grid operator for most of the state, is increasingly curtailing solar- and wind-powered electricity generation as it balances supply and demand during the rapid growth of wind and solar power in California.\nGrid operators must balance supply and demand to maintain a stable electric system. The output of wind and solar generators are reduced either through price signals or rarely, through an order to reduce output, during periods of:\n\nCongestion, when power lines don\u2019t have enough capacity to deliver available energy\nOversupply, when generation exceeds customer electricity demand\n\nIn CAISO, curtailment is largely a result of congestion. Congestion-related curtailments have increased significantly since 2019 because solar generation has been outpacing upgrades in transmission capacity.\n\nData source: California Independent System Operator\n\nIn 2022, CAISO curtailed 2.4 million megawatthours (MWh) of utility-scale wind and solar output, a 63% increase from the amount of electricity curtailed in 2021. As of September, CAISO has curtailed more than 2.3 million MWh of wind and solar output so far this year.\nSolar accounts for almost all of the energy curtailed in CAISO\u201495% in 2022 and 94% in the first seven months of 2023. CAISO tends to curtail the most solar in the spring when electricity demand is relatively low (because moderate spring temperatures mean less demand for space heating or air conditioning) and solar output is relatively high.\n\nData source: California Independent System Operator\n\nCAISO has increasingly curtailed renewable generation as renewable capacity has grown in California. In 2014, a combined 9.0 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar capacity had been built in California. As of July 2023, that number had grown to 17.6 GW. Developers plan to add another 3.0 GW by the end of 2024.\nCAISO is exploring and implementing various solutions to its increasing curtailment of renewables, including:\nThe Western Energy Imbalance Market (WEIM) is a real-time market that allows participants outside of CAISO to buy and sell energy to balance demand and supply. In 2022, more than 10% of total possible curtailments were avoided by trading within the WEIM. A day ahead market is expected to be operational in Spring 2025.\nCAISO is expanding transmission capacity to reduce congestion. CAISO\u2019s 2022\u201323 Transmission Planning Process includes 45 transmission projects to accommodate load growth and a larger share of generation from renewable energy sources.\nCAISO is promoting the development of flexible resources that can quickly respond to sudden increases and decreases in demand such as battery storage technologies. California has 4.9 GW of battery storage, and developers plan to add another 7.6 GW by the end of 2024, according to our survey of recent and planned capacity changes. Renewable generators can charge these batteries with electricity that would otherwise have been curtailed.\nPrincipal contributors: Lori Aniti, Susanna Smith\nTags: generation, electricity, wind, solar, California, states\nMore recent articles \u203a\n\nAbout EIA\nOpen Data\nPress Room\nCareers\nContact Us\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration\n1000 Independence Ave., SW\nWashington, DC 20585\n\nSources & Uses\nPetroleum\nCoal\nNatural Gas\nRenewable\nNuclear\nElectricity\nConsumption\n\nTotal Energy\n\n\nTopics\n\nAnalysis & Projections\nEnvironment\nMarkets & Finance\nEnergy Disruptions\nToday in Energy\nGeography\nStates\nCountries\n\nMaps\n\n\nTools\n\nA-Z Index\nAll Reports & Publications\nData Tools, Apps, and Maps\nEIA Survey Forms\nEIA Beta\n\nOpen Source Code\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPrivacy/Security\nCopyright & Reuse\nAccessibility\nInformation Quality\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA)\n\nLearn about the Department of Energy\u2019s Vulnerability Disclosure Program\n\n\nRelated Sites\n\nU.S. Department of Energy\n\nUSA.gov\n\n\nStay Connected\n\nFacebook\nX\nYoutube\nFlickr\nLinkedIn\nEmail Updates\nRSS Feeds\n"

The natural resources, fuels and essential products produced here cement America\u2019s energy security, fortify Texas\u2019 economic strength and advance global stability at a time when our energy leadership has never been more crucial,\u201d he said.\n$26.3 billion in state and local tax revenue and royalties from the Texas oil and natural gas industry translates to an extraordinary $72 million every day that pays for Texas\u2019 public schools, universities, roads, first responders and other essential services. Several sources of tax revenue from oil and natural gas surged in FY 23 including state and local sales taxes paid by the industry, which rose by $1.6 billion, an indicator of the industry\u2019s ongoing investment in Texas. Property taxes paid by the oil and natural gas industry rose another $1.8 billion, as property values of oil and natural gas-bearing mineral properties more than doubled in a single year.\nIn 2023, 99 percent of the state\u2019s oil and natural gas royalties were deposited into the Permanent School Fund and the Permanent University Fund, which support Texas public education. Each fund received $1.8 billion. Out of FY 2023\u2019s production taxes paid, the Economic Stabilization (\u201cRainy Day\u201d) Fund, or ESF, and the State Highway Fund (SHF) each received $3.3 billion. Since its inception in 1987, the Rainy Day Fund has received over $31.2 billion from oil and natural gas production taxes. All of these are funded almost exclusively with taxes and state royalties paid by the oil and natural gas industry.\nIn FY 2023, Texas school districts received $2.81 billion in property taxes from mineral properties producing oil and natural gas, pipelines, and gas utilities. Counties received an additional $885.6 million in these property taxes.\nPecos-Barstow-Toyah ISD in West Texas ranked #1 receiving $275.2 million in these property taxes. Reeves County ranked #1 with $98.9 million paid in oil and natural gas property taxes \u2013 more than double its total from fiscal year 2022.\nSince 2007, when TXOGA first started compiling this data, the Texas oil and natural gas industry has paid more than $230.3 billion in state and local taxes and state royalties, a figure that does not include the hundreds of billions of dollars in payroll for some of the highest paying jobs in the state, taxes paid on office buildings and personal property, and the enormous economic ripple effect that benefits other sectors of the economy.\nIn 2023, the industry employed more than 480,000 Texans who earned an average of $124,000 a year \u2013 nearly twice the average paid by the rest of Texas\u2019 private sector. Conservative estimates indicate that each of these jobs generates approximately two more jobs, with more than 1.4 million total jobs supported across the Texas economy. Some economists say this number could be as high as three more jobs supported and total over 2 million jobs in Texas.\n\u201cThis type of unmatched, repeat economic performance does not happen by accident,\u201d said Staples. \u201cSuccess is the result of non-stop industry innovation, investment and operational efficiencies that shattered a string of oil and natural gas production, supply, refining and export records last year \u2013 all while achieving world-leading environmental progress.\u201d\nTexas hit production records in six of 12 months in 2023, producing as much as 5.6 million barrels per day of crude oil in October 2023 \u2013 more than 42% of the nation\u2019s total and the highest monthly oil production total ever.\nNew record-highs in natural gas marketed production occurred in seven of 12 months in 2023, and in October eclipsed 1.0 trillion cubic feet in a single month for the first time ever, accounting for nearly 30% of the nation\u2019s production.\nTexas refineries set two new processing records in 2023: Texas refineries processed a record 5.6 million barrels of crude oil per day in July 2023.\u00a0 And as Texas produced and exported record amounts of natural gas liquids (NGLs) in 2023, refineries also utilized record amounts of NGLs.\nStaples noted the United States is not only the world\u2019s number one producer of oil and natural gas \u2013 with Texas at the front \u2013 but the nation also leads the world in emissions reductions. \u201cNo one produces, transports, and refines oil and natural gas with the same commitment to safety and protecting the environment as American producers. Industry-led initiatives like the Texas Methane & Flaring Coalition and The Environmental Partnership are dramatically reducing emissions and achieving environmental gains unseen anywhere else in the world.\u201d\nIn addition to its economic impact for Texas, Staples described the Texas oil and natural gas industry\u2019s contribution to global stability: \u201cWith so much uncertainty in the world, the need for reliable, responsibly produced energy from a stable trading partner has never been more crucial. Texas is that trade partner. Our producers, pipelines, refineries, and exporters answer the call to alleviate the global energy crisis, made worse by war.\u201d\u00a0\nStaples noted Texas\u2019 liquified natural gas (LNG) exports to Europe \u2013 6.8 billion cubic feet per day in FY23 \u2013 more than doubled from 2.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) in 2021 \u2013 and subsequently reached a record-high 8.1 bcf/d in October 2023. \u201cAs a result, our allies are less dependent on hostile nations and their people benefit from the safety, security and opportunity made possible by reliable energy from Texas,\u201d he said.\nStaples asserted, \u201cGrowth like we\u2019ve seen in Texas is not only unprecedented, it is not guaranteed. We cannot take for granted that this industry can continue to rewrite its record book in the face of federal policies blatantly designed to undermine progress.\u00a0 Delayed permits, canceled pipeline projects, closed and delayed federal leasing programs and incoherent regulations hurt American consumers and stifle our ability to deliver energy freedom and security around the world.\u00a0\n\u201cAt the state level, even as the #1 oil and natural gas state in the world\u2019s leading energy nation, Texas has some challenges to address if we want to maintain position as a global energy leader.\u201d Staples described Permian Basin producers\u2019 need for infrastructure and more power generation as they electrify their operations. \u201cNo other major industry has to rely on temporary sources of electricity, like portable generators, for their electricity needs and neither some of the most prolific oil producers in the world,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA growing Texas needs more pipelines and a cost-effective electrical power generation market that puts consumers\u2019 needs first and incentivizes dispatchable power,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must prioritize transparency and accountability as the foundation of our electrical grid to continue attracting jobs and investment here.\u201d\nStaples continued, \u201cWe need policy that allows Texas to lead the emerging carbon capture and storage industry (CCS). Manufacturers and companies of all varieties, including Texas oil and natural gas producers, pipeline, and refiners, are working to lower their emissions profile to meet customer demands. Texas must demonstrate a commitment to advance CCS because it benefits landowners and enables Texas businesses to remain competitive.\u201d\nStaples concluded, \u201cWe know that policy can promote prosperity or hinder it. We look forward to working with our lawmakers to ensure that the American energy leadership that starts in Texas, stays in Texas.\u201d\nStay Updated\nGet quick updates in our e\u2011newsletter.\nRelated Updates\nNovember 15, 2024\nTXOGA Lone Star Energy Forum Features 66th U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Governor Greg Abbott\nTHE WOODLANDS \u2013 The Texas Oil & Gas Association\u2019s (TXOGA) Lone Star Energy Forum in The Woodlands showcased innovation and the state, national and global leadership of the Texas oil and natural gas industry.\nNovember 11, 2024\nEpisode 17: Election Recap\nIn this episode, TXOGA President Todd Staples and Shana Joyce, Vice President of Government and Regulatory Affairs, are joined by U.S. Oil & Gas Association...\nNovember 1, 2024\nOctober: TXOGA Month in Review\nCheck out our Month in Review for September below to see how TXOGA was busy advocating for the Texas oil and natural gas industry\nOctober 18, 2024\nTexas Oil and Natural Gas Upstream Jobs Grew  by 800 in September\nAUSTIN \u2013 Newly-released data from the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) indicates that upstream oil and natural gas employment rose by an additional 1,700 jobs in September.

The world\u2019s demand for electricity grew by 2.2% in 2023, less than the 2.4% growth observed in 2022. While China, India and numerous countries in Southeast Asia experienced robust growth in electricity demand in 2023, advanced economies posted substantial declines due to a lacklustre macroeconomic environment and high inflation, which reduced manufacturing and industrial output.\nGlobal electricity demand is expected to rise at a faster rate over the next three years, growing by an average of 3.4% annually through 2026. The gains will be driven by an improving economic outlook, which will contribute to faster electricity demand growth both in advanced and emerging economies. Particularly in advanced economies and China, electricity demand will be supported by the ongoing electrification of the residential and transport sectors, as well as a notable expansion of the data centre sector. The share of electricity in final energy consumption is estimated to have reached 20% in 2023, up from 18% in 2015. While this is progress, electrification needs to accelerate rapidly to meet the world\u2019s decarbonisation targets. In the IEA\u2019s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C, electricity\u2019s share in final energy consumption nears 30% in 2030.\nElectricity consumption from data centres, artificial intelligence (AI) and the cryptocurrency sector could double by 2026. Data centres are significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an estimated 460 terawatt-hours\u00a0(TWh) in 2022, data centres\u2019 total electricity consumption could reach\u00a0more than 1\u00a0000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent to the electricity consumption of Japan. Updated regulations and technological improvements, including on efficiency, will be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data centres.\nAbout 85% of additional electricity demand through 2026 is set to come from outside advanced economies, with China contributing substantially even as the country\u2019s economy undergoes structural changes. In 2023, China\u2019s electricity demand rose by 6.4%, driven by the services and industrial sectors. With the country\u2019s economic growth expected to slow and become less reliant on heavy industry, the pace of Chinese electricity demand growth eases to 5.1% in 2024, 4.9% in 2025 and 4.7% in 2026 in our forecasts. Even so, the total increase in China\u2019s electricity demand through 2026 of about 1\u00a0400\u00a0TWh is more than half of the European Union\u2019s current annual electricity consumption. Electricity consumption per capita in China already exceeded that of the European Union at the end of 2022 and is set to rise further. The rapidly expanding production of solar PV modules and electric vehicles, and the processing of related materials, will support ongoing electricity demand growth in China while the structure of its economy evolves.\nChange in electricity demand by region, 2022-2026\nChina provides the largest share of global electricity demand growth in terms of volume, but India posts the fastest growth rate through 2026 among major economies.\u00a0Following a 7% increase in India\u2019s electricity demand in 2023, we expect growth above 6% on average annually until 2026, supported by strong economic activity and expanding ownership of air conditioners. Over the next three years, India will add electricity demand roughly equivalent to the current consumption of the United Kingdom. While renewables are set to meet almost half of this demand growth, one-third is expected to come from rising coal-fired generation. We also expect Southeast Asia to see robust annual increases in electricity demand of 5% on average through 2026, led higher by strong economic activity.\nWhile electricity use per capita in India and Southeast Asia is rapidly rising, it has been effectively stagnant in Africa for more than three decades. Per capita consumption in Africa even declined in recent years as the population grew faster than electricity supply was made available, and we only expect it to recover to its 2010-15 levels by the end of 2026 at the earliest. Thirty years ago, a person in Africa consumed more electricity on average than someone living in India or Southeast Asia. However, strong increases in electricity demand and supply in India and Southeast Asia in recent decades \u2013 which have gone hand in hand with a boom in economic development \u2013 have transformed these regions at a spectacular pace. Meanwhile, Africa's per capita electricity consumption in 2023 was half that of India and 70% lower than in Southeast Asia. Our forecast for Africa for the 2024-26 period anticipates average annual growth in total electricity demand of 4%, double the mean growth rate observed between 2017 and 2023. Two-thirds of this growth in demand is set to be met by expanding renewables, with the remainder covered mostly by natural gas.\nElectricity demand in the United States fell by 1.6% in 2023 after increasing 2.6% in 2022, but it is expected to recover in the 2024-26 outlook period. A key reason for the decline was milder weather in 2023 compared with 2022, though a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was also a factor. We forecast a moderate increase in demand of 2.5% in 2024, assuming a reversion to average weather conditions. This will be followed by growth averaging 1% in 2025\u201126, led by electrification and the expansion of the data centre sector, which is expected to account for more than one-third of additional demand through 2026.\nElectricity demand in the European Union declined for the second consecutive year in 2023, even though energy prices fell from record highs. Following a 3.1% drop in 2022, the 3.2% year-on-year decline in EU demand in 2023 meant that it dropped to levels last seen two decades ago. As in 2022, weaker consumption in the industrial sector was the main factor that reduced electricity demand, as energy prices came down but remained above pre-pandemic levels. In 2023, there were also signs of some permanent demand destruction, especially in the energy-intensive chemical and primary metal production sectors. These segments will remain vulnerable to energy price shocks over our outlook period.\nEU electricity consumption is not expected to return to 2021 levels until 2026 at the earliest. Electricity demand in the European Union\u2019s industrial sector fell by an estimated 6% in 2023 after a similar decline in 2022. Assuming the industrial sector gradually recovers as energy prices moderate, EU electricity demand growth is forecast to rise by an average 2.3% in 2024-26. Electric vehicles, heat pumps and data centres will remain strong pillars of growth over the period \u2013 together accounting for half of expected gains in total demand.\nEstimated drivers of change in electricity demand in the European Union, 2021-2026\nElectricity prices for energy-intensive industries in the European Union in 2023 were almost double those in the United States and China. Despite an estimated 50% price decline in the European Union in 2023 versus 2022, energy-intensive industries in the region continued to face far higher electricity costs compared with the United States and China in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The price gap between energy-intensive industries in the European Union and those in the United States and China, which already existed before the energy crisis, has widened. As a result, the competitiveness of EU energy-intensive industries is expected to remain under pressure. Policy makers are currently discussing new policy initiatives and financial instruments to enable the European Union to position itself among other global industrial heavyweights. The scope and effectiveness of these measures will likely determine the future of the European Union\u2019s energy-intensive industrial sector.\nRecord-breaking electricity generation from low-emissions sources \u2013 which includes nuclear and renewables such as solar, wind and hydro \u2013 is set to cover all global demand growth over the next three years. Low-emissions sources, which will reduce the role of fossil fuels in producing electricity globally, are forecast to account for almost half of the world\u2019s electricity generation by 2026, up from 39% in 2023. Over the next three years, low-emissions generation is set to rise at twice the annual growth rate between 2018 and 2023 \u2013 a consequential change, given that the power sector contributes the most to global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions today.\nChanges in global electricity generation, 2022-2026\nRenewables are set to provide more than one-third of total electricity generation globally by early 2025, overtaking coal. The share of renewables in electricity generation is forecast to rise from 30% in 2023 to 37% in 2026, with the growth largely supported by the expansion of ever cheaper solar PV. Through this period, renewables are set to more than offset demand growth in advanced economies such as the United States and the European Union, displacing fossil-fired supply. At the same time, in China, the rapid expansion of renewable energy sources is expected to meet all additional electricity demand, though the weather and the extent to which the country\u2019s demand growth eases remain key sources of uncertainty for the outlook. The strong expansion in renewable power capacity must also be accompanied by accelerated investment in grids and system flexibility to ensure its smooth integration.\nThe rapid growth of renewables, supported by rising nuclear generation, is set to displace global coal-fired generation, which is forecast to fall by an average of 1.7% annually through 2026. This follows a 1.6% increase in coal-fired output in 2023 amid droughts in India and China that reduced hydropower output and increased coal-fired generation, more than offsetting strong declines in coal-fired generation in the United States and the European Union. The major factor that will determine the global outlook is evolving trends in China, where more than half of world\u2019s coal-fired generation takes place. Coal-fired generation in China is currently on course to experience a slow structural decline, driven by the strong expansion of renewables and growing nuclear generation, as well as moderating economic growth. Despite the commissioning of new plants to boost the security of energy supply, the utilisation rate of Chinese coal-fired plants is expected to continue to fall as they are used more flexibly to complement renewables. Nevertheless, coal-fired generation in China will be influenced significantly by the pace of the economy\u2019s rebalancing, hydropower trends, and bottlenecks in integrating renewables into the country\u2019s power system.\nNatural gas-fired generation is expected to rise slightly over the outlook period. In 2023, sharp declines in gas-fired power generation in the European Union were more than offset by massive gains in the United States, where natural gas, which has increasingly replaced coal, recorded its highest-ever share in power generation. Global gas-fired output grew by less than 1% in 2023. Through 2026, we forecast an average annual growth rate of around 1%. While gas-fired output in Europe is expected to continue declining, global growth will be supported by significant gains in Asia, the Middle East and Africa amid rising demand for power in these regions and the availability of additional liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply from 2025 onward.\nBy 2025, global nuclear generation is forecast to exceed its previous record set in 2021. Even as some countries phase out nuclear power or retire plants early, nuclear generation is forecast to grow by close to 3% per year on average through 2026 as maintenance works are completed within France, Japan restarts nuclear production at several power plants, and new reactors begin commercial operations in various markets, including China, India, Korea, and Europe. Many countries are making nuclear power a critical part of their energy strategies as they look to safeguard energy security while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the COP28 climate change conference that concluded in December 2023, more than 20 countries signed a joint declaration to triple nuclear power capacity by 2050. Achieving this goal will require tackling the key challenge of reducing construction and financing risks in the nuclear sector. Momentum is also growing behind small modular reactor (SMR) technology. The technology\u2019s development and deployment remains modest and is not without its difficulties, but R&D is starting to pick up.\nEvolution of nuclear power generation by region, 1972-2026\nAsia remains the main driver of growth in nuclear power, with the region\u2019s share of global nuclear generation forecast to reach 30% in 2026. Asia is set to surpass North America as the region with the largest installed nuclear capacity by the end of 2026, with a large number of plants currently under construction expected to be completed by then. More than half of new reactors expected to become operational during the outlook period are in China and India. Nuclear power has seen particularly strong growth in China over the past decade, with capacity additions of about 37\u00a0gigawatts (GW), equivalent to almost two-thirds of its current nuclear capacity. This resulted in China\u2019s share in global nuclear generation rising from 5% in 2014 to about 16% in 2023. China started the commercial operation of its first fourth-generation reactor in December 2023, further underscoring the country's nuclear power advances.\nGlobal CO2 emissions from electricity generation are expected to fall by more than 2% in 2024 after increasing by 1% in 2023. This is set to be followed by small declines in 2025 and 2026. The strong growth in coal-fired power generation in 2023 \u2013 especially in China and India amid reduced hydropower output \u2013 was responsible for the rise in the global electricity sector\u2019s CO2 emissions. As clean electricity supply continues to expand rapidly, the share of fossil fuels in global generation is forecast to decline from 61% in 2023 to 54% in 2026, falling below 60% for the first time in IEA records dating back to 1971. While extreme weather conditions, economic shocks, or changes in government policies could lead to a temporary rise in emissions in individual years, the broader decline in power sector emissions is expected to persist as renewables and nuclear power capacity continue to expand and displace fossil-fired generation.\nCO2 emissions from electricity generation in China, 2014-2026\nGlobal CO2 emissions from electricity generation, 2014-2026\nCO2 emissions from electricity generation in selected regions, 2014-2026\nCO2 emissions from electricity generation in India and Southeast Asia, 2014-2026\nThe CO2 intensity of global electricity generation is set to fall at twice the rate recorded in the pre-pandemic period. The forecasted average decline of 4% in CO2 intensity between 2023 and 2026 is double the 2% observed in the period between 2015 and 2019. The European Union is expected to record the highest rate of progress in reducing emissions intensity, averaging an improvement of 13% per year. This is followed by China, with annual improvements forecast at 6%, and the United States at 5%. The decline in the CO2 intensity of electricity generation means that emissions savings via the electrification of transport, heating and industry will become even more substantial.\nWholesale electricity prices in many countries fell in 2023 from the record highs observed in 2022. This took place in tandem with declines in prices for energy commodities such as natural gas and coal. There are, however, regional differences. Wholesale electricity prices in Europe declined on average by more than 50% in 2023 from record levels in 2022. Despite this, prices in Europe were still roughly double 2019 levels, whereas US prices in 2023 were only about 15% higher than in 2019. Uncertainty about both the pace of France\u2019s nuclear recovery and natural gas prices are supporting higher futures prices in Europe for upcoming winters. The hydropower-dominated Nordics remain the only market in Europe with average wholesale electricity prices comparable to those in the United\u00a0States and Australia. Wholesale prices in Japan and India also remained above 2019 levels in 2023.\nQuarterly average wholesale prices for selected regions, 2019-2025\nGlobal hydropower generation declined in 2023 due to weather impacts such as droughts, below average rainfall and early snowmelts in numerous regions. Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Mexico, T\u00fcrkiye, the United States, and Vietnam, along with other countries, all saw hydropower generation decline. The global hydropower capacity factor, a key measure of utilisation rate, fell to below 40%, the lowest value recorded in at least three decades. In certain countries, diminished hydropower output led to energy shortages, heightened reliance on fossil sources such as coal and gas, and raised concerns about the stability of electricity supply. The overall trend underscores the susceptibility of hydropower to weather patterns and the potential exposure of countries that rely heavily on hydro to generate electricity. Diversifying energy sources, building regional power interconnections and implementing strategies for resilient generation in the face of changing weather patterns will be increasingly important.\nExtreme weather events triggered major power outages in 2023 in the United States and India. This underlined the need to boost resilience as weather impacts on power systems increase, with both supply and demand becoming more weather-dependent. Insufficient power capacity, fuel supply challenges and grid-related technical issues also continued to cause significant power shortages in many regions. The majority of these outages were observed in emerging economies such as Pakistan, Kenya and Nigeria, which are particularly affected by insufficient electricity supply, infrastructure problems and strained grids in the face of rising power demand. Expanded, stronger grids would not only ensure reliable electricity but also serve as a vital backbone for integrating renewables into power systems. Improving data collection, digitalisation and greater data transparency regarding outages is also essential to provide better insight into why faults occurred and to help develop preventative measures.\nSpecific operating measures and new markets for ensuring the stability of power systems are becoming more common. Countries with high shares of variable renewable generation are implementing mechanisms to ensure a steady power system frequency. Some regions are establishing minimum requirements for system inertia, a property typically provided by conventional generators with spinning rotors that helps enhance the power system\u2019s resilience during disturbances. Additionally, various countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia have been introducing markets and measures such as fast frequency response and similar services that stabilise the power system rapidly after disruptions. Battery storage systems can provide such services for grid stability while enhancing system flexibility, thus playing a crucial role in integrating renewable energy sources.\nGet updates on the IEA\u2019s latest news, analysis, data and events delivered twice monthly.\nThank you for subscribing.

Demand rose by almost 2% compared with the 2.4% average growth rate seen over the period 2015-2019. The electrification of the transport and heating sectors continued to accelerate globally, with record numbers of electric vehicles and heat pumps sold in 2022 contributing to growth. Nevertheless, economies around the world, in the midst of recovering from the impacts of Covid-19, were battered by record-high energy prices. Soaring prices for energy commodities, including natural gas and coal, sharply escalated power generation costs and contributed to a rapid rise in inflation. Economic slowdowns and high electricity prices stifled electricity demand growth in most regions around the world.\nGlobal and regional percentage changes in electricity demand, 2019-2025\nElectricity consumption in the European Union recorded a sharp 3.5% decline year-on-year (y-o-y) in 2022 as the region was particularly hard hit by high energy prices, which led to significant demand destruction among industrial consumers. Exceptionally mild winter added further downward pressure on electricity consumption. This was the EU\u2019s second largest percentage decrease in electricity demand since the global financial crisis in 2009 \u2013 with the largest being the exceptional contraction due to the Covid-19 shock in 2020.\nElectricity demand in India and the United States rose, while Covid restrictions affected China\u2019s growth. China\u2019s zero-Covid policy weighed heavily on its economic activity in 2022, and a degree of uncertainty remains over the pace of its electricity demand growth. We currently estimate it to be 2.6% in 2022, substantially below its pre-pandemic average of over 5% in the 2015-2019 period. Further data expected in due course will provide greater clarity on trends in China in 2022, which could also have implications for the global picture. Electricity demand in India rose by a strong 8.4% in 2022, due to a combination of its robust post-pandemic economic recovery and exceptionally high summer temperatures. The United States recorded a significant 2.6% y-o-y demand increase in 2022, driven by economic activity and higher residential use to meet both heating and cooling needs amid hotter summer weather and a colder-than-normal winter.\nYear-on-year change in electricity demand by region, 2019-2025\nRenewables and nuclear energy will dominate the growth of global electricity supply over the next three years, together meeting on average more than 90% of the additional demand. China accounts for more than 45% of the growth in renewable generation in the period 2023-2025, followed by the EU with 15%. The substantial growth of renewables will need to be accompanied by accelerated investments in grids and flexibility for their successful integration into the power systems. The increase in nuclear output results from an expected recovery in French nuclear generation as more plants complete their scheduled maintenance, and from new plants starting operations, largely in Asia.\nGlobal electricity generation from both natural gas and coal is expected to remain broadly flat between 2022 and 2025. While gas-fired generation in the European Union is forecast to decline, significant growth in the Middle East will partly offset this decrease. Similarly, drops in coal-fired generation in Europe and the Americas will be matched by a rise in Asia Pacific. However, the trends in fossil-fired generation remain subject to developments in the global economy, weather events, fuel prices and government policies. Developments in China, where more than half of the world\u2019s coal-fired generation occurs, will remain a key factor.\nChanges in global electricity generation by source, 2021-2025\nChina\u2019s share of global electricity consumption is forecast to rise to one-third by 2025, compared with one-quarter in 2015. Over the next three years, more than 70% of the growth in global electricity demand is set to come from China, India and Southeast Asia combined. Emerging and developing economies\u2019 growth is accompanied by a corresponding rise in demand for electricity. At the same time, advanced economies are pushing for electrification to decarbonise their transportation, heating and industrial sectors. As a result, global electricity demand is expected to grow at a much faster pace of 3% per year over the 2023-2025 period compared with the 2022 growth rate. The total increase in global electricity demand of about 2 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) out to 2025 is more than double Japan's current annual electricity consumption. Nevertheless, uncertainties exist regarding the growth of electricity demand in China. While the country recently eased its stringent Covid restrictions in early December 2022, the full extent of the economic impacts remain unclear.\nGlobal CO2 emissions from electricity generation grew in 2022 at a rate similar to the 2016-2019 average. Their increase of 1.3% in 2022 is a significant slowdown from the staggering 6% rise in 2021, which was driven by the rapid economic recovery from the Covid shock. Nonetheless, electricity generation-related CO2 emissions reached a record high in 2022.\nChanges in global emissions of electricity generation, 2015-2025\nThe share of renewables in the global power generation mix is forecast to rise from 29% in 2022 to 35% in 2025. As renewables expand, the shares of coal- and gas-fired generation are set to fall. As a result, emissions of global power generation will plateau to 2025 and its CO2 intensity will further decline in the coming years.\nDue to historic drought conditions, hydropower generation in Europe was particularly low in 2022. Italy saw a drop in hydropower generation of more than 30% compared with its 2017-2021 average, followed closely by Spain. Similarly, France recorded a 20% decline in its hydro output compared with the previous five-year average.\nNuclear generation in the European Union was 17% lower in 2022 than in 2021 due to closures and unavailabilities. Plant closures in Germany and Belgium reduced the available nuclear capacity in 2022. At the same time, France faced record-low nuclear availability due to ongoing maintenance work and other challenges in its nuclear fleet. The constrained nuclear output and low hydropower supply in Europe \u2013 combined with reduced dispatchable capacity due to previous retirements of thermal generation plants \u2013 put additional pressure on remaining dispatchable capacities to meet demand. As a result, although variable renewable generation grew and record-high gas prices supported fuel-switching from gas to coal, gas-fired generation grew in 2022 by 2% in the European Union. These factors have also contributed to significant changes in the traditional import-export structure of electricity in Europe: France became a net importer and the United Kingdom a net exporter for the first time in decades.\nIn order to increase the security of electricity supply, reserve capacities of conventional power generation have been brought back in Europe for the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 winters. Similarly, some plants that were previously set to be decommissioned were also extended. Germany had the highest share of such plants in Europe, having delayed the planned shutdown of its three remaining nuclear reactors, as well as delaying the closure or reactivating fossil-fired plants that make up 15% of its current fossil-fired generation capacity. An increased risk of power outages was reported in some European countries during several weeks of cold weather combined with lower-than-average hydro and nuclear output. Security of supply was achieved through successful short-term planning and management.\nAfter 2021, 2022 marks the highest percentage growth in CO2 emissions of EU power generation since the oil crises of the 1970s, recording a 4.5% year-on-year growth. Excluding the 2021 post-pandemic rebound, the European Union also saw in 2022 the highest absolute growth in power generation emissions since 2003. This was mainly due to a rise in coal-fired generation of more than 6% in stark contrast to the almost 8% average annual rate of decline in coal-fired generation over the pre-pandemic period of 2015-2019.\nThe setback in the European Union will be temporary, however, as power generation emissions are expected to decrease on average by about 10% annually through 2025. Both coal- and gas-fired generation are expected to see sharp falls, with coal declining by 10% and gas by almost 12% annually on average over the outlook period as renewables ramp up and nuclear generation recovers.\nThe increase in wholesale electricity prices was most pronounced in Europe in 2022, where they were, on average, more than twice as high as in 2021. The exceptionally mild winter so far in 2022/23 in Europe has helped temper wholesale electricity prices, but they remain high compared with recent years. Elevated futures prices for winter 2023/24 reflect the uncertainties regarding gas supply in Europe over the coming year.\nIn the European Union, a wide range of responses to the energy crisis have been observed. In order to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and to increase resilience to price shocks, the European Commission published its REPowerEU plan in May 2022 to accelerate clean energy deployment. At the same time, discussions about electricity market design gained momentum due to soaring wholesale prices, and the Commission launched a consultation on market design reform. To dampen the effects of high electricity prices on consumers, many countries introduced measures such as the regulation of wholesale and retail prices; revenue caps on infra-marginal technologies such as renewables, nuclear and coal- plants; reductions of energy taxes and VAT; and direct subsidies. While such market interventions can help mitigate the impacts of the energy crisis, the potential creation of uncertainty in the investment landscape needs to be minimised to ensure that responses to the crisis do not come at the expense of much-needed investment.\nIndexed quarterly average wholesale prices for selected regions, 2019-2024\nGlobally, higher electricity generation costs in 2022 were driven by surging energy commodity prices. While the cost increases were more moderate in countries with regulated tariffs and long-term fuel supply agreements (oil-indexed LNG, long-term contracts or fuel supply contracts), regions dependent on short-term markets for fuel procurement were severely affected. In particular, record-high LNG prices led to difficulties for South Asian countries trying to procure gas for the power sector, which contributed to blackouts and rationing of electricity in the region. If prices of energy commodities remain elevated, fuel procurement will continue to be a serious issue for emerging and developing economies.\nThe energy crisis has renewed interest in the role of nuclear power in contributing to energy security and reducing the CO2 intensity of power generation. In Europe and the United States, discussions on the future role of nuclear in the energy mix have resurfaced. At the same time, other parts of the world are already seeing an accelerated deployment of nuclear plants. As a result, global nuclear power generation is set to grow on average by almost 4% over 2023-2025, a significantly higher growth rate than the 2% over 2015-2019. This means that in every year to 2025, about 100\u00a0TWh of additional electricity is set to be produced by nuclear power, the equivalent of about one-eighth of US nuclear power generation today.\nMore than half of the growth in global nuclear generation to 2025 comes from just four countries: China, India, Japan and Korea. Among these countries, while China leads in terms of absolute growth from 2022 to 2025 (+58\u00a0TWh), India is set to have the highest percentage growth (+81%), followed by Japan. This results from the Japanese government\u2019s push to ramp up nuclear generation in order to reduce reliance on gas imports and strengthen energy security. Outside Asia, the French nuclear fleet provides more than one-third of the absolute growth in global nuclear generation to 2025 as it gradually recovers.\nIn a world where both the demand and supply of electricity are becoming increasingly weather-dependent, electricity security requires increased attention. Along with the high cost of electricity generation, the world\u2019s power systems also faced challenges from extreme weather events in 2022. In addition to the drought in Europe, there were heatwaves in India, where the hottest March in over a century was recorded, resulting in the country\u2019s highest ever peak in power demand. Similarly, central and eastern China were hit by heatwaves and drought, which caused demand for air conditioning to surge amid reduced hydropower generation in Sichuan. The United States saw severe winter storms in December, triggering massive power outages. Mitigating the impacts of climate change requires faster decarbonisation and accelerated deployment of clean energy technologies. At the same time, as the clean energy transition gathers pace, the impact of weather events on electricity demand will intensify due to the increased electrification of heating, while the share of weather-dependent renewables will continue to grow in the generation mix. In such a world, increasing the flexibility of the power systems while ensuring security of supply and resilience will be crucial.\nGet updates on the IEA\u2019s latest news, analysis, data and events delivered twice monthly.\nThank you for subscribing.

Compared with September 2023, production was 4.6% lower in September 2024 after adjustment for calendar effects.\n\n  Loading...\nSignificant drop in production in the automotive industry\nMany branches of industry showed a negative development of production. In September 2024, the seasonally and calendar adjusted production in the automotive industry, for example, declined by 7.8% compared with the previous month, following an increase of 15.4% in August 2024. The significant fluctuations observed in the automotive industry had a serious impact on the overall development of production in the past months. The production decline registered in the chemical industry (-4.3%) also weighed on overall performance in September 2024. By contrast, production in the manufacture of machinery and equipment (+1.7%) showed a positive development.\nIn September 2024, production in industry excluding energy and construction was down 2.7% from August 2024 after seasonal and calendar adjustment. Within industry, decreases were reported in all three major groups. The production of capital goods declined by 4.0%, the production of intermediate goods fell by 1.6% and the production of consumer goods was down 1.4%. Outside industry, energy production in September 2024 was down 2.1% and production in construction dropped by 1.4% compared with the previous month.\nCompared with September 2023, production in industry excluding energy and construction in September 2024 was down 5.2% after calendar adjustment.\nProduction down in energy-intensive industrial branches\nProduction in energy-intensive industrial branches declined by 3.3% in September 2024 from August 2024, after elimination of seasonal and calendar effects, which is mainly due to a drop in production in the chemical industry. A three-month on three-month comparison showed that production in energy-intensive industrial branches was 2.2% lower in the period from July 2024 to September 2024 than in the previous three-month period. Adjusted for calendar effects, production in energy-intensive industrial branches was down 2.0% in September 2024 compared with September 2023. An analysis on the\u00a0Production index for energy-intensive industrial branches (only in German) is available on the \u201cIndustry, manufacturing\u201d page of the Federal Statistical Office\u2019s website.\nMethodological notes:\nThe differing comparative periods must be taken into account in all press releases on short-term indicators. Short-term economic monitoring focuses on comparisons of seasonally and calendar adjusted figures with those of the previous month or quarter. These reflect short-term economic trends. Year-on-year comparisons of calendar adjusted results enable long-term comparisons of levels and are not influenced by seasonal fluctuations or calendar effects. The results of month-on-month, quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year comparisons may differ considerably due to the Covid-19 crisis and the war in Ukraine.\nThe rates of change are based on the production index for industry. The average figure for 2021 is used as the basis of the index and set to 100 index points (2021 = 100). The X13 JDemetra+ method was used for calendar and seasonal adjustment.\nThe five branches referred to here as \u201cenergy-intensive\u201d have particularly high energy demands in relation to their gross value added. In the reference year of 2021, they collectively accounted for 77% of total industrial energy consumption. Their proportion of industrial gross value added stood at 17%. In 2021, just under one million people (929,599) were employed in the 6,986 industrial establishments of these branches in Germany.\nFor better readability, this press release uses a short form for the names of some economic branches which differs from the designations in the \u201cClassification of Economic Activities (2008 edition)\u201d. An overview of these short forms (only in German) is provided on the \u201cIndustry, manufacturing\" page on the website of the Federal Statistical Office.\nMore information:\nBasic data and long time series on the production index in industry can be found in the table Indices of production in manufacturing (42153-0001) in the GENESIS-Online database. It contains the time series of the production index for energy-intensive industrial branches from 2005 onwards.\nA dossier on the \"Short-term indicators\" page of the Federal Statistical Office's website provides an analysis of the relationship between material shortages, new orders, production and prices in industry. Detailed information on production in energy-intensive industrial branches is available on the \"Industry, manufacturing\" page.\nThe production index is also available on Dashboard Germany at www.dashboard-deutschland.de (only in German) In this data portal, the Federal Statistical Office brings together up-to-date indicators from official statistics producers and other data providers on the topics of the economy, finance, the labour market, construction, housing, energy and Ukraine. The portal also contains the Economic Pulse Monitor tool (Pulsmesser f\u00fcr die Wirtschaft) (only in German) for real-time economic monitoring.\nImportant information regarding the GENESIS-Online database:\nAfter leaving the beta phase, our database's new user interface has been available as the main interface version since 5 November 2024. The new interface offers faster data retrieval and intuitive table search and customisation options. There have also been changes to the structure of the machine-readable flat file (CSV) format and the data output format for table downloads.

However, the country is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels for domestic power production. In 2023, some 25 percent of gross electricity was generated using lignite and hard coal, considered the most polluting of energy sources. Natural gas contributed another 15.5 percent.\nCoal power plant pollution\nCoal plants are the biggest polluters in the European Union. Six out of the 10 most polluting coal-fired power plants in the EU were located in Germany in 2022. Germany's Neurath plant produced some 24 million metric tons of CO\u2082 equivalent that year. Although the government had previously agreed to end its reliance on coal by the year 2030, this fossil fuel made a comeback in 2022 during the global energy crisis.\u00a0\nGermany's move towards renewables\nDespite coal's continued contribution to the power mix, Germany's renewable electricity generation has increased by roughly 70 percent in one decade. Growth within the wind power sector has been especially notable. By 2022, onshore wind farms generated almost 100 terawatt-hours of electricity, while offshore farms produced an additional 25 terawatt-hours.\n\n                        Distribution of energy sources used for gross electricity generation in Germany in 2023\n                    \n\n                                    Additional Information\n                                \n\n                                Show sources information\n                            \n                                Show publisher information\n                            \n                                Use Ask Statista Research Service\n                            \nMarch 2024\nGermany\n2023\nPercentage points exceeding 100 percent are probably due to rounding.\nPercentage points exceeding 100 percent are probably due to rounding.\nOther statistics on the topicNuclear power phase-out in Germany\nEnergy\nPrimary energy consumption in Germany 2019-2023, by fuel\nEnergy\nNuclear power's share of German energy mix in Germany 2000-2023\nEnergy\nGermany's electricity generation from nuclear sources 2005-2023\nEnergy\nEnergy generation outlook in Germany 2040, by source\nTo download this statistic in XLS format you need a Statista Account\nTo download this statistic in PNG format you need a Statista Account\nTo download this statistic in PDF format you need a Statista Account\nTo download this statistic in PPT format you need a Statista Account\nAs a Premium user you get access to the detailed source references and background information about this statistic.\nAs a Premium user you get access to background information and details about the release of this statistic.\nAs soon as this statistic is updated, you will immediately be notified via e-mail.\n\u2026 to incorporate the statistic into your presentation at any time.\nYou need at least a Starter Account to use this feature.\n* For commercial use only\n\n                            Basic Account\n                        \n\n                            Starter Account\n                        \n\n                    The statistic on this page is a Premium Statistic and is included in this account.\n\n                            Professional Account\n                        \n1\n                        All prices do not include sales tax.

      "Japan's GDP grows 0.9% in July-Sept. on solid consumption\n\n\n        \n                    By Satoshi Iizuka,        \n                    KYODO NEWS\n        \n                    -\n        \n                Nov 15, 2024 - 14:14 |  All, Japan\n\nJapan's economy grew an annualized real 0.9 percent in the three months through September, supported by solid consumer spending due to a one-off income tax cut and higher summer bonuses, government data showed Friday, but whether the momentum will continue is unclear.\nReal gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, expanded for the second consecutive quarter, but growth decelerated from the prior quarter's revised 2.2 percent amid sluggish capital spending and exports.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, real GDP increased 0.2 percent from the April-June period. GDP is the total value of goods and services produced in a country.\nPrivate consumption, which accounts for more than half of the economy, rose 0.9 percent, marking the second consecutive quarter of increase, the Cabinet Office said in a preliminary report.\nConsumer spending rose as vehicle sales grew after the resumption of some domestic auto plants that were halted due to noncompliant vehicle tests. A surge in emergency food buying also contributed as people stockpiled after an August advisory on a potential megaquake along the Nankai Trough, the Cabinet Office said.\n\"Private spending has accelerated from the April-June period, due to special factors, including the tax cut and summer bonuses,\" Shinichiro Kobayashi, a senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, said. The government implemented the income and residence levy reduction worth 40,000 yen ($255) per person in June.\nBut Kobayashi cast doubt on whether the upward momentum would continue into the next quarter or later without those special positive factors, as consumers tend to tighten their purse strings amid rising prices.\nA recent weakening of the yen could rekindle concerns over a surge in imported product prices, with the Japanese currency falling to a four-month low against the U.S. dollar in the 156 level on Friday.\nReal wages, which take into account the impact of inflation, dropped for the second consecutive month in September after rising in June and July, even as domestic companies agreed to their biggest wage hikes in three decades during this year's labor-management negotiations.\nAmong other key components of GDP, capital investment declined 0.2 percent, after an expansion in the previous quarter, the report said. Japanese companies curbed investment in manufacturing machinery amid concerns over the outlook for the global economy, a Cabinet Office official said.\nExports were up 0.4 percent, compared with a rise of 2.6 percent in the previous quarter, amid a lull in the number of foreign travelers to Japan.\nJapan has benefited from an influx of overseas visitors, fueled in part by a weaker yen that makes travel and shopping in the country more affordable. Their spending is considered an export in the GDP data.\nMeanwhile, imports, whose growth impacts GDP negatively, saw an uptick of 2.1 percent, boosted by demand for overseas-made smartphones.\nAs for foreign factors, \"it is necessary to keep tabs on various uncertain factors, including a slowdown in the Chinese economy and economic policies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump,\" Kobayashi said.\nAnalysts said that Trump's proposed policies, including tax cuts, may drive up inflation and broaden the U.S.-Japan interest rate gap, strengthening the dollar against the yen and denting Japanese consumer spending through higher import costs.\nNominal GDP increased 0.5 percent from the previous quarter, or 2.1 percent at an annualized rate.\nRelated coverage:\nJapan's GDP growth surprisingly strong per working-age adult: study\nBOJ keeps rates on hold, Ueda tempers another hike speculation\nBOJ likely to forgo rate hike amid concerns over borrowing cost rise\n\n            Nov 15, 2024\n                            | KYODO NEWS\n\nPopular\nAmerican man arrested for defacing Tokyo's Meiji Jingu shrine\n\n                    Nov 13, 2024\n                                            | KYODO NEWS\n\nJapan minor party head apologizes for \"uterus removal\" remark\n\n                    Nov 10, 2024\n                                            | KYODO NEWS\n\nIshiba formally reelected as Japan PM, eyes minority gov't\n\n                    Nov 12, 2024\n                                            | KYODO NEWS\n\nJapan's Princess Yuriko, great-aunt of emperor, dies at 101\n\n                    Nov 15, 2024\n                                            | KYODO NEWS\n\nJapanese comedian drops suit vs. publisher over sex scandal report\n\n                    Nov 8, 2024\n                                            | KYODO NEWS\n\nMore from Japan\nKyodo News Digest: Nov. 18, 2024\n\n        27 minutes ago\n                | KYODO NEWS\n\nMt.

It represents all the energy required to supply end users in the country. Some of these energy sources are used directly while most are transformed into fuels or electricity for final consumption.\nEnergy production includes any fossil fuels drilled and mined, which can be burned to produce electricity or used as fuels, as well as energy produced by nuclear fission and renewable power sources such as hydro, wind and solar PV. Bioenergy - which here includes both modern and traditional sources, including the burning of municipal waste - is also an important domestic energy source in many countries.\nImports, particularly of fossil fuels like oil, natural gas and coal, make up an important part of the energy supply in many countries. Countries that rely heavily on imported energy may be vulnerable to supply disruption from external events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. In countries that export large amounts of energy, falling energy prices can also cause major economic shocks.\nEnergy sources, particularly fossil fuels, are often transformed into more useful or practical forms before being used. For example, crude oil is refined into many different kinds of fuels and products, while coal, oil and natural gas can be burned to generate electricity and heat. Other forms of transformation, such as extracting gas or oil from coal, play a relatively minor role in the energy systems of most countries.\nOne of the most important types of transformation for the energy system is the refining of crude oil into oil products, such as the fuels that power automobiles, ships and planes.\nAnother important form of transformation is the generation of electricity. Thermal power plants generate electricity by harnessing the heat of burning fuels or nuclear reactions \u2013 during which up to half of their energy content is lost. Renewable power sources generate electricity directly from natural forces such as the sun, wind, or the movement of water.\nTotal final consumption (TFC) is the energy consumed by end users such as individuals and businesses to heat and cool buildings, to run lights, devices, and appliances, and to power vehicles, machines and factories. It also includes non-energy uses of energy products, such as fossil fuels used to make chemicals.\nSome of the energy found in primary sources is lost when converting them to useable final products, especially electricity. As a result, the breakdown of final consumption can look very different from that of the primary energy supply (TES). Both are needed to fully understand the energy system.\nThe sectoral breakdown of a country's energy demand, which is based on its economy, geography and history, can greatly impact its energy needs and which energy sources it relies on to meet those needs \u2013 such as fueling automobiles, heating or cooling homes or running factories.\n\n        Related content\n    \nIEA provides analysis on wide range of fuels and technologies for Japan\u2019s G7 Presidency\n\n                        News \u2014 13 April 2023\n                    \nExecutive Director meets with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan on energy crisis and G7\n\n                        News \u2014 09 January 2023\n                    \nIEA Contribution to G20 Energy in 2019\n\n                        Conference \u2014 28 Jun 2019\n                    \nUK government and IEA spearhead largest ever global initiative to make products more energy efficient\n\n                        News \u2014 04 November 2021\n                    \nLeveraging carbon pricing to accelerate power sector decarbonisation in Asia Pacific\n\n                        Event \u2014 08 Jul 2021 10:00\u201411:00\n                    \nJapan will have to tread a unique pathway to net zero, but it can get there through innovation and investment\n\n                        Commentary \u2014 28 June 2021\n                    \nIEA welcomes G7 Leaders\u2019 commitment to reach net zero by 2050\n\n                        News \u2014 14 June 2021\n                    \nInnovation and market reform needed to drive Japan\u2019s clean energy transition, IEA policy review finds\n\n                        Press release \u2014 04 March 2021\n                    \nJapan 2021\nEnergy Policy Review\n\n                        Country report \u2014 March 2021\n                    \nMultilateral Meeting strengthens IEA\u2019s global leadership role\n\n                        News \u2014 01 December 2020\n                    \nRenewables 2020\nAnalysis and forecast to 2025\n\n                        Fuel report \u2014 November 2020\n                    \nIEA hosts high-level meeting on ways to scale up low-carbon hydrogen industries\n\n                        News \u2014 05 December 2019\n                    \nTransition to a Low-Carbon Economy: Socio-Economic Considerations\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 24 May 2011\n                    \nTransforming Innovation into Realistic Market Implementation Programmes\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 27 Apr 2010\n                    \nThe Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy: Socio-Economic Considerations\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 24 May 2011\n                    \nTechnical Workshop on Climate-Energy Policy Approaches for the Industrial Sector\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 16 Jan 2015\n                    \nScaling Up Financing to Expand the Renewables Portfolio\n\n                        Workshop \u2014  9 Apr 2013\n                    \nRenewables in the Mainstream: Towards a \"Third Way\" for electricity market design?\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 24 Mar 2015\n                    \nModelling and Analyses in R&D Priority-Setting and Innovation\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 23 Apr 2014\n                    \nInternational Conference on Efficient Power Generation\n\n                        Conference \u2014 19 Sep 2011\n                    \nIntegrating Carbon Pricing with Energy Policies\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 18 Mar 2013\n                    \nIndustry/business use of \u2018complementary measures\u2019 for decarbonisation: \r\r\nLooking beyond pricing and regulation to voluntary and other approaches\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 22 Jun 2015\n                    \nOil Market Report -

      "Advertisement\nEnergy and Economic Growth\n\n\n131 Accesses\n Abstract\nThis chapter provides an overview of the changes in energy consumption and energy productivity throughout Japan\u2019s economic growth over the 135\u00a0years from 1885 to 2019. During this observation period, the Japanese economy succeeded in sustainably improving labor productivity, except for times of war and temporary recession periods. However, energy productivity has followed a U-shaped curve, declining until World War II and then moving on a track of steady improvement with repeated acceleration and deceleration. The sustained improvement in energy productivity in postwar Japan includes the effects of structural changes, such as rapid heavy and chemical industrialization, high energy prices caused by oil shocks, and prolonged economic stagnation. This chapter also provides an overview of each chapter\u2019s focus and methodological framework and explains the structure of the productivity account developed in this book to analyze the sources of energy productivity changes.\n\u2020This chapter is a significant revision of the measurements through 2016 in Chap. 1 of Nomura (2021) based on the 2011 benchmark Japanese System of National Accounts (JSNA), including updated estimates through 2019 based on the 2015 benchmark JSNA.

PM Yoshihide Suga announced his intention to step down in September 2021, and the following cabinet of PM Fumio Kishida approved the official mid-term plan in October (METI, 2021).\nThe Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) called for the establishment of a new agency for natural resources as of December 1972, against the backdrop of uncertainty over the future of oil security and the rise of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). In response to social demand, the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) was established a few months before the outbreak of the Fourth Middle East War on October 6, 1973, which triggered the first oil shock; it was created by merging the Mines and Coal Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau of the then Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). The MITI was renamed the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) in January 2001.\nChapter 4 explains the factors that lead to a U-shape in long-term energy productivity changes (see Fig.\u00a04.1 in Sect.\u00a04.2.1).\nThe data during 1946\u20131954 are available at the aggregate level (as discussed in Sect.\u00a01.2), but in keeping with the years for which detailed industry-specific data are available (as analyzed in Chap. 2 and beyond), 1955 was chosen as the starting year of Period-I.\nKuznets (1971) derived the general observation that the growth of capital stock (excluding land) during the period of modern economic growth was much lower than that of real economic growth (i.e., capital productivity has been improving) from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to the early 1960s.\nThe use of electricity began with electric light. The first electric light in Japan was turned on at a banquet held for the opening of the Central Telegraph Office on March 25, 1878 (the 11th year of Meiji era). According to the 50-year history of the Tokyo Electric Light Company, \u201cWhen the electric light was turned on, the banquet became like broad daylight, and the guests clapped their hands in welcome. However, this was short-lived, for as soon as the \u2018swoosh\u2019 sound was heard, the arc wire was cut, and the banquet went dark at once.\u201d (Yoshida, 1961).\nWebber (2019) indicates that \u201ceach fuel and technology has its upside benefits and downside risks.\u201d Coal saved the forests because of slowed deforestation, and oil saved the whales because of kerosene\u2019s role in the 1800s. Fossil fuels are considered a threat to climate change today.\nAt that time, the primary use of coal in Japan was salt production (fuel for boiling down saltwater). In 1886, this accounted for 53.1% of coal use, with 27.6% for ships, 17.1% for factories, and 2.1% for railroads. In 1909, 48.7% of the coal was used for factories, 27.2% for ships, 14.0% for railroads, and 10.2% for salt production (Yoshida, 1961).\nUntil the early Taisho period (1912\u20131926), the value of light was far greater than it is today. The main demand for electricity was for electric lights. The Japanese electricity industry was largely privatized, with more than 800 small and medium enterprises (Kojima, 1937). The demand for other power uses in Japan exceeded that for electric lights for the first time in 1916. The emergence of large-scale consumers also changed the shape of the electricity supply through the market. Economies of scale were pursued, from the supply of small amounts of electricity to meet dispersed demand for electric lights to the generation of electricity on a large scale and the transmission of large amounts of electricity to consumption areas.\nThe four characters of \u201cSui Shu Ka Ju\u201d represent hydro, primary, thermal, and secondary, respectively, in Japanese.\nTo promote hydropower development, which is difficult for the private sector to develop, the Japanese government worked to expand the scope of the survey by targeting sites with poor conditions and devising development techniques. One of the important examples is the Oze development project in Gunma prefecture, which was planned in 1919. According to an Electricity Association of Japan survey, the Oze swamp was estimated to generate about 100\u00a0MW of electricity. In contrast, the government believed that at least 500\u00a0MW of electricity could be developed. There were concerns from the private sector that the construction costs would become increasingly higher, that electricity would eventually become more expensive, and that the region would suffer serious environmental damage. Many tug-of-war sessions followed before and after WWII, but it was not until 1996\u201477\u00a0years later\u2014that this ambitious plan was completely abandoned. Having escaped the danger of being submerged by the dam, Oze was registered as a Ramsar site, which is a wetland site designated to be of international importance under the Ramsar Convention established in 1971 by UNESCO, in 2005 and became Oze National Park in 2007.\nThe U.S. economy also saw a period of declining energy productivity. Schurr et al. (1960, 1983) showed that U.S. energy productivity rose 1.3% on average per year in 1920\u20131953 but dropped at an annual rate of 2.2% in 1880\u20131920. This shows that Japan was decades behind the U.S.\nIn August 1941, four months before the Pacific War, Japan was banned from importing oil from the U.S., and oil accounted for only 1% of Japan\u2019s primary energy supply in 1945. By 1955, the beginning of Period-I, it had expanded to 18%, but not far from coal (47%) and hydropower (27%), according to the historical data in EDMC (2021). However, oil surpassed hydropower in 1959 and coal in 1961, and oil\u2019s share grew to 60% in 1965 and 77% in 1973. The expansion of oil imports, which provided a steady supply at a stable price, was one of the keys to achieving Japan\u2019s rapid growth in Period-I.\nAccording to a survey by MITI (the predecessor of METI) reported in the Institute of Electric Power Economics & Japan Industrial Structure Research Association (1955), the cost of electricity from new construction of hydropower plants in 1955 soared to 3.5 times that of existing plants. Regarding the composition of the cost of electricity, there is no significant difference in labor costs and repair fees, but it is pointed out that capital costs rose remarkably to over five times the level of existing plants. This report argues that \u201cSui Shu Ka Ju\u201d needs to be re-examined in response to these findings. Since the mid-1950s, the thermal efficiency of new thermal power plants improved, and high-capacity and low-cost thermal power plants were developed. In 1962, the electricity supply of Japan achieved a transition to \u201cKa Shu Sui Ju,\u201d which indicates that the baseload (Shu) of electricity demand supplied by thermal power (Ka) and hydropower (Sui) played a supporting role (Ju) compared to \u201cSui Shu Ka Ju,\u201d which was developed in the early 1910s (see Sect.\u00a01.3.1).\nChapter 3 provides a detailed analysis of the price changes in energy, capital, and labor inputs.\nDependence on oil was also successfully reduced from 77% of primary energy supply in 1973 to 58% in 1990. This decline of 19 percentage points was realized mainly by expanding natural gas (from 2 to 10% during the same period) and nuclear power (1\u20139%). This improvement in the energy mix has been credited with increasing the confidence of electricity consumers, as depicted in Chap. 5.\nThe gross measure of the aggregate EPI observed in this chapter is decomposed in Chap. 2.\nIn April 1999, the Top Runner Program started with nine products: air conditioners, fluorescent lighting, television sets, copying machines, computers, magnetic disk units, video cassette recorders, passenger vehicles, and freight vehicles. In December 1999, electric refrigerators and electric freezers were added. As opposed to the minimum energy performance standard (MEPS), which sets threshold energy efficiency levels that must be exceeded by all products covered, the Top Runner Program sets energy efficiency targets based on the most efficient model (top runner) available on the market and by taking into consideration expected technological progress in the future. Manufacturers are required to exceed the designated energy-efficiency target for their products, calculated as a weighted average based on the volume of shipments. In 2021, the number of equipment subject to the Top Runner Program was expanded to 32 products. See ANRE (2015) for the details.\nIn the wake of the first oil crisis, Japan suffered its first negative growth since the end of WWII, but real GDP dropped by only 1.2% from 1973 to 1974. The impact observed in 2008\u20132009 was far larger than that.\nPrime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, leader of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), who took over from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in September 2009, pledged to reduce GHG emissions in 2020 by 25% from the 1990 level. This is a significant increase from the 8% reduction target, determined by the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s Taro Aso cabinet based on careful consideration (see Sect. 6.1.1 in Chap. 6). Against this backdrop, the Third Basic Energy Plan, approved by the Cabinet in June 2010, was ambitious, aiming to build more than 14 new nuclear power plants to increase the share of nuclear power in electricity generation to about 50% by 2030 from 32% at that time. However, because of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake, strict safety standards have been required for all nuclear power plants in Japan. Thus, the share of nuclear power in the primary energy supply had to be reduced to less than 1% in 2012 from 10% in 2010. In 2019, it had only recovered by a few percent.\nFocusing on the period 2010\u20132019, the EPI averaged 2.5% per year, close to the economy-wide EPI (2.7%) in Period-II. During this period, Japan\u2019s energy consumption dropped by 2.0%, while the economy grew by an average of 0.5% per year. As shown in Fig.\u00a01.1, the phenomenon was sometimes referred to as a \u201cdecoupling\u201d of energy consumption and economic growth. However, using 2010 as the base year for measurement would overestimate the EPI, as Japan was recovering from the major setback caused by the global financial crisis (Fig.\u00a01.2). Thus, to eliminate the effects of economic fluctuations, 2008 was chosen as the starting year of Period-IV.\nThe \u201cfinal consumption\u201d in economic statistics excludes all intermediate inputs to the production process and thus does not include energy consumption by industry. However, in energy statistics, \u201cfinal consumption\u201d refers to total domestic consumption, excluding consumption by the energy conversion sector and a net increase in inventories. The FEC used in this book means the latter.\nIn general, energy input costs are not large in most industries, but energy price fluctuations are much larger than those of other intermediate inputs. These features tend to induce errors in the time-series estimation of energy productivity because the estimates of energy costs by type of energy and industry in the national accounts rely on interpolation by rebalancing the matrix, especially in the interval periods between two consecutive benchmark years.\nJapan\u2019s aluminum smelting production, which heavily depends on electricity, was about 1.2 million tons at its peak in 1977. However, rising electricity costs caused by two oil shocks forced the country to withdraw, and since the early 1990s, it has relied entirely on imports from overseas. The increasing dependence on imports of other metals and chemical products is an economic security issue that needs to be discussed.\nDetails on the development framework of the productivity account for Japan are provided in Kuroda et al. (1997), Nomura (2004), and Jorgenson & Nomura (2005).\n References\nANRE. (2015). Top runner programme\u2013Developing the World\u2019s best energy efficient appliance and mores.

It has been revised to sustain sound comparability with the U.S. productivity account developed by Professor Dale W. Jorgenson and his associates at Harvard University.Footnote 27 The measurement in this book is based on the latest version of the KDB, reflecting the 2015 benchmark JSNA published as of the end of 2020 by the Economic Social Research Institute (ESRI), the Cabinet Office of Japan. Although the latest JSNA estimates the period 1994\u20132019, the KDB is estimated backwardly until 1955, based on compatible concepts with the 2015-benchmark JSNA.\nGross domestic product (GDP) defined in this book is broader in concept than that in the JSNA (as discussed in Sect.\u00a01.4.1). It includes the imputed values of capital services of consumer durables\u2014such as automobiles and other durable goods owned by households\u2014in addition to the value of imputed rents for housing owned by households and other capital costs of government-owned capital like infrastructure. This definition is based on the Jorgensonian accounting system (see Sect. 2.2.2 in Chap. 2). Data on output from 1885 through 1954 are simply extended using the long-term estimates of national income in the Japanese economy, developed in Okawa et al. (1974).\nLabor input in this chapter is defined as total hours worked. The data are based on a detailed labor database\u2014cross-classified by gender, age, education, class of worker, and industry\u2014for the period 1955\u20132019, following the updated and revised estimates of Nomura & Shirane (2014). Those for the years through 1954 are simply extrapolated based on the employment numbers estimated by Okawa et al. (1974), assuming constant average hours worked per worker. In other chapters of this book, the labor input is defined as the quality-adjusted measure.\nCapital stock data in this chapter represent the volume of productive/net capital stock (excluding land) as of the end of each year, following the updated and revised estimates of Nomura (2004). Figures for the years through 1954 are simple estimates obtained by extending estimates of net capital stock provided in Okawa et al. (1966). For disaggregated data on labor and capital inputs, see Sect. 4.2.1 in Chap.4. In other chapters of this book, capital inputs are defined as capital services aggregated from different types of assets, including land and inventory.\nEnergy input in this chapter is defined as the primary energy consumption. See Appendix 1 in Chap. 2 for further details on energy input in the expanded productivity account for analyzing energy. Data for the years through 1954 are retrospective estimates based on data on primary energy supply provided by the Energy Data and Modelling Center (EDMC, 2021) of The Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ), adjusted for exports and inventory changes.\n Rights and permissions\nReprints and permissions\n Copyright information\n\u00a9 2022 Development Bank of Japan\n About this chapter\nCite this chapter\nNomura, K.

      "IoT in UK smart grids: Powering a reliable and energy-efficient future\nReading time 13 mins\nManaging Director\nLast updated Aug 8, 2024\nI hope you enjoy reading this post.If you would like us to develop your next product for you,\u00a0click here\nThe UK energy sector is changing, and the industry is undergoing a shift \u2013 thanks to technological innovation, policy changes, and societal demands for sustainability. We\u2019ve reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by over 50% below 1990 levels and now generate over 33% of our electricity from renewable sources. Much of this achievement has been driven by implementing scaleable solutions (e.g. expanding the fleet of windfarms), combining technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart grids to help maximise the benefits and untapped potential of renewable energies. IoT in UK smart grids is essential to: \nIf you\u2019re working towards renewable energy solutions and technologies that address future needs by developing them today, such as domestic heat pumps using alternative energy or innovative energy storage systems, we\u2019re here to help! Our engineering experts, design specialists, and software developers will help bring your concept to life quickly and cost-effectively \u2013 without compromising quality or performance.\nIoT in UK smart grids is essential to helping us reach our sustainability goals. We have the world\u2019s most ambitious climate change target: reduce emissions by 50% by 2032 and 75% by 2037 to reach net zero by 2050. This presents unique opportunities for businesses, innovators, and entrepreneurs in the energy sector to develop and implement solutions to help achieve those targets and facilitate the cross-sector partnerships and collaborations needed to overcome the challenges such ambitious goals present.\nHow does IoT enable smart electricity grids?\n\nIoT refers to the network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet.

Introduction\nThis statistical release presents Official Statistics in development based on Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) issued for domestic and\nnon-domestic buildings and Display Energy Certificates (DECs) issued for\nbuildings occupied by public authorities. The certificates are lodged on\nthe Energy Performance of Buildings Register (The Register) for England\nand Wales.\nThrough most of the release, the figures have been split into England\nonly and Wales only. If England and Wales combined figures are required,\nthey are available in the \u2018live\u2019\ntables\npublished alongside this release. Throughout the report, numbers have\nbeen rounded to the nearest thousand. Percentage changes have been\ncalculated using unrounded figures. Due to rounding, individual figures\nmay not add up to the total.\n\n2.1 Energy Performance Certificates\nAn Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) indicates the energy efficiency\nof a building. The assessments are banded from A to G, where A (or A+\nfor non-domestic properties) is the most efficient in terms of likely\nfuel costs and carbon dioxide emissions. An EPC is required when a\nbuilding is constructed, sold, or let and if a valid certificate is not\nalready in place. The purpose of an EPC is to show prospective tenants\nor buyers the energy efficiency of the property. The requirement for\nEPCs was introduced in phases and fully implemented for all properties\nby autumn 2008. EPCs are valid for 10 years.\n\n2.2 Official Statistics in development\nOfficial Statistics in development are defined in the Code of Practice for\nStatistics as \u201cnew official statistics undergoing evaluation\u201d. They are\npublished in order to involve users and stakeholders in their\ndevelopment and as a means to build in quality at an early stage.\nThese statistics are based on information from EPCs lodged on the\nRegister. This administrative data is subject to continuing quality\nassurance and improvement (see Technical Notes on Data Quality). They\nhave been released because they have been judged to be of immediate\nvalue to interested parties and to encourage user feedback.\n\n2.3 Display Energy Certificates\nA Display Energy Certificate (DEC) is only required for buildings\noccupied by public authorities over 250 square meters where that\nbuilding is frequently visited by the public.\nDECs show the actual energy consumption of a building and are\naccompanied by reports which provide recommendations on potential energy\nsaving measures. DECs last for one year for buildings with a total\nuseful floor area more than 1,000 square metres, or 10 years when the\ntotal useful floor area is over 250 square metres and up to 1,000 square\nmetres.\nDECs that can be identified as \u2018voluntary\u2019 - some private sector\norganisations may choose to have a DEC even though they are not mandated\nby the regulations - may affect statistical and data outputs. Therefore,\n\u2018voluntary DECs are excluded from the published dataset.\n\n3. Coverage\nThe Register does not hold records for all dwellings in England and\nWales, as not every dwelling has an EPC (these are only required when a\ndwelling is constructed, sold or let).\nSome dwellings may have changed tenure since the date of their latest\nEPC. For instance, dwellings that had an EPC for reasons other than\nbeing let may have since entered the private or social rented sector.\nONS have led on an exploratory look at the EPC data comparing with the census to determine the\npercentage of dwellings covered by an Energy Performance Certificate in England and Wales, using Census 2021 data. Based on\ntheir analysis EPCs cover around 60% of the housing stock in England 55% in Wales. There is a similar proportion across all\nregions in England.\n\n4. How the data should be used\n\n4.1 How the data should be used\n\n4.2 How the data should not be used\n\n5. England and Wales\nIn the quarter January to March 2024, 453,000\nEPCs were lodged on the Register for both domestic and non-domestic\nproperties in England and Wales, a 4% decrease from quarter\n1 in 2023 (Live Table A1).\nIn January to March 2024, the total number of EPCs\nlodged for new dwellings in England and Wales had a 3% increase\nto 57,000, compared to the equivalent quarter in 2023 (Live\nTable NB1). There was a 2% decrease to 369,000 for\nexisting dwellings EPCs lodged for that quarter (Live Table EB1).\n\n6. England quarterly figures\nQuarterly figures are not seasonally adjusted and should be compared to\nthe same quarter as the previous year to see trends.\n\n6.1 New and existing dwellings\nFrom January to March 2024, 406,000 EPCs were\nlodged on the Register covering all domestic dwellings (sales, lets and\nnew dwellings) in England. This represents a 1% decrease on the\nsame quarter 2023, when there were 411,000 domestic\nlodgements (Live Table D1).\nThe majority of domestic EPCs were for the sale or let of existing\ndwellings. In January to March 2024, 350,000\nEPCs for existing dwellings were lodged on the Register in England, a\n2% decrease, while 56,000 EPCs were lodged for new\ndwellings (including new builds, conversions and change of use), a\n3% increase on the same quarter in 2023 (Live Table EB1 and\nNB1).\nSource: Live Tables, D1, EB1 and NB1\nNote: New dwellings and existing dwellings may not add up to all\ndomestic dwellings due to rounding\nEnergy Performance Certificates for domestic properties show an Energy\nEfficiency Rating (EER) based on estimated fuel costs and an\nEnvironmental Impact Rating (EIR) based on CO2 emissions. Both measures\nare estimated from the characteristics of the property. The numerical\nratings are then banded A to G, with A being the most energy efficient\nand G the least. In general, the higher the EER or EIR rating, the lower\nthe fuel bills and CO2 emissions are likely to be.\nFor both the EER and the EIR, the largest proportion of lodgements for\nexisting domestic properties in England were in bands C and D. New\nproperties in England tended to be more energy efficient, with the\nmajority in band B (Figures 1 and 2).\nIn England, from January to March 2024, most\n(79%) new properties were given a B EER rating. Existing\ndwellings were more likely to be given a C or D EER (85%),\ncompared to 14% of new dwellings. (Live Tables EB1 and NB1).\nNote: Percentage changes have been calculated using unrounded figures, therefore proportions may not add to 100%.\nNote: Percentage changes have been calculated using unrounded figures,\ntherefore proportions may not add to 100%.\n\n6.2 Non-domestic properties\nA non-domestic property is a building that is not a dwelling, such as a\nretail unit or office.\nIn January to March 2024, 26,000 EPCs were\nlodged for non-domestic properties, a 34% decrease compared with\nthe corresponding quarter in 2023. However, the number of non-domestic EPCs for quarter 1 2023 were high compared to lodgement numbers over the last 5 years.\nThe distribution by EPC band is shown in Figure 3. Non-domestic\nbuildings have an additional A+ band but numbers are too small to report\nso are combined with those receiving an A rating. An A+, A or B rating\nwas given to 40% of properties (Live Table A).\nNote: Percentage changes have been calculated using unrounded figures,\ntherefore proportions may not add to 100%.\n\n6.3 Display Energy Certificates (DECs)\nProperties over 250 square meters occupied by a public authority and\nfrequently visited by the public must display a Display Energy\nCertificate (DEC). DECs show the actual energy consumption of a building\nand are accompanied by reports which provide recommendations on\npotential energy saving measures.\nFrom January to March 2024, 9,000 DECs were\nlodged in England, an 8% increase compared with the corresponding\nquarter in 2023 (Live Table DEC1).\nThe distribution of DECs by Energy Performance Operational Ratings is\nshown in Figure 4. The highest proportions of DECs were in bands C (37%) and D (31%).\nNote: Percentage changes have been calculated using unrounded figures,\ntherefore proportions may not add to 100%.\n\n6.4 Long-term trends by transaction type\nFigure 5 shows the number of domestic EPCs by transaction type, i.e. the\nreason for the EPC being produced, as well as the total number. The\ntransaction types have been grouped. For example, lodgements for social\nand private rentals are grouped together.\nThe chart shows fluctuations in different transaction types based on the\ntotal number of EPCs lodged. For example, there is a seasonal pattern\nwith fewer home sales at Christmas, which can be seen in the number of\nEPC lodgements. This seasonality affects the total for EPCs,\nparticularly up to the end of 2012. At the end of 2012 the recast of EU\nDirective also led to changes to the Energy Performance of Buildings\nregulations (the regulations). It also shows how the total number of\nEPCs were influenced by lodgements made for energy efficiency programmes\nand similar schemes, as well as lodgements for other reasons,\nparticularly in 2013, 2014 and 2015.\nNote: The categories collected changed in\n2012, leading to a break in the chart indicated by the line.\n\n7. England annual figures\n\n7.1 New and existing dwellings\nThese figures are not seasonally adjusted and give annual estimates for\nthe number of energy performance certificates over a rolling 12-month\nperiod. These can be used to make year on year comparisons.\nIn the 12 months to March 2024, in England, 1,579,000\ndomestic EPCs were lodged, a 4% decrease on the previous 12\nmonths (Live Table D1).\nIn the year to March 2024, 1,347,000 EPCs for\nexisting dwellings were lodged on the register in England, a\n4% decrease on the equivalent 12 months preceding\nMarch 2023. EPCs for new dwellings (including new builds,\nconversions and change of use) had a 6% decrease to\n232,000 (Live Tables EB1 and NB1).\n\n7.2 Non-domestic properties\nIn the year ending March 2024, 121,000 non-domestic\nEPCs were lodged, a 2% decrease on the number lodged during\nthe previous year (Live Table A).\n\n7.3 Display Energy Certificates (DECs)\nProperties over 250 square meters occupied by a public authority and\nfrequently visited by the public must display a Display Energy\nCertificate (DEC). DECs show the actual energy consumption of a building\nand are accompanied by reports which provide recommendations on\npotential energy saving measures.\nIn the year ending March 2024, 33,000 DECs were\nlodged in England, representing a 5% increase compared with\nthe previous year (Live Table DEC1).\n\n8. England sub-national figures\nThis section presents a quarterly snapshot of domestic EPCs at\nsub-national level in England. For data at a local authority level with\nmaps, see the EPC interactive\ndashboard.\n\n8.1 Regional figures\nThere is much variability across regions in the energy efficiency of\ndwellings, this is largely related to the type and age of the dwelling\nstock.\nIn the quarter ending March 2024, the largest increase in\nEPCs lodged for new dwellings compared to the same quarter in\n2023, was in the North West\n(32%), while the largest decrease was in\nYorkshire and The Humber (-16%), (Live Table NB1).\nFor existing dwellings, the largest increase was\n6% in the West Midlands (Live\nTable EB1). The largest decrease was in the East Midlands\n(-13%).\nSource: Live Tables, EB1 and NB1\n\n9. Wales quarterly figures\nQuarterly figures are not seasonally adjusted and should be compared to\nthe same quarter in the previous year to see trends.\n\n9.1 New and existing dwellings\nFrom January to March 2024, 20,000 EPCs were\nlodged on the Register covering domestic properties (sales, lets and new\ndwellings) in Wales. This represents a 3% decrease on the same\nquarter 2023, when there were 21,000 domestic lodgements\n(Live Table D1).\nThe majority of domestic EPCs were for the sale or let of existing\nproperties. From January to March 2024, 19,000\nEPCs for existing dwellings were lodged on the Register in Wales, a\n4% decrease, while 2,000 EPCs were lodged for new\ndwellings (including new builds, conversions and change of use), a\n12% increase compared to the same quarter in 2023 (Live Table\nEB1 and NB1).\nSource: Live Tables, D1, EB1 and NB1\nNote: New dwellings and existing dwellings may not add up to all\ndomestic dwellings due to rounding\nEnergy Performance Certificates for domestic properties show an Energy\nEfficiency Rating (EER) based on estimated fuel costs and an\nEnvironmental Impact Rating (EIR) based on CO2 emissions. Both measures\nare estimated from the characteristics of the property. The numerical\nratings are then banded A to G, with A being the most energy efficient\nand G the least. In general, the higher the EER or EIR rating, the lower\nthe fuel bills and CO2 emissions are likely to be.\nFor both the EER and the EIR, the largest proportion of lodgements for\nexisting domestic properties in Wales were in bands C and D. New\nproperties in Wales are more energy efficient than existing, with the\nmajority in band B (Figures 7 and 8).\nIn Wales, from January to March 2024, the majority of\nnew properties were given a B EER (64%). Existing dwellings were\nmore likely to receive a C (45%) or D (36%) rating.\n(Live Tables EB1 and NB1).\nNote: Percentage changes have been calculated using unrounded figures,\ntherefore proportions may not add to 100%.\nNote: Percentage changes have been calculated using unrounded figures,\ntherefore proportions may not add to 100%.\n\n9.2 Non-domestic properties\nIn January to March 2024, 1,000 EPCs were lodged for\nnon-domestic properties, a 15% decrease compared with the corresponding quarter in 2023 (Live Table A).\nThe distribution by EPC band is shown in Figure 9. Non-domestic\nbuildings have an additional A+ band but numbers are too small to\nreport. From January to March 2024, an A+, A or B\nrating was given to 35% of properties. (Live Table A).\nNote: Percentage changes have been calculated using unrounded figures,\ntherefore proportions may not add to 100%.\n\n9.3 Display Energy Certificates (DECs)\nProperties over 250 square meters occupied by a public authority and\nfrequently visited by the public must display a Display Energy\nCertificate (DEC). DECs show the actual energy consumption of a building\nand are accompanied by reports which provide recommendations on\npotential energy saving measures.\nFrom January to March 2024, 400 DECs were\nlodged, a 4% decrease compared to the number of EPCs lodged in the\ncorresponding quarter in 2023 (Live Table DEC1).\nThe distribution of DECs by Energy Performance Operational Ratings is\nshown in Figure 9. The highest proportions were in bands C (38%)\nand D (25%).\nNote: Percentage changes have been calculated using unrounded figures,\ntherefore proportions may not add to 100%.\n\n9.4 Long-term trends by transaction type\nFigure 10 shows the number of domestic EPCs by transaction type, i.e.,\nthe reason for the EPC being produced, as well as the total number. The\ntransaction types have been grouped. For example, lodgements for social\nand private rentals are grouped together.\nThe chart shows fluctuations in different transaction types based on the\ntotal number of EPCs lodged. For example, there is a seasonal pattern\nwith fewer home sales at Christmas, which can be seen in the number of\nEPC lodgements. This seasonality affects the total for EPCs,\nparticularly up to the end of 2012. At the end of 2012 the recast of EU\nDirective also led to changes to the regulations. It also shows how the\ntotal number of EPCs were influenced by lodgements made for energy\nefficiency programmes and similar schemes, as well as lodgements for\nother reasons, particularly in 2013, 2014 and 2015.\nNote: The categories collected changed in\n2012, leading to a break in the chart indicated by the line.\n\n10. Wales annual figures\n\n10.1 New and existing properties\nIn the 12 months to March 2024, in Wales, 80,000\ndomestic EPCs were lodged a 1% decrease on the previous 12\nmonths (Live Table D1).\nOf which, 72,000 EPCs were lodged on the register for\nexisting dwellings, a 1% decrease, while 8,000\nEPCs were lodged for new dwellings, (including new builds, conversions\nand change of use) a 3% decrease on the previous year (Live\nTables EB1 and NB1).\n\n10.2 Non-domestic properties\nIn the year ending March 2024, 6,000 non-domestic\nEPCs were lodged, a 21% increase on the number lodged during\nthe previous year (Live Table A).\n\n10.3 Display Energy Certificates (DECs)\nProperties over 250 square meters occupied by a public authority and\nfrequently visited by the public must display a Display Energy\nCertificate (DEC). DECs show the actual energy consumption of a building\nand are accompanied by reports which provide recommendations on\npotential energy saving measures.\nIn year ending March 2024, 2,000 DECs were lodged\nin Wales, representing a <1% increase compared with the\nprevious year (Live Table DEC1).\n\n11. Wales sub-national figures\nThis section presents a quarterly snapshot of domestic EPCs at\nsub-national level in Wales.\n\n11.1 Local authority figures\nThere is much variability across local authorities in Wales.\nSource: Live Tables, EB1 and NB1\n\n12. Changes to this release\nThis release is now published in HTML format to make it more accessible.\nQuarterly and annual figures have been presented separately, and Wales\nfigures at local authority level are now included.\n\n13. Future developments\nFollowing user engagement, we are proposing to make some changes to the\nstatistical release to put more of a focus on energy efficiency and\nchange over time. In addition, we\u2019d like to be able to offer more splits\nof the data e.g. tenure, property type. We are also developing a RAP\nprocess to improve the efficiency and quality of the analyses.\nWe would welcome any comments on this:\nEPBStats@levellingup.gov.uk.\n\n14.

Where\npossible, data are updated within two weeks of this release and as of\nNovember 2021 include Unique Property Reference Numbers (UPRNs). To\nnote: local authority allocation is based on ONS geography as at July\n2020, whereas this release is based on a more up to date list.\nTherefore, allocations for authorities within Northamptonshire will\ndiffer due to the merger in July 2021. In addition, EPC certificates\nlodged on the Register and published in the open data does not reflect\nthe recent increase in energy prices. Open data is updated monthly.\n\n14.7 Related links\nHousing supply: indicators of new\nsupply\nQuarterly figures on EPCs lodged for new dwellings have followed a\nsimilar trend to quarterly new build dwelling completions since 2009-10.\nThe number of new dwelling EPCs lodged are higher than quarterly new\nbuild completions as they comprise of new build dwellings plus dwelling\nconversions (for example a house into flats) and change of use of an\nexisting building (for example a shop into a house or a barn\nconversion).\nEnglish Housing\nSurvey\nThe English Housing Survey is a continuous national survey commissioned\nby the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC). It\ncollects information about people\u2019s housing circumstances and the\ncondition and energy efficiency of housing in England. It can be used\nfor understanding the energy efficiency of the whole stock as well as\nthe household characteristics of the people living in the homes.\nWelsh Housing Conditions Survey\nThe Welsh Housing Conditions Survey collects information about the\ncondition and energy efficiency of all types of housing in Wales:\ndetails of energy saving measures installed in dwellings and\nbreakdowns of construction types\nthe number of dwellings making use of renewable energy\nheating systems, main fuel type and type of boilers used\ncomparisons between tenures, dwelling types and urban/rural areas\ncomparisons with other UK nations and changes over time.\nScottish House Condition\nSurvey\nThe Scottish House Condition Survey contains statistics on energy\nefficiency, based on an annual survey sample of around 3,000 dwellings.\nThis is the primary source of data at a national level on the energy\nefficiency of the Scottish housing stock.\nNorthern Ireland Housing\nStatistics\nThe Northern Ireland Housing Statistics report contains information and\nstatistics relating to domestic energy and energy efficiency of homes in\nNorthern Ireland.\nEnergy Efficiency of Housing in England and Wales:\n2021\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) published an article using\nDLUHC EPC data to provide an insight into the energy efficiency,\nenvironmental impact, carbon dioxide emissions, estimated energy cost\nand central heating main fuel type for new and existing homes by\nproperty type, tenure and property age.\n\n15.

Main points\n\nHomes in England had a median Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) score of 68 and homes in Wales had a median EPC score of 67, according to records from the 10 years up to March 2024; both scores are in band D.\nLondon had the highest median score in the English regions, with a score of 70 (band C), while West Midlands and Yorkshire and The Humber both had the lowest score of 67 (band D).\nIn England, median scores for Middle-layer Super Output Areas ranged from 85 (band B) to 47 (band E); in Wales, median scores ranged from 83 (band B) to 45 (band E).\nNew dwellings are becoming more efficient, regardless of property or tenure type; new dwellings in both England and Wales had a median EPC score of 84 (band B) in the five years to 2024, compared with 82 in England and 81 in Wales (band B) in the five years to 2013.\nIn London, 73% of new dwellings created in the five years to 2024 had community heating schemes as their main fuel type, compared with 45% of new dwellings created in the five years to 2013.\n\nBack to table of contents\n2. Overview of energy efficiency of dwellings\nEnergy Performance Certificates (EPCs) indicate the energy efficiency of dwellings. They are based on data about a building's energy features, like the building materials used, the heating systems, and the insulation. These data are collected by an accredited energy assessor and are used to generate an EPC score, typically ranging from 1 to 100.\nDomestic EPCs are banded from A to G, where A is the most energy efficient. The scores associated with each energy efficiency band are:\n\nband A \u2013 92 plus (most efficient)\nband B \u2013 81 to 91\nband C \u2013 69 to 80\nband D \u2013 55 to 68\nband E \u2013 39 to 54\nband F \u2013 21 to 38\nband G \u2013 1 to 20 (least efficient)\n\nThis article contains analysis of EPC\u202fdata for England and Wales, from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government\u2019s (MHCLG\u2019s) Open Data Communities webpage.\nOur analysis does not cover all homes in England and Wales, because not every dwelling has an EPC. This is because they are only required when a dwelling is constructed, converted, sold, or let. So, these statistics are not a full representation of the entire dwelling stock. These data are based on one record per dwelling, using records from April 2014 to March 2024. For more information, see Section 6: Coverage and Representativeness and our Energy efficiency of housing in England and Wales Quality and Methodology Information (QMI). See Section 10: Related links for other sources of data on energy efficiency.\nWe found that for records in the ten years up to March 2024, the median EPC score for England was 68 and the median EPC score for Wales was 67. London had the highest median score in the English regions (70), while West Midlands and Yorkshire and The Humber had the lowest median score (67).\nJust over 40% of local authorities (131 out of 318) had more than half of their housing in band C or higher (an EPC score of 69 or above). Tower Hamlets in London stands out as the local authority with the highest percentage of housing in band C or above, with 81% of dwellings with a valid EPC registering a score of 69 or above. Knowsley in the North West was the second highest, with 68% of dwellings in band C or above.\nAcross England and Wales, flats and maisonettes were the most energy efficient property type, with a median score of 73. Social rented homes had the highest median energy efficiency score of different tenure types (70 in England, 72 in Wales), compared with private rented homes (67 in England, 65 in Wales) and owner-occupied homes (65 in England, 63 in Wales).\nProperties built after 2012 had a higher EPC score (84) than homes built before 2012. The age of property also made a difference in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. New dwellings emitted less CO2 (1.3 tonnes/year in England, 1.4 tonnes/year in Wales) than existing homes (3.3 tonne/year in England, 3.6 tonnes/year in Wales).\nThese findings are broadly unchanged from our previous article. This is in part because we use all valid EPCs for our analysis, which last for a ten-year period. All data for this article can be found in our accompanying datasets. More detailed commentary on these trends can be found in our previous Energy efficiency of housing in England and Wales: 2023 article.\nBack to table of contents\n3. Energy efficiency in your local area\nLooking at smaller geographical areas provides a local picture of energy efficiency. There is much more variation in scores at the local authority and Middle-layer Super Output Area (MSOA, also referred to as \u201clocal area\u201d) levels than at the regional level.\nIn England, the highest median energy efficiency score for local areas (MSOAs) was 85. There were seven areas found with this score: Gascoigne Estate and Roding Riverside in Barking and Dagenham, Stonebridge in Brent, Wembley Park in Brent, Broughton and Wychnor in Preston, Woolwich Arsenal in Greenwich, Greenwich Peninsula West in Greenwich, and Trumpington in Cambridge. The lowest score was 47 in Shrewsbury Greenfields in Shropshire, and in the Isles of Scilly.\nIn Wales, the median energy efficiency score ranged from 83 in Pen-dre, Litchard, and Coity in Bridgend, and Langstone and Llan-wern in Newport, to 45 in Abersoch and Aberdaron in Gwynedd.\nIn England, all local areas in Cambridge and the City of London had a median energy efficiency score in bands C or above. There were nine local authorities where no MSOAs had a median energy efficiency score in band C or above. These were Blackpool, Burnley, Castle Point, Hyndburn, Isles of Scilly, North Warwickshire, Pendle, Rossendale, and Staffordshire Moorlands.\nIn Wales, 67% of local areas in the Vale of Glamorgan had a median energy efficiency score in band C or above, which was the highest proportion. Neither Conway or Denbighshire had any MSOAs with a median energy score in band C or above.\nOf all local authorities, 36% (114 out of 318) had at least half of their MSOAs with a median energy efficiency score in band C or above. This suggests that there are a variety of scores even within the same local authority, with different areas facing different challenges for improvement.\nData can be found in our Median energy efficiency score, England and Wales dataset.\nFigure 1: Energy efficiency of homes in your local area\nMedian energy efficiency score for new and existing houses and flats/maisonettes, Middle super output areas (MSOAs), England and Wales, up to March 2024\nEmbed code\nEmbed this interactive  Copy\nBack to table of contents\n4. New dwellings have become more energy efficient\nAge is closely associated with how energy efficient a home is. In our 2022 article, we reported that age of the property is the biggest single factor in energy efficiency of homes. The introduction of new building regulatory standards in both England and Wales may also be a contributing factor in how energy efficient a home is.\nThis means that new dwellings are usually more energy efficient than existing dwellings, regardless of tenure or housing type. Median Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) scores range from 64 in England and 61 in Wales for existing detached houses, and from 71 in England and 72 in Wales for existing flats and maisonettes. In comparison, the median EPC score was 84 for almost all types of new dwellings. When looking at tenure type, the range was from 64 in England and 63 in Wales for existing owner-occupied homes, and from 70 in England and 72 in Wales for existing social rented homes. In new dwellings, the median EPC score was between 79 and 84, regardless of tenure type.\nThis finding is also true of housing in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Department for Communities published energy ratings for the first time this July, in their Energy rating of housing in Northern Ireland up to March 2023 report.\nFigure 2: Median energy efficiency scores for new dwellings were higher than existing dwellings\nMedian energy efficiency score for new and existing dwellings\u202fby\u202fproperty type and tenure, England and Wales,\u202fup to March 2024\nEmbed code\nEmbed this interactive  Copy\nNew dwellings are becoming increasingly energy efficient. Using EPC records grouped into five-year blocks allows us to compare discrete results. Average scores increase by two points in England and three points in Wales when we compare EPC results for new dwellings from 2008 to 2013 with the most recent five years from 2019 to 2024.\nFigure\u202f3:\u202fNew dwellings are becoming increasingly energy efficient\nMedian energy efficiency scores for new dwellings 2008 to 2013 and new dwellings 2019 to 2024, England and Wales\nEmbed code\nEmbed this interactive  Copy\nData can be found in our Energy efficiency of housing England and Wales Five rolling years dataset.\nThis trend continues in the latest quarter of data. The Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government (MHCLG) found that 87% of new properties were given an A or B rating in England from Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2024. This is an increase from 86% in the same quarter in 2023. For more information, see MHCLG\u2019s Energy Performance of Buildings Certificates Statistical Release: April to June 2024 England and Wales.\nBack to table of contents\n5. Heating in new dwellings\nHeating is a large proportion of energy consumption in housing, as described in the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero\u2019s Energy consumption in the UK 2024 statistical release. Gas remains the main fuel type in new dwellings across England and Wales.\nIn all regions except London, increasing proportions of new dwellings have gas as their main fuel type when we compare main fuel types from 2008 to 2013 with the most recent five years from 2019 to 2024. However, the increase in gas may reflect better recording of fuel types, rather than an actual change, given that the \u201cother and unknown\u201d category has decreased across same the period. In London, there is a strong move away from gas towards community heating schemes in the most recent new builds.\nData can be found in our Main fuel type England and Wales dataset.\nFigure 4: Almost three quarters of new dwellings created in London from 2019 to 2024 had community heating scheme as their main method of heating\nPercentage of new dwellings by main fuel type or method of heating used in central heating by Wales and region, England and Wales, Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2008 to Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2013 and Quarter 2 2019 to Quarter 1 2024\nEmbed code\nEmbed this interactive  Copy\nBack to table of contents\n6. Coverage and representativeness\nOur analysis does not cover all dwellings in England and Wales because not every dwelling has an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). These are only required when a dwelling is constructed, converted, sold, or let. So, these statistics cannot be viewed as a full representation of the entire dwelling stock. Analysis is based on one record per dwelling, and most of the analysis uses records from April 2014 to March 2024 because EPCs are only valid for 10 years. Where we compare results over time, we group records together in two five-year periods (from 2008 to 2013, and the most recent five years, from 2019 to 2024) so that we have two non-overlapping periods.\nTo analyse the representativeness of dwellings covered by EPCs, we compared them with the addresses available in the Valuation Office Agency\u2019s (VOA\u2019s) Property Attributes data. Just over 69% of all residential dwellings in England, and 66% in Wales, had at least one EPC registration since records began in 2007, as of March 2024. There was a similar proportion across all regions in England, but London had the highest coverage at 72%.\nGenerally, newer properties have higher coverage of EPCs. This reflects the need for energy efficiency certification of new build homes. In England, the coverage of properties built before 1930 was 60%, while the coverage of those built since 2012 was 93%. Similarly in Wales, a much smaller proportion of dwellings built before 1930 were covered by an EPC (57%), compared with dwellings built since 2012 (89%).\nData can be found in our Percentage of dwellings covered by an EPC dataset.\nBack to table of contents\n7.

Glossary\nCommunity heating scheme\nA community heating scheme is a distribution system of insulated pipes that takes heat from a central source, usually in the form of hot water or steam, and delivers it to different buildings, or dwellings within the same building.\nDwelling\nA dwelling is an address containing a unit of accommodation that can comprise one or more household spaces.\nEnergy efficiency\nEnergy efficiency relates to the concept of efficient energy use, which means using less energy to provide a given amount of heating or lighting. Using less energy reduces emissions of carbon dioxide.\nEnergy efficiency score\nThe energy efficiency score (Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) score or Reduced data SAP (RdSAP)) is a measure of the overall efficiency of a building. This score is based on the performance of the building and its fixed services, such as heating and lighting. The higher the score, the more energy efficient the home. The score is produced during an Energy Performance Certificate assessment and is based on standardised assumptions for occupancy and behaviour. This enables a like-for-like comparison of a dwelling\u2019s energy efficiency performance.\nEnergy Performance Certificate\nEnergy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are required for all domestic and non-domestic buildings, when constructed, sold, or let. There are some exemptions, like for buildings used as places of worship. EPCs are valid for 10 years. The EPC records how energy efficient a property is as a building. The EPC uses an A-to-G rating scale, where A is the most efficient and G is the least efficient. The certificate also lists the potential rating of the building if all the cost-effective measures are installed.\nExisting dwelling\nExisting dwellings are those that are required to undergo an energy performance assessment because they are either being sold or let. They are not newly constructed or converted. Statistics for existing dwellings were created using data from the latest EPC record available for existing dwellings in a financial year.\nHeat pump\nA heat pump is a device that absorbs heat from one environment and transports it into another using electricity. For example, an air-source heat pump extracts heat from the air outside and transfers it into the home. This heat can then be used to warm radiators and underfloor heating systems.\nNew dwelling\nA new dwelling is any dwelling that has been newly constructed, created by conversion (for example, a house being converted into flats), or has undergone a change of use (for example, a pub being converted into flats), and is now required to have an energy performance assessment. Statistics for new dwellings are generated using data from new dwelling EPC records.\nBack to table of contents\n9. Data sources and quality\nThis article contains analysis of\u202fthe\u202fEnergy Performance Certificate (EPC)\u202fdata for England and Wales from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government\u2019s\u202f(MHCLG\u2019s) Open Data Communities webpage.\nFurther energy efficiency statistics are published in MHCLG\u2019s Energy Performance of Building Certificates Statistical Release: April to June 2024 England and Wales, the Welsh Government\u2019s Energy efficiency of homes report, the Scottish Government\u2019s Scottish House Condition Survey: 2021 Key Findings report, and Northern Ireland\u2019s Energy rating of housing in Northern Ireland up to March 2023 report. The English Housing Survey also provides insight into energy efficiency in housing in England.\nHow we used the property attributes data\nTo quality check the EPC records used for analysis, we link EPC data to Valuation Office Agency (VOA) property attributes data at the address level. This enables us to check that a dwelling with an EPC record still exists, and that there is consistent property information (property type and age of property band) across both data sources. We exclude records that have a direct contradiction between data sources on these property variables from the analysis. After we applied these quality assurance checks, 42.6% of the original EPC dataset remained. These records became the basis for most of our analysis.\nThe following is an overview of the data parsing process. This includes the number of records removed as a percentage of the original 26,143,827 records and the type of remaining record:\n\nEPC records for properties that no longer exist are filtered out of the dataset (4.7% of original records)\nrecords with implausible values on important variables are filtered out (less than 0.1%)\nEPC records where there is direct contradiction between the property types provided in the EPC and VOA property attributes, where both have property type information available, are removed (6.9%)\nEPC records where there is direct contradiction between the age of property band provided in EPC and the VOA property attributes, where both have age of property information available, are removed (12.4%)\nduplicated EPC records based on multiple variables including Unique Property Reference Number and inspection date are removed (0.2%)\nEPC records that have been superseded by a later record for the same dwelling are removed (23.4%)\nEPC records that are older than 10 years are removed (18.4%)\n11,150,054 EPC records are retained and used for analysis (42.6%)\n\nInterpreting these statistics\nEPCs are valid for 10 years, so do not reflect energy efficiency improvements made after certification. Dwellings can have more than one record, but we keep only the latest record for our analysis, so dwellings are not double counted in any time period that we analysed.\nSome dwellings included in our statistics may have changed tenure since the date of their latest EPC. For instance, dwellings that had an EPC for reasons other than being let may have since entered the private or social rented sector.\nFor more information about the strengths and limitations of the data, methods used, and data uses and users, see our Energy efficiency of housing in England and Wales Quality and Methodology Information (QMI).\nBack to table of contents\n10.

Use the grey and yellow toggles to change the temporal sampling. Data source: ERA5. Credit: Copernicus Climate Change Service/ECMWF.\u00a0\n\n          September 2024\n  \n\nAccording to the ERA5 dataset, globally September 2024 was:\nSeptember 2024 was the 14th month in a 15-month period for which the global-average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Eight of these 14 months, from September 2023 to April 2024, were substantially above 1.5\u00b0C, ranging from 1.58\u00b0C to 1.78\u00b0C. However, the values for May, June, August and September 2024, as well as those for July and August 2023, were very close to 1.5\u00b0C (between 1.50\u00b0C and 1.54\u00b0C). For this reason, and given the small differences among global temperature datasets, the 14 months in a 15-month period highlighted here may differ in datasets other than ERA5. Furthermore, there is inherent uncertainty in estimating monthly temperature changes above the pre-industrial levels.\n\n          The last 12 months - October 2023 to September 2024\n  \n\nAveraging over 12-month periods smooths out shorter-term variations in regional- and global-average temperatures.\nGlobally, the average for the latest 12-month period (October 2023 to September 2024) was:\nFor reference, the warmest calendar year (January to December) on record to date, 2023, had a temperature of 0.60\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average.\nRead more\u00a0about how the temperature change above the pre-industrial level is estimated and the differences between global temperature datasets.\n\n          Year to date - January to September 2024\n  \n\nGlobal-average surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1991\u20132020 averaged over the first nine months of the year (January to September, or \u2018year-to-date') from 1979 to 2024. Use the grey and yellow toggles to change the temporal sampling. Data source: ERA5. Credit: Copernicus Climate Change Service/ECMWF. \nThe year-to-date global-average temperature anomaly (for January\u2013September) is 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average; this is 0.19\u00b0C warmer than for the same period in 2023, the current warmest calendar year. Given the large positive global temperature anomalies observed in the latter part of 2023 and the transition to La Ni\u00f1a conditions expected in the coming months, the margin between 2024 and 2023 is expected to decrease by the end of the year. Nevertheless, an average anomaly of only 0.30\u00b0C for the remaining months of this year would make 2024 warmer than 2023. In other words, the average anomaly for October\u2013December 2024 would need to drop by at least 0.41\u00b0C for 2024 not to be warmer than 2023. A drop of this magnitude in October\u2013December has never occurred in the ERA5 dataset, which starts in 1940 (the largest drop was 0.25\u00b0C in 1998). Therefore, it is almost certain that 2024 will be warmer than 2023, and thus the warmest calendar year on record.\n\n          European average\n  \n\n\nEuropean-mean surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1991-2020 for each September, all months, and running 12-month averages from 1979 to 2024.

Credit: Copernicus Climate Change Service/ECMWF.\nIn September 2024, air temperatures were above their 1991-2020 average over eastern and northeastern Europe. Heatwaves occurred across Norway and Sweden, and Finland experienced above-average temperatures; a marine heatwave has also affected the coastal waters around Finland. Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula in Northwest Russia had its record September temperature of 21\u00b0C. Italy and eastern parts of the Mediterranean had temperatures slightly above average. In contrast, a large part of western of Europe had below-average temperatures, including most of the Iberian Peninsula, France, and Iceland. Near-average temperatures occurred in the United Kingdom.\nOutside Europe, temperatures were well above average over Manitoba, Canada, and most of the rest of Canada, the central and western United States, and South America, where drought conditions and wildfires have been prevalent. Northeast Africa experienced heatwave conditions, especially in Egypt. China had above-average temperatures, with Sichuan and Chongqing notably affected by heatwaves. Japan had its second-warmest September on record (since 1898), while Australia had its fourth-warmest September on record (since 1910). Eastern Antarctica also had above-average temperatures. Conversely, below-average temperatures occurred over parts of the Sahel and southern Africa, along the eastern United States, and in parts of central Asia. West Antarctica had the most below-average temperatures.\n\n          Sea surface temperature\n  \n\n\nDaily sea surface temperature (\u00b0C) averaged over the extra-polar global ocean (60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N) for 2023 (orange) and 2024 (dark red). All other years between 1979 and 2022 are shown with grey lines. The daily average for the 1991\u20132020 reference period is shown with a dashed grey line. Data source: ERA5. Credit: Copernicus Climate Change Service/ECMWF.\nHigh surface air temperatures over ocean areas were associated with continuing near-record sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) for 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N for the time of year. In mid-July, the daily SST fell below the values observed in 2023 after staying continuously at record levels for the first half of 2024; however, both 2024 and 2023 are markedly above all previous years. The average SST for September 2024 was 20.83\u00b0C, 0.48\u00b0C above average, the second highest on record for September, and only 0.09\u00b0C lower than the monthly value for September 2023.\n\nAnomalies and extremes in sea surface temperature for September 2024. Colour categories refer to the percentiles of the temperature distributions for the 1991\u20132020 reference period. The extreme (\u201cCoolest\u201d and \u201cWarmest\u201d) categories are based on rankings for the period 1979\u20132024. Values are calculated only for the ice-free oceans. Areas covered with sea ice and ice shelves in September 2024 are shown in light grey. Data source: ERA5. Credit: Copernicus Climate Change Service/ECMWF\nThe recent El Ni\u00f1o event has been an important contributor to the high global SSTs observed over the past year. Although SSTs in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific were mainly below the 1991-2020 average during September, reflecting the move from El Ni\u00f1o to La Ni\u00f1a conditions, SSTs remained the highest on record in the western part of the tropical Pacific, as shown in the above map of anomalies and extremes. Moreover, high SSTs in oceanic regions outside of the equatorial Pacific are a key contributor to the near-record global-average SST in September. The map shows that SSTs also reached record high values for September in many parts of the Atlantic Ocean (subtropical and extratropical North Atlantic, subtropical South Atlantic, and the Caribbean Sea), in many parts of the Indian Ocean, in the Southern Ocean sector south of Africa, and in various parts of the extratropical Pacific Ocean. The Mediterranean Sea, Barents Sea, eastern Baltic Sea, and the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico also recorded record SSTs, with the latter region being in the path of Hurricane Helene.\nFrom July 2024\u00a0onward the 1981-2010 reference period will not be displayed any more in the Climate Bulletin pages.

The world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first coal-fired generator was opened in 1882 in East London. \nIn the week succeeding the coal closure, ~24.7% of demand was met by gas, ~4.4% by solar, ~34.7% by wind, ~15.3% by nuclear, ~7.1% by biomass and the remainder was hydro and imports. \nThe UK has been transitioning away from coal since 1990 when 80% of electricity generated came from black coal. This transition was accelerated in 2015 when the government announced plans to close all coal within the next decade, which it has now achieved. Britain is now the first of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cG7\u00e2\u0080\u009d countries to phase out coal.\nDespite the closure of its last coal plant, the national energy system operator expects Britain's winter power supplies to outstrip demand by almost 9% in its base case scenario, with the risk of blackouts reducing to the lowest level seen in four years. \nGas fired generation has also followed a downward trend since 2016, albeit marginally, encouraging the continued decline of UK emissions intensity as seen in the figure to the right.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nWhat this month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developments mean for Australian business\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nEnergy market \nThe energy market saw significantly subdued pricing across all NEM regions through September, with most states experiencing oversupply during daylight hours. This was influenced by several factors, including an increase in rooftop solar generation, minimal coal outages and seasonality-led low demand. \nThis creates a challenging environment for, for renewable energy assets where below average market prices drive DWAPs close to and even below $0/MWh as well as BESS assets as price spikes have been relatively subdued.\nOn the sell-side of the market, these shifting conditions emphasise potential risks for spot-market exposed entities. Asset owners are likely to rely on alternate revenue streams such as PPAs, financial swaps, firm blocks, virtual and physical tolls amongst other offtake mechanisms. Lower merchant revenues for renewable energy projects may see a sell-off of LGCs as asset owners look to manage cashflow. These contract mechanisms and in-depth market insights are outlined in CORE Markets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offtake market report. \nSimilarly, potential buyers should look to establish appropriate hedging and contracting strategies, to minimise some of the seasonal risk. \u00c2\u00a0Compared to the significant volatility observed in winter, spring can present opportunities for buyers, highlighting the need to lock in sound hedging strategies with appropriate timing. \nThis month also saw considerable variation in asset performance between states, highlighting regional differences and the importance of informed investment decisions.\nThe CORE Markets team works with renewable energy project developers and corporate energy buyers to help both sides of the market manage risk. \u00c2\u00a0Get in touch to discuss your strategy.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nCarbon market \nFor the second month in a row the ACCU market saw a significant increase in traded volumes reaching a new high for 2024, at 2.5 million certificates. Alongside this traded volume increase spot prices for Generic ACCUs also rose to a new 2024 high of $37.40, Uni\nImportantly, the market continued to show signs of increasing maturity with notable volumes of Put Options trading.\nThe increase in interest in the ACCU market is also seen through primary market engagement where buyers engage with project developers as part of their strategic carbon procurement.

We used the multi-model Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment for Africa of 25 regional climate models under the RCP8.5 scenario. The changes in temperature are quantified relative to the period 1971\u20132000 based on five Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices indexes namely for warm spells, hot nights, hot days, cold nights and cold days. We show that a global warming of 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C will lead to an increase in the frequency of warm days and warm nights and a decrease in the occurrence of cold days and cold nights across C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in all climatic zones and seasons. More than 80% of the model ensemble members project this change at both GWLs. Moreover, the assessment of differences in GWLs highlights that the difference between the 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C thresholds may intensify the changes over all the country, climatic zones and seasons. Therefore this 0.5 \u00b0C difference in global warming is likely to impact upon energy demand and the agricultural system throughout the country and over all of the seasons. This study provides climate information for decision makers related to sectors such as agriculture, energy in their adaptation strategies.\n\nExport citation and abstract\n\nBibTeX\nRIS\n\n\n\n                  \n                  \nOriginal content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.

For example, agriculture remains rain-fed in many West African countries and is highly impacted upon by climate change and associated extremes such as droughts and floods (Sultan and Gaetani 2016, Trisos et al\n2022). Also, over recent decades, frequent high impact events like floods and droughts over West Africa have been responsible for numerous human deaths and structural damage (Tschakert et al\n2010).\nIn 2015, during the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) held in Paris (hereafter referred to as the Paris Agreement), the decision was made to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, well below the 2 \u00b0C of the COP16 Cancun agreement. While this global target is useful for communication, the limitations of the global mean temperature as a measure of climate change impact was apparent during the recent warming 'hiatus' discussion (Trenberth and Fasullo 2013, Steinman et al\n2015), which addressed changes in global temperature anomalies instead of the discernible regional impact of extreme events in temperature and precipitation in response to the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) emissions scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). Previous work (Sylla et al\n2015, Egbebiyi 2016, Abiodun et al\n2017) has shown that increased greenhouse gases concentration will result in an increase in extreme events intensity and frequency. Investigating the implications of changes in consecutive dry days (CDDs) and consecutive wet days at the regional scale of West Africa at global warming levels (GWLs) of 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C, Klutse et al (2018) found that enhanced warming will lead to a reduction in the mean rainfall across the region, with an increase of CDD over the Guinean region. Moreover, Diedhiou et al (2018) applied a scaling approach over various sub-regions within the West African domain, such as Western Sahel, Central Sahel, Eastern Sahel, Guinea Coast, and Central Africa including Congo Basin. They found that the increase in temperature within the region is projected to be higher than the global mean temperature increase (at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C) and heatwaves are expected to be more frequent and of longer duration. Over the wetter regions of the Guinea Coast and Central Africa, Diedhiou et al (2018) noticed a negligible change in total precipitation, a decrease in the length of wet spells, and the highest increase of heavy rainfall under the 1.5 \u00b0C global warming scenario. Though the implications of projected global mean temperature changes tend to be underestimated at the regional and countries level, since the global changes are much smaller than the expected changes in regional temperature mean and extremes over most land areas (Seneviratne et al\n2016), projected changes in temperature extremes can significantly differ from each other at different warming levels (Nkemelang et al\n2018).\nOver C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Yapo et al (2019, 2020) investigated future changes in temperature using the warm spell days index (HWFI), very warm days frequency index (TX90P), warm nights frequency index (TN90P), and intra-period extreme temperature range based on 14 of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)-Africa simulations ensemble under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. They found moderate changes in extremes over C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and projected changes in the seasonal extreme precipitation intensity and dry spell length under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 forcing scenarios, which suggested a robust increase in the cumulative intensity of precipitation associated with an amplification of extreme precipitation events during the West African Monsoon (WAM) period (Yapo et al\n2020). Although these studies provide information about projected changes for the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, they did not assess the regional changes at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C of global warming. This study investigates the implications of 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C of global warming at the country scale, since countries face different challenges (local economy, energy, water resources, social and political situation) and decision-making, with respect to adaptation, usually occurs at the national scale. The aim of this work is to quantify the projected changes in temperature extremes over C\u00f4te d'Ivoire under global warming in the context of the Paris Agreement, relative to both pre-industrial and present-day temperatures.\n2.\u00a0Material and method\n2.1.\u00a0Study area\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire is a country in West Africa located in the Gulf of Guinea (figure 1). Its economy is based largely on rain-fed agriculture and rainfall is driven by the WAM. The regional climate is characterised by the north\u2013south shift of the inter-tropical convergence zone, which is warm and humid, ranging from equatorial in the southern coasts, to tropical in the central regions and semiarid in the far north. In the southern coastal regions, precipitation patterns are correlated with air\u2013sea interactions in the equatorial Atlantic known as the Atlantic Ni\u00f1o index, rather than the WAM index (Nnamchi and Li 2011). The dry and hot season is from November to May, while the wet and hot season is from June to October. The country is the world's top exporter of Cocoa with almost 70% of the population involved in agriculture. With a total population of 22 million in 2015, the country's population rate is increasing and is expected to reach 48 million inhabitants in 2050.\nFigure 1.\u00a0Map of Cote d'Ivoire (in West Africa) with the meteorological station locations and climatic zones considered here, based on the suggestion made by Kouadio et al (2007, 2011, 2015).\nDownload figure:\nIn this study we consider three climatic regions in the country, the southern equatorial region from the coast 4\u00b0 N to 6\u00b0 N (R1), the central tropical region from 6\u00b0 N to 8\u00b0 N (R2) and the northern semi-arid climatic region from 8\u00b0 N to 10.5\u00b0 N (R3) (figure 1).\n2.2.\u00a0Data\nAn ensemble of 25 simulations from 12 regional climate models (RCMs) driven by ten global climate models (GCM) from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison (CMIP5), as described in Nikulin et al (2012, 2018) are used in this study. A bilinear interpolation has been conducted to re-grid the CORDEX data from 50 km to 12 km. This enables more grid points for climatic zone analysis since the 50 km resolution was too coarse a resolution. Following Klutse et al (2018), the RCP8.5 scenarios.\nThe spatial distribution of the data from the selected meteorological stations from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Exploitation et de D\u00e9veloppement A\u00e9roportuaire, A\u00e9ronautique et M\u00e9t\u00e9orologique (SODEXAM), presented in figure 1, is used in this study. The three climatic zones (north, centre and south) of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, as suggested by Kouadio et al (2007, 2011, 2015), are considered in this work. The southern and central climatic zones are characterised by a bimodal rainfall (peak in June and October), while the northern climatic zone are characterised by a unimodal rainfall during July\u2013August\u2013September (JAS) (Tie et al\n2007). The selection of the stations is fully motivated by the data availability over the reference period (1971\u20132000). Since the stations' data were available from 1982 to 2000, CORDEX data is evaluated through this period. Thus, stations in the northern (Odienne and Korhogo), the central (Bondoukou, Bouak\u00e9, Yamoussoukro, Daloa, Man and Gagnoa) and the southern (Abidjan, Adiake, San Pedro, Sassandra and Tabou) climatic zones, are used to assess the CORDEX RCMs ability to reproduce the historical climate of the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. However, unlike in Kouadio et al (2015), which focused only on the southern and central part of the country, the current work includes available northern stations data. It is worth noting that there is still a need to reinforce the density of the observation network to allow a more complete assessment (see Trisos et al\n2022).\n2.3.\u00a0Method\nThis present work focuses on the changes in temperature based on the GWLs (1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C). The term GWLs is defined as the average GWL above some baseline period (of e.g. 1.5\u00b0, 2\u00b0, 3\u00b0, 4\u00b0). Various definitions, depending on a pre-industrial baseline with a mean period of 15, 20 or 30 years, have been used to describe the GWLs. In this work, the methods used to determine the GWLs (1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C) and the robustness of a climate change signal follow Nikulin et al (2018), who report on the timing (i.e. years) of when these levels are crossed, and an assessment of the robustness of the changes are detailed in Nikulin et al (2018).\nThe timing of each warming level crossing is computed for each downscaled GCM and defined as the centre year of a long enough period (usually 20 or 30 years) when global mean temperature reaches predefined anomalies (1.5 \u00b0C or 2 \u00b0C) compared to preindustrial levels. Then, for the RCM, the same GWL timing defined by the downscaled GCM is used to extract 30 years for analysis. The corresponding 30 years period is then extracted from the corresponding RCM simulations for analysis using 1971\u20132000 as a control (CTL) period, as discussed in Nikulin et al (2018). The time window 1861\u20131890 is taken as the preindustrial period, as it is a reasonable approximation for pre-industrial global mean temperature and it is available for all CMIP5 historical simulations, as underlined in Klutse et al (2018).\nA brief synthesis is provided here, however detailed information can be found in Nikulin et al (2018). Information on the changes of the climate will be considered as robust when it fulfils the following two criteria: (a) more than 80% of considered model simulations agree on the sign of the supposed change; (b) the signal to noise ratio, i.e. the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation of the ensemble of climate change signals, is equal to or larger than one. While the first criterion considers only the agreement of the ensemble members, the second criterion is a metric of the strength of the climate change signal. The second criterion is necessary, as even if the first criterion is met, the change signal may be negligible. The responses to the 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C GWLs of extreme temperature are assessed through five (5) temperature-based indices from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). These include TX10P, TX90P, TN10P, TN90P and HWDI for temperature (see table 1 for a full description of the indices).\nTable 1.\u00a0Temperature-based climate extreme indices.

CC BY 3.0.\n3.\u00a0Results and discussions\n3.1.\u00a0CORDEX-Africa temperature assessment over C\u00f4te d'Ivoire\nAn assessment of the daily temperature during the historical period (1982\u20132000) over C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was made using ground-based observations from SODEXAM meteorological stations, as shown in figure 2. In the Taylor diagram (Taylor 2001), the individual models interpolated to the nearest grid points around a station considered are represented in black dots, the ensemble mean in red and the meteorological observation in blue dots is used as reference data and labelled 'ref' in the figure 2. Because of differences in the calendars used by individual models (for example the simulations with HadGEM, use a 360 d calendar, while others are using the standard Gregorian calendar) the analysis with the Taylor diagram is made at a monthly scale.\nFigure 2.\u00a0Comparison of the daily temperature statistics (standard deviation, correlation coefficient, and root mean square) of CORDEX data (black dots) to each other and with the observation (marked as ref) over meteorological stations in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The red dots account for the model's ensemble mean. The first row indicates the northern stations, the second and third row accounts for the central stations, and the fourth and fifth rows for the southern stations.\nDownload figure:\nThe analysis of the results shows that along the coastal area, in the southern climatic zone (stations of Abidjan, Adiak\u00e9, San Pedro, Sassandra and Tabou), most of the single members of the RCMs ensemble show lower standard deviation values close to the reference and relatively low values of RMSE. Also, the correlation values between these RCMs and these stations of the southern zone are between 0.7 and 0.9, except for Tabou where the values are between 0.6 and 0.8. Thus, the ensemble mean of the RCMs is located closer to the reference, suggesting a good replication of the observed temperature by the CORDEX- Africa RCMs over the southern part of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, especially along the coast.\nOver the central part of the country, for the stations of Bondoukou, Bouak\u00e9, and Yamoussoukro, the single members of the CORDEX-Africa RCMs display standard deviation values at both sides of the reference one. Thus, the ensemble mean has a standard deviation value mostly identical to the reference value. Also, across the stations of Daloa, Gagnoa, and Man, the values of standard deviation displayed by the single members and the ensemble mean are slightly higher than the reference. The values of the correlation coefficient, in this region, are varying from 0.6 to 0.8 for Yamoussoukro, 0.4\u20130.9 for Bondoukou, and from 0.4 to 0.8 in Bouak\u00e9, Daloa, Gagnoa, and Man. Also, the values of the RMSE displayed are relatively higher between these RCM members and the observation, suggesting an acceptable ability of these RCMs in reproducing the temperature patterns of the central part of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\nIn the northern climatic zone (stations of Korhogo and Odienn\u00e9), the majority of the single ensemble members of the RCMs display standard deviation values close to the reference value. These northern stations also have smaller values of RMSE and a high correlation between these RCMs and the observations. Therefore, the ensemble mean of the CORDEX-Africa RCMs and the single members are located closer to the reference, suggesting a better performance of these RCMs over the northern part of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire compared to the other regions. This assessment of the simulated daily temperatures of CORDEX-Africa over the period 1982\u20132000 highlights an increasing performance of RCMs from the South towards the North of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, in agreement with previous works which underlined that the skills of the RCMS varied from one location to another with higher performance away from the coastal area (Kouadio et al\n2015).\nMoreover, Gbobaniyi et al (2014) noticed substantial variable biases in both the magnitude and spatial extent from model to model in the CORDEX-Africa RCMs. These biases in the RCMs were related to several sources, including boundary condition, internal dynamic physical schemes convective parameterization and horizontal resolution (Cr\u00e9tat et al\n2014, Klutse et al\n2015).\n3.2.\u00a0Spatial distribution of the annual mean changes in temperature extremes\nAcross C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the percentage of days when the daily minimum temperature is below the 10th percentile (TN10P) decreases by up to \u221212% under GWL 1.5 \u00b0C and \u221215% under GWL 2 \u00b0C (figures 3(a)\u2013(d)). These decreases suggest a reduction of the occurrence of cold night events, especially along the coastal region and the northern part of the country of up to 12% (GWL 1.5 \u00b0C) and 15% (GWL 2 \u00b0C) from about 20% of the time during the reference period (1971\u20132000). This reduction is at a minimum over the central parts of the country, less than 5% with GWL 1.5 \u00b0C and approximately 5% for GWL 2 \u00b0C. Compared to GWL 1.5 \u00b0C, the extra warming to GWL 2 \u00b0C could bring an additional reduction of the occurrence of cold nights by 2% \u2013 4%, with maxima mainly located in the western, the southern and northern part of the country.\nFigure 3.\u00a0Ensemble mean of TN10P (a)\u2013(d), TN90P (e)\u2013(h), TX10P (i)\u2013(l), TX90P (m)\u2013(p) and HWDI (q)\u2013(t) for the reference period 1971\u20132001 (a)\u2013(q), (b)\u2013(r) and (c)\u2013(s) respectively for the projected changes at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C GWLs with respect to the reference period and (d)\u2013(t) the difference between the changes at 2 \u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b0C.\nDownload figure:\nAn increase in GWL to both 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C will increase the highest values of the minimum temperature (TN90P), from 23% to 25% during the reference period, to about 36% and 54% respectively (figures 3(e)\u2013(h)). This shows that exceeding the GWL threshold of both 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C will result in an increase in warm nights compared to the historical period. The projected increase in warm nights shows a north\u2013south gradient with maximum values towards the coast. Exceeding the GWL 1.5 \u00b0C and reaching the 2 \u00b0C threshold is projected to cause an increase in warm nights, characterised by a north\u2013south gradient, with 5% in the north to 14% towards the coastal part of the country.\nThe spatial distribution of the annual mean changes in TX10P due to the GWLs at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C, over C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (figures 3(i)\u2013(l)), suggests a decrease, from about 19% during the historical period, up to 9% and 12% respectively. The spatial distribution pattern of these changes shows a south\u2013north gradient with highest reductions of TX10P in the south (compared to the north) at both GWLs at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C. These changes show that the percentage of cold days will reduce across the country as the global temperature rises above the level of 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C. The occurrence of cold days decreases by approximately 3.2% at GWL 2 \u00b0C compared to GWL 1.5 \u00b0C, I with a maximum reduction located over the coastal zones and along the eastern border with Ghana.\nThe projected changes in the spatial distribution of the annual mean of TX90P over C\u00f4te d'Ivoire show an increase under GWLs at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C (figures 3(m)\u2013(p)). The percentages of occurrence of TX90P increase from 28% during the historical period by about 19% and 27% in the context of GWLs at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C respectively compared to the historical period.\nThus, in the context of GWL at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C, the warm days events are projected to be 12% \u2013 18% and 15% \u2013 30% respectively more frequent compared to the reference period, which recorded an occurrence of about 20%. The maximum values of these changes are projected in the coastal zone under GWL at 1.5 \u00b0C and spread across the country in the context of GWL at 2 \u00b0C.\nThe enhanced GWL at 2 \u00b0C (compared to GWL 1.5 \u00b0C) will result in an additional increase of up to 8% in the occurrence frequency of warm day events.\nAn enhancement of the GWL to the 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C thresholds may lead to changes in the temperature pattern across C\u00f4te d'Ivoire similar to the West African region discussed by Kumi and Abiodun (2018) and Klutse et al (2018).\nThe spatial distribution of the annual mean of HWDI indices (figures 3(q)\u2013(t)) revealed increases of these indices for both 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C of GWLs. These increases in HWDI of up to 25 and 55 d respectively for GWLs 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C indicate that warm spells are expected to lengthen over C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Also, the spatial distribution shows that the maxima are located over the coastal region in the southern part of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. These warm spells are expected to be more pronounced along the coast and in the northern half of the country. Moving from GWL 1.5 \u00b0C to 2 \u00b0C lengthens the warm spells by up to 27 d, with maximum values located along the coast, in the middle east, and the north\u2013west of the country.\n3.3.\u00a0Seasonal changes in temperature extremes\nThe previous section discussed the annual mean and spatial distribution of the changes in temperature extremes over C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. It reported an increase in warm days, nights, and spells associated with a decrease in cold days and nights in the context of GWL of both 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C thresholds. The current section focuses on the seasonal mean changes in TN10P, TN90P, TX10P, TX90P and HWDI under GWLs at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C, across C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and for each of its climatic zones as defined in figure 1. Following Yapo et al (2019), four seasons, namely January\u2013February\u2013March (JFM), April\u2013May\u2013June (AMJ), July\u2013August\u2013September (JAS) and October\u2013November\u2013December (OND) have been used for each of the three climatic zones.\nThe assessment of the projected changes in temperature extremes over Cote d'Ivoire and its climatic regions projects a decrease in the occurrence frequency of cold nights and days, associated with an increase in the occurrence frequency of warm nights and days. These expected changes may also result in an increase in the length of the maximum warm spell per year at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C GWLs. This implies that the expected changes in temperature extremes would affect the diurnal cycle of temperature over the entire country and its climatic regions, during all of the seasons. Thus, these changes in temperature will potentially impact agriculture, crop production, and food security as well as human health and energy.\nThe maximum seasonal changes in the frequency of warm nights is projected to occur during JAS under GWL at 1.5 \u00b0C at the country level and in all of the climatic zones. In the context of GWL at 2 \u00b0C, the maximum rise in warm night events occurs during the season OND in the southern and central part of the country and during the season AMJ for the northern zone and at country level (table 2). The minimum changes in warm night occurrence are mainly expected during JFM. The maximum decrease, in cold night events, under GWL at 1.5 \u00b0C is expected during JAS in southern and northern Cote d'Ivoire. In the context of GWL at 2 \u00b0C, the maximum decrease in the occurrence of cold nights are projected in AMJ across the south and centre and during JAS in the north of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (table 2). The minimum decrease in cold night events varies between seasons and regions at GWL 1.5 \u00b0C and mainly in OND under GWL 2 \u00b0C. The maximum increase in warm day occurrences is expected during JFM in all climatic zones, while the rainy seasons are relatively less affected. The maximum decrease in cold days, under GWL at 1.5 \u00b0C, is expected in JFM in the south and north and OND in the centre. In the context of GWL at 2 \u00b0C, the maximum decrease in cold nights is expected in OND. This suggests more frequent warm nights during the WAM period, when the parts with bimodal rainfall patterns (southern and central) experience the little dry season, meaning that the JAS season will experience more warmer nights. Warm days are projected to increase during JFM in a period that already records frequent warm events. The increase of 0.5 \u00b0C from the 1.5 \u00b0C threshold to 2 \u00b0C may not only impact the amplitude of temperature extreme events such as cold days/nights and warm days/nights, but also induce a slight shift of these amplitudes between seasons.\nTable 2.\u00a0Summary of maximum and minimum seasonal change in temperature extreme occurrences for C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and its climatic regions under GWL at 1.5 \u00b0C, 2 \u00b0C of RCP8.5 and their differences. The maximum and minimum values are in parenthesis.\nThese general increases in warm day/night and decreases in cold day/night occurrences, associated with the occurrence of longer warm spells expected over C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, are in line with Klutse et al (2018), who show a rise in temperature across West Africa at both 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C GWL using CORDEX data under the RCP 8.5. Moreover, Nikulin et al (2018) show that the West African region has already experienced a 1.5 \u00b0C warming since 2004 and the temperature is expected to continue to increase through 2049. They further noticed that some models indicated that the temperature rise has already crossed the 2 \u00b0C GWL since the year 2012 and would continue to rise through 2066. Furthermore, the current results are in agreement with a similar analysis in temperature extreme over C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (Yapo et al\n2019) that projected an increase, during the periods 2031\u20132060 and 2071\u20132100, in the frequency of warm spell days, very warm days, and the warm nights across the country, under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Using the low-warming projections of NCAR-CESM to assess the differences in extreme temperature events under the GWLs at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2.0 \u00b0C, relative to the recent climate taken from 1976 to 2005 over Africa, Iyakaremye et al (2021) found that the frequency of occurrence of hot days (TX90P) is projected to increase with global warming across the African continent, while the frequency of cold day events (TN10P) is expected to decrease, especially across West Africa. Moreover, Mba et al (2018) using CORDEX projection under RCP8.5 indicated that despite large uncertainties associated with projections at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C, the 0.5 \u00b0C increase in global temperature is associated with a larger regional warming response in Africa. The intercomparisons between the changes due to GWL at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C reveal generally marginal differences, in agreement with Klutse et al (2018). Most of the CORDEX-Africa models (generally more than 90%) used in the present work, across C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and the respective climatic zones, agree on the signs of the changes in temperature extreme. This indicates robust results for the increase in warm days/nights and the decreases in cold days/nights, associated with the occurrence of longer warm spells. Our results clearly indicate that these changes in temperature extremes, which would occur over all the climatic regions and during all of the seasons in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, may certainly influence heatwave intensity and occurrence and may also contribute to increased disaster risks. Additionally, previous works showed that across Africa, an increase in hot nights, long and persistent heatwaves, and disaster risks are expected to increase under GWL at 1.5 \u00b0C and will be amplified in the 2 \u00b0C level (Dosio et al\n2018, Weber et al\n2018, Djalante 2019).\n3.4.\u00a0Potential impacts on food and energy security\nSeveral areas of the country are projected to experience warmer hot extremes which will necessarily impact agriculture, crop production, and food security in a country like C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, whose economy is mainly based on rain-fed agriculture, since surface temperature may affect plant growth, development and crop yield. The current agricultural system will need to be restructured in light of the present results, by developing and integrating species more tolerant to this temperature increase, to ensure food security. Concerning the energy sector, these longer warm spells, at the country level will probably increase temperature discomfort, which will induce more energy demand and consumption for cooling systems in both households and offices (Akara et al\n2021). It will also affect solar energy production (Danso et al\n2022) which remains one of the major sources of low carbon energy. Moreover, since our results highlighted that a difference of 0.5 \u00b0C may not only impact extreme temperature amplitudes but may induce some seasonal shifts, changes will also be expected in the current pattern of energy demand. In a country where electricity production and access is still climate-dependent, as seen recently (in 2021) with widespread power shortage due to climatic hazards (low precipitations, high temperatures), it will be necessary and useful for decision-makers to put in place more sustainable energy systems, such as renewable energy, integrating the findings of this work in the infrastructure designs. These projected changes in temperature in Africa, can be an opportunity for African countries to put in place common policies, to better develop tools and use the continent solar energy reserves which are estimated to be about 60 000 000 TWh yr\u22121 (representing 40% of the global total solar energy potential), making Africa the most sun-rich continent in the world (Liu 2015).\nAs underlined by Nikulin et al (2018), the change in temperature over Cote d'Ivoire shown in the present results may be biased by some specific RCMs of the ensemble considered. Similar to their finding, the CORDEX ensemble used in this study is at least biased towards ten members of one RCM. Although in such a case, it is advisable to carefully analyse and understand the individual models considered, though this has not been analysed here. Therefore, our results only provide an overview of temperature expectations under GWLs at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C over C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and its sub-climatic zones.\n4.\u00a0Summary and conclusion\nThis work investigates the annual and seasonal mean changes in temperature extreme under GWLs of 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and its climatic zones using 25 simulations of the CORDEX-Africa ensemble under the RCP8.5 scenario. It uses daily temperatures from 13 meteorological stations to assess the CORDEX data across C\u00f4te d'Ivoire during the period 1982\u20132000. The results show that the CORDEX reasonably reproduces daily mean temperatures across the country with a correlation varying between 0.4 and 0.9 from south to north.\nThe analysis of the changes in selected ETCCDI extreme temperature metrics show longer warm spells (HWDI) under GWLs at 1.5 \u00b0C (25 d) and 2 \u00b0C (55 d) compared to the historical period. Also, the results show an increase in the occurrence of hot nights (TN90P between 19% and 56%) compared to the historical period under both GWL at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C. An additional 0.5 \u00b0C temperature rise from 1.5 \u00b0C GWL may lead to an increase in daytime warm event occurrence frequencies by 8%, with maximums over the coastal, central and widespread northern regions. This is associated with an increase in warm night occurrences of about 4%\u201312% with a maximum over the coastal region well south of 6\u00b0 N. Moreover, a decrease in the occurrence of cold nights (TN10P) and cold days (TX10P) is expected from 14% to 12% and 9% to 12% under respectively GWLs at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C. Thus, crossing the 2 \u00b0C GWL threshold may induce a decrease, of about 3%, in cold night occurrences over the western part and mountainous region of the country (from 7\u00b0 N to 10\u00b0 N). This projected decrease in cold night events may extend toward the centre of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and reach the northern borders. Additionally, this decrease in cold night events is also associated with a decrease in cold days (about 3%) with the maximum reduction located over the coastal region and along the eastern border.\nThe seasonal analysis revealed that at the country level, the warm spell lengths (HWDI) are expected to increase over all of the seasons.\nThe seasonal analysis of the changes in temperature extremes over the climatic zones of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire reveals an increase in the warm spell duration across all of the regions and over all seasons, in the context of a global warming at both the 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C threshold. An increase in warm night/day occurrences (TN90P/TX90P) is also expected over all seasons and climatic zones at both GWLs 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C. This increase in warm night/day occurrences (TN10P/TX10P) is associated with a decrease in cold night/day events across all regions and seasons. The seasonal means over the climatic zones suggest that the difference of 0.5 \u00b0C may not only impact the amplitudes of changes in temperature extremes, but may induce some shifts in the seasons. There is generally a good agreement (\u223c85% \u2013 95%) in the projection of increases of warm night/day events, warm spell duration and the decrease in cold night/day events by the model ensemble members in the context of both GWL at 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C. The combination of the projected increases in warm day/night occurrences and the decreases in cold day/night occurrences will contribute to a temperature rise across the country and its climatic zones and over all of the seasons. This will likely affect many sectors, such as energy demand for home cooling as heatwave intensity and occurrences increase. In addition, these warmer conditions all over the country and the seasons will impact the agriculture sector, crop production and food security. It is therefore necessary and urgent for decision-makers and the scientific community to investigate the development of new crop systems and crop variants that are more tolerant to this temperature increase. Further studies should investigate the impact of these changes in temperature extreme on specific crops such as cocoa, cashew or/and food security as well as energy, for example.\nAcknowledgments\nThe CORDEX-Africa data used in this work were obtained from the Earth System Grid Federation server (https://esgf-data.dkrz.de/projects/esgf-dkrz/).

City authorities have also warned of a risk of water shortages and the power grid tripping. \nDelhi\u2019s city record of 49.2\u00baC from 2002 had been broken the day before, with temperatures reaching 49.9\u00baC on May 27, 2024.\nClimate change, predominantly caused by burning fossil fuels and exacerbated by human interference, is making heatwaves hotter and more likely to happen everywhere in the world, according to scientists who study how extreme events are changing. Cities are more vulnerable to the compounding effects of urbanisation and climate change.\nAccording to the IPCC, heatwaves that occurred once every 10 years without human-caused warming are now likely to occur 2.8 times more often (or once every 3.6 years) and are 1.5\u00baC warmer because of climate change caused by burning fossil fuels. \n\n \n\n\n\nSince last week, the entire Northwest India, especially parts of Rajasthan and the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR), have been under the grip of severe heat waves. (Photo: PTI)\nExtreme heatwaves that occurred once every 50 years without human-caused warming are now likely to occur 4.8 times more often (or once every 10.4 years) and are 1.5\u00baC warmer. If emissions are not cut much faster than planned, they will become 2-3 times more common again.\nExtreme heatwaves that occurred once every 50 years without human-caused warming are now likely to occur 4.8 times more often (or once every 10.4 years) and are 1.5\u00baC warmer. If emissions are not cut much faster than planned, they will become 2-3 times more common again.\nDr. Krishna AchutaRao, Professor and Dean, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, says, \"The widespread, long-lasting, and intense heatwave conditions over India and many other parts of the world are the direct result of climate change caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases. There is an urgent need to take adaptation steps to control the rising global average temperatures; else, the result is in front of us.\"\nExtreme heat forced schools to close early for the summer in India. Temperatures in at least 37 cities exceeded 45\u00baC, with warnings of a \u201cvery high likelihood\u201d of heat illnesses for the entire population. Nighttime temperatures remained as high as 36\u00baC in some locations, which is particularly dangerous as it means people cannot cool off at night. There have been over 16,000 heat stroke cases and 60 heat-related deaths since March 2024, although this number is likely a huge underestimate. The dangerous impact\nThe dangerous impact\nHeat in India and South Asia is characterised by being extremely humid, which makes it more dangerous for human health. High humidity levels prevent the body from cooling itself through sweating, raising the risk of heat strokes and other life-threatening conditions. The combination of intense heat and humidity poses life-threatening risks to the population, exposing them to conditions that exceed human tolerance. This risk is further increased in cities, as they are often warmer than rural areas.\nAarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends, says, \"Heatwaves are clearly the single largest threat to India's well-being today. Record-breaking heat of over 48\u00baC across north, west, and central India shows that the climate crisis is a nice-to-push rhetoric as long as one hasn't experienced a 50\u00baC heatwave. Temperatures in Delhi and neighboring National Capital Region (NCR) states since the last two days are proof that the issue is now about survivability, and it\u2019s no longer a problem 'elsewhere'. As more and more Indian cities develop faster, climate resilience needs to be incorporated immediately to reduce the compounding impacts of extreme heat on human health, the economy, and livelihoods.\"\nA dedicated study is no longer necessary to understand whether climate change made a particular heatwave hotter, as this is now the case for all heatwaves. Extreme event attribution studies have evaluated how much hotter and more likely climate change made past heatwaves in India in 2022, 2023, and 2024; all concluded that burning fossil fuels made these events dramatically more likely to happen. Human-induced climate change is also increasing the temperatures that are reached during each heat episode, putting millions of lives at risk.\n\n \n\n\n\nHeat in India and South Asia is characterised by being extremely humid. (Photo Getty)\n\n\u201cThis is a wake-up call for urgent transformations to reduce the impact of the heat island effect. Between 1970 and 2018, India's urban population has increased fourfold to 460 million. That's more than one-third of Indians living in extreme vulnerability to climate threats, impacting both productivity and health,\" says Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends.\nDr. Friederike Otto, Imperial College London and Director of World Weather Attribution, says, \"This devastating heat is not a natural disaster. The suffering India is facing this week is worse because of climate change caused by burning coal, oil, and gas, and deforestation. What we are seeing in India is exactly what scientists said would happen if we didn\u2019t stop heating the planet. To avoid making the problem worse, the world needs to end fossil fuel use. Unless we do it, terrible heat like this will happen more and more often, and it will get even hotter. The heat will become worse, and the death toll will continue to rise fast.\u201d\nMahesh Palawat, Vice President of Meteorology and Climate Change at Skymet Weather, says, \u201cSince last week, the entire Northwest India, especially parts of Rajasthan and the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR), have been under the grip of severe heat waves. Maximum temperatures have been constantly above the 45\u00baC mark, which has made the current heatwave a prolonged one.\n\u201cWe saw a similar spike in temperatures in 2016 on account of El Ni\u00f1o, which is a natural and temporary driver of global warming. However, climate change has made things worse for India. El Ni\u00f1o will continue to form in the Pacific Ocean, but we need to limit average global temperatures at any cost; otherwise, similar situations will arise again and again.\n\u201cClimate change has been making heat waves more intense and frequent. 2024 is again a reminder of this.\u201d \nDr. Akshay Deoras, Research Scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Reading, UK, says, \u201cThis year\u2019s summer season in India is very unique. While frequent thunderstorms and cloud cover prevented the onset of high temperatures and heat waves over most of the country between March and mid-May, a stable weather pattern has been instigating heat waves for the last couple of days. With a persistent maximum temperature above 45\u00baC, a crunched summer season is turning out to be deadly across northwestern India, and El Ni\u00f1o is playing an important role in boosting temperatures this year.\n\u201cWe already have clear evidence of global warming increasing the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves across the globe, and El Ni\u00f1o is adding more to this effect.\u201d\nProf. Vidhya Venugopal, Country Director at Sri Ram Institute of Higher Education & Research, Chennai, says, \u201cThe unequal impacts of heat waves, especially with temperatures beyond 50\u00baC in dry environments like Delhi, will affect the most vulnerable, such as the elderly, young children, workers exerting outdoors, people with comorbidities, and the poor with minimal cooling interventions.\n\u201cWhen an individual is dehydrated, extreme heat exposure will thicken their blood and cause organs to shut down, resulting in death within hours, popularly called 'heat stroke'.\n\n \n\n\n\nExtreme heatwaves that occurred once every 50 years without human-caused warming are now likely to occur 4.8 times more often. (Photo: Getty)\n\n\u201cWe urgently need customized interventions for various stakeholders, preparedness to handle health emergencies, and action to protect exposed populations. With or without evidence, action is urgent.\u201d\nAditya Valiathan Pillai, Fellow, Sustainable Futures Collaborative, says, \u201cDelhi\u2019s sustained high temperatures nearing the 50s bring the focus back on its Heat Action Plan. In this infernal heat, millions of heat-exposed workers without access to cooling will struggle to earn their wages, protect their families, and stay safe. Heatwave preparedness and response measures in Delhi\u2019s newly minted Heat Action Plan must be implemented immediately.\n\u201cOf equal importance are long-term solutions like trees, changing how buildings are structured, and reducing the density of built areas to combat the urban heat island effect. Today\u2019s heat is yet another reminder of the terrible toll climate change will exact on India\u2019s most vulnerable.\u201d\nDr. Arun Sharma, Professor of Community Medicine, suggests, \u201cExposure to high atmospheric temperatures is harmful to the human body. Prolonged exposure to such high temperatures can cause heat stroke. It is recognized by fever above 104\u00b0F, dry skin, and loss of consciousness. High temperatures may also cause sunburn, irritation in the eyes, and dehydration. To protect yourself, avoid exposure to direct sunlight, use an umbrella and sunglasses. Keep the body hydrated with frequent, small intakes of water, fruit juice, coconut water, lemon drinks, etc. Avoid going out in extreme heat conditions. Sunscreen lotions also help in protecting against adverse effects on the skin. If eyes start itching, wash them frequently with clean, cold water. Avoid sudden changes in temperature, like walking out of air-conditioned rooms straight into sunlight and vice versa.\u201dPublished By: Sibu Kumar TripathiPublished On: May 30, 2024Must Watch \n\nAlso Watch\nArshdeep Dalla seeks bail in Canadian court\nAmit Shah attacks JMM over infiltration issue in Jharkhand\nUPPSC bows to students' demands, now PCS exam to be held in single shift\nHow Greater Noida man grew cannabis in his flat to sell on the dark web\nKanhaiya Kumar's inappropriate remark about Fadnavis's wife sparks debate\nRead This\nKhawaja reveals plans to handle Bumrah: \u2018Will not think about getting out\u2019\nHow Arsh Dalla, a Punjab gangster, turned into Khalistani terrorist in Canada\nSpecial probe team set up to investigate Kolkata tablet money scam case\nSunburn Goa 2024: Venue, date, artist lineup and all the details\nHow design thinking is solving climate, healthcare, and social challenges\nPUBLICATIONS\nTELEVISION\nEVENTS\nRADIO\nGAMING\nUSEFUL LINKS\nPRINTING\nWELFARE\nDISTRIBUTION\nSYNDICATIONS\nWEBSITES\nEDUCATION\n",
      "A Narrative on Urban Heat Island (UHI) in India\na need for a system thinking approach to integrate technologies and policies for climate and humankind\nIntroduction\nThe global temperatures are on the rise. Current data[1] show that global temperatures have been increasing by 0.360 C per decade since industrialization, and the warmest year on record is just a year ago[2]- 2023, with average temperatures 1.350 C above the pre-industrial average. It\u2019s now a known fact that climate change is happening and its effects are being felt across the globe. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and melting ice caps all point towards climate change. Humanity is responsible for exacerbating climate change and is the most impacted due to climate change. Scientists predict rising sea levels could displace 250-400 million[3] people in the next 80 years. Currently, the world\u2019s urban areas are coastal, hosting around 37% of the world\u2019s population at a population density twice the global average[4]. The predicted increase in urban population[5] to 68% by 2050 from the current 55% could only mean worse. Urbanization is shown to be one of the leading causes that alter urban climate and add to global GHG emissions. Studies[6] show that 70% of global CO2 emissions occur due to human anthropogenic activities within urban regions. Therefore, urban areas of the world are both at the creating and receiving end of this global climate change phenomenon, and one of the most dominant impacts of urbanization on climate is the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon.\nUrban Heat Islands (UHI)\nFactors contributing to UHI formation\nSeveral natural and human-modified changes impact the urban climate across temporal and spatial scales. From small-scale turbulences at the micro-scale to macro-scale jet streams and hurricanes, the climatic system is altered by the natural and human-modified characteristics of the earth's surface. While natural impacts of the earth's surface on climate may or may not be interfered with, it is crucial to understand and limit the negative impact of the human-modified environment on climate. Urban areas are the best examples of human-modified environments. Human-made modifications of urban areas, such as their function, texture, and form. All of which could influence the urban climate and lead to the formation of Urban Heat Islands.\nThe Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, characterized by higher temperatures in urban areas compared to their rural surroundings, is one of the most frequently observed urban climate modifications. The earliest UHI studies date back to the 1800s when Luke Howard noted that air temperatures in urban regions of London were higher than those in rural areas. Since then, UHI research has quantified the extent of the effect by measuring the temperature difference between urban and rural areas.\nUHI types\nBased on the location of the temperature measurement addressing different spatial scales, there are three different types of UHI: Surface UHI (SUHI), Canopy UHI (CUHI), and Boundary Layer UHI.\nWhile SUHI and CUHI are most relevant when referring to UHI's impact on human well-being and building energy consumption, boundary layer UHI reflects macro-scale weather changes happening across urban areas[8][9].\nSome characteristics of urban areas that could lead to UHI formation are:\nAll these heat exchanges occurring within the urban environment differ in magnitude compared to rural areas, where there is less development and more greenery, leading to lower temperatures than those found in urban areas.\nFigure 4: Differences in energy exchanges between urban and rural areas attributed to the UHI formation\nImpacts of UHI\nIrrespective of the type of UHI, this phenomenon is shown to impact urban climate, human well-being, energy consumption, and water availability. UHI increases cooling energy consumption by approximately 19% and it intensifies the heat stress, especially during the nighttime. The average nighttime SUHI intensity across 42 highly populated cities in India was 1.20C[10] which could impact human comfort and well-being. Studies show that even a small (less than 10C) rise in temperatures could power extreme weather events[11]. In addition, exposed surfaces in urban areas can be 30\u02daC to 40\u02daC hotter than the ambient air temperature during peak summers. As a result, the UHI phenomenon has numerous adverse effects. At a micro-scale, it increases building energy consumption and reduces occupant comfort. At the city level, it leads to elevated air temperatures, air pollution, and smog. Research also suggests that UHI can alter weather patterns and water quality, thereby impacting the environment, human health, and economic prosperity. Among its impacts on people, peak summer events can be fatal for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, urban workers, and the impoverished. Therefore, understanding UHI in the urban context of India is crucial. It not only helps in improving overall urban well-being and reducing energy consumption but could also improve the liveability and comfort of the homeless and economically disadvantaged populations in the country.\nUHI in India\nUrban Heat and UHI\nLike global averages, temperatures in India are rising. As shown in Figure 5, the increase in temperatures over the last 20 years is evident, using Hyderabad as an example. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) dry bulb temperature data indicate that from 2000 to 2019, temperatures in Hyderabad have risen by at least 1.0\u00b0C during the post-monsoon season and up to 1.8\u00b0C in the summer. This upward trend continues, as evidenced by the numerous heat waves in 2024, with temperatures reaching between 44\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C across the country. According to a recent study[12], India could experience a temperature rise of 1.1-5.1\u00b0C by 2100.\nAdditionally, land surface temperatures across 42 cities in India indicate that, although urban areas appear cooler than rural areas during daytime in the summer, this is not true for the rest of the seasons, particularly at night. During night time, the average UHI magnitude can reach up to 1.3\u00b0C, as seen in Figure 6. In another recent study[13], the authors showed that the average UHI magnitude in Bangalore and Hyderabad is 1.90C and 2.440C over the past two decades. All the existing research and data across cities in India show that UHI magnitude is increasing and is higher in the night time compared to the daytime. The already high temperatures and the high anthropogenic heat in the form of vehicles, humans, and building cooling, all add to a dense urban built environment that cannot cool off overnight, leading to an increased night time UHI magnitude.\nGrowing cities, hotspots, and heatsinks across Indian cities\nAs of 2023, while only 3.06% of land use in India is built-up areas, more than 40% of the Indian population lives in cities, and this is increasing[14]. By 2050, it is projected that around 60% of Indians are to live in urban areas. Today, urban areas of India contribute up to 44% of its GHG emissions[15]. The average increase in impervious surface area across 42 megacities in India is 68%, over 15 years from 2003 \u2013 2018. Shown in Figure 7 is an example of Hyderabad, India which had a 58% increase in artificial (humanmade) impervious surfaces over 15 years.[10]\nWith cities expanding, the anthropogenic heat emissions of cities are also increasing. Expanding cities are also responsible for decreasing urban vegetation that could lead to UHI formation. In India, the quality and quantity of urban vegetation seem to impact the UHI formation.[16] A decrease in vegetation reduces the latent heat transfer impacting the micro-climate and reducing human comfort. The land surface temperature maps of different cities in India show that some of the hotspots within cities are densely built-up areas. Airport runways, dark roof industrial buildings, and other densely built-up areas are all prominent hotspots across all climate zones of India. On the other hand, urban parks and urban trees are the heatsinks. Further, in India, the vacant barren land parcels within urban regions could add to UHI formation. Densely built-up areas are on average 0.50C cooler compared to built-up areas with neighboring non-green vacant lands, and 1.30C warmer compared to built-up areas with neighboring vegetative land use.[10]\nWhile urban land use and planning play a crucial role in the formation of UHI, the urban geometry and the urban building material properties are also important. Narrow urban canopies blocking the escape of the anthropogenic heat back into the cooler skies, increased population, and vehicular traffic on streets, also contribute to UHI formation.\nUrban Heat and Equity\nIndia is home to the largest urban homeless population globally. While specific estimates vary across studies, the consensus remains clear: India faces a significant challenge with homelessness, urban street dwellers, and slum populations. This reality underscores the acute vulnerability of these communities to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. A recent survey conducted in Delhi, India, revealed that the urban poor typically spend approximately 9.6 hours working outdoors, with 47% of respondents reporting suffering from heat-related losses and damages. Shockingly, none of those surveyed claimed to have adequate shelter capable of shielding them from extreme heat and weather conditions.\nIndependent research supports these findings, showing that most deaths occur during the summer months rather than in winter or the monsoon season. These statistics highlight the urgent need to address heat-related disparities and promote equity. In response, there is a pressing demand for inclusive strategies and policies designed for vulnerable populations to mitigate the adverse health effects of heat in urban communities.\nOne notable initiative is the establishment of cooling centers. Ahmedabad stands as a pioneering example, being the first city in India to implement a Heat Action Plan (HAP). Subsequently, several other cities have adopted similar plans. Under the Ahmedabad HAP, various public buildings such as temples, government structures, and shopping malls have been designated as cooling centers, offering temporary shelter to underprivileged urban residents during hot nights.\nSimilarly, HAPs implemented across different states emphasize the importance of cooling centers, heat health advisories, and enhancing public awareness. The UHI phenomenon exacerbates already elevated temperatures in Indian cities, significantly impacting urban populations, particularly those spending substantial time outdoors, thereby affecting overall health and well-being.\nIn conclusion, addressing the challenges posed by urban heat and its disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations is essential for ensuring the health and well-being of urban communities across India. Establishing cooling centers and implementing Heat Action Plans are crucial steps toward mitigating these risks. However, sustained efforts are necessary to expand and strengthen these initiatives.\nUHI Mitigation Measures and Relevant Policies\nThe mitigation of Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects primarily revolves around two key categories: vegetation and urban built-up surface treatments.\nThe evapotranspiration process occurring during urban trees and vegetation is crucial in cooling the temperatures. In this process, the plants absorb water through the roots that eventually get evaporated through the leaves, adding moisture into the atmosphere and reducing the temperatures. In a city like Bangalore, the air temperatures in streets with trees can be up to 5.60C lower compared to the streets not shaded by trees[17]. Further, green roofs and green walls are proven to improve the comfort and well-being of the urban population by reducing temperatures. Vegetation not only reduces temperatures but is also shown to improve air quality. Urban agriculture is another solution to urban cooling and a solution that could implemented without depending on regional policies. With the increase in high rises, individual home gardens are shrinking. Scientists and policymakers should work towards bringing in the technologies and incentives that encourage citizens to grow plants at both individual capacity and community scale. Examples of such initiatives are the Community in Bloom initiative and the Skyrise Greenery incentive scheme of Singapore. The \u2018Community in Bloom\u2019 is a national gardening movement that promotes community gardening and active citizen participation in greening efforts. It encourages residents to cultivate gardens, plant trees, and beautify public spaces, fostering a sense of ownership and stewardship towards the environment. The \u2018Skyrise Greenery Incentive Scheme\u2019 encourages building owners to incorporate green roofs and vertical greenery systems into their properties. It provides funding support and incentives to promote the adoption of greenery on building surfaces, contributing to urban biodiversity and thermal comfort.\nIn terms of urban vegetation, Singapore stands out as a best-case scenario. Further, since India and Singapore are both tropical countries, learning from each other\u2019s knowledge and experiences could be beneficial. Added to the need for urban vegetation incentives, schemes, policies, and awareness activities, creating an inventory and maps of existing trees within urban regions could serve as a baseline for identifying the areas with the lowest vegetation and exploring how vegetation could be improved. Identifying local tree species with wide canopies to provide shade, and require minimal irrigation would be key for countries like India. Urban greening policies in India should also consider the existing water scarcity and air pollution impacts on maintaining urban greenery. To overcome such challenges, UHI mitigation measures need to be diverse and cannot be just focused on urban greening activities.\nAccording to the Cool Roof Rating Council, a cool roof reflects and emits the sun's heat back into the sky rather than transferring it into the building. The coolness of the roof is determined by two properties: solar reflectance and thermal emittance. Both properties are measured on a scale from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating cooler roofs. For conventional grey roofs, the solar reflectance value is typically around 0.3, whereas for a cool roof, it's about 0.7. Previous research indicates that conventional grey roofs can be 31-47\u00b0C hotter than the surrounding air temperature, while cool roofs tend to remain between 6-11\u00b0C warmer than the air temperature. In unconditioned spaces, cool roofs have been shown to enhance comfort, while in conditioned spaces, they reduce cooling energy consumption by 5%, thereby decreasing heat absorption into the immediate micro-climate and lessening the need for energy production, which in turn affects the macro-climate.\nThe advantages of cool roofs extend beyond merely reducing cooling energy consumption or enhancing thermal comfort. They have global implications for decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollution, thus helping to mitigate Urban Heat Island (UHI) formation in various ways. While cool roof technology is well-established with numerous options available in the market, costs remain higher compared to conventional roofs. However, the payback period for cool roofs is typically within five years at most. Although the use of cool roofs is more common in green buildings, a pioneering statewide policy on cool roofs was only introduced in 2023 in Telangana, a state where 47% of the population resides in urban areas. While such policies should be more widespread, it is crucial to ensure their adaptation and effective implementation. Working toward the appropriate implementation of such policies is essential for mitigating the UHI phenomenon.\nAdding to the cool roof programs will be the cool pavement initiatives that promote the use of high solar reflectance material and/or green pavements across the sidewalk and impervious areas of the city. An example of such board policies including multiple surfaces from the city is the \u2018Cooling Singapore\u2019 initiative. Improving the permeability of surfaces and reducing the non-impervious surfaces in urban areas could make a difference in reducing overall temperatures in urban regions, and hence mitigating the UHI effect. Cool coatings on conventional asphalt, permeable asphalt, permeable concrete, grass pavers, brick pavers, etc. are all examples of cool pavements. Just like all the other mitigation measures, the magnitude of the impact of such technologies and measures could be location-specific, they are overall shown to mitigate the UHI effect by reducing air temperatures and improving air quality. Cool pavements are also great for reducing storm water run-off and therefore in addressing issues such as water quality and availability. Chicago\u2019s Green Alley program is one such initiative that promotes cool pavements.\nA green roof is a vegetative layer on the rooftop, that could either be intensive or extensive in style. Intensive green roofs have deep soil layers that could go beyond 15\u201d deep while extensive ones are around 6\u201d deep. Based on the building type, location, and use of the roof, either intensive, extensive, or semi-extensive roofs are to be chosen. Irrespective of the type all green roofs are shown to reduce surrounding air temperatures, improve comfort, and reduce the cooling energy consumption within the building on which the green roof has been installed. Added to these benefits is the reduction in stormwater runoff and an improvement in the overall quality of life of the occupants of the building. Currently, in India, there aren\u2019t any specific policies focusing towards green roofs. The \u2018Greening Enhancement\u2019 initiative of Singapore encourages the planting of trees, the creation of parks and gardens, and the implementation of green roofs and walls on buildings and stands as an example of the policy measures that could increase the adoption of green roofs across cities and communities. While cool roofs and green roofs at the building level or community level are both encouraged and credited through rating systems such as the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC), till date, there aren\u2019t any state-wide or national-level green roof policies in place for India.\nOther UHI mitigation measures\nIn addition to these conventional UHI mitigation measures, there are a few other built-environment measures that could help in mitigating UHI. These include:\nBy incorporating these additional measures alongside traditional vegetation and surface treatments, cities can adopt a multifaceted approach to UHI mitigation, promoting resilience and sustainability in urban environments.\nCurrent Challenges and Future Opportunities\nNeed for a holistic and integrated approach in designing buildings and urban spaces \nWhile the aforementioned UHI mitigation measures have been demonstrated to directly reduce temperatures and thus mitigate UHI formation, the overall enhancement of urban areas and building design and planning also plays a crucial role in UHI mitigation. On the latter front, one significant impact of UHI on buildings is the increase in cooling energy consumption \u2013 a topic that has been extensively studied by building scientists. However, this represents just one facet of the equation. It is equally essential to understand how buildings and the built environment as a whole contribute to UHI. Research in this domain is still nascent, primarily due to the limitations in analysis tools and methodologies. Traditionally, while building and urban designers focused on enhancing the indoor performance and functionality of spaces, urban climatologists and meteorologists delved into atmospheric phenomenon like UHI, with minimal interaction between these two groups.\nMoreover, UHI studies have typically been conducted on larger spatial scales such as local, meso, and macro scales, rather than the micro-scale where the impact on and by the buildings could be most significant. Nevertheless, this paradigm is evolving. Now, two centuries after Howard\u2019s pioneering research on UHI London, with more than half of the world\u2019s population residing in urban areas, and the then warmest years on record occurring with the past decade (2014-2023), understanding UHI dynamics and mitigating its effects has become imperative even for building scientist.\nGaining insights into the factors within the built environment and their magnitude of impact on UHI, particularly at varying spatial scales, could mark a significant stride toward leveraging buildings as tools for UHI mitigation. Similar to the evaluation of buildings' indoor and energy performance, assessing their outdoor thermal performance is essential to create 'micro-climate neutral' or 'zero UHI impact' buildings and communities. Integrating urban micro-climatic models with whole-building simulations should become the new standard.\nOne approach to achieving this is adopting a systems integration approach to whole-building performance. For instance, while vegetation aids in temperature reduction, urban greenery remains sparse in India. Given the potential water stress associated with maintaining urban greenery in India, enhancing and preserving greenery at the individual building or urban community level through systems integration might be more feasible. Implementing measures like reusing greywater and collecting rainwater for irrigation are examples of utilizing site water resources efficiently.\nTherefore, systems thinking approach is needed to establish a built environment as a potential UHI mitigation measure, and this needs a wealth of knowledge from several disciplines.\nAwareness and Outreach Activities\nEnhancing research to identify localized mitigation measures is crucial, but alongside, raising awareness is paramount for improving urban environments. It is vital to establish public awareness and community outreach programs and involve citizen scientists in mitigating UHI. Such involvement of communities can significantly influence the success of policy development and implementation. Some of the suggested awareness and outreach activities in the field of UHI could be:\nAddressing Urban Heat for Urban Poor \u2013 An India-specific problem and possible solutions\nAs urban India embraces air-conditioned buildings, the adverse impact of such structures on outdoor temperatures exacerbates, disproportionately affecting vulnerable urban dwellers. Construction workers, the urban poor, pedestrians, and users of non-air-conditioned public transportation systems collectively constitute a significant portion of the urban population in India, and they bear the brunt of rising temperatures. To tackle these challenges, UHI mitigation strategies must be multifaceted:\nBy implementing these multifaceted strategies, such as increasing vegetation, reducing impervious surfaces, and promoting sustainable building and urban design practices, India can effectively mitigate the impacts of Urban Heat Islands. An integrated approach not only helps in cooling urban areas but could contribute to a resilient and inclusive urban environment focused towards the well-being of all its residents, particularly the vulnerable populations. Systems integration and a bottom-up approach could therefore be key for cities in India to mitigate UHI and foster a healthier environment amidst the urban growth and climate challenges.\nGreen Building Market in India\nThe Green Buildings Market in India is registering positive growth with every passing quarter. We have conducted an in-depth\u00a0market progress study\u00a0on the growth potential of green buildings in India. Compared to the past quarter (October 2023 to December 2023), the quarter (January 2024 to March 2024) has registered a growth in green building registrations with each agency clearly indicating a bolstering economic recovery and a positive development of green footprint across the country. \nFor integrative analysis, the data for green building ratings project received from GBCI LEED and GRIHA, has been separately represented in the following sections.\nGBCI LEED\nThe green building projects have demonstrated exceptional commitment to sustainability over the past quarter, as evidenced by their GBCI LEED certification ratings. The distribution of these certifications includes 63% Gold, 36% Platinum, and 1% Silver (Source: Public LEED Directory). This highlights the dedication to achieving high standards in energy efficiency and environmental performance, with the majority of projects earning Gold and a significant portion reaching Platinum status. \nGRIHA\nGRIHA certification ratings have demonstrated its projects with the distribution of ratings as: 5 stars (7%), 4 stars (60%), 3 stars (27%), and 2 stars  (6%) in Quarter 4: 2023-2024 (Source: GRIHA). As is evident with GRIHA-rated government projects, the State and Central projects are establishing great benchmarks of sustainability for a positive impact on the green buildings industry. \nIn-house Experts Comment\nAfter the analysis of the challenges posed by Urban Heat Islands (UHI) and their implications for urban environments, UHIs are not merely an environmental issue but a critical public health and economic concern too. The proactive measures, such as the adoption of cool roofing materials, the creation of green spaces, and the implementation of urban planning policies that prioritize sustainability, are essential in mitigating UHI effects. The insights provided in this newsletter aim to equip policymakers, urban planners, and the general public with actionable knowledge to combat the adverse effects of UHIs effectively.\n[1] National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n[2] National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n[3] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n[4] Coastal zone management, UNEP - UN Environment Programme\n[5] United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs\n[6] Cities and Climate Change, UNEP - UN Environment Programme\n[7] C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group\n[8] A comparative analysis of surface and canopy layer urban heat island at the micro level using a data-driven approach, \n[9] Urban Heat Island studies: current status in India and a comparison with the international studies\n[10] Surface Urban Heat Island: A Comparative Study Between India and the United States\n[11] National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n[12] Enhanced surface temperature over India during 1980\u20132020 and future projections: causal links of the drivers and trends\n[13] Geospatial and statistical analysis of urban heat islands and thermally vulnerable zones in Bangalore and Hyderabad cities in India\n[14] Land Use Statistics \u2013 At a Glance | Official website of Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India\n[15] Assessment Framework | Climate Centre for Cities\n[16] A multicity analysis of daytime Surface Urban Heat Islands in India and the US.\n[17] Lionel Sujay Vailshery, Madhumitha Jaganmohan, Harini Nagendra.

      "A Narrative on Urban Heat Island (UHI) in India\na need for a system thinking approach to integrate technologies and policies for climate and humankind\nIntroduction\nThe global temperatures are on the rise. Current data[1] show that global temperatures have been increasing by 0.360 C per decade since industrialization, and the warmest year on record is just a year ago[2]- 2023, with average temperatures 1.350 C above the pre-industrial average. It\u2019s now a known fact that climate change is happening and its effects are being felt across the globe. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and melting ice caps all point towards climate change. Humanity is responsible for exacerbating climate change and is the most impacted due to climate change. Scientists predict rising sea levels could displace 250-400 million[3] people in the next 80 years. Currently, the world\u2019s urban areas are coastal, hosting around 37% of the world\u2019s population at a population density twice the global average[4]. The predicted increase in urban population[5] to 68% by 2050 from the current 55% could only mean worse. Urbanization is shown to be one of the leading causes that alter urban climate and add to global GHG emissions. Studies[6] show that 70% of global CO2 emissions occur due to human anthropogenic activities within urban regions. Therefore, urban areas of the world are both at the creating and receiving end of this global climate change phenomenon, and one of the most dominant impacts of urbanization on climate is the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon.\nUrban Heat Islands (UHI)\nFactors contributing to UHI formation\nSeveral natural and human-modified changes impact the urban climate across temporal and spatial scales. From small-scale turbulences at the micro-scale to macro-scale jet streams and hurricanes, the climatic system is altered by the natural and human-modified characteristics of the earth's surface. While natural impacts of the earth's surface on climate may or may not be interfered with, it is crucial to understand and limit the negative impact of the human-modified environment on climate. Urban areas are the best examples of human-modified environments. Human-made modifications of urban areas, such as their function, texture, and form. All of which could influence the urban climate and lead to the formation of Urban Heat Islands.\nThe Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, characterized by higher temperatures in urban areas compared to their rural surroundings, is one of the most frequently observed urban climate modifications. The earliest UHI studies date back to the 1800s when Luke Howard noted that air temperatures in urban regions of London were higher than those in rural areas. Since then, UHI research has quantified the extent of the effect by measuring the temperature difference between urban and rural areas.\nUHI types\nBased on the location of the temperature measurement addressing different spatial scales, there are three different types of UHI: Surface UHI (SUHI), Canopy UHI (CUHI), and Boundary Layer UHI.\nWhile SUHI and CUHI are most relevant when referring to UHI's impact on human well-being and building energy consumption, boundary layer UHI reflects macro-scale weather changes happening across urban areas[8][9].\nSome characteristics of urban areas that could lead to UHI formation are:\nAll these heat exchanges occurring within the urban environment differ in magnitude compared to rural areas, where there is less development and more greenery, leading to lower temperatures than those found in urban areas.\nFigure 4: Differences in energy exchanges between urban and rural areas attributed to the UHI formation\nImpacts of UHI\nIrrespective of the type of UHI, this phenomenon is shown to impact urban climate, human well-being, energy consumption, and water availability. UHI increases cooling energy consumption by approximately 19% and it intensifies the heat stress, especially during the nighttime. The average nighttime SUHI intensity across 42 highly populated cities in India was 1.20C[10] which could impact human comfort and well-being. Studies show that even a small (less than 10C) rise in temperatures could power extreme weather events[11]. In addition, exposed surfaces in urban areas can be 30\u02daC to 40\u02daC hotter than the ambient air temperature during peak summers. As a result, the UHI phenomenon has numerous adverse effects. At a micro-scale, it increases building energy consumption and reduces occupant comfort. At the city level, it leads to elevated air temperatures, air pollution, and smog. Research also suggests that UHI can alter weather patterns and water quality, thereby impacting the environment, human health, and economic prosperity. Among its impacts on people, peak summer events can be fatal for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, urban workers, and the impoverished. Therefore, understanding UHI in the urban context of India is crucial. It not only helps in improving overall urban well-being and reducing energy consumption but could also improve the liveability and comfort of the homeless and economically disadvantaged populations in the country.\nUHI in India\nUrban Heat and UHI\nLike global averages, temperatures in India are rising. As shown in Figure 5, the increase in temperatures over the last 20 years is evident, using Hyderabad as an example. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) dry bulb temperature data indicate that from 2000 to 2019, temperatures in Hyderabad have risen by at least 1.0\u00b0C during the post-monsoon season and up to 1.8\u00b0C in the summer. This upward trend continues, as evidenced by the numerous heat waves in 2024, with temperatures reaching between 44\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C across the country. According to a recent study[12], India could experience a temperature rise of 1.1-5.1\u00b0C by 2100.\nAdditionally, land surface temperatures across 42 cities in India indicate that, although urban areas appear cooler than rural areas during daytime in the summer, this is not true for the rest of the seasons, particularly at night. During night time, the average UHI magnitude can reach up to 1.3\u00b0C, as seen in Figure 6. In another recent study[13], the authors showed that the average UHI magnitude in Bangalore and Hyderabad is 1.90C and 2.440C over the past two decades. All the existing research and data across cities in India show that UHI magnitude is increasing and is higher in the night time compared to the daytime. The already high temperatures and the high anthropogenic heat in the form of vehicles, humans, and building cooling, all add to a dense urban built environment that cannot cool off overnight, leading to an increased night time UHI magnitude.\nGrowing cities, hotspots, and heatsinks across Indian cities\nAs of 2023, while only 3.06% of land use in India is built-up areas, more than 40% of the Indian population lives in cities, and this is increasing[14]. By 2050, it is projected that around 60% of Indians are to live in urban areas. Today, urban areas of India contribute up to 44% of its GHG emissions[15]. The average increase in impervious surface area across 42 megacities in India is 68%, over 15 years from 2003 \u2013 2018. Shown in Figure 7 is an example of Hyderabad, India which had a 58% increase in artificial (humanmade) impervious surfaces over 15 years.[10]\nWith cities expanding, the anthropogenic heat emissions of cities are also increasing. Expanding cities are also responsible for decreasing urban vegetation that could lead to UHI formation. In India, the quality and quantity of urban vegetation seem to impact the UHI formation.[16] A decrease in vegetation reduces the latent heat transfer impacting the micro-climate and reducing human comfort. The land surface temperature maps of different cities in India show that some of the hotspots within cities are densely built-up areas. Airport runways, dark roof industrial buildings, and other densely built-up areas are all prominent hotspots across all climate zones of India. On the other hand, urban parks and urban trees are the heatsinks. Further, in India, the vacant barren land parcels within urban regions could add to UHI formation. Densely built-up areas are on average 0.50C cooler compared to built-up areas with neighboring non-green vacant lands, and 1.30C warmer compared to built-up areas with neighboring vegetative land use.[10]\nWhile urban land use and planning play a crucial role in the formation of UHI, the urban geometry and the urban building material properties are also important. Narrow urban canopies blocking the escape of the anthropogenic heat back into the cooler skies, increased population, and vehicular traffic on streets, also contribute to UHI formation.\nUrban Heat and Equity\nIndia is home to the largest urban homeless population globally. While specific estimates vary across studies, the consensus remains clear: India faces a significant challenge with homelessness, urban street dwellers, and slum populations. This reality underscores the acute vulnerability of these communities to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. A recent survey conducted in Delhi, India, revealed that the urban poor typically spend approximately 9.6 hours working outdoors, with 47% of respondents reporting suffering from heat-related losses and damages. Shockingly, none of those surveyed claimed to have adequate shelter capable of shielding them from extreme heat and weather conditions.\nIndependent research supports these findings, showing that most deaths occur during the summer months rather than in winter or the monsoon season. These statistics highlight the urgent need to address heat-related disparities and promote equity. In response, there is a pressing demand for inclusive strategies and policies designed for vulnerable populations to mitigate the adverse health effects of heat in urban communities.\nOne notable initiative is the establishment of cooling centers. Ahmedabad stands as a pioneering example, being the first city in India to implement a Heat Action Plan (HAP). Subsequently, several other cities have adopted similar plans. Under the Ahmedabad HAP, various public buildings such as temples, government structures, and shopping malls have been designated as cooling centers, offering temporary shelter to underprivileged urban residents during hot nights.\nSimilarly, HAPs implemented across different states emphasize the importance of cooling centers, heat health advisories, and enhancing public awareness. The UHI phenomenon exacerbates already elevated temperatures in Indian cities, significantly impacting urban populations, particularly those spending substantial time outdoors, thereby affecting overall health and well-being.\nIn conclusion, addressing the challenges posed by urban heat and its disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations is essential for ensuring the health and well-being of urban communities across India. Establishing cooling centers and implementing Heat Action Plans are crucial steps toward mitigating these risks. However, sustained efforts are necessary to expand and strengthen these initiatives.\nUHI Mitigation Measures and Relevant Policies\nThe mitigation of Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects primarily revolves around two key categories: vegetation and urban built-up surface treatments.\nThe evapotranspiration process occurring during urban trees and vegetation is crucial in cooling the temperatures. In this process, the plants absorb water through the roots that eventually get evaporated through the leaves, adding moisture into the atmosphere and reducing the temperatures. In a city like Bangalore, the air temperatures in streets with trees can be up to 5.60C lower compared to the streets not shaded by trees[17]. Further, green roofs and green walls are proven to improve the comfort and well-being of the urban population by reducing temperatures. Vegetation not only reduces temperatures but is also shown to improve air quality. Urban agriculture is another solution to urban cooling and a solution that could implemented without depending on regional policies. With the increase in high rises, individual home gardens are shrinking. Scientists and policymakers should work towards bringing in the technologies and incentives that encourage citizens to grow plants at both individual capacity and community scale. Examples of such initiatives are the Community in Bloom initiative and the Skyrise Greenery incentive scheme of Singapore. The \u2018Community in Bloom\u2019 is a national gardening movement that promotes community gardening and active citizen participation in greening efforts. It encourages residents to cultivate gardens, plant trees, and beautify public spaces, fostering a sense of ownership and stewardship towards the environment. The \u2018Skyrise Greenery Incentive Scheme\u2019 encourages building owners to incorporate green roofs and vertical greenery systems into their properties. It provides funding support and incentives to promote the adoption of greenery on building surfaces, contributing to urban biodiversity and thermal comfort.\nIn terms of urban vegetation, Singapore stands out as a best-case scenario. Further, since India and Singapore are both tropical countries, learning from each other\u2019s knowledge and experiences could be beneficial. Added to the need for urban vegetation incentives, schemes, policies, and awareness activities, creating an inventory and maps of existing trees within urban regions could serve as a baseline for identifying the areas with the lowest vegetation and exploring how vegetation could be improved. Identifying local tree species with wide canopies to provide shade, and require minimal irrigation would be key for countries like India. Urban greening policies in India should also consider the existing water scarcity and air pollution impacts on maintaining urban greenery. To overcome such challenges, UHI mitigation measures need to be diverse and cannot be just focused on urban greening activities.\nAccording to the Cool Roof Rating Council, a cool roof reflects and emits the sun's heat back into the sky rather than transferring it into the building. The coolness of the roof is determined by two properties: solar reflectance and thermal emittance. Both properties are measured on a scale from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating cooler roofs. For conventional grey roofs, the solar reflectance value is typically around 0.3, whereas for a cool roof, it's about 0.7. Previous research indicates that conventional grey roofs can be 31-47\u00b0C hotter than the surrounding air temperature, while cool roofs tend to remain between 6-11\u00b0C warmer than the air temperature. In unconditioned spaces, cool roofs have been shown to enhance comfort, while in conditioned spaces, they reduce cooling energy consumption by 5%, thereby decreasing heat absorption into the immediate micro-climate and lessening the need for energy production, which in turn affects the macro-climate.\nThe advantages of cool roofs extend beyond merely reducing cooling energy consumption or enhancing thermal comfort. They have global implications for decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollution, thus helping to mitigate Urban Heat Island (UHI) formation in various ways. While cool roof technology is well-established with numerous options available in the market, costs remain higher compared to conventional roofs. However, the payback period for cool roofs is typically within five years at most. Although the use of cool roofs is more common in green buildings, a pioneering statewide policy on cool roofs was only introduced in 2023 in Telangana, a state where 47% of the population resides in urban areas. While such policies should be more widespread, it is crucial to ensure their adaptation and effective implementation. Working toward the appropriate implementation of such policies is essential for mitigating the UHI phenomenon.\nAdding to the cool roof programs will be the cool pavement initiatives that promote the use of high solar reflectance material and/or green pavements across the sidewalk and impervious areas of the city. An example of such board policies including multiple surfaces from the city is the \u2018Cooling Singapore\u2019 initiative. Improving the permeability of surfaces and reducing the non-impervious surfaces in urban areas could make a difference in reducing overall temperatures in urban regions, and hence mitigating the UHI effect. Cool coatings on conventional asphalt, permeable asphalt, permeable concrete, grass pavers, brick pavers, etc. are all examples of cool pavements. Just like all the other mitigation measures, the magnitude of the impact of such technologies and measures could be location-specific, they are overall shown to mitigate the UHI effect by reducing air temperatures and improving air quality. Cool pavements are also great for reducing storm water run-off and therefore in addressing issues such as water quality and availability. Chicago\u2019s Green Alley program is one such initiative that promotes cool pavements.\nA green roof is a vegetative layer on the rooftop, that could either be intensive or extensive in style. Intensive green roofs have deep soil layers that could go beyond 15\u201d deep while extensive ones are around 6\u201d deep. Based on the building type, location, and use of the roof, either intensive, extensive, or semi-extensive roofs are to be chosen. Irrespective of the type all green roofs are shown to reduce surrounding air temperatures, improve comfort, and reduce the cooling energy consumption within the building on which the green roof has been installed. Added to these benefits is the reduction in stormwater runoff and an improvement in the overall quality of life of the occupants of the building. Currently, in India, there aren\u2019t any specific policies focusing towards green roofs. The \u2018Greening Enhancement\u2019 initiative of Singapore encourages the planting of trees, the creation of parks and gardens, and the implementation of green roofs and walls on buildings and stands as an example of the policy measures that could increase the adoption of green roofs across cities and communities. While cool roofs and green roofs at the building level or community level are both encouraged and credited through rating systems such as the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC), till date, there aren\u2019t any state-wide or national-level green roof policies in place for India.\nOther UHI mitigation measures\nIn addition to these conventional UHI mitigation measures, there are a few other built-environment measures that could help in mitigating UHI. These include:\nBy incorporating these additional measures alongside traditional vegetation and surface treatments, cities can adopt a multifaceted approach to UHI mitigation, promoting resilience and sustainability in urban environments.\nCurrent Challenges and Future Opportunities\nNeed for a holistic and integrated approach in designing buildings and urban spaces \nWhile the aforementioned UHI mitigation measures have been demonstrated to directly reduce temperatures and thus mitigate UHI formation, the overall enhancement of urban areas and building design and planning also plays a crucial role in UHI mitigation. On the latter front, one significant impact of UHI on buildings is the increase in cooling energy consumption \u2013 a topic that has been extensively studied by building scientists. However, this represents just one facet of the equation. It is equally essential to understand how buildings and the built environment as a whole contribute to UHI. Research in this domain is still nascent, primarily due to the limitations in analysis tools and methodologies. Traditionally, while building and urban designers focused on enhancing the indoor performance and functionality of spaces, urban climatologists and meteorologists delved into atmospheric phenomenon like UHI, with minimal interaction between these two groups.\nMoreover, UHI studies have typically been conducted on larger spatial scales such as local, meso, and macro scales, rather than the micro-scale where the impact on and by the buildings could be most significant. Nevertheless, this paradigm is evolving. Now, two centuries after Howard\u2019s pioneering research on UHI London, with more than half of the world\u2019s population residing in urban areas, and the then warmest years on record occurring with the past decade (2014-2023), understanding UHI dynamics and mitigating its effects has become imperative even for building scientist.\nGaining insights into the factors within the built environment and their magnitude of impact on UHI, particularly at varying spatial scales, could mark a significant stride toward leveraging buildings as tools for UHI mitigation. Similar to the evaluation of buildings' indoor and energy performance, assessing their outdoor thermal performance is essential to create 'micro-climate neutral' or 'zero UHI impact' buildings and communities. Integrating urban micro-climatic models with whole-building simulations should become the new standard.\nOne approach to achieving this is adopting a systems integration approach to whole-building performance. For instance, while vegetation aids in temperature reduction, urban greenery remains sparse in India. Given the potential water stress associated with maintaining urban greenery in India, enhancing and preserving greenery at the individual building or urban community level through systems integration might be more feasible. Implementing measures like reusing greywater and collecting rainwater for irrigation are examples of utilizing site water resources efficiently.\nTherefore, systems thinking approach is needed to establish a built environment as a potential UHI mitigation measure, and this needs a wealth of knowledge from several disciplines.\nAwareness and Outreach Activities\nEnhancing research to identify localized mitigation measures is crucial, but alongside, raising awareness is paramount for improving urban environments. It is vital to establish public awareness and community outreach programs and involve citizen scientists in mitigating UHI. Such involvement of communities can significantly influence the success of policy development and implementation. Some of the suggested awareness and outreach activities in the field of UHI could be:\nAddressing Urban Heat for Urban Poor \u2013 An India-specific problem and possible solutions\nAs urban India embraces air-conditioned buildings, the adverse impact of such structures on outdoor temperatures exacerbates, disproportionately affecting vulnerable urban dwellers. Construction workers, the urban poor, pedestrians, and users of non-air-conditioned public transportation systems collectively constitute a significant portion of the urban population in India, and they bear the brunt of rising temperatures. To tackle these challenges, UHI mitigation strategies must be multifaceted:\nBy implementing these multifaceted strategies, such as increasing vegetation, reducing impervious surfaces, and promoting sustainable building and urban design practices, India can effectively mitigate the impacts of Urban Heat Islands. An integrated approach not only helps in cooling urban areas but could contribute to a resilient and inclusive urban environment focused towards the well-being of all its residents, particularly the vulnerable populations. Systems integration and a bottom-up approach could therefore be key for cities in India to mitigate UHI and foster a healthier environment amidst the urban growth and climate challenges.\nGreen Building Market in India\nThe Green Buildings Market in India is registering positive growth with every passing quarter. We have conducted an in-depth\u00a0market progress study\u00a0on the growth potential of green buildings in India. Compared to the past quarter (October 2023 to December 2023), the quarter (January 2024 to March 2024) has registered a growth in green building registrations with each agency clearly indicating a bolstering economic recovery and a positive development of green footprint across the country. \nFor integrative analysis, the data for green building ratings project received from GBCI LEED and GRIHA, has been separately represented in the following sections.\nGBCI LEED\nThe green building projects have demonstrated exceptional commitment to sustainability over the past quarter, as evidenced by their GBCI LEED certification ratings. The distribution of these certifications includes 63% Gold, 36% Platinum, and 1% Silver (Source: Public LEED Directory). This highlights the dedication to achieving high standards in energy efficiency and environmental performance, with the majority of projects earning Gold and a significant portion reaching Platinum status. \nGRIHA\nGRIHA certification ratings have demonstrated its projects with the distribution of ratings as: 5 stars (7%), 4 stars (60%), 3 stars (27%), and 2 stars  (6%) in Quarter 4: 2023-2024 (Source: GRIHA). As is evident with GRIHA-rated government projects, the State and Central projects are establishing great benchmarks of sustainability for a positive impact on the green buildings industry. \nIn-house Experts Comment\nAfter the analysis of the challenges posed by Urban Heat Islands (UHI) and their implications for urban environments, UHIs are not merely an environmental issue but a critical public health and economic concern too. The proactive measures, such as the adoption of cool roofing materials, the creation of green spaces, and the implementation of urban planning policies that prioritize sustainability, are essential in mitigating UHI effects. The insights provided in this newsletter aim to equip policymakers, urban planners, and the general public with actionable knowledge to combat the adverse effects of UHIs effectively.\n[1] National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n[2] National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n[3] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n[4] Coastal zone management, UNEP - UN Environment Programme\n[5] United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs\n[6] Cities and Climate Change, UNEP - UN Environment Programme\n[7] C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group\n[8] A comparative analysis of surface and canopy layer urban heat island at the micro level using a data-driven approach, \n[9] Urban Heat Island studies: current status in India and a comparison with the international studies\n[10] Surface Urban Heat Island: A Comparative Study Between India and the United States\n[11] National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n[12] Enhanced surface temperature over India during 1980\u20132020 and future projections: causal links of the drivers and trends\n[13] Geospatial and statistical analysis of urban heat islands and thermally vulnerable zones in Bangalore and Hyderabad cities in India\n[14] Land Use Statistics \u2013 At a Glance | Official website of Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India\n[15] Assessment Framework | Climate Centre for Cities\n[16] A multicity analysis of daytime Surface Urban Heat Islands in India and the US.\n[17] Lionel Sujay Vailshery, Madhumitha Jaganmohan, Harini Nagendra.

      "EIA: India leads global oil consumption growth in 2024, 2025\nIndia has emerged as the top contributor to expected global oil consumption growth, accounting for 25% of the increase for 2024 and 2025, according to the US Energy Information Agency (EIA)\u2019s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO).\nEIA expects global liquid fuel consumption to rise by 1.0 million b/d in 2024 and 1.2 million b/d in 2025. This growth is below the pre-pandemic 10-year average of 1.5 million b/d of annual growth, as well as below the oil demand growth seen in the 2021-23 pandemic recovery.\n\u201cWe expect consumption of liquid fuels in India to increase by 300,000 b/d in both 2024 and 2025, driven by rising demand for transportation fuels. We forecast China\u2019s petroleum and liquid fuels consumption will grow by less than 100,000 b/d in 2024 before recovering to almost 300,000 b/d 2025,\u201d EIA said.\n\u201cWe have revised China\u2019s 2024 consumption downward several times over the past year. In China, rapidly expanding electric vehicle ownership, rising use of liquefied natural gas for trucking goods, and decelerating economic growth have limited consumption growth for transportation fuels.\u201d\nMeantime, EIA forecasts more distillate fuel consumption in the US next year after 2 years of declines, largely because US manufacturing activity is expected to increase.\nOil prices\nThe Brent crude oil spot price averaged $76/bbl in October, up $2/bbl from the average in September. Crude oil prices increased in October in part because of market concerns that an Israeli response to Iran\u2019s missile attack would reduce Iran\u2019s ability to produce or market oil. However, Brent fell to $71/bbl on Oct. 29 after Israel\u2019s military response did not target Iran\u2019s oil infrastructure.\nDespite the drop in oil prices in late October, EIA expects that geopolitical risks and OPEC+ cuts are likely to raise oil prices, with Brent crude averaging $78/bbl in first-quarter 2025. As production grows, inventories will build in second-quarter 2025, reducing prices to $74/bbl in second-half 2025.\n\u201cBy second-quarter 2025, we expect OPEC+ production increases and supply growth from countries outside of OPEC+ will outweigh global oil demand growth and cause oil to be put into inventory. We expect that global oil inventories will increase by an average of 400,000 b/d in second-quarter 2025, before inventories rise by an average of 600,000 b/d in second-half 2025. We forecast that inventory builds will put downward pressure on crude oil prices, with Brent falling to an average of $74/bbl in second-half 2025. In our forecast, the Brent price averages $76/bbl for the full year of 2025,\u201d EIA said.\nHowever, EIA sees at least two main sources of oil price uncertainty: the future course of the ongoing Middle East conflict and OPEC+ members\u2019 willingness to adhere to voluntary production cuts.\nUS natural gas\nEIA expects the Henry Hub natural gas spot price to rise in the coming months to average $2.80/MMbtu in first-quarter 2025, following seasonal patterns during which prices typically rise during the winter.\n\u201cThe monthly average Henry Hub daily spot price fell to $2.20/MMbtu in October and below $2.00/MMbtu in early November. Low prices reflected warm temperatures, which could delay the beginning of withdrawals of natural gas from storage until mid-November. We expect the Henry Hub price to average around $2.90/MMbtu in 2025, as global demand for US LNG exports, a component of US natural gas demand, continues to increase,\u201d EIA said.\nMarketed US natural gas production in EIA\u2019s forecast averages 113 bcfd in 2024. Production in 2024 is relatively unchanged from 2023, a contrast to the production growth in the previous 3 years, as low natural gas prices curtailed production in some regions. EIA expects US marketed natural gas production to increase by 1% next year, averaging 114 bcfd, led by a 6% increase in the Permian region.\nContinue Reading\nEIA revises down slightly global oil demand growth forecasts for 2021\nEIA continues downward revision of global oil consumption forecast\nLatest in Economics & Markets\n\nElection euphoria ends for oil prices\n\nOil prices higher on host of factors\nMost Read\nUS finalizes methane fee on emitters in waning months of Biden administration\nThe State of Hydrogen \u2013 Moving Beyond the Hype\nEmpire Energy receives environmental approval for Carpentaria pilot\n"

Total final consumption (TFC) is the energy consumed by end users such as individuals and businesses to heat and cool buildings, to run lights, devices, and appliances, and to power vehicles, machines and factories.\nOne way of looking at the overall energy efficiency of a country is to measure the total energy supply per unit of economic output (here adjusted for purchasing power parity). This reflects not only energy efficiency but also the structure of the economy, with services-oriented economies generally having a lower energy intensity than those based on heavy industry.\nIn most countries, heating and cooling make up the largest share of energy use in homes. While air conditioners, appliances and lights generally run on electricity, combustible fuels such as natural gas, oil, coal and biomass are still widely used for heating and cooking. Electrifying these end uses, for example by replacing fossil fuel boilers with efficient electric heat pumps, will be important for reducing CO2 emissions.\nResidential energy intensity is largly driven by space heating, and to a lesser extent appliances. To allow cross-country comparisons, it is measured by floor area and temperature-corrected.\nIn most countries, transport energy use is dominated by oil used to fuel passenger cars, trucks and airplanes. Electrification of the transport sector, for example through the widespread rollout of EVs, is an important strategy for reducing CO2 emissions.\nPassenger transport intensity is measured by the average amount of energy used to move one passenger over a distance of one kilometre. Intensity levels vary across countries depending on how people get around in that country \u2013 such as the modes of tranport used (e.g. driving, flying, rail), the types of vehicles used, and the average number of passengers per vehicle.\nIndustrial energy sources can vary considerably between countries depending on the structure of their economies. Many industrial processes, including steelmaking, cement and chemicals, still require fossil fuels for high-temperature heat or as feedstocks.\nA country's manufacturing energy intensity largely depends on the makeup of a country's manufacturing sector: certain industries, such as basic metals and pulp and paper, are particularly energy intensive relative to their economic contribution.\nThe services sector tends to be much less energy intensive than industry, with the largest share of energy in most countries being used to heat and cool buildings. The shift from an economic structure based on heavy industry to one based on services has historically been a driver of falling energy intensity of advanced economies.\n\n        Related content\n

      "EU China Energy Monitor September 2024 Issue EU China Energy Monitor \u2013 September 2024 Page 1 of 5 China Energy Updates General overview In August in China, \uf09f Raw coal production reached 400 million tonnes, up 2.8% year-on-year (YoY) and 2.6% month-on-month (MoM). Coal imports totalled 45.84 million tonnes, rising by 3.4% YoY but down 0.8% MoM. \uf09f Crude oil production reached 17.83 million tonnes, up 2.1% YoY but down 0.4% MoM. Crude oil imports stood at 49.10 million tonnes, down by 7% YoY but up 16% MoM. \uf09f Natural gas production hit 20 billion cubic metres, an increase of 9.4% YoY, unchanged MoM. Natural gas imports amounted to 11.76 million tonnes, up by 9.1 % YoY and 8.3% MoM. Headline developments \uf09f China calls for another round of public opinions on its first ever Energy Law. \uf09f China new coal output capacity could increase by 1.28 billion tonnes/yr. \uf09f China's renewable energy capacity is set to grow by more than 100 million KW/yr before 2030. Regulatory and policy updates China has called for a second round of public consultations on its first ever Energy Law, between 13 September and 12 October. When compared to initial version in April 2024 (see Energy Monitor, April 2024), the version published in September includes the following revisions: \uf09f Additional provisions for the development and use of new energy sources: \u2022 wind and solar: adhere to both centralised and distributed development; accelerate the construction of wind and photovoltaic power generation bases; support distributed wind and photovoltaic power projects to supply nearby users; develop offshore wind power in a reasonable and orderly manner; actively develop solar thermal power generation. \u2022 biomass: development of biomass energy in power generation, clean heating and biogas within the limitations of local conditions. \u2022 ocean and geothermal energy: promote the large-scale development and use of ocean energy and develop geothermal energy within the limitations of local conditions. \u2022 hydrogen: promote the development and use of hydrogen energy and the associated hydrogen industry. \uf09f China will accelerate the construction of a new power system and strengthen the coordinated construction of power sources and grids etc. to improve the power grids\u2019 ability to accept, allocate and regulate clean energy. \uf09f Renewable energy green power certificates will be promoted to boost green energy consumption. Coal updates Approximately 1280 mtpa (million tonnes per annum) of coal capacity is under development across 14 provinces, equalling nearly half of global proposed capacity, according to a report published by Global Energy Monitor (GEM). Shanxi and Inner Mongolia together produce more than the rest of China combined. The authors report that 35% of China\u2019s proposed coal projects are already under construction, signalling a surge in production within three to five years. As of April 2024, GEM\u2019s Global Coal Mine Tracker has identified around 1 800 active coal mines in China with a minimum approved annual capacity of 0.6 million tonnes, collectively accounting for nearly 4 390 million tonnes of annual coal capacity. In 2023, China produced 4.66 billion tonnes, up 2.9% YoY. In September, China\u2019s first integrated PV and clean coal power project commenced operation. The Datang Xinyu Phase II high-efficiency coal power project (Unit 1) in Jiangxi Province has successfully completed a 168- EU China Energy Monitor September 2024 Issue EU China Energy Monitor \u2013 September 2024 Page 2 of 5 hour trial operation and is now officially in service. The project is grid-connected and consists of a 250 000 kW PV power station, complemented by two 1 GW coal-fired power units. This configuration not only addresses the issue of night-time power generation limitations for the PV plant but also allows steam to be recycled for a second round of power generation. This innovative approach significantly enhances the utilisation of steam energy, reduces coal consumption, and boosts overall power generation efficiency. Annual electricity output is projected to reach approximately 9.5 billion kWh. Oil and gas updates Power of Siberia 2 natural gas pipeline is absent from Mongolia\u2019s Four-Year National Action Programme (2024-28). A 950 km section of this proposed 3 550 km pipeline had been scheduled to transit Mongolia. The new pipeline is intended to deliver up to 50 bcm/yr of Russian gas to China, in addition to the existing 38 bcm/yr capacity in Power of Siberia 1. Electricity updates The National Energy Administration (NEA) has issued guidelines for green electricity trading, clarifying specific matters relating to division of responsibilities, account management, green certificate issuance, green certificate transactions and transfers, green certificate write-offs, information management and supervision, etc. According to the Guidelines, one green certificate, which can only be issued by the NEA\u2019s Electric Power Business Qualification Management Centre, will represent 1 000 KWh of renewable electricity. The price will be determined by the market, and its full life cycle will be traceable. In August, 314 million green certificates were traded across the country (of which 164 million ere green electricity certificates). In total, 1.841 billion green certificates have been issued nationwide during 2024, apportioned between energy sources as follows: \uf09f wind: 682 million, accounting for 37.05%. \uf09f solar: 413 million accounting for 22.45%. \uf09f conventional hydropower: 629 million, accounting for 34.13%. \uf09f biomass: 116 million, accounting for 6.3%. \uf09f other renewable energy: 1.28 million, accounting for 0.07%. On 10 September, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), NEA and other departments issued the \u2018Notice on promoting the pilot work on the large-scale application of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) interaction\u2019. This notice proposes the establishment of pilot projects across the country which will include no fewer than five cities with appropriate criteria, supportive policies, and significant vehicle usage, as well as at least 50 V2G pilot projects. The candidates of pilot projects should be submitted to NEA before 31 October 2024. Regions participating in the pilots are required to implement a peak-valley electricity tariff and aim to ensure that more than 60% of electricity used at car charging stations is concentrated during off-peak periods, while more than 80% of the electricity used at private EV charging stations should be during off-peak periods. In principle, the total discharging power of participating V2G projects should be no less than 500 KW, while the annual discharge capacity should be no less than 0.1 million KWh, though some flexibility is allowed in the country\u2019s western regions. Clean energy updates China's renewable energy capacity will continue to grow by over 100 million KW/yr before 2030, according to a recent article by the NEA\u2019s Party Group \u2018Supporting Chinese Modernisation with Energy Transition Development\u2019 carried in People's Daily. Before 2030, China aims for 70% of new energy consumption to be supplied by non-fossil energy, while the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption will rise by 1 percentage point each year. Shanghai-based Envision Energy is to invest USD 1 billion in an integrated green hydrogen net zero industrial plant in Spain. The project includes a hydrogen energy equipment factory, a green hydrogen industry chain and a zero-carbon hydrogen industrial park, to achieve 100% green electricity hydrogen production. Envision will also conduct comprehensive cooperation with Spain in the fields of synthetic biology, green methanol, and EU China Energy Monitor September 2024 Issue EU China Energy Monitor \u2013 September 2024 Page 3 of 5 sustainable bio-jet fuel to create a new ecology of the green hydrogen industry and support Spain's zero-carbon transition development in industry, aviation, navigation and other fields with cost-competitive products. EU Energy Updates Regulatory and policy updates EU Member States receive guidance on renewable energy and efficiency directives. On 2 September, EU adopted guidance for Member States on implementing the revised directives on renewable energy and on energy efficiency. The European Commission's guidance aims to provide clarity on complex elements of the new legislation and support national administrations in transposing these directives into national law. It covers four areas: heating and cooling, energy system integration, and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs). Industrial carbon management (ICM) can play an important role in achieving EU\u2019s carbon neutrality. Based on the impact assessment on the EU climate target for 2040, the EU will need to be ready to capture at least 50 million tonnes of CO2 per year by 2030, scaling up to 280 Mt by 2040 and 450 Mt by 2050. The ICM Strategy, adopted in February 2024, supports this goal by addressing all parts of the CO2 value chain. The EU also funds ICM projects through programmes such as the Innovation Fund, which has allocated EUR 3.3 billion since 2020. Airlines must monitor vapour trails under new EU climate rules. On 30 August, the European Commission agreed on new rules requiring airlines operating from European airports to report the climate impact of vapour trails from jet engines, as well as annual CO2 emissions. The legislation follows a recent reform of Europe\u2019s emissions trading system (EU ETS). Clean energy updates CINEA launches 4th call for cross-border renewable energy projects. On 2 September, the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA) has opened the 4th call for cross-border renewable energy projects (CB RES) to obtain the CB RES status, a mandatory requirement for CEF funding. The CB RES programme, extended in 2021, supports renewable energy projects involving cross-border cooperation between EU member states and non-EU countries. Since its inception, the programme has awarded over EUR 90 million to 14 projects. Mallorca Island launches Spain's first hydrogen pipeline on Sep 17. The initiative, as part of the 'Green Hysland' project, aims to achieve zero emissions by 2050 and promote the hydrogen economy. The 3.2 km pipeline will transport green hydrogen, benefiting over 115,000 households and reducing CO2 emissions. Energy security updates EU launches consultation on energy security architecture fitness check. On 3 September, the European Commission initiated a fitness check to evaluate the effectiveness of EU regulations relating to energy security, inviting input from a wide range of stakeholders before 26 November. The consultation aims to assess the performance of key regulations such as the Gas Security of Supply Regulation and the Electricity Risk Preparedness Regulation, which have been in force since 2017 and 2019 respectively. The evaluation will include the impact of emergency measures under REPowerEU and lessons from the recent COVID-19 and energy crises.

      "Main navigation\n\n\n                    Analysis finds decrease in U.S. manufacturing energy consumption \n        \nThis article is a first in a series of communication pieces associated with the Manufacturing Energy and Carbon Footprints project from the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Manufacturing Office. \nThe manufacturing sector, a subset of the industrial sector, consumed roughly 24 quads of total energy in 2018, accounting for approximately 74% of total industrial energy consumption, Figure 1 (DOE 2022; EIA 2021a, 2021b). The U.S. industrial sector is composed of four major types of industries: manufacturing, mining, construction, and agriculture. Improving efficiency, reducing energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and increasing competitiveness of the U.S. manufacturing sector is the core mission of the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO). \nIn order to increase energy and material efficiency in manufacturing, drive U.S. economic competitiveness, and enable an equitable transition to a decarbonized energy system by 2050, AMO partners with industry, academia, states, and National Laboratories to catalyze research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RDD&D) and the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies and practices. \u00a0\nFigure 1: Breakdown of total energy consumption for the end use sectors of the U.S. economy in 2018. Total energy consumption was roughly 101 quads and industrial manufacturing accounted for roughly 25% of the total (DOE 2022; EIA 2021a, 2021b). \nTo better understand and visualize the flow, end uses of energy, and GHG emissions within the U.S. manufacturing sector, AMO publishes its Manufacturing Energy and Carbon Footprints analysis every four years. The footprints map manufacturing energy use and GHG emissions from energy supply to major end uses, including process heaters, machine-driven equipment, boilers, and power generators. The footprints are based on the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s (EIA) Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS), along with referenced energy loss and emissions factors, and input from industry and subject matter experts.\nMECS provides survey results of actual plant data, so the AMO footprints represent a genuine distribution of energy consumption and GHG emissions across the manufacturing sector. They provide a benchmark to assess energy consumption and GHG emission patterns since the prior MECS data were released, helping to illuminate opportunities for technologies and practices to drive further improvements.\nEnergy consumption in the manufacturing sector\nIn addition to the footprints, which presents a holistic picture of manufacturing energy consumption, loss, and GHG emissions, meaningful insights can also be gleaned by examining certain segments of MECS data. For example, Figure 2 shows the following trends from the past five MECS iterations (data for years 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018).\nFigure 2: Total energy used for all purposes (first use) in the U.S. manufacturing sector from 2002 to 2018 (EIA 2021c)\nFigure 2 depicts the total energy used for all purposes (first use) for the manufacturing sector. First use of energy is defined as the energy consumed, whether generated onsite or offsite, for all end uses, excluding electricity produced from onsite fuel consumption.\nA 16% decrease in first use of energy was observed between 2002 and 2010, and there was a 3% increase between 2010 and 2018. The largest iteration to iteration change was a 11% decrease between 2006 and 2010.\nTable 1 provides a more granular view of energy consumption for specific sectors within U.S. manufacturing. The 15 sectors included in the table account for roughly 90% of first use of energy consumed in the manufacturing sector. For the Manufacturing Energy and Carbon Footprints, individual footprint visualizations are generated for each sector. Any sector outside of these 15 is captured in the \u201cAll Manufacturing\u201d footprint. The top five largest energy consuming sectors, which have not changed since 2002, account for roughly 80% of first use of energy and represent the primary drivers of energy consumption within the manufacturing sector.\nTable 1: Breakdown of first use of energy and iteration rankings (from largest energy consumption to smallest energy consumption) for the 15 distinct footprint sectors and all manufacturing (EIA 2021c).\nManufacturing Sector\nFirst Use of Energy (TBtu)\nRank\nFirst Use of Energy (TBtu)\nRank\nFirst Use of Energy (TBtu)\nRank\nFirst Use of Energy (TBtu)\nRank\nFirst Use of Energy (TBtu)\nRank\n\u00a0\nReferences\nDOE (Department of Energy). 2022.

      "Not\u00edcias\nFUEL OF THE FUTURE\nLula enacts Fuel of the Future law: \u201cBrazil will drive the world's largest energy revolution\u201d\n\n    According to the president, project approval underscores the country's ambition to be a major global player. Image: Ricardo Stuckert / PR\n    \n    \n  \nAddressing an audience that included representatives from the energy sector, agro-industry, aviation, and key stakeholders in the energy transition process, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva declared with conviction: \"Brazil will lead the world's largest energy revolution.\"\nThe statement was delivered this Tuesday, October 8, at the Brasilia Air Base, during the enacting ceremony of Bill of Law No. 528/2020, which institutes the National Program for Sustainable Fuel for Aviation, National Program for Green Diesel, and the National Program for the Decarbonization of Natural Gas Producers and Importers and for the Promotion of Biogas.\n\u201cWhich country can rival Brazil in wind and solar energy? Which country can compete with us in hydric energy? Which country can compete in green hydrogen? All we need is the desire to be big. The desire to win. To have self-esteem.\u201d The new legislation presents a series of initiatives to promote sustainable, low-carbon mobility and consolidate Brazil\u2019s position as a leader in the global energy transition.\n\u201cBrazil will get a head start because you, the entrepreneurs, have the capacity to produce, to research. Enacting this law demonstrates that none of us have the right to continue disbelieving that this country can be a large economy. What it needs is leaders who are up to the needs and aspirations of the people,\u201d the president added.\nParticipants of the event included Vice President and Minister of Development, Industry, Trade, and Services, Geraldo Alckmin; the Minister of Mines and Energy, Alexandre Silveira; heads of other ministries, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Arthur Lira, as well as parliamentarians and entrepreneurs.\n\u201cWe are planting a new seed. The seed of the fuel of the future. It will generate over BRL 260 billion in investments in agribusiness and the biofuels chain. The fuel of the future places Brazil at the forefront of the new economy, the green economy,\u201d summarized Alexandre Silveira.\n\u201cAn agenda like today\u2019s is an agenda of the State, of the country, of development. I do not doubt that they will become the country\u2019s greatest assets, as a significant milestone is set today,\u201d stated Arthur Lira.\nA post shared by Luiz Ina\u0301cio Lula da Silva (@lulaoficial)\nCOMMITMENT \u2013\u00a0In addition to the enactment of the Fuel of the Future Law (Lei do Combust\u00edvel do Futuro), the event was marked by the signing of letters of commitment for investments in the biofuel sector in Brazil. Seven companies signed commitments that surpass BRL 20 billion.\nETHANOL AND BIODIESEL\u00a0\u2014\u00a0The text outlines the increase in the ethanol blending margin with gasoline from 22% to 27%, with the potential to reach 35%. Currently, the minimum is set at 18%. Regarding the blending of biodiesel with fossil-derived diesel, which has been at 14% since March of this year, it states that one percentage point will be added to the mix annually, starting in 2025, until it reaches 20% by March 2030.\nPOTENTIAL \u2013\u00a0The executive director at the Brazilian Association of the Hydrogen Industry (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira da Ind\u00fastria de Hidrog\u00eanio Verde / ABIHV), Fernanda Delgado, defined the enacted law as key for the future of renewable energy. \u201cThe importance of the Fuel of the Future is that it incorporates into the energy matrix sustainable fuels, which will guide the country\u2019s renewable future. The Brazilian energy matrix is already renewable, with ethanol and biodiesel. However, this law mandates the expansion of this renewability, now including aviation fuels and marine fuels, as well as increasing the percentage of blends within fossil fuels,\u201d highlighted the businesswoman.\nPROGRAMS\u00a0\u2014\u00a0The Fuel of the Future Law institutes programs to foster research, production, trade, and use of biofuels with the goal of promoting the decarbonization of the transportation and mobility matrices.\nThe programs are:\n\u00bb National Program for Sustainable Fuel for Aviation (Programa Nacional de Combust\u00edvel Sustent\u00e1vel de Avia\u00e7\u00e3o / ProBioQAV): starting in 2027, the Air operators will be required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from domestic flights by utilizing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The targets will begin with a 1% reduction and will increase to 10% by 2037.\n\u00bb National Program for Green Diesel (Programa Nacional de Diesel Verde / PNDV): the National Council for Energy Policy (Conselho Nacional de Pol\u00edtica Energ\u00e9tica / CNPE) will yearly determine the minimum amount, in volume, of green diesel to be mixed with fossil-derived diesel.\n\u00bb National Program for the Decarbonization of Natural Gas Producers and Importers and for the Promotion of Biogas (Programa de Descarboniza\u00e7\u00e3o do Produtor e Importador de G\u00e1s Natural e de Incentivo ao Biometano): aims to foster research, production, trade, and use of biomethane and biogas in the Brazilian energy matrix.\u00a0\nENTHUSIASM\u00a0-\u00a0The president of the Brazilian Association of Wind Energy (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Energia E\u00f3lica / ABEE\u00f3lica), Elbia Gannoum was enthusiastic about the enaction of the law. \u201cThis idea of the Fuel of the Future is the fuel that, in the end, at net zero, we will need to use. And Brazil is really leading this discussion because it has several natural resources that can be used to produce the green molecule \u2014green hydrogen, which is made with clean and renewable energy\u2014 and our fuels \u2014ethanol, biodiesel, and all the mixes we are going to promote so that we can reach the energy transition at the end,\u201d said the president of ABEE\u00f3lica. Through the Fuel of the Future, Brazil is expected to avoid the emission of 705 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) by 2037, strengthening the country\u2019s commitment to reducing the greenhouse effect gas emissions. \u201cThe most important role here is the opportunity that Brazil identifies in this process of searching for a low-carbon economy, with a large global potency of renewable resources that can contribute to the climate solution. One cannot talk about a climate solution without taking Brazil into consideration, with the amount of resources it has to promote this transition,\u201d stated Elbia Gannoum.\n\nSIGNALING \u2013\u00a0According to Guilherme Nolasco, president of the National Union of Corn Ethanol (Uni\u00e3o Nacional do Etanol de Milho / UNEM), Brazil is sending a message to the world by sanctioning this norm.\u00a0\u201cI believe this is the most important legal framework of this administration. Brazil is signaling to the world that it has a vocation-based strategy for the energy transition through biofuels, be it for vehicle mobility, be it for aviation. And thus, it attracts the eyes of the world and investors through biomass, agriculture, generating jobs, social inclusion, income, taxes, to make the energy transition through biofuels,\u201d analyzed Nolasco.\nEXPO \u2014\u00a0The Lideran\u00e7a Verde (\u201cGreen Leadership\u201d) Brasil Expo, where the sanctioning ceremony took place, gathers the largest public and private companies from the biofuels, gas, and electric energy sectors. The venue is holding a large exhibition of equipment and vehicles that use technologies led by the Brazilian industry in the fields of transportation and mobility, such as SAF and BioGLP, produced with renewable raw materials. At the expo, visitors can check out aircraft from air companies Azul, Latam, and Gol, and automobiles from major manufacturers, such as Mercedes, Toyota, Volvo, Renault, and Volkswagen. In all, over 50 vehicles are exposed in the patio at the Brasilia Air Base, including trucks, tractors, excavators, harvesters, buses, and cars.\n",

It represents all the energy required to supply end users in the country. Some of these energy sources are used directly while most are transformed into fuels or electricity for final consumption.\nEnergy production includes any fossil fuels drilled and mined, which can be burned to produce electricity or used as fuels, as well as energy produced by nuclear fission and renewable power sources such as hydro, wind and solar PV. Bioenergy - which here includes both modern and traditional sources, including the burning of municipal waste - is also an important domestic energy source in many countries.\nImports, particularly of fossil fuels like oil, natural gas and coal, make up an important part of the energy supply in many countries. Countries that rely heavily on imported energy may be vulnerable to supply disruption from external events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. In countries that export large amounts of energy, falling energy prices can also cause major economic shocks.\nEnergy sources, particularly fossil fuels, are often transformed into more useful or practical forms before being used. For example, crude oil is refined into many different kinds of fuels and products, while coal, oil and natural gas can be burned to generate electricity and heat. Other forms of transformation, such as extracting gas or oil from coal, play a relatively minor role in the energy systems of most countries.\nOne of the most important types of transformation for the energy system is the refining of crude oil into oil products, such as the fuels that power automobiles, ships and planes.\nAnother important form of transformation is the generation of electricity. Thermal power plants generate electricity by harnessing the heat of burning fuels or nuclear reactions \u2013 during which up to half of their energy content is lost. Renewable power sources generate electricity directly from natural forces such as the sun, wind, or the movement of water.\nTotal final consumption (TFC) is the energy consumed by end users such as individuals and businesses to heat and cool buildings, to run lights, devices, and appliances, and to power vehicles, machines and factories. It also includes non-energy uses of energy products, such as fossil fuels used to make chemicals.\nSome of the energy found in primary sources is lost when converting them to useable final products, especially electricity. As a result, the breakdown of final consumption can look very different from that of the primary energy supply (TES). Both are needed to fully understand the energy system.\nThe sectoral breakdown of a country's energy demand, which is based on its economy, geography and history, can greatly impact its energy needs and which energy sources it relies on to meet those needs \u2013 such as fueling automobiles, heating or cooling homes or running factories.\n\n        Related content\n    \nBrazil\u2019s opportunity

      "Energy consumption in Brazil\nBrazil could be self-sufficient with domestically produced energy. The total production of all electric energy producing facilities is 674 bn kWh, which is 116 percent of the country's own usage. Despite this, Brazil trades energy with foreign countries. Along with pure consumption, the production, imports and exports play an important role. Back to overview: Brazil\nEnergy Balance\nCO\u2082 emissions\nProduction capacities per energy source\nIn practice this isn't possible, because e.g. solar collectors are less efficient under clouds. Also wind- and water-power plants are not always operating under full load.

This means all energy sources that renew themselves within a short time or are permanently available. Energy from hydropower is only partly a renewable energy. This is certainly the case with river or tidal power plants. Otherwise, numerous dams or reservoirs also produce mixed forms, e.g. by pumping water into their reservoirs at night and recovering energy from them during the day when there is an increased demand for electricity. Since it is not possible to clearly determine the amount of generated energy, all energy from hydropower is displayed separately.If all production capacities in Brazil for solar, wind, tidal, geothermal and biomass are added together, this results in a share of 24.5% of the total electricity volume for renewable energies excluding wind power plants. The World Bank, on the other hand, shows a value of 46.5% for the year 2021. \nUsage of renewable energies\nIf all production capacities in Brazil for solar, wind, tidal, geothermal and biomass are added together, this results in a share of 24.5% of the total electricity volume for renewable energies excluding wind power plants.

      "THIS REPORT CONTAINS ASSESSMENTS OF COMMODITY AND TRADE ISSUES MADE BY USDA STAFF AND NOT NECESSARILY STATEMENTS OF OFFICIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICY Required Report: Required - Public Distribution Date: March 15, 2024 Report Number: SP2024-0003 Report Name: Food Processing Ingredients Annual Country: Spain Post: Madrid Report Category: Food Processing Ingredients Prepared By: Arantxa Medina Approved By: Karisha Kuypers Report Highlights: In 2023, Spain imported $2.2 billion worth of agricultural, seafood and forest products from the United States, up 3 percent compared to the previous year. Even though inflation rates declined in 2023 as compared to the record highs registered in 2022, they remained higher compared to pre-pandemic levels. The high energy cost of raw materials and labor, as well as the effects of the drought, have increased the inflationary situation with repercussions for the productivity of companies and their margins, as well as for household consumption. Despite the economic and political uncertainties, Spain\u2019s food and beverage sector continues to show a constant and positive performance. With one of the most competitive food processing industries in Europe, Spain\u2019s demand for ingredients continues to increase, as well as its demand for distilled spirits, beef and beef products, seafood, pulses, and tree nuts. Spain Food Processing Ingredients 2024 2 Market Fact Sheet: Spain Spain is a major producer and exporter of food and agricultural products, with other EU countries as its primary export destination. Spanish producers, processors, wholesalers, retailers, food service operators, and importers are all part of a well-developed agribusiness sector, contributing to a competitive and dynamic domestic scenario. In 2023, Spain\u2019s total imports of agricultural and related products reached $65.4 billion, up 2.4 percent compared to 2022; 57 percent of these imports originated from the European Union. Goods imported into Spain must meet the EU sanitary and phytosanitary requirements to protect human and animal health, as well as requirements under the customs union. Hence, U.S. exporters already exporting to other EU member states will likely meet most of the Spanish import requirements. For the export of animal products, the production plant must be approved for export to the EU. Total Imports of Consumer-Oriented Products 2023 In 2023, the food-processing sector consolidated its position as an important industrial sector. Spain enjoys a modern food-processing sector that pays special attention to the quality, safety, and traceability of the food products it produces. It has one of the most competitive food processing industries in Europe, which makes this sector an important target for U.S. exports of food ingredients. Industry\u2019s interest in developing new products continues to present opportunities for food ingredients. The retail competitive landscape remained highly fragmented in 2023, led by major grocery retailers. Within grocery store-based retailing, the competitive environment is concentrated, with Mercadona retaining its leadership, followed by Carrefour. In 2024, due to new consumption habits, internet retailing is expected to continue growing, as retailers continue to invest in eCommerce platforms.

MARKET SUMMARY Under the current complex macroeconomic environment, the Spanish food and beverage industry has carried out its activity under the pressure of rising production costs and the consequent effects on business results. Even though inflation rates declined in 2023 as compared to the record highs registered in 2022, they remained higher compared to pre-pandemic levels. In 2022, in nominal terms, industry's production grew extraordinarily to above 17 percent, but once the price factor is applied this figure is reduced to 1.5 percent. This indicates the strong impact that inflation has had on business margins, in addition to the brake imposed on production, which had managed to maintain a constant line in the previous crises. However, despite the economic and political uncertainties, Spain\u2019s food and beverage sector has continued its positive performance. In 2022, the food and beverage industry continued to be the strongest industrial sector in Spain. Its gross added value, estimated at close to $30 billion, represented 19.3 percent of the manufacturing industry and close to 2.5 percent of the total Spanish economy. 2023 has once again proven to be a very demanding year for small and medium companies. The food and beverage industry maintained its business network above 30,159 companies, demonstrating during this year some increase in the number of medium and large companies. This trajectory shows an improvement in the size of the industry, although small and medium companies continue to represent the majority of the sector, representing more than 96 percent of the sector. Table 1. Advantages and Challenges Facing U.S. Food Processing Ingredients Advantages Challenges Spanish consumers are increasingly open to new products. The United States is a favorite destination for Spanish travelers outside the EU, increasing the popularity and interest in U.S. food products. Adjustments to the overall domestic and international economy situation (inflation, international conflicts, drought, logistics challenges). Spain\u2019s food industry relies on imported ingredients, many from the United States, which have a good image and reputation. Food imported from third countries, including the U.S., must comply with EU food law, labeling, traceability, and packaging laws, which vary from U.S. regulation and practice. Increased demand in retail channels is pushing food processors to be more innovative to provide new offerings. High transportation costs. In addition, small exporters face difficulties in shipping mixed/smaller container loads vs EU competitors or big exporters. Good network of agents and importers to help get products into the market. Competition from EU countries, where tastes and traditional products may be better known. New generation of consumers demand healthy, innovative, sustainable products, creating new opportunities. Lack of consumer awareness of U.S. brands, applicability, and varieties of U.S. products. Distribution structure is modern and many companies cover both Spain and Portugal. High import tariffs and import regulations impose a price disadvantage on non-EU based companies. Spain Food Processing Ingredients 2024 4 SECTION II. ROAD MAP FOR MARKET ENTRY Entry Strategy Success in introducing products in the Spanish market requires local representation and personal contact. A local representative can provide up-to-date market intelligence, guidance on business practices and trade related laws, sales contact with existing and potential buyers, and market development expertise. The Office of Agricultural Affairs in Madrid maintains listings of potential importers and develops sector-specific information to help introduce your product in Spain. Customs are involved in the implementation and enforcement of European legislation relating to external trade, not only for customs duties and commercial policy measures, but also as regards security, environmental, anti-dumping, consumer protection, cultural and agricultural controls. Goods imported into the EU must meet the sanitary and phytosanitary requirements to protect human and animal health and as part of the custom union. Though Spain implements harmonized EU rules and regulations, there are subtleties that exporters should learn about when considering exporting to Spain. For more information, we invite potential U.S. exporters to contact our office for additional sector-specific information. U.S. exporters already exporting to other member states will likely meet most of the requirements for exporting to Spain. Typically, operators buy food ingredients from importers or wholesalers. Some large companies buy directly from foreign suppliers. Other companies concentrate on the domestic or on export markets, but most will have mixed customers. Companies supplying the domestic market frequently sell their products directly and have their own logistics infrastructure. However, their customers will vary from wholesalers to buying groups and retailers. Companies producing for re-export may have their own marketing office overseas, local agents, or may work with local importers. U.S. exporters also face challenges with EU labeling and traceability regulations. Labeling is required for any product that contains genetically modified ingredients. For details, visit the EU labeling requirements section of the USEU Mission webpage. Import Procedures The local importer has primary responsibility with the Spanish Government for imported food products once they enter Spain. It is recommended that that U.S. exporters verify all import requirements with their Spanish buyer. The buyer and local freight forwarder are in the best position to research such matters and assist with local authorities. The final authorization to import any product is subject to the Spanish rules and regulations as interpreted by border officials at the time of product entry. Spain follows the Harmonized Nomenclature and Classification System (HS) and applies EU import duties according to a maximum and minimum rate schedule. If your product is or contains plant or animal products, it will require a phytosanitary or health certificate issued by the competent U.S. authority. In addition, if you are exporting animal products, your production plant must be approved to export into the EU. Spain Food Processing Ingredients 2024 5 The following documents are required for ocean or air cargo shipments of food products into Spain: \uf0b7 Bill of Lading and/or Airway Bill \uf0b7 Commercial Invoice \uf0b7 Phytosanitary Certificate and/or Health Certificate, when applicable \uf0b7 Import Certificate For all details, please check the Food and Agricultural Import Regulations and Standards Report (FAIRS) and the FAIRS Export Certificate Report for the EU and Spain, and the U.S. Mission to the European Union (USEU Mission) website for helpful information on exporting U.S. food and agricultural products into the EU. Please keep in mind that if the product you are exporting into Spain does not comply with EU harmonized regulations, Spanish customs or health authorities may not allow entry of the product. Trade Shows Trade shows in Spain continue to offer excellent opportunities for U.S. exporters to contact potential clients or business partners from Spain, Portugal, other EU countries and other continents. The most important trade shows are: Alimentaria, in Barcelona March 18-21, 2024, and the USDA-endorsed show Seafood Expo Global, in Barcelona April 23-25, 2024.

Major Consumer Trends: \uf0b7 Price sensitivity: 75 percent of Spanish consumers look for a bargain before making a final purchasing decision, while a quarter leave their regular retailer if they find lower prices elsewhere. Price sensitivity also results in a lack of loyalty to brands. \uf0b7 Environmental shift and pressure: increasing awareness of environmental challenges are having a powerful impact on consumer behavior and purchasing decision making. \uf0b7 Population changes: trends such as urbanization, migration, and aging are reshaping consumer lifestyles and shopping decisions. Single/two person households are growing and households of four or more persons are declining. The low birth rate and the increasing percentage of elderly people is another trend that will require adjustments in market supply. SECTION III. COMPETITION Spain\u2019s main trading partner is the EU-27.

      "ENERGY USE IN U.S. AGRICULTURE: AN OVERVIEW Greta Raser and Madeline Silecchia* INTRODUCTION The agricultural industry in the United States relies on a variety of tools and methods to accommodate the intensive and highly efficient production processes considered necessary to meet current demand. Farms implement energy-intensive practices such as machinery use, transportation, and pesticides and other chemical inputs to efficiently produce large quantities of quality crops or livestock products. In 2012 alone, the U.S. agriculture industry used about 800 trillion British Thermal Units (BTU) of energy.1 The hidden costs of efficient agricultural production include the impacts of the fossil-fuel based energy that is used to produce our everyday foods. Energy use in agriculture is classified as either direct or indirect energy use. Direct energy use is the consumption and use of fuels on the farm. These are very clearly seen on farms at the time of production and include most commonly propane, natural gas, electricity, and distillate fuels (diesel).2 Indirect energy use is the use of fuels to make products that will later be used on farms. This use of energy is much less obvious as a contribution to agricultural energy consumption since it is not directly consumed on the farm. However, because the agricultural process includes any aspect that plays a role in bringing the finished product to market, an accurate assessment of energy use in agriculture will include indirect energy use.3 Energy is consumed in four general phases of agricultural production: agriculture, fertilizer production, transportation, and processing. Agriculture is the growing and harvesting of crops and the care and slaughter of livestock. Transportation is the process of sending agricultural products by any means of transportation to the next step of production. Processing is needed for food that is not able to be consumed directly after leaving the farm. Additionally, processing often requires additional transportation to processing facilities. Lastly, food and other agricultural products go through the handling phase. At this point food and products are packaged, canned and sold into the market.4 * Clean Energy Advocacy Interns, Institute for Energy and the Environment, Vermont Law School, 2020 1 Susan Hicks, U.S. Energy Information Admin., Energy For Growing And Harvesting Crops is a Large Component of Farm Operating Costs, https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=18431. 2 U.S. Energy Information Admin., Glossary, https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php?id=distillate. 3 Susan Hicks, supra note 1. 4 American Food Production Requires More Energy than You'd Think, Save On Energy Blog (Dec. 6, 2019), www.saveonenergy.com/learning-center/post/american-food-production-requires-energy/. 2 The agricultural industry is a complex system with advanced technology and farming practices that consume a large amount of energy.5 For example, 4% of California electricity consumption is used in agriculture and 5% of the state\u2019s natural gas use is attributable to food production.6 The United States uses a staggering amount of fossil fuels to produce foods like vegetables, milk and meat, resulting in the large carbon footprint left by U.S. food production. Extreme energy use exists at all levels of the farming industry from small organic farms to large industrial farms. DIRECT ENERGY While every species of plant and animal has its own needs, it may require more uses of energy, such as needing extra care or more fertilizers. Direct energy use is the most obvious use of energy in agriculture. Direct energy is the development and consumption of energy within the inner workings of an entity and its activities, structures, as well as upkeep.7 Direct energy use can be from any type of renewable or non-renewable energy. However, the majority of energy used on U.S. farms is non-renewable energy such as diesel, electricity liquefied petroleum, natural gas and gasoline.8 The amount of energy used directly on farms is evident in the large amounts of money spent on energy use in both crop and livestock industries. The average expenditures of agriculture can be analyzed to begin understanding how much these industries are investing in their energy consumption. First, 2012 data reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicates that crop farms consume more energy than livestock farms in every energy source category.9 5 Agriculture and Energy Consumption, https://foodprint.org/issues/agriculture-energy-consumption/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-1293 (last visited July 26, 2020). 6 California Energy Commission, Energy in Agriculture Program (2017), http://www.energy.ca.gov/process/agriculture/; see also Emma G. Fitzsimmons, Tap Water Ban for Toledo Residents, The New York Times (August 3, 2014), https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/us/toledo-faces-second-day-of-water-ban.html?_r=0. 7 Direct and Indirect Energy Consumption by Source, FenRIAM 1 (July 18, 2020), www.fenriam.eu/direct-and-indirect-energy-consumption-by-source.html. 8 Id. 9 Susan Hicks, supra note 1. 3 Second, the expenditures on agricultural energy use are informative. For context, the total U.S. expenditure on fuel in 2017 was $12,000,000. This number consists of both indirect and direct energy sources.10 Fuel is 3.3% of the agriculture's total overall expenditures.11 Crops use an average $8,511 per farm on fuel and livestock spend an average of 3,906 per farm. Crop farms are going to be using more tractors, self-propelled, and farm machinery than livestock farms therefore it makes sense for them to be spending more on these objects as well. Crops on average spend $9,139 on tractors/self-propelled farm machinery and $4,227 on other farm machinery. Livestock farms spend more money on trucks and automobiles than crops at an average of $2,696 per farm.12 The amount spent on trucks, tractors, and machinery indicates how much energy within each category. Today there are multiple practices used to care and grow crops which require equipment of various fuels. There is a long list of uses on a farm that derives the use of some type of fuel or energy source.13 In almost every action on a farm you can drive energy. Crop farms derive more energy overall than livestock farms do. On a crop farm the energy use that occurs in the beginning of production occurs in the form of field work using some type of large operating equipment such as mowers, tractors, plow and combines. Different types of equipment are needed to manage the soil like weeding, harvesting, tillage, fertilizing and seed distribution. Farmers tend to use either equipment hooked to their tractors to perform these tasks or purchase additional machinery that is capable of performing these tasks individually. Whichever method is used in the field, diesel and gasoline are the fuels that are needed to power these highly important 10 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 2015 Energy Balance for the Corn-Ethanol Industry 8 (2016). 11 Nat\u2019l Agric. Statistics Serv., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric, 2017 Census of Agriculture (2019). 12 Id. 13 Jodi Ziesemer, Energy Use in Organic Food Systems (2007), http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload/233069/energy-use-oa.pdf. 4 and large tools. However, these are under traditional crop farming standards that do not include electricity for lights and heat from greenhouses or propane powered fire weeding and many more methods that farmers use to accommodate their unique crop. For example, orchids use heaters to prevent frost. Livestock farming is uniquely different compared to crop farming. Livestock farms use mostly direct energy to care for its animals. Since most of the operations occur inside, farms put more energy into powering the building with lights, heat and ventilation just to make the building safe for workers and animals. When dealing with animals in an industrial farm there is use of many moving parts such as water distribution, waste management and feeding machines. Although these methods are efficient for time and cleanliness, they derive these benefits from the use of large amounts of distillate fuel. Oil is needed to improve flow of the farm through the use of internal conveyors and elevators. These machines move the animals and the product to necessary parts of the farm. The use of the livestock does not alter the need for large refrigeration. Refrigeration derives electricity twenty-four hours a day without being shut off in order to conserve products until they leave the farm. Almost every aspect of livestock production requires some form of direct energy fuel.14 INDIRECT ENERGY While direct energy in agriculture focuses on the activities on the farm, thus making them \u201cdirect,\u201d indirect energy can include the activities that happen during pre-production and post-production that take place off the farm. Most of the research about indirect energy use in agriculture focuses on fertilizer and pesticides because the production of these two substances accounts for a large portion of the indirect energy. As the population has increased, farmers have used increasing amounts of fertilizers to increase agriculture production. Fertilizer has helped grow the production output of certain crops, including wheat, soybeans, corn, rice, and oats to name a few.15 About 70-80% of the energy used to produce fertilizers comes from natural gas, due in part to the high volume of nitrogen fertilizer production.16 Natural gas is used to create a nitrogen fertilizer called anhydrous ammonia and natural gas is important for the ammonia synthesis done by the Haber-Bosch process, which is commonly used in nitrogen fertilizer production.17 The Haber-Bosch process became a growing phenomenon after World War II because it made it possible to mass produce fertilizers, therefore contributing along with pesticides and herbicides to the 14 Susan Hicks, supra note 1. 15 The Fertilizer Institute, Improving Lives (2020), www.tfi.org/our-industry/intro-to-fertilizer/improving-lives. 16 Clark Gellings et al., Energy Efficiency in Fertilizer Production and Use (2009). 17 Id. 5 increase in yields that came about.18 While this Haber-Bosch process consumes only about 3-5% of the world\u2019s natural gas, scientists are working to make it more efficient to help reduce global energy demand.19 There are also different fertilizer types. Nitrogen fertilizer is used more than the other two, potash and phosphate.20 While nitrogen is extracted from air, potash and phosphates are retrieved through mining processes.21 Phosphate fertilizer production consumes about 5,600 BTUs per pound of phosphate, while potash fertilizer production consumes about 4,700 BTUs per pound of potash.22 Nitrogen fertilizer production utilizes greater than 75% of all the energy use attributable to total fertilizer production with a consumption of about 25,000 BTUs per pound of nitrogen. Therefore, not only is nitrogen fertilizer used more frequently, but it is also more energy intensive to produce than the other two.23 Indirect energy use also includes chemical inputs like pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides, which farmers also rely on to increase yields.24 Although pesticide use consumes less energy than fertilizer use, it is still a significant contributing factor, with more than $9 billion spent on pesticides by U.S. producers in 2012 to protect their yields from potential harm by pests.25 While less than 15% of energy use in agriculture is ascribed to pesticides, it requires more energy per pound to manufacture pesticides than nitrogen fertilizer.26 Pesticide production typically uses petroleum sources, as well as some electricity, natural gas, and steam for certain steps of the manufacturing process.27 However, the amount of energy for the production of different pesticides may depend on the method used to manufacture them and the chemical composition.28 Fertilizer and pesticide use varies by agriculture and crop type, with about 1.25 billion pounds of pesticides used each year, most overall used by feed and food grain crops and most 18 Vaclav Smil, Nitrogen Cycle and World Food Production, http://vaclavsmil.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/smil-article-worldagriculture.pdf. 19 Improving Ammonia Synthesis Could Have Major Implications for Agriculture and Energy, ScienceDaily (2010), https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101117094031.htm. 20 Econ.

Crop agriculture uses more energy and has a higher percentage of energy expenditures than livestock agriculture.31 The variations in fertilizer and pesticide use can then be broken down even more, when examining organic crop agriculture, which does not make use of energy-intensive fertilizers and pesticides like industrial crop agriculture does.32 In addition to the production of fertilizers and pesticides, their post-production aspects also contribute to the total indirect energy use in agriculture. This can include processing, distributing, and transportation.33 The Fertilizer Institute describes the steps of the fertilizer supply chain as first the collection of raw materials, which are the three types previously discussed: nitrogen, phosphate, potash, then the manufacturing at a production facility, followed by storage and distribution to a retailer who may create nutrient blends specific to their needs, and then to the farm.34 These post-production aspects of energy use for fertilizers and pesticides are difficult to measure because they vary based on numerous factors, including type of transportation and distance travelled as well as type of packaging and processing methods.35 For fertilizers, about 4,000 BTUs per ton are required to move a mile by truck and about 1,600 BTUs per ton for a mile by rail.36 For pesticides, oil-based ones are estimated to use about 430 BTUs per pound for transportation.37 Fertilizers and pesticides are mostly used in \u201cconventional agriculture\u201d as opposed to organic agriculture which relies on less inputs.38 Much of what is considered \u201cinefficient\u201d in conventional agriculture is due to the amount of energy consumed during the manufacturing of fertilizers and pesticides, as well as the energy consumed while transporting and distributing them.39 Conventional farming depends more on energy-intensive fertilizers, pesticides, and concentrated feed, another aspect of indirect energy, than organic farms do.40 There are ways however, that farmers can utilize fertilizers and pesticides more efficiently to save energy. Soil testing is one option for farmers to assess which soil patches have a lack of nutrients and therefore have more need for fertilizer.41 This saves energy by not utilizing extra fertilizers on 29 Id. 30 Susan Hicks, supra note 1. 31 Id. 32 Jodi Ziesemer, supra note 13. 33 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 17. 34 The Fertilizer Institute, supra note 7. 35 Energy-Efficient Use of Fertilizer and Other Nutrients in Agriculture, supra note 22. 36 Id. 37 Energy Use and Efficiency in Pest Control,, supra note 26. 38 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 10. 39 Id. 40 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 4. 41 Energy Use and Efficiency in Pest Control,, supra note 26. 7 areas where it is not necessary and instead applying those fertilizers to soils with a lack of nutrients.42 Placement of fertilizer close to the seed during planting is another more effective method, as well as liming soil to the crop\u2019s optimal pH, crop rotation, and timing the application of fertilizer based on what research has shown to produce the most effective results can also help with energy reduction.43 For pesticides, one main method to reduce energy is to utilize integrated pest management through carefully searching for pests and determining when it is economically best to spray preventative pesticides instead of spraying them constantly.44 Animal feed manufacturing is another category of indirect energy use. Concentrated feed can be produced off-farm, making them indirect consumers of energy, however determining if they fall under indirect or direct energy use can depend on if they are produced on the farm or not, which they usually are for organic farms and are usually not for conventional farms.45 Production of feed for livestock tends to be intensive and makes use of chemicals and fertilizers, adding to the inefficiency of energy use.46 Similar to fertilizers and pesticides, much of the energy used for livestock feed is due to production, processing, and transportation, amounting to about 2/3rds specifically for conventional livestock feed.47 Post-production activities such as processing and packaging can have various definitions on if they are direct or indirect energy consumers. For the purposes of this project, if they are performed on-site at the farm they are considered direct and if they are performed off-site they are indirect. Packaging can be a large consumer of energy, with one evaluation by Heller et al. finding that packaging had exceeded the total combined amount of energy used in production, processing, and transportation.48 However, packaging is important because it prevents food spoilage, which would be an inefficient use of energy, and there are ways to utilize more recycled and biodegradable materials for packaging, as seen on some organic farms.49 Storage is another component that depending on locational factors could be considered direct or indirect energy consumption. Refrigeration, pest and fungal control contribute to energy consumption for storage for both conventional and organic farms, and synthetic preservatives and other chemicals may also contribute to energy use for conventional agriculture.50 Distribution and transportation are typically the next steps after storage, and as touched on previously depend on the type of transportation, fuel, loading efficiency, distance, and consumer 42 Id. 43 Id. 44 Energy Use and Efficiency in Pest Control, supra note 26. 45 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 14. 46 Id. 47 Id. 48 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 16. 49 Id. 50 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 17. 8 travel.51 However, low energy use in one aspect of post-production may offset some energy expenditures for transportation and there are different methods that can cut energy use, such as delivery or pick up to a nearby center can cut costs of transportation by about 37-43% as well as supplying a local wholesaler.52 There was a finding however, that while locally sourced food may decrease energy use in some cases, other times it may not due to the use of smaller vehicles and lower loads.53 Nevertheless, finding local food can be an important step to reducing an individual\u2019s energy footprint because it is common for food nowadays to be imported internationally.54 Even within the United States, agriculture is concentrated in certain areas and large percentages of certain crops are grown in specific regions, largely due to industrial farming.55 Organic agriculture will sometimes put an emphasis on buying locally to reduce individual energy use, which is an important thing to do, but does not take away from the large-scale changes that are needed by the energy and agriculture industries to reduce their ecological footprints. While measuring indirect energy use, it\u2019s important to consider those energy consumers that aren\u2019t always obvious. As mentioned above, there can be many layers to indirect energy use. The production of fertilizers and pesticides is a large portion of indirect energy consumption, but the transportation and handling of these substances is another layer, as well as the transportation and handling of the crops on which these fertilizers and pesticides are used. Some other indirect energy uses that might be considered are food intake by workers56, as well as energy used in manufacturing equipment, even though that\u2019s done only once, and the energy wasted from food waste. CONCLUSION Throughout history, as the population has grown there has been an increasing demand for industrial farming and the ability to feed a large number of people. Certain developments of fertilizers and pesticides that help increase agricultural outputs may help yield efficiency, but in order to use these in the large amounts that they\u2019re used in, they do consume significant amounts of energy. While there are many direct and indirect energy factors at play when it comes to overall energy consumption in agriculture, it\u2019s important to find renewable energy options and sustainable alternatives for all factors. Finding renewable options not only may benefit the natural environment, but it may help with environmental justice concerning humans who deal 51 Id. 52 Id. 53 Id. 54 Eating Sustainably: An Introduction to Sustainable Food (2011), https://sustainability.emory.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Sustainable_Food_Information_Booklet.pdf. 55 Id. 56 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 20. 9 with water and air contamination from chemicals, fossil fuels, and other harmful toxins from the energy and agriculture industries. Organic agriculture was mentioned earlier as having lower energy inputs, which can be a sustainable alternative to more conventional and industrial farms.57 While this system tends to require less energy and has less greenhouse gas emissions, it is not a perfect system that can still have large energy uses in certain areas, such as large travel distances, even international. Buying local food was one option of a change that consumers can make in their lives. One source gives a few other important lifestyle changes to be aware of, such as being aware of the energy required to produce the food that makes up your diet because meats and animal products tend to require a lot of energy.58 Other steps for consumers they describe are meal planning to decrease food waste and energy efficient storage to decrease energy consumption by refrigerators.59 While working to reduce energy consumption at the consumer level can be important, it is not always accessible for everyone due to different life situations. This makes it even more important that the energy and agriculture industries work to reduce their large amounts of fossil fuel usages. Some farms have already implemented renewable energy sources on-site like wind, solar and biomass technologies, as well as implemented methods to rotate crops to fix nitrogen in soil to make use of less fossil fuels.60 Many farms may have the potential to include renewable resources, and different policies may have the ability to incentivize these practices which is hopefully a shift that we will see in the near future. 57 Ziesemer, supra note 13, at 4. 58 Save on Energy Team, American Food Production Requires More Energy Than You Think (2019), https://www.saveonenergy.com/learning-center/post/american-food-production-requires-energy/. 59 Id. 60 Agriculture and Energy Consumption (2020), https://foodprint.org/issues/agriculture-energy-consumption/."

      "Energy consumption in Sweden\nSweden could be self-sufficient with domestically produced energy. The total production of all electric energy producing facilities is 174 bn kWh, which is 134 percent of the country's own usage. Despite this, Sweden trades energy with foreign countries. Along with pure consumption, the production, imports and exports play an important role.

On the way to CO2 neutrality, the country needs other energy sources. Hydroelectric power is by far the largest energy supplier, but there is no possibility of increasing capacity in the long term. Solar energy cannot be relied on in the far north. In winter, the sun does not shine long enough to make it profitable to operate. The construction of wind power plants is making massive progress, especially in the north of the country. Investors are being attracted with substantial subsidies. However, the country does not want to and cannot yet do without nuclear energy because the demand for energy is enormous, especially in the transportation sector. Nuclear power is not a renewable energy, but it releases considerably fewer emissions than fossil fuels. In addition, the mix of nuclear and hydroelectric power is favorable, which pleases private households and the economy alike.Sweden, for example, is way out in front in terms of electric car registrations. In recent years, every second to third new vehicle was electric or at least a partially electric hybrid. Government subsidies, such as the bonus-malus system and high gasoline prices are making conventional fossil fuel vehicles increasingly unattractive.Usage of renewable energiesRenewable energy includes wind, solar, biomass and geothermal energy sources. This means all energy sources that renew themselves within a short time or are permanently available. Energy from hydropower is only partly a renewable energy. This is certainly the case with river or tidal power plants. Otherwise, numerous dams or reservoirs also produce mixed forms, e.g. by pumping water into their reservoirs at night and recovering energy from them during the day when there is an increased demand for electricity. Since it is not possible to clearly determine the amount of generated energy, all energy from hydropower is displayed separately.If all production capacities in Sweden for solar, wind, tidal, geothermal and biomass are added together, this results in a share of 28.4% of the total electricity volume for renewable energies excluding wind power plants. The World Bank, on the other hand, shows a value of 57.9% for the year 2021. \nElectric mobility thanks to nuclear power The former plans to phase out nuclear power have not been pursued for years.

One way people respond to hot weather is by using air conditioning. Air conditioning is the primary way to cool a home and has become more widely used over time; as of 2015, it accounted for 17 percent of the electricity that the average American household uses every year.1 Conversely, cold weather requires people to use energy to heat their homes, using electricity and fuels such as natural gas, propane, and oil.\nAs climate change contributes to an increase in average temperatures and unusually hot days, Americans are expected to use more energy\u2014mostly electricity for air conditioning.2\u00a0As a result, people will likely have to spend more money on electricity for cooling.2 Increased use of air conditioning could also lead to more greenhouse gas emissions and further climate change, because more electricity must be generated to meet this increased demand. As of 2021, about three-fifths of the electricity in the United States was generated by burning fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas.3 Burning fossil fuels for electricity is one of the largest sources of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions in the United States (see the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions indicator).\nThe opposite effect could take place with winter heating. As temperatures rise, Americans are expected to use less fuel energy for heating their homes.2\u00a0Overall, though, summer increases in energy use are expected to outweigh any reduction due to lower heating needs in the winter.2\u00a0 Improvements in energy efficiency, particularly for electricity-based heating and cooling, can influence residential consumption and demand for energy over time.\nAbout the Indicator\nThis indicator measures changes in residential seasonal energy use in the United States. It has two components:\nThe data come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), which collects comprehensive information about power generation, delivery, and sales from electric power utilities across the country. EIA has collected these data consistently since 1973. For this indicator, EPA divided total residential electricity sales for the summer months by the corresponding total U.S. population to calculate summer electricity use per capita, which Figure 1 shows in kilowatt-hours per person. EPA used a similar method with winter residential natural gas sales, which Figure 2 shows in cubic feet per person.\nFor reference, Figure 1 also shows summer cooling degree days for each year, while Figure 2 shows winter heating degree days for each year (see the Heating and Cooling Degree Days indicator). In general, more cooling degree days and fewer heating degree days means a combination of more warm days and warmer temperatures on those days. Residential electricity and natural gas use cover all 50 states plus Washington D.C., while cooling and heating degree days are shown for the contiguous 48 states plus D.C., as they are not routinely calculated for Alaska and Hawaii.\nAbout the Data\nIndicator Notes\nThis indicator is based on residential retail electricity and natural gas sales. In the case of electricity, sales are not exactly the same as total residential electricity use, because sales data do not count electricity that people generate and consume onsite\u2014for example, using rooftop solar panels. For context, residential solar generated an estimated 33,600 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2021, which translates to 2.3 percent of total residential retail sales.8\u00a0\u00a0As more people produce their own power and buy less electricity from a utility, sales data could increasingly underestimate the actual amount of electricity used. However, retail sales data are still the best available approximation for energy use nationwide .\nOutdoor air temperature is not the only weather-related factor that influences energy use (humidity and dew point also matter, for example), but it is still a major driver of the amount of electricity and natural gas people use in their homes. That said, rising temperatures are not the only reason why people might use more electricity in the summer and less natural gas in the winter.\nOne possible factor affecting electricity and natural gas use is where people live. Over the past several decades, the fastest-growing parts of the United States have been in the South and West, which means a growing share of the U.S. population lives in warmer places. The \u201ccooling degree days\u201d line in Figure 1 and the \u201cheating degree days\u201d line in Figure 2 adjust for where people lived as of the 2010 census but do not adjust for changes in population distribution over time.\nOther factors include characteristics of people\u2019s homes and the air conditioning and heating equipment they use. As of 2020, 88 percent of U.S. homes use some type of air conditioning, and 66 percent have central air conditioning installed.9\u00a0\u00a0These numbers have increased over time, as has the size of the average American home, which means more space to heat and cool. Conversely, homes have become more energy efficient over time (for example, through better insulation), and air conditioning and heating equipment has also become more efficient.\nElectricity and natural gas use could also reflect utility prices (when rates are higher, people may choose to reduce their use) and the amount of electricity and natural gas that Americans use for other needs. Other considerations include whether new homes rely on electricity or gas for cooking, water heating, and other activities, and shifts towards the use of innovative electronic appliances over time.\nEven with all these factors at work, many studies agree that rising temperatures can and will lead to increased use of electricity, as well as reduced use of heating fuels in winter.2\nData Sources\nThe data for this indicator were provided by EIA, which maintains a large collection of information about how the United States produces and uses electricity and other forms of energy. EIA\u2019s energy sales data can be found online at: www.eia.gov/electricity and www.eia.gov/naturalgas. EPA developed this indicator using two additional sources: population data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and cooling and heating degree days from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nTechnical Documentation\nReferences\n1 EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration).

For example, if the average temperature on a particular day is 78\u00b0F, then that day counts as 13 cooling degree days, as a building's interior would need to be cooled by 13\u00b0F to reach 65\u00b0F. If the average outdoor temperature is 34\u00b0F, then that day counts as 31 heating degree days, as a building's interior would need to be warmed by 31\u00b0F to reach 65\u00b0F.\nLearn about other indicators in this section\nClimate Change Indicators\nDiscover.\nConnect.\nAsk.\nFollow.\n"

      "Contents\nTimeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City\nThe following is a timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City.\nBefore March 2020\nThe first, confirmed, case of COVID-19 was in New York State on March 1, 2020, in a 39-year-old health care worker who had returned home to Manhattan from Iran on February 25.[1][2] Genomic analyses suggest the disease had been introduced to New York as early as January, and that most cases were linked to Europe, rather than Asia.[3]\nWhile the first official case wasn't confirmed until March 1, researchers later estimated that approximately 10,700 New Yorkers had already contracted the virus by that time.[4]\n2020\nMarch 2020\nOn March 3, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the first recorded case of person-to-person spread in New York State had been confirmed via a New Rochelle man who was working at a law firm within One Grand Central Place in Midtown Manhattan.[5] Six days later, on March 9, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that there were 16 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New York City.[6] Cuomo announced a New Rochelle \"containment area\" on March 10,[7] and the World Health Organization declared a global COVID-19 pandemic on March 11.[8] New York City public schools closed as of March 16, and remote learning began on March 23.[9]\nThe virus then grew exponentially; by March 25, over 17,800 cases had been confirmed in New York City, with 199 deaths.[10] At the time, the city's infection rate was five times higher than the rest of the country, and its cases were one-third of total confirmed US cases.[11] The reasons for the high infection rate continue to be discussed.[12] On March 27, infection in New York City surpassed 23,000, with 365 deaths. Queens was the worst-affected borough by number of deaths, with over a third of total deaths; the majority of the deceased had underlying health issues.[13] Between March 28 and 29, the number of deaths in New York City tripled from the previous 24-hour period; 222 people died of the virus, bringing the city's fatalities to 672, with 30,765 confirmed cases.[14]\nThe USNS\u00a0Comfort hospital ship arrived in New York Harbor on March 30.[15] Field hospitals were also set up in several places citywide.[16][17] Refrigerator trucks were set up on city streets outside hospitals to accommodate the overflow of bodies of the deceased.[18] On March 31, the first death of a child from COVID-19 in New York City was recorded.[19]\nApril 2020\nOn April 4, Governor Cuomo announced that the Chinese government had arranged for a donation of 1,000 ventilators to be sent to New York through foundations run by billionaires Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai.[20] The state of Oregon was reported to be sending 140 ventilators.[21] Trump announced that 1,000 additional federal medical soldiers would be deployed to New York City.[22] It was reported that \"Urban Area Medical Task Forces\" made up of army reservists would be working in the New York City field hospitals and other parts of the country.[23] As of April 4[update], there were 1,200 medical military personnel serving on the USNS Comfort. 2,700 New York State National Guard forces had also been deployed.[20]\nOn April 5, it was reported that a Malayan tiger at the already-closed Bronx Zoo tested positive for COVID-19. This was the first known case of an animal in the US (or a tiger anywhere) being infected with the disease. The tiger had started showing symptoms on March 27, including a dry cough, wheezing, and weakened appetite. The source of the infection was believed to be an infected zookeeper who was not yet showing symptoms.[24] On April 22, it was reported that four additional tigers and three lions had tested positive.[25]\nBy April 6, New York City had accumulated 72,181 confirmed COVID-19 cases in humans, with at least 2,475 deaths, nearly 25% of the US total.[26] The next day Gothamist reported that the official death toll in New York City was undercounted.[27] It was estimated that 1,125 people had died at home or on the street in NYC in the first five days of April, an eight-fold increase compared with FDNY figures for 2019. Due to the large increase, many of the deaths were presumed to be caused by COVID-19, but only residents with confirmed infections had been recorded in the official count. Due to the crisis circumstances of the pandemic, the real death toll was unknown. Bodies of those who had died at home, around 280 per day, were being picked up by the US Army, National Guard, and Air National Guard.[28]\nSome of the communities most affected by the pandemic included densely-populated neighborhoods in north-central Queens with high immigrant populations, including Corona, East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights. As of April 8[update], these communities, with a cumulative 600,000 residents, had recorded 7,260 COVID-19 cases.[29] On April 23, state officials said that based on preliminary results of an antibody testing survey, they estimated around 21% of city residents had contracted COVID-19, far more than the number of cases confirmed directly by virus testing.[30]\nMay 2020\nOn May 10, de Blasio said 38 children citywide were known to be affected by an inflammatory syndrome believed to be linked to an immune response to COVID-19.[31] Known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), this life-threatening condition resembles Kawasaki disease and other pediatric inflammatory conditions, such as toxic shock syndrome.[32] Symptoms include high fevers that can last for days, rash, racing heart beat, changes in skin color, redness of the tongue, and severe abdominal pain.[31] At least one child had died due to MIS-C in New York City, and two additional deaths to MIS-C were reported statewide. The link with COVID-19 has not yet been proven.[33] On May 19, Cuomo confirmed 137 cases of the illness statewide, stating it was \"the tip of the iceberg\" with 90% of the cases testing positive for the virus or antibodies.[34] By May 26, three deaths and 89 cases of MIS-C had been confirmed in the city, mostly affecting children and teenagers. Doctors reported that the risk of death or serious illness for MIS-C was mitigated by early detection. Hospitals were instructed to prioritize kids for testing.[35]\nA survey conducted May 5\u201312 and reported in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that 42% of 286 respondents residing in the New York City metropolitan area knew someone who had tested positive for COVID-19, and 23% knew someone who had died.[36]\nDuring May, active COVID-19 cases started to decline.[37] After the George Floyd protests in New York City started in late May, public officials expressed concern about the spread of COVID-19 via the crowded events.[38]\nJune 2020\nOn June 8, the city commenced the first phase of its reopening plan after meeting seven conditions of the stay-at-home order, which had been put in place three months earlier.[39] Business safety protocols were put in place to limit occupancy of confined spaces, like elevators, to one person at a time, and occupancy ceilings were reduced to under 50% of their usual capacity.[40] On June 24, New York state, along with New Jersey and Connecticut, began requiring travelers to self-quarantine for 14 days if traveling from an area with high infection rates.[41] On June 29, Patience and Fortitude, the lion statues outside the New York Public Library Main Branch, were masked as a symbol of the city's resilience.[42]\nJuly 2020\nHealth experts noted that the effectiveness of contact tracing in preventing resurgence would depend on careful monitoring of hospitalizations and targeted testing of high-risk populations to screen for asymptomatic carriers.[43] The city's COVID hospitalizations fell below 700, the lowest levels since mid-March, but more cases were reported in the age group between 21 and 30.[44]\nPlans to open indoor dining during the Phase 3 reopening were postponed due to the heightened risks posed by customers refusing to wear face masks and the uncertain role of air conditioning for COVID spread. Indoor dining in other states had resulted in superspreading at certain venues. To compensate in part, outdoor space was expanded by shutting down certain areas to create more space for outdoor dining.[45][46] Plans to reopen museums in Phase 4 were also postponed.[47]\nThe governor's office announced that malls would be allowed to reopen only after installation of antiviral air filtration systems, which was opposed by mall owners and their tenants.[48]\nIn late July, over 130 bars were cited for violations of COVID-related regulations. The governor warned that bars would be shut down again if compliance did not improve. At least 40 businesses lost their liquor licenses between March and August. Some restaurants reported difficulty controlling the crowds gathered outside, despite hiring security.[49]\nOn July 11, a seven-year-old German Shepherd named Buddy died of COVID-19. He tested positive back in mid-April when his owners noticed he was having trouble breathing. He was the first dog in the United States to test positive for COVID-19.[50][51]\nAugust 2020\nBy August 1, the total number of establishments who had their liquor licenses suspended for not following social distancing guidelines had risen to 52.[52] In mid-August, Cuomo announced that bowling alleys would be able to reopen on August 17, and museums and other cultural institutions on August 24, at reduced capacity.[53][54]\nSeptember 2020\nOn the nineteenth anniversary ceremony of the September 11 attacks at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, the reading of names of victims, usually by family members, was instead recorded in advance. Mask protocols and social distance measures were also in place. The Tunnels to Towers foundation held a simultaneous memorial nearby at Zuccotti Park where around 125 family members took part in reading names.[55]\nIn late September, parents of yeshiva students in Brooklyn were texted \"DO NOT test your child for Covid,\" advised not to report symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and told that it was \"up to parents\" to prevent the school from being closed.[56]\nOn September 25, 37 people tested positive for COVID-19 after a sweet sixteen party at the Miller Place Inn. The inn was fined $10,000 for violating COVID restrictions.[57]\nBy the end of September, de Blasio had ordered the police department to enforce public health guidelines in several Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods and conduct emergency inspections at private religious schools.[58] President Trump's views on masks were shared by most residents of these neighborhoods, who frequently refused to wear masks or follow the social distancing restrictions. The rate of infection in some predominantly Orthodox neighborhoods rose to six times higher than the rest of the city. City health officials said another lockdown might be needed, similar to the one imposed in Israel, which at the time had the highest per-capita rate of new cases of any country.[59]\nOctober 2020\nIn early October, the city was still in Phase 4 of reopening, which included museums, gardens, botanical gardens and gyms. Twenty ZIP Codes were identified as cluster areas, with an average 5.2% of positive tests, relatively high compared to the rest of New York State. These 20 ZIP Codes contained 26% of all positive cases in the state on October 2.[60] In response, the governor's office announced what they called \"direct enforcement\" of COVID-19 related restrictions in high-risk neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens. The mayor's office proposed closing businesses deemed \"non-essential\" and on-site dining. In-person schooling would have to shut down in nine ZIP Codes with 14-day positivity rates over 3%, while another eleven ZIP Codes were placed on a \"watch list\" because their positivity rates were 1\u20133%.[61][62] A twelfth ZIP Code was placed on the \"watch list\" on October 5, the same day that the governor's office rejected the mayor's plan to close non-essential businesses.[63][64]\nCommunity leaders from the Jewish communities in Queens, including the neighborhoods of Rego Park, Kew Gardens, and Kew Gardens Hills, expressed concerns that singling out neighborhoods and ZIP Codes was unfairly targeting the Jewish community.[65][66][67] Councilman Barry Grodenchik said that, \"One of the worst things is Jews being blamed for outbreaks and epidemics...slander is akin to murder.\" Councilwoman Karen Koslowitz said Kew Gardens and Rego Park are diverse neighborhoods and that it was unnecessary to single out Orthodox Jewish communities.[68]\nOn October 6, Governor Andrew Cuomo introduced a \"micro-cluster strategy.\" The new plan placed tighter restrictions in cluster areas with spikes in COVID-19 cases. The first areas to experience these new restrictions were parts of Brooklyn and Queens. On October 7, protesters opposing the micro-cluster strategy burned masks in the street and set a fire in Borough Park.[69][70][71] Clusters have been added and removed since October 6.\nThere were 779 hospitalizations on October 9, the highest number reported since July 15. Significant fines of up to $15,000 per day were put in place for mass gatherings, and up to $1,000 per day for violations of social distancing and mask-wearing rules. Over the first weekend under the new rules, the city issued over $150,000 in fines.[72]\nReligious communities protested the restrictions. A federal judge declined to grant an injunction requested by attorneys of a national Orthodox Jewish organization in a legal follow-up, set in motion to prevent restrictions on mass gatherings in houses of worship in red zones, ruling that the state had a compelling state interest to protect the \"health and life of all New Yorkers\" and that the restrictions were not motivated by any animus.[73][74] The United States Supreme Court declined to hear similar cases on appeal from two other states.[75]\nThe New York Sheriff's Office broke up a rave party with over 100 attendees in Queens on October 11. The organizers were charged with multiple criminal offenses, as well as violations of the park and health codes.[76]\nOn October 17, a wedding at North Fork Country Club with 91 guests resulted in at least 30 positive cases.[77] Suffolk County Executive Steven Bellone recommended the country club be fined $17,000 for having a non-essential gathering of more than 50 people. In Bellport, a birthday party with 50 attendees resulted in at least 26 positive cases.[77]\nNovember 2020\nOn November 10, Governor Cuomo stated that starting November 13 for the entirety of New York state, gatherings were to be limited to 10 people, and gyms, bars, and restaurants must close by 10 pm, with local municipalities handling enforcement responsibility. This came as the positivity rate in the city climbed back above 2.5%, levels not seen since early June, according to Mayor de Blasio.[78][79]\nPublic schools were closed indefinitely on November 19 after the rolling seven-day average reached 3%.[80] Despite calls from health experts to close indoor dining before it was too late \"to reverse the tide of new infections,\" the governor's office declined to impose restrictions until the statistical thresholds were met. The mayor's office took charge of closing schools only. Some epidemiologists and public health officials have criticized the decision to close schools, while allowing indoor dining to continue.[80] The school-closure policy was partly reversed less than two weeks later, with de Blasio announcing that elementary schools would resume in-person learning from December 7.[81][82] However, intermediate and high schools would remain closed through 2021.[83]\nBy late November, the governor's office was warning that the entire city was approaching the threshold for the \"orange zone\" designation that would close indoor dining, salons and gyms.[84]\nOn November 29, New York City police shut down an illegal bottle club with nearly 400 people in attendance. The four party organizers were arrested and charged with holding a mass gathering against health orders and not having a liquor license.[85]\nDecember 2020\nIn the first week of December, there was controversy when a Staten Island tavern, Mac's Public House, publicized its violation of restrictions on bars and restaurants. The bar continued to offer indoor dining despite Cuomo's \"orange zone\" prohibition, and continued to serve liquor after the New York State Liquor Authority had suspended its license.[86][87][88] After the New York City Sheriff's Office shut down Mac's on December 1 and arrested its owner,[89] several hundred people gathered to protest the shutdown.[86][87][90]\nAfter warning it was likely,[91] Governor Cuomo announced that indoor dining would be suspended again on December 14.[92]\nCOVID-19 vaccinations were authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration on December 11.[93] New York administered the vaccine first to health-care workers, and then to nursing-home residents starting December 21.[94]\nA video of 50 members and maskless dancers at a Republican Club party in Queens became widely publicized on December 21. At the time, gatherings of more than ten people were prohibited.[95]\nOn December 23, following concerns over a new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom, de Blasio issued an order for travelers from the UK to quarantine or otherwise face fines of $1,000.[96]\nOn December 27, New York State announced a criminal investigation into ParCare Community Health Network for \"fraudulently\" obtaining vaccine doses and administering them to persons who were not within the designated priority groups to receive the first doses of vaccine. ParCare is owned and operated by Hasidic business owner Gary Schlesinger. The clinic denied the allegations.[97][98]\nPublic health researchers estimated that 44 percent of metro New York residents had been infected by December 31, 2020, based on a combination of virus testing, antibody testing, fatality counts, and population mobility data.[99][100]\n2021\nJanuary 2021\nNew York State lowered its vaccine age from 75 to 65 on January 11, 2021.[101] As of January 25, 2021, 628,831 vaccines had been administered in New York City.[102]\nDuring the last week of the month, the city was averaging 5,000 new cases per day and around 60 deaths per day.[103]\nBrooklyn's Bensonhurst and Brighton Beach neighborhoods, Queens's South Ozone Park and Flushing neighborhoods, Staten Island's South Beach area, and Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood were the hardest hit areas at the time, with positive test results in the 10% range.[104]\nFebruary 2021\nIn February 2021, New York City expanded its vaccination Phase 1b to include restaurant workers (including delivery workers) and taxi drivers (including FHV drivers).[105][106]\nOn February 8, it was announced that public middle schools would reopen for in-person learning on February 25.[107]\nThe MTA announced that overnight subway service, suspended since May 2020, would be partially restored as long as hospitalization and infection rates continued to decrease. On February 14, the closing time for restaurants, bars, gyms and other establishments was extended to 11 p.m.[108]\nMarch 2021\nOn March 8, it was announced that public high schools would reopen for in-person learning on March 22.[109]\nThe \"cluster zone\" restrictions were lifted in late March. Indoor fitness classes resumed. Vaccine eligibility was expanded to New Yorkers over the age of 50. The first case of the Brazilian P.1 variant was confirmed.[110]\nApril 2021\nOn April 29, de Blasio announced that New York City would fully reopen on July 1.[111]\nMay 2021\nOn May 3, Cuomo announced that the overnight subway closures would end on May 17, 2021, with 24-hour service resuming on that date.[112][113]\nOn May 12, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority launched a five-day pilot project of walk-up COVID-19 vaccination sites in eight of its subway, Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road stations.[114] This pilot project was subsequently extended another week at Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal.[115][116] Over 11,000 people received the one-shot Janssen COVID-19 vaccine as part of the program.[117]\nJune 2021\nBy June, the city's overall testing positivity rate had reached its lowest since the pandemic began. Since the first vaccines arrived in December, over 8,408,000 doses were administered.[118] Governor Cuomo reopened the entirety of New York State on June 15, two weeks ahead of Mayor Bill de Blasio's planned July 1 reopening.[119]\nJuly 2021\nOn July 7, 2021, the city held a \"Hometown Heroes\" ticker tape parade to honor healthcare professionals and essential workers for their work during the pandemic.[120] The Uniformed Firefighters Association asked its members to boycott the event, however, saying that COVID-related risks to firefighters had not yet ended, citing the case of a union member who was in the ICU with COVID-related pneumonia at the time of the parade.[121] The Uniformed EMS Officers Union also asked its members not to attend the parade due to an ongoing dispute with the city over a lack of hazard pay during the pandemic.[122]\nOn July 23, 2021, the city's health department announced that daily average cases were 32% higher than the prior week and that the Delta variant had become the dominant COVID strain, accounting for 57% of citywide samples over a four-week period. Mayor Bill de Blasio responded to the new data by pleading with private employers to \"move immediately to some form of mandate\" for COVID-19 vaccination.[123]\nAugust 2021\nOn August 2, 2021, de Blasio recommended that vaccinated people wear masks in indoor settings, following CDC guidance and a continued uptick in positive COVID cases due to the Delta variant.[124] The next day, it was announced that masks would be required indoors beginning August 16.[125]\nOn August 3, de Blasio announced that New York City would become the first in the United States to require proof of vaccination for workers and customers at all indoor dining establishments, gyms, entertainment venues, and performances. As of August 16, patrons would be expected to show either their vaccination cards or one of two authorized vaccine passport apps: the city's NYC COVID Safe app or the state's Excelsior app.[126] The requirement will start to be enforced in September.[127]\nFollowing the announcement of the citywide vaccination requirement, the New York Young Republican Club began to organize an opposition movement. A march on Gracie Mansion took place on August 15, featuring speakers such as Curtis Sliwa, Guardian Angels founder and 2021 New York Republican mayoral candidate, and Andrew Giuliani, the eldest child of Rudy Giuliani and 2022 New York Republican gubernatorial candidate.[128]\nOn August 23, de Blasio said that all Department of Education employees\u2014including teachers, principals, and other staff\u2014must receive at least the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by September 27.[129]\nSeptember 2021\nOn September 10, three days prior to de Blasio's requirement that all of the city's municipal employees would need to report to full-time, in-person work, Comptroller Scott Stringer announced that his department would be defying the mayor's directive until at least October 12, citing the evolving situation in regard to the delta variant and the need to develop hybrid work options.[130][131] On the same day, several municipal unions sued the city over the mayor's tightened vaccination requirements for employees of the public school system, which had ended the option to opt out of the vaccination mandate through weekly coronavirus testing.[132]\nDuring the first week of the city's enforcement of the vaccine mandate, which started on September 13, it was found that 11 out of 15 restaurants investigated by Inside Edition, or just over 73% of the restaurants that producers visited, were still not enforcing the mandate for indoor dining.[133]\nIn mid-September, amid the first in-person return of foreign dignitaries during the pandemic, Mayor de Blasio informed the president-elect of the United Nations General Assembly that the UN General Assembly Hall qualified as a convention center and thus would be subject to the city's vaccine mandate. The Biden administration also expressed worries that the UNGA would become a \"superspreader event\" and Biden's UN Ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, urged diplomats to participate remotely. Jair Bolsonaro, the unvaccinated president of Brazil, announced that he would be attending the General Assembly in person, in defiance of the mandate, and the Russian Ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, criticized the mandate as \"discriminatory\" and in violation of U.S. agreements with the UN regarding the establishment of the New York headquarters in 1947. The Russian protest led UNGA president-elect Abdulla Shahid to announce that vaccination requirements would be based entirely on an honor system.[134]\nOctober 2021\nOn October 4, the vaccination requirement for all of New York City's public school teachers and staff went into full effect, with unvaccinated staff members being placed on unpaid leave and not allowed to report to work. Three days earlier, on October 1, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an emergency injunction to block the mandate's implementation, allowing the city to move forward with its plans to enforce compliance.[135]\nNovember 2021\nOn November 1, all New York City employees who had not received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccination would be put on unpaid leave. City officials announced that they had instituted a variety of contingency plans to deal with a shortage of first responders due to vaccine hesitancy.[136]\nDecember 2021\nOn December 2, the second reported U.S. case of the highly mutated Omicron variant was found in a Minnesota man who had recently returned from a trip to New York City to attend an anime convention at the Javits Center.[137] Governor Hochul urged attendees of the convention to get tested, while Mayor de Blasio remarked that the city had activated its contact tracing program to locate and make contact with people who had attended the event.[138]\nOn December 6, in response to a surge in cases and unknowns regarding the Omicron variant, New York City became the first American city to issue a general vaccine mandate for all private-sector employees, broadening a previous mandate for public-sector employees to cover all workers within the city's five boroughs. De Blasio announced that the expanded mandate would take effect on December 27, just days before Mayor-elect Eric Adams would take office on January 1, 2022.[139]\nOn December 19, de Blasio requested assistance from the Biden administration due to a rapid increase in Omicron cases throughout the city. He specifically asked the White House to invoke the Defense Production Act to produce greater numbers of at-home COVID tests as well as requesting greater access for monoclonal antibody treatments and FDA fast-tracking of Pfizer's antiviral pill.[140]\nOn December 23, COVID data released by the city showed that Manhattan's Greenwich Village neighborhood had some of the highest levels of infection in the United States over the preceding 7-day period, which, at nearly 3% test positivity, was 18 times higher than the percentage of residents testing positive in the other East Coast Omicron hotspot of Washington, D.C. during the same time frame.[141] Several days later, on December 26, the MTA announced that it would be reducing train service for several days, due to a high number of its employees falling ill or undergoing quarantine.[142]\n2022\nJanuary 2022\nDue to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant and its vaccine breakthrough potential, the New York City Department of Education modified its policy of randomly selecting 10% of unvaccinated students for weekly testing into a policy of testing all students twice per week when schools reopened after winter break on January 3. Instead of requiring entire classes to shift to remote learning after a positive case, however, all students in a class with a confirmed case would begin to receive rapid at-home tests, with asymptomatic students able to return the day after their first negative test.[143]\nFebruary 2022\nCity employees were given a final deadline of February 11 to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination or face termination. This cutoff date covered new employees who had not submitted proof of a second vaccination (if required as part of a series) and unvaccinated employees who had been placed on unpaid leave in November 2021 yet had not elected to continue receiving health benefits past June 2022.[144]\nFollowing the rejection of an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of a group of teachers, New York City commenced with the firing of 1,430 workers for noncompliance with the vaccine mandate.[145]\nMarch 2022\nMayor Eric Adams announced that March 7 would mark the end of vaccination requirements for indoor activities throughout the city, as well as the end of required masking in schools except for children under five years of age, who were not yet eligible for vaccination. The city's health commissioner, David Chokshi, unveiled a new color-coded system for the shift to 'living with COVID,' which would recommend the reintroduction of vaccine and masking mandates in the event of a future surge in cases.[146]\nOn March 24, Mayor Adams exempted athletes and performers from the city's vaccine mandate for private-sector employers, allowing prominent unvaccinated athletes, such as Kyrie Irving of the Brooklyn Nets, to once again play in home games.[147] A collection of union leaders and elected officials, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, criticized the move as creating a double standard for elite, celebrity New Yorkers.[148]\nDue to the BA.2 Omicron subvariant, the city's daily case average was up 43% at the end of March, compared to the average case count of the prior four weeks. Hospitalizations and deaths continued to decrease, however.[149]\nApril 2022\nFollowing the uptick of BA.2 cases, Mayor Adams decided to maintain the city's mask mandate for preschool children, who were not yet eligible for vaccination. Adams had previously planned to rescind the mask requirement in early April, yet it remained in place after the mayor prevailed in a legal challenge to the mandate.[150]\nThe NYC Health Department's \"Test & Trace Corps\" is slated to conclude its universal contact tracing mandate on April 30. The program, which started in June 2020, after the first COVID-19 surge, had funding allocated for the entirety of the 2022 fiscal year and would continue to contact \"known positives\", conduct limited tracing efforts, and perform other COVID-related public health services, such as the distribution of at-home tests.[151][152]\nOn Sunday, April 10, Mayor Adams tested positive for COVID-19 after a PCR test. Adams, who was exhibiting minor symptoms, cancelled all of his public events for the following week and began taking newly available antiviral medications, which he recommended to other COVID-positive New Yorkers. He had previously attended the Gridiron Club Dinner superspreader event in Washington, D.C. on April 2.[153] Adams commanded the city's response to the April 12 subway attack remotely, while quarantining at his mayoral residence of Gracie Mansion.[154]\nMay 2022\nOn May 2, New York City entered the medium risk level (yellow), moving beyond the low risk (green) level for the first time since the new color-coded risk system was unveiled by the city in March 2022. The new risk system was based on revised CDC risk guidelines and suggested various actions that the city and its residents could choose to take in response to an uptick in cases as reopening continued.[155] The city's risk level was further upgraded to high risk level (orange) on May 17; indoor mask usage was suggested but not mandated.[156]\nJune 2022\nIn June, Mayor Adams announced that, since the city was past its most recent surge in COVID cases, masking for children ages 2\u20134 would no longer be compulsory within the public school system as of June 13.[157] Vaccines for children under 5 years of age would not be available until June 21.[158]\nJuly 2022\nAmid hospitalizations, yet not deaths, reaching 4-month highs in the city, Mayor Adams scrapped the color-coded risk system, saying that he would not use an \"old weapon\" to fight \"new wars\" against highly contagious subvariants, and that the city would role out a new alert system in the weeks to follow.[159][160] By July 8, city officials recommended that all New Yorkers wear highly protective N95, KN95 or KF94 masks in all indoor settings and in crowded areas outside.[161]\nAugust 2022\nThe August 2022 conversion of city-run COVID-19 vaccination sites for children under 5 into Monkeypox vaccination centers drew condemnation from some parents and local politicians for taking place just weeks before the new school year. At the time, toddlers had only been eligible for vaccination for less than two months.[162]\nSeptember 2022\nOn September 7, 2022, following Governor Hochul's decision to end the statewide transit mask mandate due to Omicron-specific boosters and stabilizing infection rates, the MTA revised its guidelines to say that masks were \"encouraged but optional\" throughout the system.[163] Mask mandates were left in place for all healthcare settings and adult care facilities in the city and throughout New York State.[164]\nA report by Partnership for New York City surveyed more than 160 major Manhattan office employers in late August and early September 2022 and found that 49 percent of office workers are currently at the workplace on an average weekday, up from just 38 percent in April. The study also found that 9 percent of employees are in the office five days a week.[165]\nOctober 2022\nJustice Ralph Porzio of Staten Island's supreme court ruled on October 24, 2022, that a group of municipal employees fired for noncompliance with the city's municipal worker vaccine mandate should be reinstated with back pay. The city appealed his ruling the next day, on October 25, thus maintaining the municipal worker vaccine mandate.[166]\nNovember 2022\nThe most strict provisions of the New York's vaccine mandate, requiring vaccination for private-sector employees and for \"high risk\" after-school activities, were ended with unanimous approval by New York City health leaders on November 1, 2022.[167] The rollback of public health measures for schoolchildren also came amid the backdrop of the 2022 pediatric care crisis.[168]\nDecember 2022\nOn December 2, 2022, Chanette Lewis of Brooklyn pleaded guilty to defrauding New York City by offering to sell hotel rooms that were intended for free use in the city's pandemic isolation program. While working at a call center for the program in 2020 and 2021, she stole the identities of healthcare workers and sold the data to co-conspirators who would, in turn, resell the rooms to ineligible individuals.[169][170]\nThe Pandemic Response Lab, which processed 10 million COVID-19 tests for New Yorkers and tracked the development and spread of COVID variants in the city during the pandemic, announced that it would close at the end of December.[171] The closure came amid a rising tide of COVID-19, flu, and RSV cases in the city and a renewed suggestion of indoor masking by municipal public health authorities.[172]\n2023\nJanuary 2023\nAs of January 6, 2023, over one third of New York City neighborhoods had COVID-19 positivity rates in excess of 20% and four out of five neighborhoods exceeded 15%, largely due to the highly infectious XBB.1.5 variant. This particular variant accounted for 80.8% of the city's cases, compared to the projected U.S. prevalence of 61%.[173]\nFebruary 2023\nIn early February, Mayor Adams announced that February 10, 2023 would mark the end of New York City's vaccine mandate for city workers, due to 96 percent of city workers having received their primary COVID-19 vaccination series. On the same date, city schools would also no longer require visitors to provide proof of vaccination to enter school buildings.[174] On February 10, the city also sunsetted its text-based COVID-19 notification service, imploring New Yorkers to \"stay safe\" in a final text marking the end of the program.[175]\nAt the same time that the city began to end pandemic-era programs and policies, Mayor Adams confronted a more long-lasting shift in attitudes toward remote work, leading to a U-turn in his remote work policy that originally favored a full-scale return to in-person work one year prior, in February 2022. Instead, after the city struggled to fill job vacancies due to a refusal to allow remote or hybrid work, Adams announced, on February 14, that he had tasked city agencies with discovering \"creative ways of having flexibility.\"[176]\nMarch 2023\nOn March 1, 2023, three years after the New York City's first recorded case, the city reached a settlement in a lawsuit filed by four FDNY EMS personnel who had alleged violation of their federal free speech and due process rights for their persecution after speaking out to reporters about harsh work conditions and an overall lack of protective equipment early in the pandemic. Each were awarded $29,999 in damages.[177]\nJune 2023\nAs of late May and early June, each of the city's 14 wastewater treatment plants showed high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2. City officials acknowledged the uptick but noted that it was too early to say if the data indicated a new wave of infections. There was not, however, a concurrent rise in the number of confirmed cases, due to rollbacks in funding and data reporting requirements associated with the end of the national public health emergency in early May.[178]\nAugust 2023\nMid-August data from the city's health department confirmed a summer wave in New York City, with the seven-day average of total cases reaching 672 on August 14 in the city, compared to 289 on May 16. Hospitalizations and deaths remained relatively low at the time and the surge of cases appeared to be less severe than the previous two summers.[179]\nReferences",

The state of New York has been one of the hardest hit U.S. states by the COVID-19 pandemic.

This metric has \u201cshown 99% concordance\u201d with community levels, according to the CDPH.\nAs of Oct. 7, there were 321 hospitalized patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 statewide, a change of -58.3% from two weeks ago.\nIntensive care and other hospitalized patients\nHospitalizations by county\nTo keep tabs on available beds, officials watch out for rapid increases in the number of infected patients.\nRecent deaths\nSince the start of the pandemic, 109,763 Californians have died of COVID-19. In the last 90 days, 1,168 state residents have died.\nThe number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the last 22 days is incomplete due to the time it takes to process death certificates. Earlier dates\u2019 totals will be updated as new information is released.\nSeven-day average\nStatewide vaccinations\nAbout 72.8% of Californians have completed a primary series of a COVID-19 vaccine from Moderna, Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson.\nThe CDPH and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend everyone who is eligible get an updated booster to increase immunity against new variants of the virus. As of Nov. 13, 9.9% of residents are up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations.\nIn June, CDPH changed the way it tracks booster data. Instead of separately counting people receiving the primary series, booster and updated booster, the agency now counts those who are \u201cup-to-date\u201d with their vaccinations. This figure is calculated out of the total population rather than the booster-eligible population.\nVaccinations by county\nLiving with COVID-19\nLiving with COVID-19\n\n\n\nGeneral\nWhat to do if you get COVID now\n\n\n\nVaccines\nCOVID vaccines and drugs\n\n\n\nTesting\nHow to stock up on COVID tests\n\n\n\nLong COVID\nSymptoms linger even after mild cases\n\n\n\nGeneral\nHow COVID will change American life\n\n\n\nGeneral\nCOVID-19 Q&A\n\n\nLatest coronavirus stories\nOpinion: Don't be stupid: Skipping your COVID booster could reduce your IQCalifornia's COVID surge is finally over.

      "Page 1 of 8 Brandon Johnson, Mayor May 31, 2024 Olusimbo Ige, MD, MS, MPH, Commissioner This report summarizes key respiratory virus surveillance indicators. The indicators are compiled from laboratory-based data as well emergency department visit data. This report is meant to provide more context for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as co-circulation of respiratory viruses increases. More detailed information on influenza and COVID-19 activity can be found on their respective online dashboards. All data are preliminary and may change as additional reports are received. Weekly Surveillance Key Points During the summer, an abbreviated report will be published with the full report to resume in the fall. A summary describing the 2023-2024 influenza season in Chicago is at the end of this report. COVID-19: \u2022 The proportion of emergency department visits attributed to COVID-19 diagnoses is <1%. \u2022 The test positivity for SARS-CoV-2 has decreased from 3.8% to 2.5%. Influenza: \u2022 The risk of influenza infection remains low; the percent of specimens testing positive for influenza is <1%. \u2022 The proportion of emergency department visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) and the proportion of outpatient visits for ILI are below local thresholds. \u2022 For situational awareness of the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza see, H5N1 Bird Flu: Current Situation Summary. Other Respiratory Viruses: \u2022 The percent of emergency department visits in children <5 years old due to RSV remains at <1%. \u2022 The test positivity for RSV remains at <1%. \u2022 The test positivity for parainfluenza has decreased from 4.6% to 2.9%. \u2022 The test positivity for rhinovirus/enterovirus has decreased from 17.3% to 12.9%. \u2022 The test positivity for adenovirus has decreased from 2.9% to <1%. \u2022 The test positivity for human metapneumovirus remains at 4.6%. Respiratory Virus Laboratory Surveillance - Current Week and Cumulative The table below includes respiratory viral PCR tests performed by several hospital laboratories in Chicago as well as two commercial laboratories serving Chicago facilities. Reporting facilities represent nearly half of all acute care hospitals in the city. Data reported include Chicago and non-Chicago residents. Chicago Respiratory Virus Weekly Surveillance Report Surveillance Week 21 (May 19, 2024 - May 25, 2024) Week Ending May 25, 2024 Since October 1, 2023 Respiratory Pathogen # Tested % Positive # Tested % Positive Influenza* 2,452 0.9 173,748 6.4 RSV* 1,319 0.7 115,868 4.8 SARS-CoV-2* 1,162 2.8 127,280 6.8 Parainfluenza 1,469 2.9 62,806 1.8 Rhinovirus/Enterovirus 567 12.9 35,767 13.1 Adenovirus 567 0.9 35,755 3.4 Human Metapneumovirus 569 4.6 35,996 2.7 Seasonal Coronaviruses\u2020 1,467 0.5 62,588 2.0 *Represents both dualplex and multiplex PCR data. All other data represents only multiplex panels that include the specified pathogens;\u2020 Four seasonal coronavirus strains include 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. Page 2 of 8 Respiratory Virus Laboratory Surveillance - Seasonal Trends These graphs show seasonal trends of selected respiratory virus testing data presented in the previous table. Typical seasonal periods when activity tends to increase for influenza and RSV are indicated by shaded areas. Elevated test positivity outside of typical seasonal periods suggests atypical activity, and increased clinician awareness and testing may be warranted. Yearly data can also be used to compare the timing and intensity of viral activity, although changes in testing patterns also influence yearly trends, and data should be interpreted in the context of other surveillance indicators. Emergency Department Illness Surveillance In Illinois, all 185 acute-care hospitals report emergency department visit data in near-real time to the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). By tracking symptoms (or chief complaints) of patients in emergency departments, public health can promptly detect unusual levels of illness to determine whether a response is warranted. A map of influenza-like illness (ILI) activity levels by patient zip code determined by the emergency department chief complaint data can be found on the influenza dashboard. Percent of emergency department visits attributed to influenza-like illness (ILI) for residents of Chicago zip codes based on chief complaint data. Page 3 of 8 Percent of emergency department visits attributed to COVID-19 diagnoses for residents of Chicago zip codes based on chief complaint data. Percent of emergency department visits attributed to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) diagnoses for residents of Chicago zip codes based on chief complaint data. Seasonal trends are displayed for children younger than 5 years old who are most impacted by RSV. Weekly Pediatric Admissions Emergency department visit data includes information on whether the visit resulted in a hospital admission at any time during the course of the clinical encounter. The syndromes or disease associated with the hospitalization are based on chief complaint and discharge diagnosis codes and no not necessarily represent lab-confirmed cases. The chart below represents hospital admissions among children <18 years-old at Chicago hospitals due to acute respiratory illnesses. Page 4 of 8 National and State Respiratory Virus Surveillance The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s FluView report provides national updates and trends relat-ed to influenza activity across the United States, and the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) is a voluntary laboratory-based system that monitors temporal and geographic circulation patterns of several respiratory viruses in the U.S. The Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Hospitalization Sur-veillance Network (RSV-NET) is a CDC population-based surveillance system that collects data on severe RSV hospitalizations, including those resulting in ICU admission or death, among children and adults. The Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) comprises three platforms that conduct population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations associated with COVID-19, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) among children and adults. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVID Data Tracker Weekly Review. The Illinois and Suburban Cook County influ-enza surveillance reports are also available online. Current and archived issues of the Chicago Influenza and Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report can be found on the CDPH website section Current Flu Situation in Chi-cago. Page 5 of 8 This report summarizes key influenza surveillance indicators for the 2023-2024 season. The indicators are compiled from influenza ICU hospitalizations, laboratory-based data as well emergency department and outpatient visits data. More de-tailed information on influenza and COVID-19 activity can be found on their respective online dashboards. All data are pre-liminary and may change as additional reports are received. Overall, the 2023-2024 season had moderate influenza activity similar to other pre-pandemic seasons and no influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported. This season saw two distinct peaks of activity with the second peak associated mainly with influenza B. Influenza-Associated ICU Hospitalizations - In Illinois, influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations are reportable as soon as possible but within 24 hours. The graph below shows the weekly number of reported ICU hospitalizations for Chi-cago residents. There were 298 influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations reported during the 2023-2024 season. Excluding the two pan-demic seasons (2020-21 and 2021-22), this is higher than last season and the fourth highest number of ICU hospitaliza-tions reported in the last nine seasons. The peak number of reported hospitalizations (34) occurred in December with less than half (43%) of cases reported by December 30, 2023 compared to last season where over 90% were reported by the end of December. Excluding the two pandemic seasons, the overall cumulative rate of influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations landed in the middle of the previous nine influenza seasons; the cumulative rate was lower than three seasons (2017-18 to 2019-20) and higher than three seasons (2015-16, 2016-17, 2022-23). Rates began to increase in late December and continued to increase until mid-March and leveling off by April 2024. Chicago 2023-2024 Influenza Season Surveillance Summary Brandon Johnson, Mayor May 31, 2024 Olusimbo Ige, MD, MS, MPH, Commissioner Page 6 of 8 For the 2023-2024 season, the highest cumulative ICU hospitalization rates were among those 50-64 and 65+ years of age. Among pediatric cases, those 0-4 years had higher rates than school-aged children 5-17 years. The lowest rates were among those 18-49 years. This is consistent with national trends of cumulative rates of influenza hospitalization. Influenza Virus Laboratory Surveillance The chart below includes data on influenza viral PCR tests performed by sev-eral hospital laboratories in Chicago as well as two commercial laboratories serving Chicago facilities. Reporting facilities represent nearly half of all acute care hospitals in the city. Data reported include Chicago and non-Chicago residents. Overall influenza laboratory percent positivity was 6.5% for the season peaking at 14.5% at the end of December 2023. Excluding the two pandemic seasons, this is the lowest overall percent positivity during the past nine seasons; however the number of influenza tests performed and reported was higher than any prior season. For the 2023-2024 season, 72% of positive specimens were influenza A with the majority not subtyped. Among those subtyped, 61% were A(H1N1)pdm09. Since early March, influenza B accounted for the majority of positive specimens. Page 7 of 8 Influenza-like Illness (ILI) Surveillance Two data sources are utilized to conduct syndromic surveillance for influenza-like illness, emergency department visit data and outpatient visit data (ILINet). In Illinois, all 185 acute-care hospitals re-port emergency department visit data in near-real time to the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). For ILINet, sever-al outpatient clinics throughout Chicago report on a weekly basis the total number of outpatient clinic visits, and of those visits, the number with ILI. The graphs below show the percent of emergency department and outpatient visits attributed to ILI by week for the 2015-2016 - 2023-2024 seasons. \u2022 The proportion of emergency department visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) was 2.2% for the season. This is con-sistent with the previous eight-season average of 2.4%. The peak (4.1%) occurred in December with 47% of visits due to ILI reported by December 30, 2023; 95% were reported by early May. \u2022 The proportion of outpatient visits for ILI was 1.3% for the season. This is lower than the previous eight-season aver-age of 2.7%. The peak (2.5%) occurred in November with 49% of visits due to ILI reported by December 30, 2023; 95% were reported by early May. Influenza Outbreaks in Congregate Settings - In Illinois, outbreaks of influenza or ILI in a congregate setting are re-portable as soon as possible but within 24 hours. The graph below shows the number of reported influenza outbreaks in congregate settings in Chicago for the 2013-2014 to 2023-2024 seasons. \u2022 There were 15 influenza outbreaks in congregate settings reported this season with a total of 45 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases; this is almost double the number of reported outbreaks from last season. The highest number of reported outbreaks occurred in 2017-2018 with 22 outbreaks reported.",

      "What to Know About the Updated 2024-2025 COVID Vaccines > News > Yale Medicine\nSkip to Main Content\n1-877-YALEMDS\nSearch for\nSpecialistsFact SheetsDepartmentsClinical TrialsNewsPatient ToolsFor Medical Professionals\n\n1-877-YALEMDS\nFamily Health\nWhat to Know About the Updated 2024-2025 COVID Vaccines\n\n\n\n\nBY KATHY KATELLA August 27, 2024\nThe updated shots aim to protect against Omicron subvariant KP.2.\nNote: Information in this article was accurate at the time of original publication. Because information about COVID-19 changes rapidly, we encourage you to visit the websites of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and your state and local government for the latest information.\nAs a summer marked by yet another COVID-19 surge draws to a close, newly updated COVID vaccines are becoming available for the fall and winter months, a time of year when respiratory illnesses can overwhelm hospitals.\nThe new shots target a SARS-CoV-2 strain called KP.2, and they are expected to provide protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death related to COVID.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older get one of the updated vaccines. Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s updated mRNA vaccines are fully approved for everyone ages 12 and older, and each has a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) for infants and children ages 6 months through 11 years.\nThe FDA has yet to approve an updated COVID vaccine from Novavax that would target another strain\u2014JN.1. The previous Novavax COVID Vaccine remains authorized but is no longer available in the United States, since all doses have expired.\nThe new vaccines come at a time when a collection of closely related SARS-CoV-2 strains are circulating in the United States. All of them are descendants of the Omicron strain. JN.1 was the dominant strain in May but was surpassed in June by a collection of other Omicron virus strains, including KP.2. (By late August, KP.2 and JN.1 only accounted for a minimal number of cases, but the new vaccines are expected to protect against new related variants.)\nScott Roberts, MD, a Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist, recommends the updated vaccines as the best way to protect against COVID infection and severe outcomes, including hospitalization and death. \u201cCOVID will never go away, and I am certain we are going to see an increase in cases in our communities this winter,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to see patients get admitted to the hospital with COVID, the majority of whom are unvaccinated.\u201d\nBelow, Dr. Roberts answers questions about this fall\u2019s updated COVID vaccines.\nHow is the updated 2024-2025 COVID vaccine different from previous shots?\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, continues to mutate and spawn new strains, so it\u2019s important to keep up with vaccinations that match the strain that is circulating as closely as possible, says Dr. Roberts. This is why new COVID shots are called \u201cupdated\u201d vaccines as opposed to \u201cboosters\u201d\u2014they are expected to be updated annually; boosters, by comparison, are additional doses of the same\u2014or previous\u2014formula taken to \u201cboost\u201d immunity.\nThe COVID vaccine updated in 2023 was aimed at XBB.1.5, an Omicron subvariant that had been the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the U.S. and the world at that time.\nHow will the updated COVID shots protect me?\nThe shots aren\u2019t meant to prevent every SARS-CoV-2 infection; rather, the aim is to protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. They also restore and enhance protection from previous shots, which has declined over time.\nAvoiding serious illness continues to be a major concern, because even though COVID infections have declined dramatically since the beginning of the pandemic, there have been periods of upticks in hospitalizations. In 2023, for instance, more than 916,300 people were hospitalized in the U.S. due to COVID, and more than 75,500 people died from it. What\u2019s more, most people who were hospitalized had not received last year\u2019s updated shot, according to CDC data.\nStudies have shown that people who are 50 or older are more likely to get very sick than younger people\u2014and those 65 and older have a higher than average risk for hospitalization and death due to COVID. Severe disease is also a higher risk for anyone who has a compromised immune system or a chronic medical condition, such as diabetes or heart disease. But some young, healthy people have developed severe illness from COVID as well.\nIn addition, vaccination reduces the chance of suffering the effects of Long COVID, according to the CDC. Long COVID refers to the wide range of symptoms and conditions, which may last for weeks, months, or even years, that some people experience four or more weeks after an initial COVID infection.\nWill the updated vaccines work if new variants emerge?\nNew strains have emerged already\u2014in August, KP.3.1.1 became the dominant strain, accounting for 36.8% of cases, according to the CDC\u2019s Nowcast, which provides model-based early estimates. It has surpassed KP.3 (which overtook KP.2 earlier this summer). But Dr. Roberts expects the new shots will continue to help protect against severe illness even if the virus mutates and additional strains appear.\n\u201cObviously, the more closely the strain and the vaccine match, the better,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if there is a significant change that makes a new strain very different, I would still expect the planned vaccine to work.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, for the new 2024-2025 shots, the FDA changed course from advising pharmaceutical companies in early June to focus on an updated vaccine aimed at the JN.1 variant to, later that month, recommending one aimed at the KP.2 variant, which had recently been gaining ground.\nDr. Roberts also points to the monovalent vaccine introduced for the fall and winter of 2023, which targeted the XBB.1.5 strain. After the rollout of that updated vaccine, JN.1 surfaced with more than 30 new mutations, he explains. \u201cMany of us were nervous that the vaccine would not work on JN.1. However, in spite of the large genetic distance between the two strains, the vaccine still elicited neutralizing antibodies against JN.1, and it was effective,\u201d Dr. Roberts says.\nHow safe are the updated COVID vaccines?\nThe COVID vaccines remain safe and effective, according to the CDC, which notes that hundreds of millions of people have gotten the shots at this point and that the COVID vaccines have received the most intense safety monitoring in U.S. history.\nOne concern has been myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart). In rare cases, these conditions have been observed after vaccination, mostly in adolescent and young adult males. But research has shown that cardiac complications, including myocarditis, were significantly higher after a COVID infection than vaccination for both males and females in all age groups.\n\u201cAll vaccines have side effects. The important thing is to weigh the benefits of vaccination against the risk of side effects\u2014and to do so from an individual and a population level,\u201d Dr. Roberts says. \u201cIn most cases, especially with the COVID vaccine, the benefits of the protection against COVID continue to outweigh the risk of side effects from the vaccine.\u201d\nAnyone can report an adverse event related to a COVID vaccine on the government Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) site.\nCan I get shots for COVID, flu, and RSV (if eligible) during the same visit?\nIt is safe to get COVID and flu shots at the same time, according to the CDC.\nSeptember and October remain the best times for most people to get a flu shot, and vaccination continues to be recommended while the flu virus circulates, typically from October through May.\nThere still isn\u2019t data to say for sure whether combining a COVID shot with a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) shot is the best strategy. RSV is an illness that causes mild cold symptoms in most people, but can lead to hospitalization and death in older people and babies. RSV vaccines were brand new in 2023 for older adults, and are recommended for anyone 75 and older or those 60 and older who are at high risk of severe RSV disease. A new RSV vaccine also became available last year for pregnant women (who can pass the antibodies along to their newborns).\nWho should get the updated COVID vaccine?\nThe CDC recommends that everyone get one of the updated 2024-2025 vaccines, especially if they have never received a COVID vaccine, are 65 or older, are at high risk for severe COVID, are living in a long-term care facility, or are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant, or might become pregnant in the future. (While one shot is highly recommended for people 65 and older, a second shot is NOT currently recommended for people in this age group unless they are moderately or severely immunocompromised.)\nIf you had COVID recently, the CDC advises waiting three months after you recover before getting another shot.\nAccording to the CDC, the vaccines are covered by insurance, including private insurance, Medicare plans, and Medicaid plans. Uninsured children also have access through the Vaccine for Children Program.\nWhere can I get the updated 2024-2025 COVID vaccine?\nTo find a location near you that carries the vaccine and to schedule an appointment, go to Vaccines.gov. You can also call 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489). Be aware that current distribution and insurance issues may delay the availability of the vaccines temporarily in some places.\nInformation provided in Yale Medicine articles is for general informational purposes only.

Vaccination is expected to play a key role in preventing hospitalizations. CDC will update this outlook every two months throughout the season, and as warranted by substantial changes in the spread of any of the three diseases.\nOverview\nCDC expects the fall and winter respiratory disease season will likely have a similar or lower number of combined peak hospitalizations due to COVID-19, influenza, and RSV compared to last season. This assessment has not changed since CDC's outlook was initially published on August 29.\nAs of October 11, overall respiratory virus activity is low nationally. The Respiratory Illnesses Data Channel has weekly updates about current surveillance of respiratory illness.\n\n\nCOVID-19: COVID-19 activity is declining in most areas. COVID-19-associated ED visits and hospitalizations are decreasing overall. Laboratory percent positivity is 7.7%. Epidemic trend estimates indicate that COVID-19 infections are declining or likely declining in much of the country, as of October 8.\n\n\nInfluenza: Nationally, seasonal influenza activity remains low. As of October 8, epidemic trend estimates indicate that influenza infections are growing or likely growing in 10 states, declining or likely declining in 9 states, and not changing in 18 states.\n\n\nRSV: Nationally, RSV activity remains low. However, signs of increased RSV activity have been detected in the southeastern United States, including Florida, particularly in young children.\n\n\nThis outlook is intended to provide decision-makers with information to assist in public health preparedness during the 2024-2025 fall and winter respiratory virus season, such as when hospitals might prepare for the highest demand.\nOur assessments are based on expert opinion, current and historical surveillance data, and scenario modeling for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV. As with all long-range scenarios, there is inherent uncertainty, which we describe below.\nRole of vaccination\nCOVID-19\nIn our initial outlook, published on August 29, we outlined two potential scenarios for COVID-19 hospitalization burden to demonstrate the range of possibilities for how the season could unfold. While we lack comprehensive hospitalization data for the U.S. summer months because mandatory reporting does not resume until November, other surveillance data suggest these two scenarios (Scenarios A and B) still reflect useful bounds for the coming season. According to data from the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), the summer wave peaked in the week ending August 10, with an estimated 4.8 hospitalizations per 100,000. As a result, population immunity may be lower than it would be had the summer wave of infection continued to increase or if it peaked at a higher rate. We therefore expect the upcoming season to be more similar to Scenario A, with a winter peak that is higher than the preceding summer/fall peak, similar to COVID-19 trends over the last four years. This scenario model assumes variants will emerge this winter with similar severity and transmissibility to variants that drove last winter's peak, and the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine will have similar effectiveness as last year's vaccine.\nRegardless of the exact trajectory, vaccination is expected to play a critical role in preventing hospitalizations due to COVID-19 this season. As of October 5, 11.2% of adults 18 years or older have received the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine, and this percentage is expected to increase as the season progresses. To understand the potential impact of vaccinations, we used scenario modeling to compare scenarios for high and baseline vaccine uptake. For our baseline vaccination scenario, we used data from the first week of collection of the National Immunization Survey. As of September 7, 23.9% of adults 18 years or older report that they \"definitely will\" receive a vaccine this yearA\u2014down from 28.2% during the first week of collection last season (September 30, 2023B), a 15% relative reduction. Prior modeling indicates that vaccine sentiment at the beginning of the season may be predictive of end-of season vaccine uptake.C\nResults indicate that if there is a similar 15% reduction in uptake relative to last year, approximately 77,000 to 98,000 hospitalizations would be averted, assuming a 50% and 75% vaccine efficacy against hospitalization, respectively. However, in our high vaccination scenario where uptake is double that of last seasonD\u2014still lower than overall uptake for the influenza vaccine\u2014approximately 179,000 to 227,000 hospitalizations would be averted, assuming a 50% and 75% vaccine efficacy against hospitalization, respectively. For more details on scenario modeling, see our Behind the Model. The COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub's latest results showed similar potential impact of vaccination on preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations.\nVaccination coverage and sentiment vary by jurisdiction, age, race and ethnicity, poverty status, health insurance and other social and demographic factors. In addition to protecting vaccinated individuals, maternal vaccination can help protect infants who are not age-eligible for vaccination, but still experience high rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization.\nInfluenza\nVaccination is expected to play a key role in preventing influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations and deaths due to influenza this season. Recent modeling by the Influenza Scenario Modeling Hub indicates that a 20% increase in influenza vaccination compared to last season could lead to a 9\u201311% reduction in hospitalizations due to influenza this season. During the 2023-2024 influenza season, CDC estimates that influenza vaccination prevented between 105,000 and 240,000 hospitalizations. A recent study in five South American countries during the 2024 Southern Hemisphere influenza season found that the 2024 Southern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine reduced the risk for influenza-associated hospitalization among high-risk groups by 35%.\nWhile we expect influenza vaccination rates to increase as the season progresses, 19.6% of adults 18 years or older have received the 2024-25 seasonal influenza vaccine, as of October 5, up from 16.6% of adults 18 years or older who received the 2023-2024 seasonal influenza vaccine as of October 7, 2023. As of October 5, 27.5% of adults 18 years or older report that they will \"definitely\" receive a vaccine this year. Vaccination coverage and sentiment vary by jurisdiction, age, race and ethnicity, poverty status, health insurance and other social and demographic factors.\nRSV\nImmunization is expected to play a key role in preventing hospitalizations due to RSV among infants and older adults this season. As of October 5, 36.9% of adults 75 years or older have ever received the RSV vaccine since it was first available last season, while an additional 13.9% indicate that they definitely will receive the RSV vaccine this year. Vaccination coverage and sentiment vary by jurisdiction, age, race and ethnicity, poverty status, health insurance and other social and demographic factors.\nDespite last year being the first year for RSV immunization products, more than half of eligible infants were protected against RSV by maternal vaccination or receipt of the RSV antibody nirsevimab, according to a CDC survey. Early estimates of nirsevimab effectiveness indicated that nirsevimab was 90% effective against RSV-associated hospitalization in infants. As of September 2024, among females with an infant born since April 1, 52.7% reported that they will definitely get nirsevimab for their infant.\nFactors, Key Uncertainties, & Methods\nFactors that could lead to higher peak hospitalization rate\nWhile we expect this season's peak hospitalization rate will be similar to or lower than last year, there is still a risk of a higher peak rate, underscoring the need to consider this possibility in planning and preparedness activities. The following factors could drive higher peak rate:\n\n\nEmergence of a new COVID-19 variant with an increased ability to evade the body's prior immunity, or a new COVID-19 variant associated with higher clinical severity.\n\n\nPredominance of an influenza subtype with more severe outcomes.\n\n\nLower vaccine uptake or effectiveness, including:\n\n\nIf there is lower than projected uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine, influenza seasonal vaccine, or RSV vaccines and immunizations.\n\n\nIf the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization is lower than that of the 2023-2024 vaccine.\n\n\nIf influenza seasonal vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization is lower than projected.\n\n\n\n\nKey Uncertainties\nThis outlook is a high-level assessment intended to provide scenarios for how the 2024-2025 respiratory season could unfold; it is not a precise forecast. We have noted several areas of uncertainty for specific diseases in sections above, including related to vaccination and circulating viral variants and subtypes. Additional uncertainties include the following:\n\n\nIt is difficult to predict the size and timing of peak activity for each disease, as well as how the timing might overlap. Experts agree that some level of overlap in peak hospitalization burden may occur. These factors will affect the level of demand on the healthcare system. We note that while peak hospitalization rate is a key factor, cumulative burden can also impact hospital demand throughout the season.\n\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is constantly changing, and a new variant could emerge that is less effectively mitigated by immunity from past infections or from existing vaccines and treatments. COVID-19 occurs at meaningful levels throughout the year with periodic epidemics, which can vary in timing and magnitude.\n\n\nAvian influenza A (H5N1) is widespread in wild birds globally and is causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows, with several recent human cases in U.S. dairy and poultry workers. The current risk to the general public posed by the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus presently spreading in cows, poultry, and other mammals remains low.\n\n\nParticularly for RSV, estimates are less precise for the burden of illnesses and hospitalizations in past seasons which limits our ability to anticipate trends for this respiratory season.

It is widespread in many parts of the world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia. Measles begins with a fever that lasts for a couple of days, followed by a cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis (pink eye), and a rash. The rash typically appears first on the face, along the hairline, and behind the ears and then affects the rest of the body. Infected people are usually contagious from about 4 days before their rash starts to 4 days afterwards.  \n\u2022\u00a0Who\u2019s at Risk, How it Spreads, and More\n\u2022 Images | Real-life Stories\n\u2022 Immunization Recommendations \nMeasles Activity in California 202\u200b4 \u2013 As of November\u00a09, 2024\nAs of November 9, 2024, 14 confirmed measles cases have been reported in California.

Measles cases increased by 79 percent in 2023, the World Health Organization reported. The year before, the disease killed an estimated 130,000 people, mostly children, according to the World Health Organization.\n\u201cMeasles is a huge concern and directly related to declining measles vaccination rates,\u201d said Priya Soni, MD, a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Cedars-Sinai Guerin Children\u2019s. \u201cVaccine hesitancy, fueled during the pandemic by the anti-vaccine movement, has affected vaccination rates nationwide. In addition, because children were quarantined during the pandemic, many missed out on well-child visits and didn\u2019t catch up on their vaccines. That has meant 61 million fewer doses distributed nationwide between 2020 and 2022.\u201d\nFind out what's happening in Orange Countywith free, real-time updates from Patch.\nWith five months left to go in the year, 26 states and the District of Columbia have reported 188 cases of measles, about half of which (49 percent, or 93) were severe enough to require hospitalization, mostly among people under the age of 5. \nLast year, the nation saw 58 measles cases in four outbreaks. This year, there have been 13 outbreaks, the largest of them traced to a migrant shelter in Chicago in March in which 60 illnesses have been linked.\nFind out what's happening in Orange Countywith free, real-time updates from Patch.\nIn California, hundreds of people at the UC Davis Medical Center were exposed to measles after a child who was infected with the virus was seen at the hospital in March, according to Sacramento County Public Health. People who were unvaccinated for measles at the hospital were at risk of developing the virus for up to 21 days following exposure.\nAnother case of possible exposure was reported in Alameda County at a restaurant on March 9. In February, an infected international traveler landed at Los Angeles International Airport and headed straight to a Los Angeles area fast food restaurant, prompting health officials to track a trail of potential exposures.\nPrior to 2024, outbreaks occurred in the winter and spring of 2014-15, where at least 131 California residents were infected in a large measles outbreak associated with Disneyland, and in 2019 when 73 confirmed measles cases were confirmed in the state, largely linked to healthcare settings, according to the California Department of Public Health.\nSeven states \u2014 Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon and Vermont \u2014 joined the growing list of states with measles outbreaks in the past month, according to the CDC. In Massachusetts, the case was the first in three years.\nThe CDC said the current uptick in cases is due to an increase in vaccine hesitancy since the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a global uptick in measles cases. \nAbout 85 percent of U.S. measles cases this year were among people who haven\u2019t been vaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status, and 10 percent were among people who had taken only one dose of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine.\nIn some U.S. communities, the number of people protected against measles by the vaccine has fallen below the 95 percent coverage level needed to prevent measles outbreaks.\nIn California, 96 percent percent of kindergarteners in the 2022-23 school year were up-to-date on their MMR vaccinations, according to CDC data. Nationwide, 93 percent of kindergartners that year had received two doses of MMR vaccine, compared to 93 percent in the 2019-20 school year, the data shows.\nMeasles was declared eradicated from the United States in 2000, a status threatened by a large measles outbreak in 2019, which resulted in 1,200 cases, mostly associated with outbreaks in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York. The 2024 measles outbreak is the highest since then. \nBefore the vaccine became available in 1963, between 3 million and 4 million people were infected every year.\nMeasles is highly contagious. A sick person can spread it to 90 percent of the people in close contact if they are not immune, and the virus can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves.\nCommon symptoms include a high fever, cough, pink eye (conjunctivitis), runny nose, white spots in the mouth, and a rash that typically starts on the face and spreads downward to the feet.\nBetween 1 and 3 of every 1,000 children infected with measles die from complications of measles, which can include pneumonia and swelling of the brain.\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.

      "Disease Outbreak News\nDengue - Global situation\nSituation at a glance\nDescription of the situation\nGlobal overview\nCurrent situation\nAs of 30 April 2024, over 7.6 million dengue cases have been reported to WHO in 2024, including 3.4 million confirmed cases, over 16 000 severe cases, and over 3000 deaths. While a substantial increase in dengue cases has been reported globally in the last five years, this increase has been particularly pronounced in the Region of the Americas, where the number of cases has already exceeded seven million by the end of April 2024, surpassing the annual high of 4.6 million cases in 2023. Furthermore, this is three times what was reported during the same period in 2023, highlighting the acceleration of this health problem.\u00a0 Dengue virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Cases are most commonly asymptomatic or result in mild febrile illness. However, some cases will develop severe dengue, which may involve shock, severe bleeding or severe organ impairment.\nThe risk of dengue is similar across regions, countries, and within countries. Factors associated with\u00a0an increasing risk of dengue epidemics and spread to new countries include:\nCurrently, 90 countries have known active dengue transmission in 2024, not all of which have been captured in formal reporting. In addition, many endemic countries do not have strong detection and reporting mechanisms, so the true burden of dengue globally is underestimated. In order to control transmission more effectively, real-time robust dengue surveillance is needed to address concerns about potential undetected cases, co-circulation and misdiagnosis as other arboviruses, and unrecorded travel movements. These factors could contribute to unrecognized disease spread and establish a potential risk for local transmission in non-endemic countries.\nTo strengthen global surveillance, and monitor temporal trends and disease incidence, WHO has established a global dengue surveillance system with monthly reporting across all WHO regions, which is now available as a dashboard.\u00a0\u00a0 This has so far captured 103 countries (Figures 1 and 2) including 28 zero reporting countries. No autochthonous or locally transmitted dengue cases have been reported in Europe\u00a0so far in 2024 but these data will be added when autochthonous cases occur, which can occur when seasonal conditions permit vector activity from June to November.\nGiven the current scale of the dengue outbreaks, the potential risk of further international spread and the complexity of factors impacting transmission, the overall risk at the global level is still assessed as High and thus dengue remains a global threat to public health.\nFigure 1. Epidemic curve of dengue cases and deaths as reported to WHO from January to April 2024*\n* Note: includes 103 countries so far integrated in the WHO global surveillance system, 28 of which have submitted zero reports to date\nFigure 2: Geographical distribution of dengue cases as reported to WHO from January to April 2024*\n*Note: only 103\ncountries integrated in the WHO global dengue surveillance system so far are\nshown\nCo-circulation of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses\nThere is considerable overlap in the geographic distribution of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, which are all transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and share some clinical features that can result in misdiagnoses and misreporting in the absence of differential laboratory testing. Surveillance data during large outbreaks of \u2018suspected dengue\u2019 may erroneously include cases of one or both of the other diseases. For instance, in one study in Brazil (Ribas Freitas AR, et al., 2024), in the state of Minas Gerais in 2023, \u2018suspected dengue\u2019 accounted for 84.4% of cases of the 828 654 cases of \u2018suspected arboviruses\u2019, and \u2018suspected chikungunya\u2019 only accounted for 15.6%. The true proportion of the two diseases amongst laboratory-confirmed cases was 65.9% chikungunya and only 34.1% dengue.\nSurveillance systems specifically targeting endemic transmission of chikungunya or Zika are weak or non-existent in many countries. Misdiagnosis between diseases is a surveillance concern because skewed surveillance can misinform policy decisions. As dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses share the same Aedes mosquito vectors and co-circulate in the same geographic areas, they also share many prevention strategies, such as differential diagnosis, mosquito control and public awareness campaigns. However, there are important differences between these diseases that affect risk populations, patient management and use of health care resources. For instance, Zika is particularly dangerous for pregnant women due to its association with Congenital Zika Syndrome. Consequently, expanding surveillance to simultaneously monitor for all three viruses can help public health authorities accurately determine the true burden of each disease, refine risk assessments, and optimize clinical management and resource allocation for more effective public health interventions.\nSo far in 2024, more than 250 000 cases of chikungunya have been reported to WHO and almost 7000 cases of Zika virus disease. Figure 3 shows countries/territories/areas with evidence of current or previous circulation of at least two of the three viruses.\nFigure 3:\u00a0Countries, territories or areas with previous or current local mosquito-borne transmission of more than one\u00a0Aedes-borne virus (dengue, chikungunya and Zika) as of 30 April 2024\nRegional overview\nAfrican Region\nThe African region is strongly affected by arboviruses, although the exact burden is not well understood due to challenges with laboratory capacity. There is evidence of current or prior dengue circulation in local populations and/or among travellers returning from approximately 30 African countries. In 2023, outbreaks were reported in 15 countries in the WHO African Region: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe, Senegal, and Togo.\nIn 2024, from 1 January to 28 April, 13 countries are known to have ongoing active transmission of the dengue virus \u2014 Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Niger, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe, Senegal, and the Seychelles. A total of 32 925 dengue cases (14 095 confirmed; 1051 severe cases) and 57 deaths have been reported from these 13 countries and an additional 16 countries have reported zero cases through their respective routine surveillance mechanisms. Circulation of three of the four dengue serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3) has been identified in the WHO African region. The current priority countries based on dengue burden are Burkina Faso, Mauritius and Mali. Burkina Faso reported 72% of all cases and 89% of all deaths in the region from the beginning of 2023 to 28 April 2024, and remains the country with the largest dengue burden, reporting 17 098 cases (52%) and 38 deaths (67%) in 2024. Mauritius reported 7177 dengue cases and 15 deaths during the first 17 weeks of 2024, with only DENV-2 serotype being detected to date. In Mali between 1 January and 28 April 2024, a total of 3231 dengue cases and three deaths have been reported, with two serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-3) currently circulating. The main challenges in addressing dengue in the affected countries include funding constraints that hinder preparedness and response, shortages of rapid diagnostic tests, vector control specialists, lab technicians, and entomologists.\nRegion of the Americas\nDengue is the most widespread arbovirus and causes the highest number of arboviral disease cases in the Region of the Americas, with cyclical epidemics every 3 to 5 years. The Ae. aegypti, the first vector mosquito for dengue, is established in all countries in the Americas except Canada, which has also reported no prior autochthonous dengue cases. Previously, the highest burden of dengue was reported in 2023 with 4 600 086 suspected cases, including 2 048 048 laboratory-confirmed cases being recorded. However, in 2024 as of the end of April, there have already been 7 517 060 suspected dengue cases (3 528 635 laboratory-confirmed), 7374 (0.10%) severe dengue, and 3504 deaths (Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) 0.05%) reported. There are three times more suspected cases in 2024 to date than over the same period in 2023. Several countries in the northern hemisphere are also reporting a significant number of suspected dengue cases even though they have not yet entered their period of high transmission, which typically occurs in the second half of the year.\nIn 2024, Brazil is the country with the highest number of cases, with 6 296 795 suspected dengue cases (3 040 736 laboratory-confirmed), followed by Argentina (420 867 suspected cases), Paraguay (257 667 suspected cases), and Peru (199 659 suspected cases). \u00a0All four dengue serotypes have been detected across the region and in 2024; six countries (Brazil, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Panama) have already reported the simultaneous circulation of all dengue serotypes.\nEastern Mediterranean Region\nDengue outbreaks continue to be reported in both fragile, conflict-affected, and/or vulnerable countries in the region that have weakened healthcare systems as well as countries with stronger healthcare systems that have been affected by unusual rains due to climate change. Ae. aegypti and some Ae. Albopictus mosquitoes have been identified in most of the countries in the region.\u00a0In areas affected by armed conflict, the lack of detailed and timely information complicates a coordinated dengue response. Additionally, timely data sharing also remains a challenge for other countries in the region for reasons such as the potential impact in the tourism, economy and other sectors.\nEuropean Region\nDengue is not endemic in the WHO European Region and reported cases are mainly travel-related. However, there have been sporadic autochthonous dengue cases and few dengue outbreaks reported in the region since 2010 with evidence of dengue transmission from five countries: Croatia, France, Italy, Portugal (Madeira), and Spain. In 2023, autochthonous cases were reported in three countries: Italy (82), France (45) and Spain (3). No autochthonous dengue cases have been reported in Europe so far in 2024, though the summer has not yet started when mosquito vector activity commences. Testing capacity for dengue is limited in many Member States in the WHO European Region, especially outside the European Union, and most cases likely are first-time infections and therefore mild and do not present for care, the actual numbers of dengue cases may be underestimated.\nStrong public health systems, good clinical care including access to early diagnosis, case referral, and management of severe cases, relatively short vector season, and relatively unsuitable conditions for disease transmission all contribute to reduced severe health impact and further disease spread for both imported and autochthonous cases. The region is preparing for, likely limited, local transmission in the upcoming summer and early autumn months.\nThe competent vector, Aedes albopictus, has been establishing itself further north and west in the European region over the past ten years. Additionally, Aedes aegypti has already been established in Cyprus, and Madeira, Portugal. While cold winters in the majority of the region do not allow for year-round transmission, the climatic suitability for transmission of dengue infections in the European region may increase with changes in climate, including potential higher temperatures and milder winters, increase in the geographical range of the competent vectors, and temperature suitability for virus transmission.\u00a0 Changes in humidity and precipitation (followed by floods and stagnant water pools) may also create more favourable conditions for the vector population and therefore increased suitability for transmission of dengue virus.\nSouth- East Asia Region\nIn the South-East Asia Region, all Member States have the environmental conditions for dengue endemic transmission, and all have systematically reported dengue cases, except the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. There are clear seasonal patterns in dengue incidence, associated with the climate patterns in respective countries.\nIn 2024, Indonesia is experiencing a surge in dengue incidence, with 88 593 confirmed cases and 621 deaths as of\u00a0 \u00a0 30 April 2024 \u2013 approximately three times higher than the same period in 2023. In 2024 Bangladesh, Nepal, and Thailand have reported a higher number of cases compared to the same period of 2023. From January to April 2024, the CFR varied from 0% in Nepal to 1.09% in Bangladesh. However, interpreting these values requires caution since the case definition used varies across countries with some countries reporting only (lab confirmed) hospitalized cases (compared to others reporting probable cases from communities), hence leading to higher case fatality rate among those hospitalized or severe dengue cases.\nThe surge in dengue incidence is likely triggered by various factors, including shifts in the circulating serotype and climate change. At least five countries (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand) are currently grappling with the initiation of monsoon season, which creates suitable conditions for Aedes mosquito breeding and survival. Additionally, urbanization and population movements have played a pivotal role in the increasing burden in the region. Changes in the predominant circulating serotype increase not only the incidence but also the population risk of subsequent exposure to a heterologous DENV serotype, which in turn increases the risk of higher rates of severe dengue and deaths.\nWestern Pacific Region\nThe Western Pacific Region continues to face a high burden of mosquito-borne arboviral diseases, particularly dengue, which is endemic in twenty-three countries in the region. In 2024, seven countries including Australia, Cambodia, China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Singapore, and Viet Nam have reported dengue cases; Malaysia and Viet Nam are the most affected as of 22 April, reporting 50 650 cases and 39 deaths (CFR 0.07%) and 16 111 cases and one death (CFR 0.01%) respectively. Factors such as climate change, underdevelopment of infrastructure, cross-border population movements, and the resurgence of global travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, increase the risk of further international spread. The number of cases is expected to continue increasing once the rainy season begins in June.\nThere have not been any large outbreaks reported from Pacific Island countries/territories (PICs) in several years however in 2024, outbreaks have been reported in Fiji (3841 cases), Samoa (261 cases), Tokelau (130 cases as of 23 January 2024) and French Polynesia (43 cases). With ongoing travel between the PICs and the presence of competent Aedes mosquitoes, there is a risk of outbreaks occurring because of introduction from areas with active transmission.\nMember States in the region with endemic transmission continue to report longer seasonal dengue epidemics with increasing magnitude and geographic spread. However, disease burden estimation is less reliable due to the underreporting of cases, particularly in the PICs, based on their current syndromic reporting of dengue as dengue-like illness (DLI). Further, the reported number of deaths due to severe dengue is heterogenous across countries. As such, country-level and sub-national CFRs may appear inconsistent.\nA subset of the region requires additional support for dengue to address operational gaps in clinical management, surveillance, laboratory support, risk communication and community engagement, and operational management. There is also a need to improve adherence to the existing WHO \u201cFramework for National Surveillance and Control Plans for Aedes vectors\u201d for non-endemic countries in the Pacific Region, particularly establishing a comprehensive Early Warning System that integrates climate, disease, viral/serological, and entomological surveillance.\nEpidemiology\nDengue virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes typically in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, though in some regions such as Europe and North America, this latter vector is more widespread.\nDENV has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the same serotype and only transient immunity to the other serotypes, after which secondary infections with a different serotype increase the risk for severe dengue. Dengue cases are most commonly asymptomatic or result in mild febrile illness. However, some cases will develop severe dengue, which may involve shock, severe bleeding or severe organ impairment. This stage often starts after the fever has gone away and it is preceded by warning signs such as intense abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bleeding gums, fluid accumulation, lethargy or restlessness, and liver enlargement.\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue, but the timely diagnosis of dengue cases, identification of warning signs for severe dengue, and appropriate clinical management are key elements of care to prevent the progression to severe dengue and deaths.\nPublic health response\nThe overall capacity for countries to respond to multiple, concurrent outbreaks continues to be strained due to the global lack of resources, including shortages of good quality dengue diagnostic kits for early disease detection, lack of trained clinical and vector control staff and community awareness. Emergency response mechanisms have been established, and WHO supports high-risk countries across affected regions; however, the needs continue to outweigh the available resources. Coordination with partners, including UNICEF, has led to the development and implementation of common analyses and priority-setting tools. Nevertheless, it is imperative to sustain and enhance partner collaboration.\nCountries are encouraged to learn and adopt successful examples of effective case management, prevention, and control of dengue and other arboviruses through heightened research projects, which is also aimed at limiting the vectors reducing their ability to spread across the urban context. WHO should closely review local interventions and under the best evidence to accept and recommend them for public health programmes, facilitating early adaptation to reduce the growing health impact of dengue.\nOther response activities within WHO to support countries in their ongoing response activities include:\nWHO Leadership and Coordination\nWHO Health Operations Support\nClinical Management:\nHealth Information Management:\nRisk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE):\nLaboratory:\nVector Control:\nInternational Health Regulations and Border Health (Vector Control):\nWHO risk assessment\nDengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the dengue virus, with the potential to cause a serious public health impact. Dengue infections are the most common vector-borne viral infections worldwide, particularly impacting tropical and subtropical countries.\u00a0 DENV has the potential to cause epidemics resulting in high morbidity and mortality. The virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, most commonly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The proliferation and propagation of mosquitoes depend on climatic factors such as temperature, humidity and rainfall. The arbovirus can be carried by infected travellers (imported cases) and may establish new areas of local transmission in the presence of vectors and a susceptible population. As they are arboviruses, all populations living in areas with the presence of Aedes aegypti are at risk, however, their impact largely affects the most vulnerable people, in which the arboviral disease programs do not have enough resources to respond to outbreaks.\nInfection with one of the dengue serotypes (1-4) does not provide cross-protective immunity to the others, so persons living in a dengue endemic area can have four dengue infections during their lifetimes. Changes in the predominant circulating serotype increase the population risk of subsequent exposure to a heterologous DENV serotype, which increases the risk of higher rates of severe dengue and deaths.\u00a0 Severe dengue is characterized by vascular leakage, hemorrhagic manifestations, thrombocytopenia, and hypotensive shock, which can lead to organ failure and death. Age, interval between infections, antibody characteristics, viral factors, and host-specific genetics are contributing factors.\nMonitoring of the global dengue situation to date has shown that several factors are associated with an increasing risk of dengue epidemics becoming more extensive and less predictable, and these include;\nWHO assessed the global risk of dengue as high on 30 November 2023, and subsequently assigned a WHO internal emergency response grade of G3 at the global level on 1 December 2023. Given the current scale of the dengue outbreaks, the potential risk of further international spread and the complexity of factors impacting transmission, the overall risk at the global level is still assessed as high and thus dengue remains a global threat to public health.\nWHO advice\nDengue is primarily an urban disease of the tropics and the viruses that cause it are maintained in a cycle that involves humans and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The same mosquitoes transmit chikungunya and Zika viruses. The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for dengue virus infection. Aedes species mosquitoes can become infected with the virus after biting individuals infected with DENV and then transmit the virus to others in the vicinity. This cycle, therefore, makes the infective mosquito capable of spreading the dengue virus within households and in the neighbourhoods of cases, leading to clusters.\nEffective vector control interventions are key to the prevention and control of dengue. Vector control activities should target all areas where there is a risk of human-vector contact, such as residences, workplaces, schools, and hospitals. WHO promotes Integrated Vector Management (IVM) to control Aedes species. IVM should include removing potential breeding sites, reducing vector populations, and minimizing individual exposure. This should involve vector control strategies for larvae and adults (i.e., environmental management and source reduction), especially monitoring water storage practices, draining and cleaning household water storage containers weekly, larvicide in non-potable water using WHO-prequalified larvicides at correct dosages, distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for fever/dengue inpatients to contain spread of the virus from health facilities. Indoor space spraying for rapidly containing dengue-infected mosquitoes may be challenging to deliver in densely populated areas.\nPersonal protective measures during outdoor activities include topical repellents to exposed skin or the treatment of clothing and using long-sleeved shirts and pants. Additionally, indoor protection can include the use of household insecticide aerosol products, or mosquito coils during the day; window and door screens can reduce the chances of mosquitoes entering the house and insecticide-treated nets offer good protection to people against mosquito bites while sleeping during the day. Personal protective measures are recommended from dawn to dusk due to the diurnal Aedes aegypti. These measures and mosquito control should also cover workplaces and schools since the vectors are day-biting mosquitoes. Entomological surveillance should be undertaken to assess the breeding potential of Aedes mosquitoes in containers to target vector control activities and monitor insecticide resistance to help select the most effective insecticide-based interventions.\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue infection. However, early detection and access to appropriate healthcare for case management reduces mortality, as can rapid detection of dengue cases with warning signs and timely referrals of severe cases to tertiary healthcare facilities. Case surveillance should continue to be enhanced in all affected countries and globally. Where feasible, resources should be allocated for the strengthening of case referral mechanisms and for the confirmation and serotyping of the dengue viruses.\nVaccination against dengue should be viewed as part of an integrated strategy to control the disease, including vector control, proper case management, community education, and community engagement. WHO recommends the use of TAK-003 (only available vaccine) in children aged 6\u201316 years in settings with high dengue transmission intensity.\nCountries are encouraged to learn and adopt successful examples of effective case management, prevention, and control of dengue and other arboviruses through heightened research projects, particularly given the recent WHO recommendations on clinical trials. Implementing clinical surveillance and case and death report forms for dengue could be particularly useful in understanding the disease better and also form a basis for developing clinical trials for new therapies or quality improvement initiatives.\nWHO should closely review local interventions and under the best evidence to accept and recommend them for public health programmes, facilitating early adaptation to reduce the growing health impact of dengue.\nMinistries of Health and partners should closely review local interventions to accept and recommend them for public health programmes for early adaptation to reduce the growing health impact of dengue.\nWHO does not recommend that any general travel or trade restrictions be applied to countries based on the available information.\nFurther information\nCitable reference: World Health Organization (30 May 2024).

Influenza activity in the United States during the 2023\u20132024 season (October 1, 2023 \u2013 August 31, 2024) was moderately severe and within the range seen during pre-COVID-19 seasons for both timing and intensity of activity. During the 2023\u20132024 season, influenza activity began to increase in early November and peaked in late December 2023. Activity declined for a few weeks in January 2024 and then remained relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 before declining to inter-seasonal levels in May 2024. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant virus circulating during the 2023\u20132024 season. However, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria viruses were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses later in the season as overall influenza activity began to decrease. This is the third season in a row without influenza B/Yamagata viruses in circulation.\nThis report summarizes influenza activity in the United States during the 2023\u20132024 season (October 1, 2023 \u2013 August 31, 2024) as reported to CDC through its collaborative efforts with clinical and public health laboratories, outpatient providers, emergency departments, hospitals, vital statistics offices, and public health departments. It also includes the composition of the Northern Hemisphere 2024\u20132025 influenza vaccines and a brief update on influenza activity occurring during the summer of 2024 in the Southern Hemisphere.\nVirus Surveillance\nThe influenza virologic surveillance system is comprised of the U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating laboratories and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratories, which include both clinical and public health laboratories throughout the United States. Clinical laboratories primarily test for diagnostic purposes and their data are used to understand timing and intensity of influenza activity, while public health laboratories primarily test specimens for influenza for surveillance purposes to understand what influenza virus subtypes and lineages are circulating and the ages of people that are infected 1. During the 2023\u20132024 influenza season, clinical laboratories reporting to CDC tested 3,910,204 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses using clinical diagnostic tests. Among these, 351,460 (9.0%) specimens tested positive, including 243,048 (69.2%) for influenza A and 108,401 (30.8%) for influenza B viruses. The overall percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza nationally each week ranged from 0.4% to 18.3% and peaked during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) before declining slightly and remaining relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 (Figure 1). The timing of peak activity for influenza A and influenza B varied (late December and late February, respectively) which contributed to the sustained period of elevated activity overall.\nBased on the percentage of specimens testing positive in clinical laboratories, peak influenza activity in the 10 Health and Human Services (HHS) regions occurred between mid-December 2023 and late February 2024: HHS Regions 9 and 10 (West Coast and Pacific Northwest) peaked in mid-December; Regions 2, 3, 4, and 8 (New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Mountain) peaked in late December; Region 6 (South Central) peaked late in January; Region 1 (New England) peaked in early February; and Regions 5 and 7 (Midwest and Central) peaked late in February.\nFigure 1. Influenza Positive Test Results Reported by Clinical Laboratories to CDC, National Summary by MMWR week and Influenza Season \u2014 United States, 2018\u20132019 to 2023\u20132024 Seasons\nPublic health laboratories tested 129,638 specimens and reported 39,885 influenza positive specimens, with 30,689 (76.9%) positive for influenza A and 9,196 (23.1%) positive for influenza B viruses. Among 25,906 seasonal influenza A viruses that were subtyped, 16,875 (65.1%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and 9,031 (34.9%) were influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Influenza B lineage information was available for 8,010 (87.1%) influenza B viruses, with all of them belonging to the Victoria lineage (Figure 2). No influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses have been identified worldwide since March 2020.\nFigure 2. Influenza Positive Tests Reported to CDC by U.S. Public Health Laboratories*, National Summary, 2023\u20132024 Season\n*This graph reflects the number of specimens tested and the number determined to be positive for influenza viruses at the public health lab (specimens tested is not the same as cases). It does not reflect specimens tested only at CDC and could include more than one specimen tested per person. Specimens tested as part of routine influenza surveillance as well as those tested as part of targeted testing for people exposed to influenza A(H5) are included. The guidance for influenza A/H5 testing recommends testing both a conjunctival and respiratory swab for people with conjunctivitis which has resulted in more specimens testing positive for influenza A/H5 than the number of human H5 cases. For more information on the number of people infected with A/H5, please visit the \"How CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situation\"\nNationally, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant virus during the 2023\u20132024 influenza season as a whole and for each week from early November 2023 through the end of February 2024. Influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria viruses co-circulated at lower levels during that time. However, as overall influenza activity decreased, A(H3N2) or B viruses were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. The co-circulation of these strains likely contributed to extending the duration of the season, with A(H3N2) and B viruses increasing as A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses decreased and A(H3N2) viruses taking over as the predominant virus in early April 2024 (Figure 2). On a regional level, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were predominant during the season as a whole in all 10 HHS regions; however, the extent and timing of A(H3N2) and B viruses varied by region. For additional regional level data, please visit FluView Interactive.\nAmong the influenza A viruses that were subtyped, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most common virus among all age groups comprising 68.8% of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses identified in persons aged 0\u20134 years, 63.8% in 5\u201324 years, 66.0% in 25\u201364 years, and 63.6% in those aged 65 years or older. However, the second most frequently identified virus varied by age group: influenza B in those 0\u20134 and 5\u201324 years old, influenza A(H3N2) in those 65 years and older and approximately equal proportions of influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses in those 25\u201364 years.\nVirus Characterization & Antiviral Susceptibility\nGenetic characterization of the viruses circulating during this time period was conducted using next generation sequencing, and the genomic data were analyzed and submitted to publicly accessible databases (GenBank: GenBank Overview and EpiFlu: Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2025 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season announced). Phylogenies of representative subsets of genetic data from CDC and other submitters can be visualized in real time at Nextstrain.\nTo evaluate whether genetic changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) of circulating viruses affected antigenicity, antigenic characterizations were conducted using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays (A(H1N1)pdm09, H3N2 and B viruses) or High-content Imaging-based micro-Neutralization Test (HINT) (A(H3N2) viruses) and post-infection ferret antisera raised to reference viruses representing the 2023\u20132024 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses. Both assays determine how well antibodies raised to the influenza vaccine reference viruses recognize or bind to circulating viruses. HI assay measures how well antibodies inhibit the binding between the HA of the virus and the sialic acid receptors on the surface of red blood cells, whereas HINT measures how well antibodies neutralize or block virus infection of a cell.\nCDC genetically characterized 5,348 viruses (3,865 influenza A and 1,483 influenza B) collected in the United States during October 1, 2023 \u2013 August 31, 2024, and antigenically characterized viruses representing various genetic clades. Overall, the vaccine antigens for each of the three major groups of the influenza viruses circulating in people (i.e., A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria) elicited antibodies that reacted well with most of the co-circulating viruses during this period (Figure 3). Detailed characterization data for each group are bellow.\nInfluenza A(H1N1)pdm09\nPhylogenetic analysis of the HA demonstrated that all viruses tested belonged to the 6B.1A.5a lineage and were classified in 2 clades. Clade 5a.2a represented 24.4% (n=480), and 75.6% (n=1,491) were clade 5a.2a.1. The A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the 2023\u20132024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines contain HA genes from clade 5a.2a.1. Nearly all (99.8%, n=573) of the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses antigenically characterized were well recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer by HI) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like reference viruses which represent the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\nInfluenza A(H3N2)\nAll 1,894 genetically characterized A(H3N2) viruses belonged to subclades of the 3C.2a1b.2a clade, with the majority (99.8%, n=1,891) belonging to the 2a.3a.1 subclade. The A(H3N2) component for the 2023\u20132024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines contain HA genes from the 3C.2a1b.2a clade. Antigenic analysis showed that 629 (95.0%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer by HI or HINT by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses that represent the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\nInfluenza B\nAll influenza B viruses for which characterization was possible belonged to the B/Victoria-lineage. Infections with B/Yamagata viruses have not been identified globally since March of 2020. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes showed that all (n=1,483) belonged to clade V1A.3a.2. The genetic clade of the B/Victoria-lineage component for the 2023\u20132024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines is this V1A.3a.2 clade.\nFigure 3. Genetic Clades of HA genes Based on Phylogenic Analysis of Influenza Viruses Collected Since October 1, 2023\nCDC also assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to antiviral medications. Between October 1, 2023, and August 31, 2024, a total of 5,163 viruses collected in the United States were characterized for susceptibility to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors using sequence-based analysis, and a subset of 478 viruses (9.3%) were tested using a functional assay. Based on sequence analysis, all viruses, except 10, lacked known or suspected mutations associated with reduced inhibition by the neuraminidase inhibitors. Of these 10 viruses, 5 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses contained an NA-H275Y amino acid substitution and 1 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had a combination of NA substitutions I223V + S247N. The remaining 4 viruses were from B/Victoria lineage; two of them had a new substitution NA-A245G; one had NA-D197N; and 1 virus had NA-H273Y substitution. All viruses lacking NA mutations displayed normal inhibition by the neuraminidase inhibitors. As expected, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses containing NA-H275Y showed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. One A(H1N1)pdm09 virus with substitutions I223V + S247N showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. Two B/Victoria viruses with NA-A245G showed reduced inhibition by peramivir. One B/Victoria virus with NA-D197N showed reduced inhibition by peramivir and zanamivir, while another B/Victoria virus with NA-H273Y showed highly reduced inhibition by peramivir.\nA total of 5,069 viruses were characterized for susceptibility to the polymerase acidic (PA) cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using sequence-based analysis, and a subset of 585 viruses (11.5%) were tested phenotypically. All tested viruses were susceptible to baloxavir, except 1 A(H3N2) virus with a PA-I38T amino acid substitution, which showed reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.\nTable 1. Assessment of Virus Susceptibility to Antiviral Medications, Viruses Collected in the U.S. October 1, 2023 \u2013 August 31, 2024\nVaccine Strain Selection 2024\u20132025\nViruses to be included in the 2024\u20132025 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines were recommended at the World Health Organization's (WHO) Consultation on the Composition of the Influenza Vaccines in February 2024 and selected by the Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee in March 2024 after reviewing and evaluating data on the 2023\u20132024 influenza season and the performance of the 2023\u20132024 influenza vaccines (2,3). The A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria lineage and B/Yamagata lineage components are unchanged from the 2023\u20132024 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. Both the egg-based and cell- or recombinant-based vaccines had a change in the A(H3N2) component. In the egg-based vaccine it was changed to an A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virus and in cell- or recombinant-based vaccines it was changed to an A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)-like virus23. The genetic clade and subclade for the recommended vaccine viruses were 5a.2a.1 for A(H1N1)pdm09, 3C.2a1b.2a.3a.1 for A(H3N2), V1A.3a.2 for B/Victoria, and Y3 for B/Yamagata.\nDue to the lack of detections of circulating B/Yamagata lineage viruses worldwide after March 2020, FDA further recommended vaccines manufactured for the U.S. population for the 2024\u20132025 season be trivalent, including only one B component from the B/Victoria lineage4.\nTable 2. Influenza Vaccine Viruses Northern Hemisphere 2023\u20132024 and 2024\u20132025* Seasons2.\n*Due to the lack of detections of circulating B/Yamagata lineage viruses worldwide after March 2020, FDA further recommended vaccines manufactured for the U.S. population for the 2024\u20132025 season be trivalent, including only one B component from the B/Victoria lineage.\nNovel Flu A Viruses\nNovel influenza A viruses are influenza A virus subtypes that are different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses. Early identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can be understood, and appropriate public health measures can be taken1.\nFrom October 1, 2023, through August 31, 2024, a total of 21 novel influenza A virus infections were reported to CDC (Figure 4). Of the 21 novel influenza A virus infections reported, 14 avian influenza A (H5) virus detections in people were reported from 4 states (1-TX, 2-MI,10-CO, 1-MO). Four of the 14 cases were associated with exposure to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 infected dairy cattle, 9 were associated with poultry culling operations, and one case did not have a determined source. All 14 cases occurred in adults, 13 reported mild illness, and one patient with underlying medical conditions was hospitalized at the time the specimen for influenza testing was collected. All have recovered from their illness. No human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A (H5) viruses was identified associated with these cases.\nCurrently in the United States, HPAI A(H5N1) virus has been detected in wild birds, and there have been outbreaks among other animals including commercial poultry, backyard flocks, and dairy cows. Sporadic infections in wild mammals also have been reported by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)5. The first detections of HPAI A(H5N1) virus in dairy cows and unpasteurized milk samples from cows in Texas and Kansas were reported by USDA on March 25, 2024. As of August 31, 2024, HPAI A(H5N1) virus has been detected in 201 dairy herds from 14 states. Since 2022, HPAI A(H5) virus has been detected in commercial and backyard flocks in 48 states and has impacted over 100 million birds5. Updates on surveillance activities and symptom monitoring among persons exposed to animals infected with H5N1 are available at: How CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situation.\nCDC recommends that state and local public health departments monitor people who are exposed to birds or other animals (including livestock) suspected to be infected with avian influenza A viruses for signs and symptoms consistent with influenza virus infection until 10 days after their last exposure and that people who develop illness be tested for influenza and treated with antiviral medication if indicated6. During February 9, 2022 \u2014 August 31, 2024, over 14,100 people were monitored following exposure to HPAI A(H5N1) virus infected birds, cows, or other animals.\nOf the 21 novel influenza A virus infections reported during the 2023\u20132024 season, 7 were confirmed to be variant viruses (i.e., a swine influenza virus identified in a human and designated with a \"v\"). One H1N1v (OH), 4 H1N2v (PA), and 2 H3N2v (1-CO, 1-MI) virus infections were detected and reported to CDC. Among the 7 individuals infected with variant influenza viruses, 6 had documented swine exposure prior to illness, and for one the investigation did not determine a source. Among the 7 cases, 4 were hospitalized, and all recovered from their illness. Three were children <18 years old, and 4 were adults. No human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses was identified associated with these cases.\nFigure 4.  Novel Influenza A Virus Cases by Season\u2014 United States, 2010\u20132011 to 2023\u20132024 Season\nOutpatient Respiratory Illness Surveillance\nInformation on outpatient visits to health care providers for respiratory illness, referred to as influenza-like illness ([ILI], fever plus cough or sore throat), is collected through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet)1. Nationally, the weekly percentage of outpatient visits for ILI recorded in ILINet was at or above the national baseline of 2.9% for 22 consecutive weeks from late October 2023 to late March 2024 and peaked at 6.9% during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) (Figure 5). The timing and peak percentage of visits for ILI during the 2023\u20132024 season were within the range of what was reported during seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be attributable to respiratory virus circulation and healthcare seeking behavior that was more similar to pre-COVID seasons than what occurred during the 2020\u20132021, 2021\u20132022, and 2022\u20132023 seasons.\nOn a regional level, 8 of 10 HHS regions reported ILI activity that peaked during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52); however, Region 6 (South Central) peaked during the week ending December 23, 2023 (week 51) and Region 7 (Central) peaked during the week ending February 24, 2024 (week 8). The number of weeks of elevated activity (weeks above the region-specific baseline) varied slightly by region: Region 1 (New England) was above baseline for 23 weeks; Regions 3 (Mid-Atlantic), 4 (Southeast), 5 (Midwest), 6 (South Central), and 7 (Central) were above baseline for 20-21 weeks; Regions 2 (New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands), 8 (Mountain) and 9 (Pacific) were above baseline for 17-18 weeks; and Region 10 (Pacific Northwest) was above baseline for 14 weeks. Multiple respiratory viruses co-circulated during the 2023\u20132024 season and the contribution of influenza viruses to ILI likely varied by week and location.\nFigure 5. Percentage of Outpatient Visits for Respiratory Illness as Reported by ILINet, National Summary by Season \u2014 United States, 2018\u20132019 to 2023\u20132024 Seasons\n*Effective October 3, 2021 (Week 40), the respiratory illness definition (fever plus cough or sore throat) no longer includes \"without a known cause other than influenza.\"\nApproximately 67% of ILINet providers report total number of patient visits, as well as ILI visits, by age group, allowing the calculation of percentage of visits for ILI by age group. Both pediatric age groups (0\u20134 years and 5\u201324 years) had a higher percentage of visits for ILI compared to the adult age groups throughout the season. Peak activity among those 5\u201324 years occurred during the week ending December 23, 2023, while activity in all other age groups occurred during the week ending December 30, 2023 (Figure 6).\nFigure 6. Percentage of Outpatient Visits by Age Group for Respiratory Illness as Reported by ILINet \u2014 United States, October 1, 2023 \u2013 August 31, 2024\nILINet data are used to produce weekly jurisdiction and core-based statistical area (CBSA)-level measures of ILI activity. From the 2008\u20132009 season through the 2018\u20132019 season ILI activity categories ranged from minimal to high; during the 2019\u201320 season the very high category was added1. For the weeks ending December 23, 2023\u2013January 6, 2024, and February 10, 2024 (weeks 51-1, 6), more than 50% of the 55 jurisdictions experienced high or very high ILI activity each week, with the highest number (41; 74.5%) occurring during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52). This is similar to the peak weekly percentage of jurisdictions experiencing high of very high ILI activity during the past 2 seasons (2022\u20132023 [86%], 2021\u20132022 [58%]) and during the 2 seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic (2019\u201320 [87.0%], 2018\u20132019 [59.3%]). For a weekly snapshot of geographic activity levels of ILI, please see FluView Interactive.\nHospitalization Surveillance\nCDC monitors hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections through two surveillance systems: the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), which covers approximately 9% of the U.S. population, and National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance which consists of reports from all hospitals across the country (1).\nFrom October 1, 2023, to August 31, 2024, a total of 25,390 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites. Hospitalization rates peaked nationally during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) at 8.9 per 100,000 population. This is the third highest weekly rate observed during all seasons going back to 2010\u20132011 (Figure 7). This season follows the 2017\u20132018 season which peaked at 10.2 per 100,000 during the week ending January 6, 2018 (week 1) and the 2014\u20132015 season which peaked at 9.0 per 100,000 during the week ending December 27, 2014 (week 52).\nFigure 7. Weekly Rates of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations \u2014 United States, 2014\u20132015 to 2023\u20132024 influenza seasons\n*Dashed lines for current season indicate potential reporting delays for recent weeks. Data from the Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly. Hospitalization rates are updated weekly as data becomes available.\n**In 2021\u20132022, rates reflect cases hospitalized beginning October 1, 2021 (MMWR Week 39), but given late influenza season activity, the season was extended to June 11, 2022 (MMWR Week 23). In 2023\u20132024, surveillance was extended beyond April 30 for situational awareness during the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus among birds, poultry, dairy cattle, and other animals in the United States.\nThe overall cumulative hospitalization rate through April 27, 2024 (to coincide with when FluSurv-NET surveillance typically ends) was 83.1 per 100,000 population. Since the 2009\u20132010 season, this is the second highest cumulative rate based, (Figure 8).\nFigure 8. Cumulative Rates of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations \u2014 United States, 2014\u20132015 to 2023\u20132024 influenza seasons\n*In 2021\u20132022, rates reflect cases hospitalized beginning October 1, 2021 (MMWR Week 39), but given late influenza season activity, the season was extended to June 11, 2022 (MMWR Week 23). In 2023\u20132024, surveillance was extended beyond April 30 for situational awareness during the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus among birds, poultry, dairy cattle, and other animals in the United States. Because surveillance for the 2023\u20132024 season was extended, it is recommended to not compare the cumulative rate from this season to cumulative rates from past seasons in which surveillance ended earlier.\nAmong 25,390 influenza-associated hospitalizations, most (84.6%) were associated with influenza A virus, with 14.8% associated with influenza B virus. Among those with influenza A subtype information, 67.6% were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 32.4% were A(H3N2).\nWhen examining rates by age, the highest cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was among adults aged \u226565 years (231.0), followed by adults aged 50\u201364 years (98.9), children aged 0\u20134 years (86.1), adults aged 18\u201349 years (40.2), and was lowest among children and adolescents aged 5\u201317 years (34.3) (Figure 9). When examining age-adjusted rates by race and ethnicity, the highest cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population was among non-Hispanic Black persons (149.5), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons (120.4), Hispanic/Latino persons (85.9), non-Hispanic White persons (65.5), and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander persons (47.5).\nFigure 9. Cumulative Rate of Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations by Age \u2014 United States, 2023\u20132024 influenza season\nAmong 5,990 adults with information on underlying medical conditions who were hospitalized between October 1, 2023, and April 30, 2024, 94.5% had at least one reported underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported were hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, and obesity. Among 1,980 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15\u201349 years) with information on pregnancy status, 21.7% were pregnant. Among 1,429 hospitalized children and adolescents with information about underlying conditions, 70.7% reported at least one underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported were asthma, neurologic disease, and obesity.\nReporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance Component, the second surveillance system that tracks hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections, was between October 1, 2023, and May 4, 2024. During that time, 229,442 influenza associated hospitalizations were reported yielding a cumulative national influenza associated hospitalization rate of 69.2 per 100,000 population for the season. Hospitalizations began to increase in early November, peaking nationally during the week ending December 30, 2023 (week 52) at 20,534 hospitalizations (6.2 hospitalizations per 100,000 population) before declining slightly and remaining relatively stable at elevated levels through February 2024 (Figure 10). While the peak weekly number of hospitalizations during the 2023\u20132024 season (20,534) was slightly lower than the peak weekly number during the 2022\u20132023 season (25,882), the total number of hospitalizations was higher this season (229,442) than it was during the same time period of the 2022\u20132023 season (209,338) due to the extended period of elevated activity this season.\nFigure 10. Number of New Influenza Hospital Admissions and Rates Reported to the CDC\u2019s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance Component, National Summary, 2021\u20132022 to 2023\u20132024 Seasons\nAt a regional level, the timing of peak activity was similar to that observed nationally (week ending December 30, 2023) for 7 of the 10 HHS Regions: Regions 2 (New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico), 3 (Mid-Atlantic), 4 (Southeast), 5 (Midwest), 8 (Mountain), 9 (West Coast), and 10 (Pacific Northwest). Regions 1 (New England) and 6 (South Central) peaked one week later (the week ending January 6, 2024) and Region 7 (Central) peaked during the week ending March 2, 2024 (week 9). Hospitalization rates in Regions 1 (New England), 3 (Mid-Atlantic), 5 (Midwest), and 6 (South Central) had a bimodal distribution, with smaller secondary peaks occurring in early March 2024 following the initial peak in late December and early January 2024. On a regional level, cumulative hospitalization rates ranged from 39.7 to 82.7 per 100,000 with 7 regions reporting a cumulative rate greater than 70 per 100,000. For additional details, see FluView Interactive.\nMortality Surveillance\nAccording to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Surveillance System1, during October 1, 2023 \u2013 August 31, 2024, a total of 2,774,168 deaths from all causes were reported nationally. Among these, 10,289 (0.4%) had influenza listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death. The weekly percentage of deaths due to influenza ranged from 0.03% to 1.3% and peaked during the week ending January 6, 2024 (week 1) (Figure 11). Influenza deaths began to increase in late November 2023, peaking in early January 2024 (week 1), and then declined. This peak occurred later in the season compared to the 2022\u20132023 influenza season, which peaked at 1.6% during mid-December 2022; however, it was slightly earlier than recent pre-COVID influenza seasons, which peaked between late January 2018 (2017\u20132018 season) and mid-March 2016 (2015\u20132016 season). While the peak weekly percentage of deaths due to influenza was lower during this season compared to last, the cumulative percentage of deaths due to influenza was slightly higher (0.4% during 2023\u20132024 compared with 0.3% during 2022\u20132023) due to longer duration of elevated influenza-associated mortality.\nFigure 11. Influenza Mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System, 2019\u201320 to 2023\u20132024 Seasons*\n*Data presented are current as of September 9, 2024.\nCDC monitors influenza-associated deaths in children younger than 18 years of age through the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System1. During October 1, 2023 \u2013 August 31, 2024, a total of 197 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported to CDC (Figure 12); this is nearly equal to the highest number of deaths reported during a seasonal influenza epidemic (199 deaths reported during the 2019\u20132020 season). Since influenza-associated deaths in children became a nationally notifiable condition in 2004, the total number of influenza-associated deaths among children during one season has ranged from 37 during the 2011\u20132012 season to 199 during the 2019\u201320 season. This season, 104 of the reported deaths were associated with influenza A viruses, 90 were associated with influenza B viruses, and 3 were associated with influenza A and B virus co-infection. Of 60 influenza A viruses with a reported subtype, 44 (73.3%) were influenza A (H1N1) and 16 (26.7%) were influenza A (H3N2). Fourteen deaths associated with influenza B viruses had a lineage reported, and all were B/Victoria lineage viruses. No pediatric deaths associated with influenza B/Yamagata have been reported since the 2017\u20132018 season. The mean age at death was 7 years (range = 4 weeks\u201317 years). Location of deaths were known for all children and adolescents; most (112 [56.9%]) died after hospital admission; 56 (28.4%) died in an emergency room; and 29 (14.7%) died outside of a hospital setting. Among the 187 children and adolescents with a known medical history, 93 (49.7%) had at least one underlying medical condition associated with higher risk for developing serious influenza-related complications7. Among the 157 children and adolescents who were eligible for influenza vaccination (age \u22656 months at date of illness onset) and for whom vaccination status was known, 130 (82.8%) were not fully vaccinated.\nFigure 12. Number of Influenza-Associated Pediatric Deaths by Virus Type and Week of Death, 2020\u20132021 to 2023\u20132024 Seasons*\n*Data shown are current as of September 9, 2024, and include deaths occurring until August 31, 2024. Additional pediatric deaths that occurred during this time period may continue to be reported as they are identified. The total number of deaths will be updated in FluView and on FluView Interactive as they are received.\nInfluenza Disease Burden and Prevented Burden from Vaccination\nCDC does not know the exact number of people who have been sick and affected by influenza viruses because influenza virus infection is not a reportable disease in most areas of the United States. However, CDC uses a mathematical model to estimate the number of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that occur each season8. Preliminary end of season estimates of influenza disease burden in the United States for the 2023\u20132024 season, from October 1, 2023 through April 30, 2024, show that influenza virus infection likely resulted in between 34 million\u201375 million symptomatic illnesses, 15 million-33 million medical visits, 380,000-900,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000-100,000 deaths. Older adults (\u226565 years) accounted for 51% of hospitalizations and 68% of deaths.\nIn addition to estimating the disease burden, CDC also estimates the benefit of influenza vaccination by calculating the number of illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that are prevented by vaccination. CDC uses a compartmental model to estimate the burden that would have occurred without vaccination and the burden that occurred with vaccination8. The difference between these two estimates is the vaccine prevented burden. During the 2023\u20132024 season (October 1, 2023 \u2013 April 30, 2024), influenza vaccine coverage ranged from 37% among those 18\u201349 years to 73% among older adults \u226565 years (FluVaxView: Weekly Flu Vaccination Dashboard) Influenza vaccine effectiveness in outpatient settings ranged from 34% to 64% depending on age group9. For the 2023\u20132024 season, CDC preliminarily estimates that influenza vaccination prevented between 7.4 million-15 million symptomatic illnesses, 3.6 million-7.4 million medical visits, 100,000-240,000 hospitalizations, and 3,500-34,000) deaths.\nBoth disease and prevented burden will be updated later in the calendar year and updated estimates will be posted to the CDC websites for disease burden and averted burden.\nSeasonal Severity Assessment\nEach season, CDC classifies influenza season severity at the end of each season using influenza virus activity data, including influenza-like illness, influenza hospitalization rates, and influenza deaths to compare to the same data from past seasons and to classify the severity of the influenza season10. Severity is classified across all age groups and for children, adults, and older adults. The severity of the 2023\u20132024 season was classified as moderately severe across all age groups and for children, adults, and older adults.\nInfluenza Activity in the Southern Hemisphere\nInfluenza follows a seasonal pattern in Southern Hemisphere countries, with activity usually occurring between April and September and sometimes lasting until October or November. Based on data collected and submitted by countries to the World Health Organization's FluNet system11, as of late-August 2024, influenza activity peaked and is declining in most Southern Hemisphere countries in South America, while activity in countries in Southern Africa and Oceania persists. In South America and Australia (which provides most of the data for the Oceania region), most influenza virus detections reported this season have been influenza A(H3N2) viruses, except in Ecuador where influenza B predominated. In Southern Africa, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have predominated, though influenza B detections have increased in recent weeks.\nIn comparison to seasonal influenza trends observed before the COVID-19 pandemic, three South American countries\u2014Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay\u2014reported data suggesting an earlier start to their 2024 influenza seasons while the remaining countries reported timing of activity similar to what was observed before the COVID-19 pandemic. Most countries in South America, Southern Africa, and Oceania have had influenza activity reach moderate levels, in line with levels observed in prior seasons, though two countries experienced very high influenza virus detection levels: Chile and Zambia driven by circulation of A(H3N2) and co-circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria viruses, respectively. Influenza virus detections among individuals with severe acute respiratory infections (i.e., SARI cases, defined as a hospitalized case reporting a cough and fever, with symptom onset in the last 10 days) reached very high levels in Chile and Zambia, and high levels in Uruguay, Ecuador, and South Africa1213.\nOf note, Ghana, Senegal, and Lao People's Democratic Republic, which are tropical countries in the Northern Hemisphere, have reported higher levels of influenza detections than expected for this time of year compared to seasonal influenza trends observed before the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDiscussion\nThe 2023\u20132024 influenza season in the United States is considered moderately severe with an estimate of at least 34 million symptomatic illnesses, 15 million medical visits, 380,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000 deaths caused by influenza virus infection. The predominant influenza virus overall during the 2023\u20132024 influenza season was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. However, as A(H1N1)pdm09 activity declined, A(H3N2) and B/Victoria virus activity continued to increase for several more weeks and, each were identified more frequently than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from early March until mid-May. From June through August, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses co-circulated and influenza B viruses were reported in small numbers. Eight of the previous 25 seasons (1997\u201398 through 2022\u20132023, excluding the 2020\u20132021 season due to low influenza virus circulation), were characterized by A(H1N1) as the predominant virus (5 were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 3 were the older A(H1N1) viruses); the predominant virus was influenza A(H3N2) during 16 seasons and equal proportions A(H1N1) and B in one season. Eleven seasons during this 25-year time period had two waves of influenza activity; influenza B was responsible for the second wave in 8 (73%) of those seasons (seven following A(H3N2) activity and one following A(H1N1) activity). Three seasons had a second wave of influenza A activity (two A(H3N2) and one A(H1N1)pdm09, all occurring since the 2018\u20132019 season.\nMost (75% \u2013 100%) of the influenza viruses genetically and antigenically characterized were in the same genetic subclade as, and antigenically similar to, the vaccine reference viruses included in the season's influenza vaccine. Almost all (>99.7%) of the influenza viruses collected and tested for antiviral resistance by CDC, were susceptible to zanamivir, peramivir, oseltamivir, and baloxavir .\nThe level of influenza activity this season and during the 2022\u20132023 influenza season was more similar to those seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic than what was observed in the two seasons immediately after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (2020\u20132021 and 2021\u20132022). The peak percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza (18.3%) as reported to CDC from clinical laboratories nationally was slightly less than the average peak percentage positive (26.5%) during the five influenza seasons (2015\u20132016 \u2013 2019\u20132020) immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, but this could be influenced by the addition of another virus causing significant respiratory illness. Compared to the most recent pre-COVID seasons, the cumulative rate of influenza-associated hospitalizations as reported in FluSurv-NET this season was higher than all but one season (2017\u20132018 season).\nMortality attributed to influenza this season also was similar to the 2022\u20132023 influenza season and to what was seen in the most recent pre-COVID seasons. The peak percentage of deaths this season (1.4%) was slightly less than the 2022\u20132023 season (1.6%), but much more similar to pre-pandemic levels than the 2020\u20132021 (0.05%) and 2021\u20132022 seasons (0.2%). The number of pediatric deaths reported this season (197) is the second highest number of pediatric deaths attributed to influenza since the 2004\u20132005 season, excluding the 2009 influenza pandemic, when it became a nationally notifiable condition. The highest number of reported pediatric deaths due to influenza occurred during the 2019\u201320 season (199).\nFor the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of peak influenza activity occurred within the range of what was expected based on pre-COVID-19 activity (more than 80% of seasons between 1997\u201398 and 2019\u201320 peaked between late December and late February) and activity returned to low levels by mid-May. During the 2022\u20132023 season, influenza activity peaked earlier than expected (early December) and the 2021\u20132022 season continued longer than expected (through mid-June).\nWhile not always a predictor of the subsequent Northern Hemisphere influenza season, Southern Hemisphere activity in the summer is often considered when planning for what could be expected during the subsequent Northern Hemisphere influenza season. However, due to continued varied influenza activity among Southern Hemisphere countries, different influenza viruses predominating in different parts of the world, and the possibility of variations in population immunity between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, Southern Hemisphere activity cannot be used to definitively predict the timing or intensity of influenza activity in the United States this fall and winter.\nThough influenza activity has remained low in the summer, maintaining vigilance for influenza virus infections in the United States year-round is important. Sporadic seasonal influenza virus infections and novel influenza A virus infections associated with exposure to swine during animal exhibitions often are reported during the summer months6. In addition, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus continue among dairy cows, poultry, and other animals, so it is important that providers and persons with exposure to sick or infected birds, cows, or other livestock remain attentive to any new symptoms, including conjunctivitis, that could be consistent with influenza virus infection6. Patients with suspected novel influenza A virus infection should isolate at home away from household members and not go to work or school until they are proven not to be infected with a novel influenza A virus or have recovered from their illness. Specimens from patients with suspected novel influenza A virus infection should be collected and referred to state public health departments for testing and treatment with influenza antiviral medications should be initiated immediately1415.\nWhile we do not know exactly what the coming influenza season will look like, influenza causes a significant public health burden in the United States every winter. For persons aged \u22656 months, receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine each year remains the best way to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe consequences. There are also everyday preventive actions, including avoiding close contact with people who are sick, limiting contact with others if sick, and covering coughs and sneezes, that can help reduce the spread of influenza. Influenza antiviral drugs are another way to minimize the impact of influenza this coming season. CDC recommends initiating influenza antiviral drug treatment as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at increased risk for influenza-associated complications15. Four influenza antiviral drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration are currently recommended for use in the United States.\nInfluenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly(Weekly US Influenza Surveillance Report) Additional information regarding influenza viruses, surveillance, vaccines, antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available online (Influenza (Flu)).\nContributors: A Col\u00f3n, MPH.

Nationally, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria viruses are all co-circulating. However, the distribution of circulating viruses varies by region. For regional and state level data and age group distribution, please visit FluView Interactive.\nClinical Laboratories\nThe results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories (the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza virus) are used to monitor whether influenza activity is increasing or decreasing.\n\nPublic Health Laboratories\nThe results of tests performed by public health laboratories nationwide are summarized below.\u00a0 Data from public health laboratories are used to monitor the proportion of circulating influenza viruses that belong to each influenza subtype/lineage.\n* This data reflects specimens tested and the number determined to be positive for influenza viruses at the public health labs (specimens tested is not the same as cases). It does not reflect specimens tested only at CDC and could include more than one specimen tested per person. The guidance for influenza A/H5 testing recommends testing both a conjunctival and respiratory swab for people with conjunctivitis which has resulted in more specimens testing positive for influenza A/H5 than the number of human H5 cases. For more information on the number of people infected with A/H5, please visit the \u201cHow CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situation\u201d\n\nView Chart Data | View Full Screen\nAdditional virologic surveillance information for current and past seasons:\nSurveillance Methods | FluView Interactive: National, Regional, and State Data or Age Data\nNovel Influenza A Virus:\nA human infection with a novel influenza A virus was reported by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. The patient was infected with an influenza A(H3N2) variant (A(H3N2)v) virus. The patient is < 18 years of age, sought healthcare during the week ending July 13, 2024 (Week 28), and was not hospitalized. An investigation by state public health officials found the patient attended an agricultural event prior to their illness onset. Investigation did not identify illness among close contacts of the patient. The investigation is ongoing.\nThree cases of influenza A (H1N2)v were also reported during the 2023-2024 season bringing the total to 4 variant influenza cases this season. No new human infections of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus have been reported during Week 31. A total of 13 cases of human infection with influenza A (H5) were previously reported this season bringing the total to 17 novel influenza cases reported during the 2023-2024 season. An ongoing outbreak of H5N1 continues in domestic dairy cattle and poultry and monitoring for additional cases is ongoing.\nWhen an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a \u201cvariant\u201d influenza virus. Most human infections with variant influenza viruses occur following exposure to swine, but human-to-human transmission can occur. It is important to note that in most cases, variant influenza viruses have not shown the ability to spread easily and sustainably from person to person.\nEarly identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can be understood, and appropriate public health measures can be taken.\nAdditional information on influenza in swine, variant influenza virus infection in humans, and guidance to interact safely with swine can be found at www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/index.htm.\nAdditional information regarding human infections with novel influenza A viruses:\nSurveillance Methods\u00a0 |\u00a0 FluView Interactive\nInfluenza Virus Characterization\nCDC performs genetic and antigenic characterization of U.S. viruses submitted from state and local public health laboratories according to the Right Size Roadmap submission guidance. These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current influenza vaccines. The data are also used to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in influenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC also tests susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir.\nCDC has genetically characterized 5,235 influenza viruses collected since October 1, 2023.\nCDC antigenically characterizes influenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) (H1N1pdm09, H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses) or neutralization-based HINT (H3N2 viruses) using antisera that ferrets make after being infected with reference viruses representing the 2023-2024 Northern Hemisphere recommended cell or recombinant-based vaccine viruses. Antigenic differences between viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference viruses recognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raised against a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody titer differences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to the reference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer differences of less than or equal to 8-fold. Viruses selected for antigenic characterization are a subset representing the genetic changes in the surface proteins seen in genetically characterized viruses.\nInfluenza A Viruses\nInfluenza B Viruses\nAssessment of Virus Susceptibility to Antiviral Medications\nCDC assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next generation sequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays. Information about antiviral susceptibility test methods can be found at U.S. Influenza Surveillance: Purpose and Methods | CDC.\nViruses collected in the U.S. since October 1, 2023, were tested for antiviral susceptibility as follows:\nFour A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses had NA-H275Y amino acid substitution and one A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-H275Y/H, conferring highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. One (H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-I223V and NA-S247N amino acid substitutions and showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. Two B viruses had NA-A245G amino acid substitution and showed reduced inhibition by peramivir. One B virus had NA-D197N amino acid substitution and showed reduced inhibition by zanamivir and peramivir. One B virus had NA-H273Y amino acid substitution and showed highly reduced inhibition by peramivir. One A(H3N2) virus had PA-I38T amino acid substitution and showed reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.\nHigh levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses (the adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses). Therefore, use of these antivirals for treatment and prevention of influenza A virus infection is not recommended and data from adamantane resistance testing are not presented.\nOutpatient Respiratory Illness Surveillance\nThe U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-confirmed influenza and will therefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with pathogens that can present with similar symptoms, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. It is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a more complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is providing integrated information about COVID-19, influenza, and RSV activity on a website that is updated weekly. Information about other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC\u2019s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website.\nOutpatient Respiratory Illness Visits\nNationally, the percentage of visits for respiratory illness that were reported through ILINet remained stable (change of \u2264 0.1 percentage points) compared to the previous week and is below the national baseline. All 10 regions are below their region-specific baselines. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location.\n\n* Effective October 3, 2021 (week 40), the ILI definition (fever plus cough or sore throat) no longer includes \u201cwithout a known cause other than influenza.\u201d\n\nOutpatient Respiratory Illness Visits by Age Group\nAbout 70% of ILINet participants provide both the number of patient visits for respiratory illness and the total number of patient visits for the week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patient visits for respiratory illness by age group.\nThe percentage of visits for respiratory illness reported in ILINet decreased in the 0-4 years age group and remained stable for all other age groups in Week 31 compared to Week 30.\n\nView Chart Data | View Full Screen\nOutpatient Respiratory Illness Activity Map\nData collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity*\u00a0by state/jurisdiction and Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA).\n\u00a0\n\n*Data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a jurisdiction or CBSA, and therefore, may not accurately depict the full picture of influenza activity for the entire jurisdiction or CBSA. Differences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by some health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with data presented by the health department likely being the more complete.\nAdditional information about medically attended visits for ILI for current and past seasons:\nSurveillance Methods | FluView Interactive: National, Regional, and State Data or ILI Activity Map\nHospitalization Surveillance\nFluSurv-NET\nThe Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in select counties in 14 states and represents approximately 9% of the U.S. population. FluSurv-NET hospitalization data are preliminary. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly.\nA total of 25,317 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites between October 1, 2023, and August 3, 2024. The weekly hospitalization rate observed in Week 31 was 0.0 per 100,000 population. The peak weekly hospitalization rate observed this season was 9.0 per 100,000 population and occurred during Week 52.\nAmong 25,317 hospitalizations, 21,409 (84.6%) were associated with influenza A virus, 3,734 (14.7%) with influenza B virus, 53 (0.2%) with influenza A virus and influenza B virus co-infection, and 121 (0.5%) with influenza virus for which the type was not determined. Among those with influenza A subtype information, 4,312 (67.5%) were A(H1N1) pdm09 and 2,072 (32.5%) were A(H3N2).\n\nView Full Screen\n\nView Full Screen\n**In this figure, weekly rates for all seasons prior to the 2023-2024 season reflect end-of-season rates. For the 2023-2024 season, rates for recent hospital admissions are subject to reporting delays and are shown as a dashed line for the current season. As hospitalization data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly.\nAdditional FluSurv-NET hospitalization surveillance information for current and past seasons and additional age groups:\nSurveillance Methods |FluView Interactive: Rates by Age, Sex, and Race/Ethnicity or Data on Patient Characteristics | RESP-NET Interactive\nNational Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance\nEffective May 1, 2024, hospitals are no longer required to report hospital admissions, hospital capacity, or hospital occupancy data to HHS through NHSN.

BPHC has also observed a\u00a0rapid increase in influenza-related pediatric hospitalizations in the past week. \u00a0\nFlu season is generally considered from October to May, and usually peaks between December and February. The current levels of influenza activity are concerning, and this high level is occurring much earlier in the season than usual. Last year, the highest number of influenza cases reported in a given week was 250 at the peak of the flu season in mid-December. The data also indicate the highest number of reported cases is among children and adolescents younger than 18 years old, representing 59% of cases, as well as among Black and Latinx/Hispanic residents. The neighborhoods with the highest case rates are\u00a0Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, Hyde Park, Jamaica Plain, and South End.\u00a0\n\u201cWith flu spreading throughout Boston at such a high rate, there\u2019s an urgent need for more residents to get vaccinated to protect themselves and help avoid an even greater influx of cases and hospitalizations during and after the holidays,\u201d said Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, Commissioner of Public Health and Executive Director of the Boston Public Health Commission. \u201cI urge everyone to be safe this holiday season. Stay home if you\u2019re sick and call your doctor to ask about treatments for flu and COVID-19, in addition to staying up to date on vaccinations, wear a mask indoors to reduce your risk of illness. \u00a0\n\u00a0The Boston Public Health Commission strongly urges all residents 6-months and older get their annual flu vaccine, in addition to their COVID-19 vaccines, and that those 5 years and older get their bivalent boosters, to ensure the broadest level of protection against respiratory viral infection. The flu can be a very serious illness, especially for older adults and young children. \u00a0\nFlu vaccines are free and widely available throughout Boston. BPHC has several standing, walk-in sites where residents can get free flu vaccines, as well as COVID-19 testing, vaccines, and boosters. No insurance or ID is needed:\u00a0\nPrescription antiviral drugs are available for people who are sick with flu to shorten the length of the illness, and to prevent severe disease and the need for hospitalization. For those\u00a0at higher risk of serious flu complications, such as people 65 years and older, children younger than 2 years, people who are pregnant, and people with medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes or heart disease, treatment with influenza antiviral drugs can mean the difference between milder or more serious illness that may result in hospitalization. BPHC recommends that anyone who feels sick with symptoms of flu, especially those\u00a0at high risk of serious flu complications, check with their\u00a0health care provider promptly to ask about flu treatment. Flu symptoms can include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue. Other important ways to manage flu include getting rest and drinking enough water and other clear liquids to prevent dehydration.\u00a0\nBPHC\u00a0also encourages individuals\u00a0to wear high-quality, well-fitting masks\u00a0to prevent the spread of the flu, COVID-19, and RSV during this holiday season. \u00a0\nAs residents gather for the holidays, being up to date on COVID-19 and flu vaccines and knowing how to access treatments for both illnesses if you get sick is critical to avoid severe illness and hospitalization.\u00a0For information about flu treatment, call your healthcare provider. For additional information about flu or support getting a healthcare provider, call the Mayor\u2019s Health Line at 617-534-5050.\n"

      "\nSocial Links\nSan Francisco norovirus, Covid levels high as first flu death recorded this season\nShare\nSan Francisco is being hit with high levels of several illnesses, including the nasty stomach bug norovirus, Covid and RSV, according to an analysis of city sewage by WastewaterSCAN.\nAlthough San Francisco Covid levels are dropping as 2024 kicks off, around Christmas, part of San Francisco saw the highest Covid levels since data collection began roughly a year and a half ago.\nInfluenza virus levels remain low but continue to tick up, as the city announced Monday that its first flu death of the season happened last week.\nNorovirus\nNorovirus levels in San Francisco have surged, peaking around New Year\u2019s Eve and remaining high as levels slowly drop.\nAt the city\u2019s Oceanside wastewater plant, which recycles wastewater for San Francisco\u2019s western neighborhoods, levels started to spike after Dec. 19 until peaking on Dec. 29 and Dec. 31 before starting to decline, although levels on Jan. 7 remain elevated compared with levels before Christmas Eve.\nNorovirus levels at the Southeast plant, which recycles wastewater for San Francisco\u2019s eastern neighborhoods, are starting to drop after a surge between Dec. 17 and Dec. 29, although levels are still high compared with levels during early and mid-December.\nOn Sunday, norovirus levels were up by 114% at the Oceanside plant and 58% at the Southeast plant compared with the same date one month ago.\nFlu\nInfluenza levels in San Francisco are on the uptick but are drastically lower than they were during the 2022-2023 flu season.\nDespite flu levels being much lower this season, the first flu death in the city claimed the life of an adult under the age of 65 who was not vaccinated and had preexisting medical conditions, the Department of Public Health said.\nDuring this flu season, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says typically spans between December and February, influenza levels at the city\u2019s Oceanside plant began to surge on Nov. 1 before dipping after Thanksgiving and spiking again after Christmas. Virus levels dropped after Dec. 27 but have begun to creep back up since Jan. 5.\nAt the city\u2019s Southeast plant, influenza levels followed a similar trend, beginning to increase on Nov. 8 and peaking on Nov. 26 before dropping in mid-December. Virus levels spiked again after Dec. 13 and peaked even higher on Dec. 22 and began dropping the next day. As of Monday, virus levels at the Southeast plant are dropping and remain below the December low.\nCovid\nCovid is trending down from a peak roughly a week ago as the city exits the holiday season.\nDespite the downward trend in San Francisco, part of the city is seeing the highest levels of Covid infections since wastewater data collection began in mid-2022.\nREAD MORE: San Francisco Covid Levels Spike Just in Time for Holiday Travel Peak\nWastewater from the city\u2019s Southeast treatment plant had the highest wastewater Covid virus levels on Dec. 25 since records began in May 2022, according to WastewaterSCAN.\nAt the Oceanside plant, Covid levels have fluctuated but remained high between Dec. 18 and Sunday, the latest available data.

The severity of the infections in San Diego County has remained mild, with no hospitalizations reported to date. The initial investigations identified 41 probable and confirmed norovirus cases linked to oysters harvested in Sonora, Mexico. Cases to date have been tied to oysters served at three locations of The Fish Shop -- in Pacific Beach, Point Loma and Encinitas -- and the Carlsbad Aquafar. Twenty-eight more cases have been added, including 20 who ate oysters from other food venues.\nOyster-Connected Norovirus Outbreak\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t41 norovirus cases linked to raw oysters sold in San Diego County\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRaw oysters sold in San Diego County linked to dozens of norovirus cases\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\"The county recommends that people ask where oysters were harvested when eating out or getting food from wholesale locations to avoid consuming oysters imported from Mexico,\" said Dr. Ankita Kadakia, deputy county public health officer. \"Norovirus is typically a mild illness but can cause dehydration especially for the very young and very old.\n\"Given the increasing number of cases, the chance for others at greater risk for more severe illness in the same home is also increased,\" Kadakia said. \"I want to remind people who become ill, and those that live with them, to wash their hands frequently to avoid contaminating surfaces and foods that could further spread the infection.\"\nAccording to the county, oyster-associated norovirus cases are also being reported in Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Both the California Department of Public Health and U.S. Food and Drug Administration are now actively engaged in the investigation.\nThe FDA, which has jurisdiction over oysters imported into the country, issued an initial advisory on Jan. 11, based, at least in part, on the findings of the investigation conducted by county health officials, a statement from the county read.\nOn Wednesday, the FDA then issued a second advisory for Laguna De Guerrero Negro and Laguna Manuela, both on the Pacific Coast of Baja California, Mexico but locations geographically distant from Sonora. Thursday, FDA updated the initial advisory on Sonora oysters to include a second harvest location, Estero Morua.\nThe new FDA recommendations advise restaurants and retailers to dispose of any oysters they still have or contact their distributor to coordinate return or destruction. People who have them in their homes should do the same.\n\"All of the implicated oysters were harvested in December 2023 and no oysters since then have been distributed to food venues in San Diego from those locations,\" the county statement reads.\nIf you eat raw or undercooked oysters, germs that might be in the oyster can make you sick.\nPeople infected with norovirus generally develop nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever and body aches 12 to 48 hours after consuming contaminated foods. The illness typically lasts for 1-3 days. The vomiting and diarrhea can lead to dehydration requiring medical attention, especially in young children, older adults and people with other illnesses.\nHHSA is working with the California Department of Public Health, including the Shellfish Program, to continue investigating illnesses associated with oysters. To report illness to the County after dining out or purchasing from wholesale food locations call 858-505-6814, or email fhdepi@sdcounty.ca.gov.\nTrending Stories\nWeather Forecast\n"

On July 29, health officials announced four cases of Zika infection in Miami that were most likely acquired via the bite of local mosquitoes. On August 1, Florida reported 10 more cases in the city.\nNo mosquitoes in the state have yet tested positive for Zika, but officials suspect Aedes aegypti is to blame. Florida has been spraying insecticides daily, but experts are still seeing new larval mosquitoes and \u201cmoderately high\u201d counts of A. aegypti. Miami\u2019s mosquitoes may be resistant to the insecticides or holed up in hard-to-find breeding spots: small pools of standing water where larvae can hatch, Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a news briefing August 1.\nOfficials have pinned the area of exposure to a 150-meter radius just west of Biscayne Bay. The CDC has now\u00a0warned pregnant women to avoid a one-mile zone\u00a0surrounding the area. A. aegypti doesn\u2019t typically range far from home, so Frieden doesn\u2019t expect to see widespread transmission. \u00a0\nQuestions or comments on this article?

      "Article Contents\n\r\n                        Epidemiology of Zika Virus Infection\r\n \nCite\nSusan L Hills, Marc Fischer, Lyle R Petersen,  Epidemiology of Zika Virus Infection, The Journal of Infectious Diseases, Volume 216, Issue suppl_10, 15 December 2017, Pages S868\u2013S874, https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jix434\nAbstract\nLong known to be endemic in Africa and Southeast Asia and a rare cause of acute febrile illness, Zika virus (ZIKAV) arose from obscurity when an Asian genotype ZIKAV caused an outbreak of mild febrile illness in 2007 in Yap State, Federated States of Micronesia. Subsequent viral spread in the Pacific led to a large outbreak in French Polynesia commencing in 2013. After its recognition in the Americas through March 2017, the Pan American Health Organization has received reports of >750000 suspected and laboratory-confirmed cases of autochthonous ZIKAV transmission. Outbreaks in most countries in the Americas peaked in early to mid-2016. Increased surveillance in several Southeast Asian counties has led to increased case recognition, including an outbreak in Singapore, and the first reports of birth defects linked to ZIKAV in the region. As of April 2017, the World Health Organization reported 84 countries or territories with current or previous ZIKAV transmission.\nZika virus (ZIKAV) is a flavivirus transmitted to humans primarily by Aedes (Stegomyia subgenus) mosquitoes. Other documented modes of transmission include sexual, intrauterine, perinatal, laboratory exposure, and probably blood transfusion [1\u20136]. Most ZIKAV infections are asymptomatic [7]. When clinical illness occurs, it is generally mild with characteristic clinical symptoms of maculopapular rash, fever, arthralgia, and/or nonpurulent conjunctivitis. However, ZIKAV infection during pregnancy can cause adverse outcomes, such as fetal loss, congenital microcephaly, or other serious brain anomalies [1]. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), and rare cases of encephalopathy, meningoencephalitis, myelitis, uveitis, paresthesia, and severe thrombocytopenia have also been reported after ZIKAV infection [8\u201314].\nZIKAV was first isolated in 1947 in the Zika Forest of Uganda from a sentinel rhesus monkey that was part of a yellow fever research study [15]. Before 2007, only sporadic human disease cases were reported from countries in Africa and southeast Asia [4, 16\u201318]. In 2007, the first documented ZIKAV disease outbreak was reported in Yap State, Federated States of Micronesia [7]. In 2013, an outbreak began in French Polynesia, and the virus subsequently spread to other Pacific islands [18]. In May 2015, ZIKAV transmission was reported in Brazil and was subsequently detected through much of the Americas. Cumulatively, as of March 2017, a total of 84 countries or territories globally had reported autochthonous mosquito-borne ZIKAV transmission, including 61 countries or territories with new introduction of ZIKAV since January 2015 (Figure 1) [19].\nCountries and territories with evidence of current or past transmission of Zika virus (as of March 2017). Introduction of Zika virus before 2015 but transmission interrupted (Easter Island [Chile], Cook Islands, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu).\nZIKAV IN THE AMERICAS\nIn May 2015, Brazil reported confirmed autochthonous mosquito-borne ZIKAV transmission [20]. Confirmation of ZIKAV presence followed testing of samples collected earlier in 2015 from patients with febrile rash illnesses in northeastern Brazil, although retrospective phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses have suggested that introduction of the virus into Brazil may have occurred as early as 2013 [21\u201323]. In October 2015, Colombia reported confirmation of local mosquito-borne ZIKAV transmission, and transmission was subsequently reported from much of South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and parts of North America [24]. Retrospectively, circulation of ZIKAV in Haiti as early as December 2014 was demonstrated [25]. As of April 2017, autochthonous mosquito-borne ZIKAV transmission has been confirmed in 49 countries or territories in the Americas [19, 26]. The only countries that have not reported mosquito-borne transmission are Bermuda, Canada, and Uruguay; continental Chile also has not reported mosquito-borne ZIKAV disease cases, but transmission was reported on Easter Island, a territory of Chile, in 2014 [27].\nFrom January 2015 through March 2017, a total of 754460 suspected and laboratory-confirmed autochthonous cases of ZIKAV disease had been reported to the Pan American Health Organization from countries and territories in the Americas [28], 27% of which were laboratory confirmed. The largest number of suspected and confirmed cases were reported from Brazil (346475 cases; 46%) followed by Colombia (107206; 14%), and Venezuela (62200; 8%) (Table 1). Overall by region, South America accounted for 70% of reported cases, the Caribbean 21%, Central America 9%, and North America 1%. Incidence rates were highest in the Caribbean countries and territories, with Saint Barthelemy reporting the highest rate, 10510 cases per 100000 population (Table 2). Although the strength of surveillance systems and the timing of introduction of ZIKAV into countries probably affected these national figures, making comparisons difficult, large and explosive outbreaks clearly occurred in many countries and territories, probably due to introduction of the virus into immunologically naive populations and widespread presence of vectors. During this period, 20 deaths among patients with ZIKAV disease (excluding those with GBS or congenital ZIKAV infection) were reported in the Americas, for a case fatality rate of <0.003%.\nSuspected and Confirmed Autochthonous ZIKAV Disease Cases Reported by Countries and Territories in the Americas, 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017\nAbbreviation: ZIKAV, Zika virus. \naReported to the Pan American Health Organization from 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017 [28].\nSuspected and Confirmed Autochthonous ZIKAV Disease Cases Reported by Countries and Territories in the Americas, 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017\nAbbreviation: ZIKAV, Zika virus. \naReported to the Pan American Health Organization from 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017 [28].\nCountries and Territories in the Americas With Highest Reported ZIKAV Disease Incidence, 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017a\nAbbreviation: ZIKAV, Zika virus.\naSuspected and confirmed autochthonous ZIKAV disease cases reported to the Pan American Health Organization from 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017 [28].\nbPopulation based on average 2015\u20132017 population for countries that reported their first ZIKAV disease case in 2015, and 2016\u20132017 population for those that reported their first case in 2016.\nCountries and Territories in the Americas With Highest Reported ZIKAV Disease Incidence, 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017a\nAbbreviation: ZIKAV, Zika virus.\naSuspected and confirmed autochthonous ZIKAV disease cases reported to the Pan American Health Organization from 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017 [28].\nbPopulation based on average 2015\u20132017 population for countries that reported their first ZIKAV disease case in 2015, and 2016\u20132017 population for those that reported their first case in 2016.\nReported ZIKAV disease case numbers in the Americas peaked in February 2016 (Figure 2). However, disease incidence peaked at variable times in different countries and subregions. In the South America region, incidence peaked in February 2016 and subsequently declined [24, 26]. In the Central America region, incidence peaked in January 2016 and initially declined, although a secondary smaller peak occurred in mid-2016. Incidence in the Caribbean region gradually increased during 2016, peaking in mid-2016, later than in the South and Central American regions. In the North America region, incidence rates have remained low; most cases in this region are reported from Mexico, which reports only laboratory-confirmed cases. Although the reported incidence was low in all regions in early 2017, there have been occasional increases in reporting from some countries. The large outbreaks observed in 2016 are unlikely to be seen in 2017 because herd immunity will probably reduce transmission in many areas, but localized outbreaks are likely to continue as the virus is introduced into new areas and susceptible populations are exposed. Based on transmission patterns for other Aedes mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya virus disease, ZIKAV transmission will be interrupted in some areas, particularly in small island nations, but the disease is likely to become endemic in some countries of the Americas [29].\nSuspected and confirmed Zika virus disease cases in the Americas reported to the Pan American Health Organization [24] by epidemiological week, May 2015 to December 2016.\nIn late 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported an unusual increase in congenital microcephaly cases suspected to be associated with ZIKAV infection during pregnancy. In addition, concerns regarding a possible association between ZIKAV infection and GBS had been raised by investigators in Brazil and French Polynesia [30\u201332]. This ultimately led to the declaration by the World Health Organization of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016 [33]. As of March 2017, 24 countries and territories in the Americas had reported 2767 confirmed cases of microcephaly or central nervous system malformations associated with ZIKAV infection during pregnancy. Twenty-two countries and territories had reported \u22651 ZIKAV-associated GBS case, including 15 that reported an increase in GBS incidence compared with baseline rates [26].\nZIKAV IN STATES AND TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES\nZIKAV Disease in Travelers From US States\nFrom 2007\u20132014, 14 ZIKAV disease cases were identified among US travelers, based on testing performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [34]. These cases included 12 with travel to Pacific Island countries or territories and 2 with travel to Africa [34, 35]. ZIKAV disease was formally added to the United States nationally notifiable condition list in February 2016 [36]. Cases are reported to the CDC by health departments using a standard case definition [37].\nBased on preliminary data, US states and the District of Columbia reported 4937 cases of laboratory-confirmed ZIKAV disease among returning overseas travelers from January 2015 to April 2017. Overall, 3181 (64%) reported cases were in female travelers, although the higher percentage of reported cases in female compared with male travelers might reflect care-seeking behavior arising from concerns about ZIKAV infection during pregnancy. The median age among reported case patients was 38 years (range, 11 months to 89 years), with 79% aged 20\u201359 years. The number of traveler cases peaked in July 2016 (Figure 3). The most frequently reported travel destinations were countries and territories in the Caribbean (2384 cases; 48%), followed by Central America (797; 16%), North America (519; 11%), South America (202; 4%), Pacific Islands (14; <1%), and Asia (11; <1%); the reported location of travel included >1 subregion for 18 persons (<1%) and was unspecified for 992 (20%). Forty-six cases of ZIKAV disease acquired through sexual transmission from returning travelers were also reported.\nLaboratory-confirmed Zika virus disease cases reported from US states and the District of Colombia by month of illness onset, from January 2015 to April 2017 (provisional data, April 2017).\nZIKAV in the Continental United States\nLocal transmission of ZIKAV in the continental United States has been identified in 2 states, Florida and Texas. In Florida, 4 ZIKAV disease cases in persons with no recent travel history were identified in residents of 2 counties in July 2016 [38]. Further investigation revealed that 2 of these case patients were employees at workplaces in close geographic proximity in Miami\u2013Dade County, and epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of the worksites and surrounding neighborhood ultimately identified additional persons with evidence of recent ZIKAV infection, with likely exposure from late June onward. As a result, a 2.6-km2 (1\u2013square mile) zone of possible active ZIKAV transmission in the Wynwood area in Miami\u2013Dade County, encompassing an approximately 6-block area, was designated in August 2016. This zone remained in place for approximately 7 weeks until it was lifted in September after 45 days with no evidence of active ZIKAV transmission. \nActive transmission was also identified in 2 additional small areas of Miami\u2013Dade County. In August, an approximately 4-km2 (1.5\u2013square mile) section in the Miami Beach area was designated as having active transmission, and this was expanded to an approximately 12-km2 (4.5\u2013square mile) area in September. In October, a 2.6-km2 (1\u2013square mile) active transmission area also was designated in the Little River area in Miami\u2013Dade County. An intensive public health response was implemented in all areas with active transmission, including mosquito control by ground-based and aerial adulticide and larvicide applications, and this probably helped control the outbreaks [38].\nAs of December 2016, no areas of Florida were considered to have ongoing, active mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKAV [39]. Sporadic cases of presumed local mosquito-borne ZIKAV infection were reported during 2016 from 3 additional Florida counties, but detailed investigations did not provide evidence of sustained multiperson local transmission of ZIKAV [39]. A total of 287 locally acquired ZIKAV infections in Florida had been reported by April 2017. Most were identified and reported during 2016, although there have been some reports in 2017 of persons with asymptomatic infections probably acquired during 2016. Among these 287 ZIKAV infections, 217 were reported to the CDC as symptomatic ZIKAV disease cases.\nIn Texas, the first case of local mosquito-borne ZIKAV disease was reported in Brownsville in November 2016 [40]. Brownsville borders Tamaulipas state, Mexico, where confirmed ZIKAV disease cases had been reported [41]. An additional 5 ZIKAV disease cases were subsequently reported from the Brownsville area [42]. All 6 case patients lived in close geographic proximity.\nZIKAV Disease in US Territories\nZIKAV outbreaks have occurred in 3 US territories, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. From January 2015 through April 2017, there were 36432 laboratory-confirmed ZIKAV disease cases acquired through presumed local mosquito-borne transmission in these US territories reported to the CDC, and 143 cases in travelers returning from other affected areas. Among the 36432 locally acquired cases, 22684 (62%) were in female patients. The median age of reported case patients was 32 years (range, <1 month to 100 years), and 76% were aged <50 years.\nIn December 2015, Puerto Rico became the first US territory to report autochthonous transmission of ZIKAV, after initiation of ZIKAV disease surveillance and subsequent identification of a patient with symptom onset in November [43]. The number of reported cases remained relatively low through April 2016, then increased quickly and peaked in August. Cases then steadily declined with low-level transmission continuing into 2017. Transmission appeared to begin in the heavily populated eastern area of the island and subsequently spread, with cases reported in residents of all 78 municipalities [43, 44]. As of April 2017, a total of 35280 cases of presumed local mosquito-borne transmission had been reported to the CDC.\nIn April 2016, ZIKAV screening of blood donations was implemented in Puerto Rico. Modeling of screening data suggested a 13% island-wide cumulative incidence of ZIKAV infection from April through mid-August [45]. Serosurveys before and after a 2014 outbreak in Puerto Rico of chikungunya virus disease, another arbovirus transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, estimated that about 23% of blood donors in Puerto Rico had acquired chikungunya virus infections [46]. Based on an estimated cumulative incidence of ZIKAV infection of almost 13% by mid-August, 2016, and recognizing that transmission continued thereafter, it is conceivable that about 20%\u201225% of the Puerto Rico population was infected with ZIKAV during 2016, similar to the 2014 chikungunya infection rate.\nIn the US Virgin Islands, the first patient with laboratory-confirmed ZIKAV disease had symptom onset in January 2016. As of April 2017, a total of 1020 cases of presumed local mosquito-borne transmission had been reported to the CDC, with 85% of all cases having symptom onset between July and November 2016. From January to December 2016 in American Samoa, 132 cases acquired through presumed local mosquito-borne transmission were reported to the CDC. The last ZIKAV disease case detected by means of real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction occurred in a patient with symptom onset in June 2016. Although serologically confirmed cases continued to be reported, serologic cross-reactivity between ZIKAV and other flaviviruses (eg, dengue virus) circulating in American Samoa, and the possible long duration of anti-ZIKAV immunoglobulin M antibody positivity, meant that serological diagnoses were considered too nonspecific to indicate ongoing ZIKAV transmission. Without evidence of any additional reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction\u2013positive cases, despite enhanced surveillance for and testing of patients with compatible symptoms, the outbreak in American Samoa was considered interrupted in October 2016 [47].\nZIKAV IN AFRICA, ASIA, AND THE PACIFIC\nUntil 2015, only sporadic ZIKAV disease cases were reported from Africa, likely a result of the nonspecific clinical presentation of disease with symptoms similar to those of other infectious diseases, limited availability of testing, and the potential for misdiagnosis based on flavivirus cross-reactivity in diagnostic tests. Despite this lack of case reporting, it is clear there was ongoing ZIKAV circulation in parts of Africa, suggested by detection of human cases on retrospective testing of patient cohorts, reports of infection in travelers, and detection of virus in mosquito surveys [35, 48\u201351]. Two African countries reported local ZIKAV transmission for the first time in 2016; Guinea Bissau reported its first case of ZIKAV disease, and 2 cases of infection acquired in Angola were reported, 1 in a resident and 1 in a traveler [52, 53]. Since its emergence in the Americas, ZIKAV also has also been reintroduced to Africa. In October 2015, Cabo Verde reported a ZIKAV disease outbreak [54]. Sequencing of the virus confirmed it was the Asian genotype, the first time this genotype had been detected in Africa. As of May 2016, there had been 7557 suspected ZIKAV disease cases reported from Cabo Verde [55]. Three cases of microcephaly had been reported.\nIn Asia, occasional cases in residents and travelers and small outbreaks had been reported in the decades after recognition of ZIKAV transmission in the region during the 1950s [17, 56\u201364]. However improved awareness of and surveillance for ZIKAV disease since the outbreak in the Americas have resulted in increased detection and reporting in the region. Retrospective testing of samples in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic identified previously unrecognized patients with ZIKAV disease from the last 5\u201210 years [53, 64\u201366]. Thailand substantially enhanced surveillance during 2016 and reported a considerable increase in ZIKAV disease cases, as well as 2 cases of congenital Zika syndrome, the first such cases in the South-East Asia Region [67]. In November 2016, Vietnam became the second country in Southeast Asia to report a case of microcephaly potentially linked with ZIKAV [67]. Singapore had not previously reported ZIKAV disease, but the Ministry of Health reported the first local outbreak there in August 2016, and several small clusters and sporadic cases have been reported into 2017 [68\u201370].\nIn the Pacific region, soon after the recognition of the ZIKAV disease in French Polynesia in 2013, outbreaks were reported in New Caledonia and Cook Islands beginning in early 2014, and subsequently in Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Samoa, and Fiji in early to mid-2015 [18, 71]. In Papua New Guinea, retrospectively tested samples from patients who had presented with febrile illness during outbreaks of malaria and dengue in 2015 also indicated the presence of ZIKAV there during the same period [72]. Cases have subsequently been reported in several other countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean (Tonga, Kosrae State\u2013Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Palau, and as described above, American Samoa) [53].\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor many decades ZIKAV infection was considered a mild disease, but recent years have shown its potential for a variety of severe outcomes and elevated the virus\u2019s importance to that of a global public health priority. The complete global burden of ZIKAV disease is difficult to accurately determine. Because disease is often clinically mild, patients might not seek medical care. Among those who do, the clinical picture might be mistaken for another illness with similar presentation (eg, dengue or chikungunya virus disease), testing might not be available or requested, and diagnosed cases might not be reported. Congenital, neurological, or other adverse outcomes might not be recognized as being ZIKAV associated. Conversely, given the considerable attention currently being given to ZIKAV, reporting might overestimate the true disease incidence as cases due to other causes may be attributed to ZIKAV infection in the absence of laboratory testing. \nIn November 2016, recognizing that research had confirmed the link between ZIKAV infection and microcephaly, the World Health Organization declared that ZIKAV and associated complications no longer represent a public health emergency of international concern but are rather an enduring public health challenge best managed through long-term coordinated action [73]. Sustained attention to ZIKAV will be needed, because there is still much to understand about its epidemiology and natural history.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.

Subsequent viral spread in the Pacific led to a large outbreak in French Polynesia commencing in 2013. After its recognition in the Americas through March 2017, the Pan American Health Organization has received reports of >750000 suspected and laboratory-confirmed cases of autochthonous ZIKAV transmission. Outbreaks in most countries in the Americas peaked in early to mid-2016. Increased surveillance in several Southeast Asian counties has led to increased case recognition, including an outbreak in Singapore, and the first reports of birth defects linked to ZIKAV in the region. As of April 2017, the World Health Organization reported 84 countries or territories with current or previous ZIKAV transmission.\nZika virus (ZIKAV) is a flavivirus transmitted to humans primarily by Aedes (Stegomyia subgenus) mosquitoes. Other documented modes of transmission include sexual, intrauterine, perinatal, laboratory exposure, and probably blood transfusion [1\u20136]. Most ZIKAV infections are asymptomatic [7]. When clinical illness occurs, it is generally mild with characteristic clinical symptoms of maculopapular rash, fever, arthralgia, and/or nonpurulent conjunctivitis. However, ZIKAV infection during pregnancy can cause adverse outcomes, such as fetal loss, congenital microcephaly, or other serious brain anomalies [1]. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), and rare cases of encephalopathy, meningoencephalitis, myelitis, uveitis, paresthesia, and severe thrombocytopenia have also been reported after ZIKAV infection [8\u201314].\nZIKAV was first isolated in 1947 in the Zika Forest of Uganda from a sentinel rhesus monkey that was part of a yellow fever research study [15]. Before 2007, only sporadic human disease cases were reported from countries in Africa and southeast Asia [4, 16\u201318]. In 2007, the first documented ZIKAV disease outbreak was reported in Yap State, Federated States of Micronesia [7]. In 2013, an outbreak began in French Polynesia, and the virus subsequently spread to other Pacific islands [18]. In May 2015, ZIKAV transmission was reported in Brazil and was subsequently detected through much of the Americas. Cumulatively, as of March 2017, a total of 84 countries or territories globally had reported autochthonous mosquito-borne ZIKAV transmission, including 61 countries or territories with new introduction of ZIKAV since January 2015 (Figure 1) [19].\nCountries and territories with evidence of current or past transmission of Zika virus (as of March 2017). Introduction of Zika virus before 2015 but transmission interrupted (Easter Island [Chile], Cook Islands, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu).\nZIKAV IN THE AMERICAS\nIn May 2015, Brazil reported confirmed autochthonous mosquito-borne ZIKAV transmission [20]. Confirmation of ZIKAV presence followed testing of samples collected earlier in 2015 from patients with febrile rash illnesses in northeastern Brazil, although retrospective phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses have suggested that introduction of the virus into Brazil may have occurred as early as 2013 [21\u201323]. In October 2015, Colombia reported confirmation of local mosquito-borne ZIKAV transmission, and transmission was subsequently reported from much of South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and parts of North America [24]. Retrospectively, circulation of ZIKAV in Haiti as early as December 2014 was demonstrated [25]. As of April 2017, autochthonous mosquito-borne ZIKAV transmission has been confirmed in 49 countries or territories in the Americas [19, 26]. The only countries that have not reported mosquito-borne transmission are Bermuda, Canada, and Uruguay; continental Chile also has not reported mosquito-borne ZIKAV disease cases, but transmission was reported on Easter Island, a territory of Chile, in 2014 [27].\nFrom January 2015 through March 2017, a total of 754460 suspected and laboratory-confirmed autochthonous cases of ZIKAV disease had been reported to the Pan American Health Organization from countries and territories in the Americas [28], 27% of which were laboratory confirmed. The largest number of suspected and confirmed cases were reported from Brazil (346475 cases; 46%) followed by Colombia (107206; 14%), and Venezuela (62200; 8%) (Table 1). Overall by region, South America accounted for 70% of reported cases, the Caribbean 21%, Central America 9%, and North America 1%. Incidence rates were highest in the Caribbean countries and territories, with Saint Barthelemy reporting the highest rate, 10510 cases per 100000 population (Table 2). Although the strength of surveillance systems and the timing of introduction of ZIKAV into countries probably affected these national figures, making comparisons difficult, large and explosive outbreaks clearly occurred in many countries and territories, probably due to introduction of the virus into immunologically naive populations and widespread presence of vectors. During this period, 20 deaths among patients with ZIKAV disease (excluding those with GBS or congenital ZIKAV infection) were reported in the Americas, for a case fatality rate of <0.003%.\nSuspected and Confirmed Autochthonous ZIKAV Disease Cases Reported by Countries and Territories in the Americas, 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017\nAbbreviation: ZIKAV, Zika virus. \naReported to the Pan American Health Organization from 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017 [28].\nSuspected and Confirmed Autochthonous ZIKAV Disease Cases Reported by Countries and Territories in the Americas, 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017\nAbbreviation: ZIKAV, Zika virus. \naReported to the Pan American Health Organization from 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017 [28].\nCountries and Territories in the Americas With Highest Reported ZIKAV Disease Incidence, 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017a\nAbbreviation: ZIKAV, Zika virus.\naSuspected and confirmed autochthonous ZIKAV disease cases reported to the Pan American Health Organization from 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017 [28].\nbPopulation based on average 2015\u20132017 population for countries that reported their first ZIKAV disease case in 2015, and 2016\u20132017 population for those that reported their first case in 2016.\nCountries and Territories in the Americas With Highest Reported ZIKAV Disease Incidence, 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017a\nAbbreviation: ZIKAV, Zika virus.\naSuspected and confirmed autochthonous ZIKAV disease cases reported to the Pan American Health Organization from 1 January 2015 to 9 March 2017 [28].\nbPopulation based on average 2015\u20132017 population for countries that reported their first ZIKAV disease case in 2015, and 2016\u20132017 population for those that reported their first case in 2016.\nReported ZIKAV disease case numbers in the Americas peaked in February 2016 (Figure 2). However, disease incidence peaked at variable times in different countries and subregions. In the South America region, incidence peaked in February 2016 and subsequently declined [24, 26]. In the Central America region, incidence peaked in January 2016 and initially declined, although a secondary smaller peak occurred in mid-2016. Incidence in the Caribbean region gradually increased during 2016, peaking in mid-2016, later than in the South and Central American regions. In the North America region, incidence rates have remained low; most cases in this region are reported from Mexico, which reports only laboratory-confirmed cases. Although the reported incidence was low in all regions in early 2017, there have been occasional increases in reporting from some countries. The large outbreaks observed in 2016 are unlikely to be seen in 2017 because herd immunity will probably reduce transmission in many areas, but localized outbreaks are likely to continue as the virus is introduced into new areas and susceptible populations are exposed. Based on transmission patterns for other Aedes mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya virus disease, ZIKAV transmission will be interrupted in some areas, particularly in small island nations, but the disease is likely to become endemic in some countries of the Americas [29].\nSuspected and confirmed Zika virus disease cases in the Americas reported to the Pan American Health Organization [24] by epidemiological week, May 2015 to December 2016.\nIn late 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported an unusual increase in congenital microcephaly cases suspected to be associated with ZIKAV infection during pregnancy. In addition, concerns regarding a possible association between ZIKAV infection and GBS had been raised by investigators in Brazil and French Polynesia [30\u201332]. This ultimately led to the declaration by the World Health Organization of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016 [33]. As of March 2017, 24 countries and territories in the Americas had reported 2767 confirmed cases of microcephaly or central nervous system malformations associated with ZIKAV infection during pregnancy. Twenty-two countries and territories had reported \u22651 ZIKAV-associated GBS case, including 15 that reported an increase in GBS incidence compared with baseline rates [26].\nZIKAV IN STATES AND TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES\nZIKAV Disease in Travelers From US States\nFrom 2007\u20132014, 14 ZIKAV disease cases were identified among US travelers, based on testing performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [34]. These cases included 12 with travel to Pacific Island countries or territories and 2 with travel to Africa [34, 35]. ZIKAV disease was formally added to the United States nationally notifiable condition list in February 2016 [36]. Cases are reported to the CDC by health departments using a standard case definition [37].\nBased on preliminary data, US states and the District of Columbia reported 4937 cases of laboratory-confirmed ZIKAV disease among returning overseas travelers from January 2015 to April 2017. Overall, 3181 (64%) reported cases were in female travelers, although the higher percentage of reported cases in female compared with male travelers might reflect care-seeking behavior arising from concerns about ZIKAV infection during pregnancy. The median age among reported case patients was 38 years (range, 11 months to 89 years), with 79% aged 20\u201359 years. The number of traveler cases peaked in July 2016 (Figure 3). The most frequently reported travel destinations were countries and territories in the Caribbean (2384 cases; 48%), followed by Central America (797; 16%), North America (519; 11%), South America (202; 4%), Pacific Islands (14; <1%), and Asia (11; <1%); the reported location of travel included >1 subregion for 18 persons (<1%) and was unspecified for 992 (20%). Forty-six cases of ZIKAV disease acquired through sexual transmission from returning travelers were also reported.\nLaboratory-confirmed Zika virus disease cases reported from US states and the District of Colombia by month of illness onset, from January 2015 to April 2017 (provisional data, April 2017).\nZIKAV in the Continental United States\nLocal transmission of ZIKAV in the continental United States has been identified in 2 states, Florida and Texas. In Florida, 4 ZIKAV disease cases in persons with no recent travel history were identified in residents of 2 counties in July 2016 [38]. Further investigation revealed that 2 of these case patients were employees at workplaces in close geographic proximity in Miami\u2013Dade County, and epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of the worksites and surrounding neighborhood ultimately identified additional persons with evidence of recent ZIKAV infection, with likely exposure from late June onward. As a result, a 2.6-km2 (1\u2013square mile) zone of possible active ZIKAV transmission in the Wynwood area in Miami\u2013Dade County, encompassing an approximately 6-block area, was designated in August 2016. This zone remained in place for approximately 7 weeks until it was lifted in September after 45 days with no evidence of active ZIKAV transmission. \nActive transmission was also identified in 2 additional small areas of Miami\u2013Dade County. In August, an approximately 4-km2 (1.5\u2013square mile) section in the Miami Beach area was designated as having active transmission, and this was expanded to an approximately 12-km2 (4.5\u2013square mile) area in September. In October, a 2.6-km2 (1\u2013square mile) active transmission area also was designated in the Little River area in Miami\u2013Dade County. An intensive public health response was implemented in all areas with active transmission, including mosquito control by ground-based and aerial adulticide and larvicide applications, and this probably helped control the outbreaks [38].\nAs of December 2016, no areas of Florida were considered to have ongoing, active mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKAV [39]. Sporadic cases of presumed local mosquito-borne ZIKAV infection were reported during 2016 from 3 additional Florida counties, but detailed investigations did not provide evidence of sustained multiperson local transmission of ZIKAV [39]. A total of 287 locally acquired ZIKAV infections in Florida had been reported by April 2017. Most were identified and reported during 2016, although there have been some reports in 2017 of persons with asymptomatic infections probably acquired during 2016. Among these 287 ZIKAV infections, 217 were reported to the CDC as symptomatic ZIKAV disease cases.\nIn Texas, the first case of local mosquito-borne ZIKAV disease was reported in Brownsville in November 2016 [40]. Brownsville borders Tamaulipas state, Mexico, where confirmed ZIKAV disease cases had been reported [41]. An additional 5 ZIKAV disease cases were subsequently reported from the Brownsville area [42]. All 6 case patients lived in close geographic proximity.\nZIKAV Disease in US Territories\nZIKAV outbreaks have occurred in 3 US territories, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. From January 2015 through April 2017, there were 36432 laboratory-confirmed ZIKAV disease cases acquired through presumed local mosquito-borne transmission in these US territories reported to the CDC, and 143 cases in travelers returning from other affected areas. Among the 36432 locally acquired cases, 22684 (62%) were in female patients. The median age of reported case patients was 32 years (range, <1 month to 100 years), and 76% were aged <50 years.\nIn December 2015, Puerto Rico became the first US territory to report autochthonous transmission of ZIKAV, after initiation of ZIKAV disease surveillance and subsequent identification of a patient with symptom onset in November [43]. The number of reported cases remained relatively low through April 2016, then increased quickly and peaked in August. Cases then steadily declined with low-level transmission continuing into 2017. Transmission appeared to begin in the heavily populated eastern area of the island and subsequently spread, with cases reported in residents of all 78 municipalities [43, 44]. As of April 2017, a total of 35280 cases of presumed local mosquito-borne transmission had been reported to the CDC.\nIn April 2016, ZIKAV screening of blood donations was implemented in Puerto Rico. Modeling of screening data suggested a 13% island-wide cumulative incidence of ZIKAV infection from April through mid-August [45]. Serosurveys before and after a 2014 outbreak in Puerto Rico of chikungunya virus disease, another arbovirus transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, estimated that about 23% of blood donors in Puerto Rico had acquired chikungunya virus infections [46]. Based on an estimated cumulative incidence of ZIKAV infection of almost 13% by mid-August, 2016, and recognizing that transmission continued thereafter, it is conceivable that about 20%\u201225% of the Puerto Rico population was infected with ZIKAV during 2016, similar to the 2014 chikungunya infection rate.\nIn the US Virgin Islands, the first patient with laboratory-confirmed ZIKAV disease had symptom onset in January 2016. As of April 2017, a total of 1020 cases of presumed local mosquito-borne transmission had been reported to the CDC, with 85% of all cases having symptom onset between July and November 2016. From January to December 2016 in American Samoa, 132 cases acquired through presumed local mosquito-borne transmission were reported to the CDC. The last ZIKAV disease case detected by means of real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction occurred in a patient with symptom onset in June 2016. Although serologically confirmed cases continued to be reported, serologic cross-reactivity between ZIKAV and other flaviviruses (eg, dengue virus) circulating in American Samoa, and the possible long duration of anti-ZIKAV immunoglobulin M antibody positivity, meant that serological diagnoses were considered too nonspecific to indicate ongoing ZIKAV transmission. Without evidence of any additional reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction\u2013positive cases, despite enhanced surveillance for and testing of patients with compatible symptoms, the outbreak in American Samoa was considered interrupted in October 2016 [47].\nZIKAV IN AFRICA, ASIA, AND THE PACIFIC\nUntil 2015, only sporadic ZIKAV disease cases were reported from Africa, likely a result of the nonspecific clinical presentation of disease with symptoms similar to those of other infectious diseases, limited availability of testing, and the potential for misdiagnosis based on flavivirus cross-reactivity in diagnostic tests. Despite this lack of case reporting, it is clear there was ongoing ZIKAV circulation in parts of Africa, suggested by detection of human cases on retrospective testing of patient cohorts, reports of infection in travelers, and detection of virus in mosquito surveys [35, 48\u201351]. Two African countries reported local ZIKAV transmission for the first time in 2016; Guinea Bissau reported its first case of ZIKAV disease, and 2 cases of infection acquired in Angola were reported, 1 in a resident and 1 in a traveler [52, 53]. Since its emergence in the Americas, ZIKAV also has also been reintroduced to Africa. In October 2015, Cabo Verde reported a ZIKAV disease outbreak [54]. Sequencing of the virus confirmed it was the Asian genotype, the first time this genotype had been detected in Africa. As of May 2016, there had been 7557 suspected ZIKAV disease cases reported from Cabo Verde [55]. Three cases of microcephaly had been reported.\nIn Asia, occasional cases in residents and travelers and small outbreaks had been reported in the decades after recognition of ZIKAV transmission in the region during the 1950s [17, 56\u201364]. However improved awareness of and surveillance for ZIKAV disease since the outbreak in the Americas have resulted in increased detection and reporting in the region. Retrospective testing of samples in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic identified previously unrecognized patients with ZIKAV disease from the last 5\u201210 years [53, 64\u201366]. Thailand substantially enhanced surveillance during 2016 and reported a considerable increase in ZIKAV disease cases, as well as 2 cases of congenital Zika syndrome, the first such cases in the South-East Asia Region [67]. In November 2016, Vietnam became the second country in Southeast Asia to report a case of microcephaly potentially linked with ZIKAV [67]. Singapore had not previously reported ZIKAV disease, but the Ministry of Health reported the first local outbreak there in August 2016, and several small clusters and sporadic cases have been reported into 2017 [68\u201370].\nIn the Pacific region, soon after the recognition of the ZIKAV disease in French Polynesia in 2013, outbreaks were reported in New Caledonia and Cook Islands beginning in early 2014, and subsequently in Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Samoa, and Fiji in early to mid-2015 [18, 71]. In Papua New Guinea, retrospectively tested samples from patients who had presented with febrile illness during outbreaks of malaria and dengue in 2015 also indicated the presence of ZIKAV there during the same period [72]. Cases have subsequently been reported in several other countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean (Tonga, Kosrae State\u2013Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Palau, and as described above, American Samoa) [53].\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor many decades ZIKAV infection was considered a mild disease, but recent years have shown its potential for a variety of severe outcomes and elevated the virus\u2019s importance to that of a global public health priority. The complete global burden of ZIKAV disease is difficult to accurately determine. Because disease is often clinically mild, patients might not seek medical care. Among those who do, the clinical picture might be mistaken for another illness with similar presentation (eg, dengue or chikungunya virus disease), testing might not be available or requested, and diagnosed cases might not be reported. Congenital, neurological, or other adverse outcomes might not be recognized as being ZIKAV associated. Conversely, given the considerable attention currently being given to ZIKAV, reporting might overestimate the true disease incidence as cases due to other causes may be attributed to ZIKAV infection in the absence of laboratory testing. \nIn November 2016, recognizing that research had confirmed the link between ZIKAV infection and microcephaly, the World Health Organization declared that ZIKAV and associated complications no longer represent a public health emergency of international concern but are rather an enduring public health challenge best managed through long-term coordinated action [73]. Sustained attention to ZIKAV will be needed, because there is still much to understand about its epidemiology and natural history.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.

Beginning today, the Index will show average real monthly revenue (deflated to 2017 dollars) per small business nationally, regionally, and by sector. The Index also tracks real monthly revenue in 20 states. Browse monthly revenue data from 2019 to the previous month with over month comparisons\u2014all seasonally adjusted. Learn more about the methodology behind the new small business revenue index.\nRevenue Index\nIn August 2024, average real monthly revenue for US small businesses with one to nine employees was $52,000 in 2017 dollars, which is equivalent to $63,800 per business today. The Index is deflated to 2017 dollars to remove the impact of inflation and track real changes in revenue. The Index is also seasonally adjusted.\nIn August 2024, monthly small business revenue increased in 7 of the 12 sectors covered by the Index. Education and health services (NAICS 61-62) saw the fastest growth, with a monthly increase of 0.67% to $34,000 on average per business. Wholesale trade (NAICS 41-42) saw the largest increase, up by $1,000 month-over-month (0.4%) to $265,600 on average per business.\nSmall business revenue increased in 6 of the 8 US regions in August compared to July. The Great Lakes increased the fastest\u2014with a monthly growth rate of 0.62%, adding $300 per small business, taking the monthly average to $51,400.\nExplore revenue data using the buttons and charts below\nEmployment Index\nIn August, employment for US small businesses with one to nine employees increased by 400 jobs compared to July (rounding to a 0% growth rate month-over-month). These small businesses now employ 12,982,100 people, based on the Index\u2019s latest projection from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data released in July.\u207a\nEmployment was fairly stagnant among the 12 sectors tracked by the Index, with zero or near zero growth in August. The construction sector (NAICS 23) added the most small business jobs\u2014500 in total\u2014with a monthly growth rate of 0.06%. Leisure and hospitality (NAICS 71-72) had the largest net loss\u2014down by 300 jobs, a monthly decline of 0.02%.\nLikewise, small business employment levels remained largely unchanged across all eight regions and all 20 states tracked by the Index. Employment in the Plains, the Great Lakes, and New England increased by just 0.01%, adding 200 jobs across all three regions combined. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania added 100 jobs each, increasing by 0.01% each month-over-month.\nExplore employment data using the buttons and charts below\nMore information\nGet more data insights from the interactive Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index dashboard.\nMedia inquiries\nMedia contact details for QuickBooks in the US can be found here on the Intuit website.\nCanada Index\nThe Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index is also published monthly in Canada.

Get the latest small business employment insights for the UK here.\nAbout the Index\nThe Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index is a timely new measure of small business employment and hiring in the US, Canada, and the UK. The Index launched in March 2023 and is updated monthly. The Index uses purpose-built economic models to normalize anonymized QuickBooks data to reflect the general population of small businesses in each country; it is not a reflection of Intuit\u2019s business. The Index was developed in collaboration with leading economist Professor Ufuk Akcigit and an international team of researchers and academics.\nMethodology\nThe Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index creates aggregated data outputs from a sample of anonymized QuickBooks Online Payroll customer records which are calibrated using statistical methods to create modeled results which better reflect the general population of small businesses in each country, as represented by published official statistics. Statistical adjustment ensures the Index truly reflects employment and job vacancy changes rather than trends in the QuickBooks customer base.\u00a0\nRead more or download the full methodology here.\u00a0\nRounded values\nTotal and monthly changes in employment and job vacancies have been rounded to the nearest hundred. Monthly changes and growth rates are calculated before total employment or job vacancy values are rounded. Rates have been rounded to the nearest hundredth.\nSeasonal adjustments\nThe Index\u2019s data insights are seasonally adjusted to limit the effect of seasonal patterns in employment and hiring throughout the year, which lead to regular fluctuations in workforce growth and contraction.\nEmployment growth formula\nEmployment growth(t) = [Employment(t)-Employment(t-1)]/[0.5*Employment(t)+0.5*Employment(t-1)]\n*Employment levels\nThe Index produces a monthly prediction of employment growth rates by country, region, and sector. In order to translate these growth rates into the number of jobs/vacancies gained or lost, the growth rates are multiplied by the prior month\u2019s predicted employment levels, except during the months when official statistics are published. During those months, the latest official employment levels that have been reported are used in the calculation instead of the Index\u2019s prior month\u2019s predicted employment levels. As a result, the Index\u2019s predicted total employment levels may at times differ from the predicted growth rates. Official statistics are published at different frequencies depending on the country ranging from monthly to quarterly.\n\u207aNote: The Index\u2019s economic model is refreshed every 2 to 4 months when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics updates its employment statistics. Official statistics are an essential component of the Index because they make it nationally representative of small business employment. Whenever they are updated, this provides new information that wasn\u2019t previously available, which is why the Index\u2019s latest estimates for small business employment sometimes differ from older estimates. The latest estimates always provide the most accurate picture of small business employment or hiring because they include the most up-to-date official statistics.\nTime series\nThe Index uses data going back to January 2015 in the US and Canada and to January 2018 in the UK. Published at the earliest opportunity every month, the Index shows the number of people employed by small businesses (in the US and Canada) or the number of job vacancies at small businesses (in the UK) in the previous month and how that number has changed since the month before. The Index helps to eliminate almost all of the time lags in official statistics by providing estimated projections of what those statistics will ultimately show when they are published.\nSample sizes\nThe total sample across all three countries is around 424,000 small businesses. The US sample is almost 333,000 small businesses. The Canadian sample is almost 66,000 small businesses. The UK sample is almost 25,000 small businesses. The minimum sample sizes for regions or sectors to be included in the Index are 1,000 small businesses in the US, 800 small businesses in Canada, and 200 small businesses in the UK.\u00a0\nTarget populations\nIn the US and UK, the Index targets the populations of small businesses with one to nine employees. In Canada, the target population is small businesses with one to 19 employees. The differences ensure the Index\u2019s data insights are consistent with official statistics in each country, which are used for benchmarking during the calibration process. Timely data insights for these populations of small businesses are particularly valuable since most datasets fail to cover this portion of the economy well. Please note: Unlike in the US and Canada, the UK Index uses job vacancy data for calibration rather than employment data because official employment statistics are not currently available for small businesses on a monthly basis.\u00a0\nExternal data sources\nExternal data sources used alongside the samples of anonymized QuickBooks Online Payroll customer data include:\nGeographic regions\nIndustry sectors\nDisclaimer\nThis content is for information purposes only and should not be considered legal, accounting or tax advice, or a substitute for obtaining professional advice specific to your business.

      "City of Chicago Office of Budget and Management Comparative Estimate of Revenue Collections March 2023 As the city continues its post-pandemic recovery in 2023, some revenue streams are expected to chart a faster path to recovery while others may lag based on economic conditions. Even during stable economic conditions, seasonality in some revenue streams and the irregular nature of others lead to significant variances from one month to the next that smooth out as the year progresses. MONTHLY ANALYSIS Total collections through March are $4.5 million or 0.7% lower than budget expectations. Collections from internal service earnings ($17.0 million), income taxes ($8.9 million), transaction taxes ($8.8 million), other revenue ($3.0 million), and leases, rentals, and sales ($1.3 million) are contributing to these variances. Internal service earnings variances through the year are timing related, while a slowdown in real estate activity is contributing to the underperformance in the real property transfer tax within the transaction taxes category for the third month in a row. Offsetting these lower-than-expected collections are revenues from charges for services ($22.3 million), fines, forfeitures, and penalties ($5.7 million), transportation taxes ($5.2 million), and business taxes ($1.9 million). It is important to note that the City does not collect revenue from a few major sources through the first quarter of the year, and that trends observed thus far are not sufficient to make adjustments to expectations for the full fiscal year. Some variances are likely timing related and should track closer to budget as the year progresses.

      "City of Chicago Office of Budget and Management Comparative Estimate of Revenue Collections September 2023 As the city continues its post-pandemic recovery in 2023, some revenue streams are expected to chart a faster path to recovery while others may lag based on economic conditions. Even during stable economic conditions, seasonality in some revenue streams and the irregular nature of others lead to significant variances from one month to the next that smooth out as the year progresses. MONTHLY ANALYSIS Total collections through September are $35.0 million or 1.1% under budget expectations. This variance is driven by favorable collections from the Personal Property Replacement Tax ($110.4 million), Business Taxes ($17.4 million) Charges for Service ($15.5 million), and Recreation Taxes ($13.5 million). Business Taxes and Recreation Taxes performances are driven by a healthy return to pre-pandemic leisure activity, large entertainment events, and increased tourism. The Charges for Service category is impacted by revenue from ground emergency medical transport. Offsetting this higher than budgeted revenue are collections from Internal Service Earnings ($119.1 million), the Sales Tax Residual ($46.9 million), and Transaction Taxes ($26.5 million). Variance in collections for internal service earnings are timing related while the lower-than-budgeted revenue from the Sales Tax Residual is due to less residual revenue coming to the Corporate Fund as more sales tax proceeds go towards debt service from a recent debt restructuring. Underperformance in Transaction Taxes is driven by the real property transfer tax which has been impacted by a slowdown in real estate activity through September. Additionally, collections for the Personal Property Replacement Tax remain unchanged from August due to the disbursement schedule. Although the City does not receive revenue from this Tax in the month of September, revenues have exceeded budget by $110.4 million, or 72.8%, year-to-date. This favorable variance has helped offset underperforming revenues and collections are expected to exceed budget once again in October, the next disbursement month. The Office of Budget and Management (OBM) has revised year-end estimates based on data collected through the summer months and will continue to monitor collections to inform any needed adjustments to the City\u2019s budget.

      "March 2024 National Climate Report\nAdditional Resources\nRankings Maps\nU.S. Percentage Areas\nRelated Materials\nSupplemental Material\nNational Overview\nMarch Highlights\nMarch Temperature\nThe contiguous U.S. average temperature during March was 45.1\u00b0F, 3.6\u00b0F above average, ranking 17th warmest in the 130-year record.\nTemperatures were above average across much of the contiguous U.S., while below-average temperatures were observed in small pockets of the West and Southwest.\nFor the month of March, Connecticut and Delaware each had their eighth warmest March on record. Nine additional states ranked among their top-10 warmest March on record.\nThe contiguous U.S. average maximum (daytime) temperature during March was 56.6\u00b0F, 3.6\u00b0F above the 20th century average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for daytime temperatures. Maximum temperatures were above average across the majority of the eastern contiguous U.S. and Plains, and in parts of the Northwest and Rockies. Near-average temperatures were observed across much of the West and in parts of the Southeast, while below-normal temperatures were observed in parts of West and Southwest. Illinois ranked eighth warmest on record, while eight additional states ranked among their top-10 warmest March for daytime temperatures.\nThe contiguous U.S. average minimum (nighttime) temperature during March was 33.7\u00b0F, 3.7\u00b0F above the 20th century average, ranking 16th-warmest March on record for overnight temperatures. Minimum temperatures were above average across much of the contiguous U.S. while near- to below-average temperatures spanned portions of the northern Rockies and Plains and the West. Maine ranked second-warmest on record for March, while 13 additional states experienced a top-10 warmest March for nighttime temperatures.\nThe Alaska statewide March temperature was 14.1\u00b0F, 3.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the 100-year period of record for the state. Temperatures were above average across most of the state with near-normal temperatures in parts of the North Slope, Interior, Southwest and parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\nBased on NOAA's Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index (REDTI), the contiguous U.S. temperature-related energy demand during March was 45 percent of average and the ninth-lowest value in the 130-year period of record.\nMarch Precipitation\nThe March precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 2.85 inches, 0.34 inch above average, ranking in the wettest third of the 130-year record.\nPrecipitation was above average across much of the West, in the Great Lakes and along the Gulf and East coasts and in parts of the northern Plains. Conversely, precipitation was below normal across much of the Ohio Valley, the Plains, and in parts of the Northwest and Florida.\nMaine and Rhode Island each ranked second-wettest March on record, while six additional states had their top-10 wettest March on record.\nAcross the state of Alaska, the average monthly precipitation ranked in the middle third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior, south-central Alaska and in parts of the Panhandle during the month.\nAccording to the April 2 U.S. Drought Monitor, about 18% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought, down about 3.6% from the end of February. Drought conditions expanded or intensified in portions of the Plains and in parts of the Northwest, central Mississippi Valley, northern Great Lakes and Hawaii this month. Drought contracted or was reduced in intensity across much of the Mississippi Valley, Puerto Rico and the West, and in parts of the Plains, Great Lakes and Carolinas.\nBillion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters\nOne new billion-dollar weather and climate disaster was confirmed this month after a severe weather event impacted the central and southern U.S. during mid-March, with the most severe weather occurring on March 13\u201315.\nSince these billion-dollar disaster records began in 1980, the U.S. has sustained 378 separate weather and climate disasters where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (based on the CPI adjustment to 2024) per event. The total cost of these 378 events exceeds $2.675 trillion.\nOther Notable Events\nPersistent heat brought record-breaking temperatures to portions of the U.S. during March:\nOn March 12\u201315 powerful storms brought baseball-sized hail and more than 20 tornadoes to portions of the Midwest:\nA blizzard in early March blasted parts of Sierra Nevada with gusts of up to 190 mph and more than 10 feet of snow, shattering the \u201csnow drought\u201d and significantly boosting vital snowpack levels.\nFive wildfires, including the Smokehouse Creek wildfire, were finally contained in the Texas Panhandle, the largest cattle-producing region in the world. The wildfires resulted in approximately 1.1 million acres scorched, hundreds of destroyed structures, hundreds of miles of ruined fencing and more than 7,000 dead cattle.\nSnow drought occurred in the Southeast, as Asheville, Greensboro and Charlotte, North Carolina, had their longest streaks with no measurable snowfall through March. The last measurable snows in those cities were recorded on March 13, January 17 and January 30, 2022, respectively.\nSnow depth across Anchorage remained above two feet by the end of March\u2014the second-highest depth ever recorded this late in March.\nYear-to-Date Highlights\nJanuary-March Temperature\nFor the January-March period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 39.4\u00b0F, 4.2\u00b0F above average, ranking fifth warmest on record for this period.\nTemperatures were above average across most of the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast.\nWisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine each ranked second warmest on record, while an additional 15 states ranked in their top-10 warmest year-to-date period. No state experienced a top-10 coldest event for this three-month period.\nThe contiguous U.S. average maximum (daytime) temperature during January-March was 50.0\u00b0F, 3.9\u00b0F above the 20th century average, ranking 11th warmest in the historical record. Above-average temperatures were observed across much of the conterminous U.S., while near- to below-average temperatures were observed in parts of the West, western Plains and Southeast. Wisconsin and Michigan each ranked second-warmest on record for daytime temperatures during the January-March period. An additional 19 states ranked among their top-10 warmest for daytime temperatures during this period.\nThe contiguous U.S. average minimum (nighttime) temperature during this three-month period was 28.8\u00b0F, 4.6\u00b0F above the 20th century average, ranking fourth warmest in the historical record. Above-average nighttime temperatures were observed across nearly all of the Lower 48, while near- to below-average temperatures were observed in small portions of the West, Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast. New Hampshire and Vermont each ranked warmest on record, while 21 additional states ranked among their top-10 warmest January-March period on record for nighttime temperatures.\nThe Alaska January-March temperature was 9.4\u00b0F, 3.5\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Much of the state was above average for the three-month period while temperatures were near average across the eastern portions of the state and in parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\nBased on REDTI, the contiguous U.S. temperature-related energy demand during January-March was 27 percent of average and was the fifth-lowest value on record.\nJanuary-March Precipitation\nThe January-March precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 8.15 inches, 1.19 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record.\nPrecipitation was above average across much of the contiguous U.S., with Rhode Island having its second-wettest year-to-date period on record. Six additional states ranked among their top-10 wettest on record for this three-month period.\nConversely, precipitation was below average across much of the northern Plains and in small parts of the Northwest, central and southern Plains, Ohio Valley and Southeast during the January\u2013March period. No states ranked among their top-10 driest year-to-date period on record.\nThe January-March precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record, with above-average precipitation observed in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior and south-central Alaska, as well as southern portions of the Panhandle during this period.\nExtremes\nThe U.S. Climate Extremes Index (USCEI) for the year-to-date period was 6 percent above average, ranking in the upper third of the 115-year period of record. Extremes in warm maximum and minimum temperatures were the major contributors to this elevated CEI value. The USCEI is an index that tracks extremes (occurring in the upper or lower 10 percent of the record) in temperature, precipitation and drought across the contiguous United States.\nOn the regional scale, the Southwest and Ohio Valley were above average while the Northeast and Upper Midwest ranked much-above average with the Northeast experiencing the largest extent of extremes on record for this period. Each of these regions experienced elevated extremes in warm minimum temperatures, while the Ohio Valley, Northeast and Upper Midwest also observed elevated extremes in warm maximum temperatures. Wet PDSI and extremes in one-day precipitation were elevated across much of the Northeast, while extremes in dry PDSI blanketed more than one third of the Upper Midwest. Below-average extremes were observed across the South, Northwest and West regions during this three-month period.\nMonthly Outlook\nAccording to the March 31 One-Month Outlook from the Climate Prediction Center, above-normal monthly average temperatures in April are favored to impact much of the central U.S., Northwest and Northeast. Above-normal monthly precipitation is likely from much of the Plains to parts of the East Coast and in much of the Southwest during April. Drought is likely to persist along portions of the Northern Tier, the Southwest, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.\nAccording to the One-Month Outlook issued on April 1 from the National Interagency Fire Center, much of the Upper Midwest and in parts of the central and southern Plains have an above-normal significant wildland fire potential during the month of April, while much of southeastern U.S. and areas along the Gulf Coast are expected to have below-normal potential for the month.\nRegional Highlights\nThese regional summaries were provided by the six Regional Climate Centers and reflect conditions in their respective regions. These six regions differ spatially from the nine climatic regions of the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nNortheast  (Information provided by the Northeast Regional Climate Center) \nAn unusually warm, record-wet March featured record low snowfall in some locations.\nThe Northeast had its 10th warmest March since records began in 1895, with an average temperature of 39.8 degrees F, 5.3 degrees F above normal. State average temperatures for March ranged from 4.0 degrees F above normal in Rhode Island to 5.9 degrees F above normal in New York. This March ranked among the 12 warmest for all 12 Northeast states: Connecticut, eighth warmest; Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, ninth warmest; New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia, 11th warmest; and New Hampshire, 12th warmest.\nIt was the fifth-wettest March since 1895 for the Northeast, which picked up 5.38 inches of precipitation, 151 percent of normal. March precipitation for the 12 Northeast states ranged from 79 percent of normal in West Virginia, the lone drier-than-normal state, to 230 percent of normal in Maine. March 2024 ranked among the 17 wettest Marches on record for 10 of the states: Delaware, Maine, and Rhode Island, second wettest; Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Vermont, third wettest; Connecticut, fourth wettest; Maryland, 13th wettest; and New York, 17th wettest. March 2024 became the wettest March on record for seven major climate sites: Bridgeport, Connecticut; Kennedy Airport, New York; LaGuardia Airport, New York; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Islip, New York; Caribou, Maine; and Albany, New York.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor from March 5 showed less than one percent of the Northeast in moderate drought and three percent as abnormally dry. Moderate drought and abnormal dryness expanded slightly in western New York in response to continued precipitation deficits and much below-normal streamflow and groundwater levels. Meanwhile, moderate drought persisted on Nantucket, Massachusetts, driven mostly by reduced groundwater levels. However, conditions improved enough in northwestern Pennsylvania to ease abnormal dryness there. The U.S. Drought Monitor from March 26 showed less than one percent of the Northeast in moderate drought and two percent as abnormally dry. During March, western New York experienced record low or much below normal groundwater levels and 7-day streamflow, based on USGS data. During the spring fire season in the Mid-Atlantic, locally dry conditions contributed to multiple wildfires that burned several structures, led to evacuations, and reduced air quality in some locations.\nFrom March 10 to 12, a complex storm system brought heavy rain and snow to the Northeast, with precipitation totals of up to 3 inches. Coastal areas from Maryland to Maine saw mostly rain, while interior areas saw more of a mix of precipitation types, particularly higher elevations of northern New York and northern New England where the greatest snowfall totals approached 13 inches. Wind gusts of 30 to 60 mph accompanied the storm, with locally higher gusts generally along the coast. The gusty winds brought down trees and wires, resulting in power outages and contributing to a death in Pennsylvania, and led to temporary ground stops at airports such as Newark International Airport in New Jersey and Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia. Meanwhile, coastal flooding in New England led to some road closures. From March 20 to 21, a storm moving across northern parts of the Northeast brought snow mostly to northern New England, particularly the higher elevations which generally saw the greatest snowfall totals of 8 to 12 inches. A Blizzard Warning was issued by the NOAA National Weather Service office in Caribou, Maine, for northern parts of that state as heavy snow was blown around by wind gusts as high as 50 mph. In southern parts of the region like West Virginia and Maryland, gusty winds of up to 60 mph downed trees and power lines. A major storm system delivered flooding rain, heavy snow, and ice to the Northeast from March 23 to 24. Much of the Mid-Atlantic, southeastern New York, and a large portion of southern New England saw mostly rain, with the greatest totals of 3 to 5 inches generally along the Interstate 95 corridor from southeastern Pennsylvania into southern Connecticut. March 23 became the wettest March day since recordkeeping began for LaGuardia Airport, New York (3.47 in.); Kennedy Airport, New York (3.13 in.); and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (3.09 in.). It was among the three wettest March days for six other major climate sites including Central Park, New York; Wilmington, Delaware; and Concord, New Hampshire. The heavy rain resulted in localized flooding that closed roads, led to water rescues, suspended transportation services, and inundated buildings in some of these areas. Additionally, there was one flood-related fatality in southeastern Pennsylvania. Much of New York and northern New England saw a mix of precipitation types including freezing rain and snow. In fact, the storm produced one of the snow season\u2019s largest snowfalls for an area stretching from northern and eastern New York into western and northern Maine, with the greatest storm totals ranging from 18 to 30 inches. For instance, Caribou, Maine, and Burlington, Vermont, had their greatest daily snowfall of the snow season on March 23 with 10.9 inches of snow and 8.6 inches, respectively. Some locations in New York and New England saw several hours of freezing rain, with reports of 0.50 inches to 0.75 inches of ice accumulation in places like Portland, Maine, and Albany, New York. Wind gusts of up to 50 mph accompanied the storm, with locally higher gusts in places like New York\u2019s Long Island. Factors such as gusty winds, saturated ground, heavy snow, or ice accumulation brought down trees and power lines, blocking roads and resulting in power outages. For example, in Maine, dozens of roads were closed and over 200,000 customers lost power. The weather conditions also contributed to flight delays and cancellations, as well as vehicle accidents, across the Northeast. However, the snowfall gave some northern New England ski resorts a bump in attendance and allowed them to slightly extend their season. Outside of northern New England, snowfall was generally below normal. March 2024 was the least snowy March on record, tying several other years in most cases, for nine major climate sites: Worcester, Massachusetts; Boston, Massachusetts; Williamsport, Pennsylvania; Bridgeport, Connecticut; Islip, New York; Providence, Rhode Island; Allentown, Pennsylvania; Huntington, West Virginia; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In fact, even with the March snowfall boost in northern New England, the snow season, which started in October, has generally been lackluster. For instance, some ski resorts relied heavily on snowmaking operations and the snowmobiling season in northern Maine ended about a month earlier than usual, with losses expected for businesses that rely on revenue from tourism. In early March, officials in northern Maine asked folks to remove their ice fishing shacks from local waterways due to rapidly changing ice conditions, while the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation warned hikers in the Adirondacks to \u201cpostpone high elevation activities due to unstable spring conditions\u201d usually more typical of late March to mid-April. Peak bloom of cherry blossoms in Washington, D.C., occurred on March 17, tying as the second earliest date since 1921. The earliest peak bloom was March 15, 2000. Plants budding or blooming earlier than usual has also been noted in other areas like western New York and eastern Massachusetts, with allergy season arriving early and possibly being more intense in multiple parts of the Northeast. Additionally, some golf courses opened for the season during March.\nFor more information, please visit the Northeast Regional Climate Center Home Page.\nMidwest Region (Information provided by the Midwest Regional Climate Center)\nThe average March temperature for the Midwest was 40.5 degrees F (4.7 degrees C), which was 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) above the 1991-2020 normal. Anomalous warmth was present across the entire region, with temperatures 1-3 degrees F (0.6-1.7 degrees C) above normal in the northwest to more than 6 degrees F (3.3 degrees C) above normal in the central and eastern portions of the region. Preliminary statewide average temperatures ranged from 1.8 degrees F (1 degree C) above normal in Minnesota to 4.6 degrees F (2.6 degrees C) above normal in Michigan. The first two weeks of the month had widespread warmth. Kansas City, Missouri, had its 5th earliest 80 degrees F (26.7 degrees C) day on March 3. Near-normal and slightly below-normal temperatures returned to the region for the last two weeks of the month. Many long-running stations across the area, particularly in the central Midwest, had a top ten warmest March.\nMarch precipitation totaled 2.62 inches (67 mm) for the Midwest, which was 0.05 inches (1 mm) above normal, or 102 percent of normal. Precipitation was up to 5 inches (127 mm) above normal across the Great Lakes and down to 3 inches (76.2 mm) below normal along the Ohio River. Preliminary statewide precipitation totals ranged from 1.76 inches (45 mm) below normal in Kentucky to 0.9 inches (23 mm) above normal in Michigan. Precipitation rankings across most Midwestern cities were unremarkable, except in Milwaukee, which had its third wettest March in 151 years.\nThe Midwest had some drought improvement throughout March. About 38 percent of the region started the month affected by drought. Drought coverage was reduced to about 27 percent by month\u2019s end. The epicenter of drought remained locked across eastern Iowa, with a large area affected by extreme (D3) drought, while the western half of the state had one category improvement on the US Drought Monitor map. Drought improvements were noted across Missouri, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, although dryness and drought remained. Areas around the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers trended drier in March, and drought development was an increasing concern.\nMarch snowfall was confined to the upper Midwest, where totals ranged from 2-25 inches (5.1-63.5 cm). Snowfall was within 5 inches (12.7 cm) above or below normal throughout most of Iowa and Michigan. Conversely, Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin had 5-15 inches (12.7-38.1 cm) of above-normal snowfall for March. Minneapolis measured 15.2 inches (38.6 cm) of snow for the month, which was more snow than they received from Oct 2023 \u2013 Feb 2024.\nHundreds of hail, tornado, and severe wind reports were noted across the Midwest on March 13-14 along an axis from southern Missouri to central Ohio. Large hail measuring 3-4 inches (76.2-101.6 mm) was reported in the St. Louis, Missouri, area. There were three fatalities and 27 injuries when an EF-3 tornado traversed Ohio\u2019s Auglaize and Logan counties. Two people were injured when an EF-2 tornado touched down in Jefferson County, Indiana. Another 38 injuries were reported associated with an EF-3 tornado west of Selma, Indiana. At least 17 tornadoes were confirmed in the Midwest during this outbreak.\nFor more information, please visit the Midwest Climate Watch Home page.\nSoutheast (Information provided by the Southeast Regional Climate Center)\nTemperatures were above average across the Southeast in March, except in parts of southern Alabama, where temperatures were slightly below average. The greatest departures were found across the Florida Peninsula, southern Georgia, eastern portions of the Carolinas, and northern Virginia, where mean temperatures were 4 to 6 degrees F (2.2 to 3.4 degrees C) above average for the month. Key West, FL recorded its third warmest March on record (since 1871), while Fort Lauderdale, FL tied its third warmest March on record (since 1912). Above average temperatures persisted across the U.S. Caribbean. Saint Croix recorded its warmest March on record (since 1951) with a mean temperature of 81.7 degrees F (27.6 degrees C), breaking the previous record of 80.9 degrees F (27.2 degrees C) set in 1981. San Juan, PR tied its second warmest March on record (since 1898). Heat advisories were issued on the island for the 19th, with heat index values near 100 degrees F (37.8 degrees C) in San Juan and Mayaguez. \nThe month began with unseasonably warm weather. Mean temperatures were 5 to 15 degrees F (2.8 to 8.3 degrees C) above average across much of the region through the first week of March, with some locations as much as 20 degrees F (11.1 degrees C) above average along the northern tier. After a brief period of near to slightly below average temperatures, warm weather returned around the middle of the month, with several locations running over 20 degrees F (11.1 degrees C) above average. Maximum temperatures reached 80 degrees F (26.7 degrees C) for the first time this year across northern Virginia on the 14th and 15th, which is 2 to 3 weeks earlier than average. In Florida, maximum temperatures reached 90 degrees F (32.2 degrees C) for the first time this year in places like West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and Miami on the 17th and 18th, which is at least a month earlier than average. This period of warm weather was followed by several days of unseasonably cool temperatures, with mean temperatures running 5 to 15 degrees F (2.8 to 8.3 degrees C) below average from the 19th through the 21st. Minimum temperatures dropped below freezing along the northern Gulf Coast. Highlands, NC, located above 4,000 feet (1,219 m) elevation in southwestern North Carolina, recorded a minimum temperature of 17 degrees F (-8.3 degrees C) on the 20th, making it the fifth coldest monthly minimum temperature on record (since 1877). After a brief warm-up, cooler temperatures returned to the region from the 24th to the 29th, with many locations across the northern tier of the region running 5 to 10 degrees F (2.8 to 5.6 degrees C) below average. Subfreezing temperatures were recorded across northern portions of Alabama and Georgia. March ended with more unseasonably warm weather across much of the region. Raleigh-Durham, NC reached 85 degrees F (29.4 degrees C) for the first time this year on the 31st, which is at least 2 weeks earlier than average.\nPrecipitation was above average across most of the Southeast in March. The wettest locations were found across southern portions of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, as well as eastern portions of North Carolina and Virginia, where monthly totals were 4 to 8 inches (102 to 203 mm) above average (over 200 percent of normal). Cape Hatteras, NC recorded its wettest March on record (since 1874) with 13.86 inches (352 mm), breaking the previous record of 11.20 inches (284 mm) set in 1989. This included 3.75 inches (95 mm) on the 4th, which is the third wettest March day on record. Further north, Norfolk, VA recorded its second wettest March on record (since 1871) with 10.30 inches (262 mm) of precipitation. Charleston, SC recorded 8.12 inches (206 mm) for the month, which is nearly 2.5 times its expected monthly total. This included 3.04 inches (77 mm) on the 1st, which is the fourth wettest March day on record (since 1938). Also on the 1st, Asheville, NC recorded 1.63 inches (41 mm) of precipitation, which is more than it recorded during the entire month of February (1.24 inches (31 mm)). On the 9th, an area of low pressure tracked northeastward across the region, resulting in heavy precipitation and severe weather. Americus, GA, located in the southwestern part of the state, recorded its third wettest March day on record (since 1876) with 4.80 inches (122 mm). Downtown Charleston, SC also recorded 3.63 inches (92 mm), which is the wettest March day on record (since 1893). Another low pressure system tracked across the region on the 22nd and 23rd, resulting in widespread totals of 1 to 2 inches (25 to 51 mm). Eastern portions of North Carolina and Virginia recorded up to 4 inches (102 mm), while parts of South Florida recorded over 5 inches (127 mm) of precipitation over the two days. Several days later, one final low pressure system tracked across the Southeast, bringing more heavy precipitation to the region on the 27th and 28th. A swath of 1 to 2 inches (25 to 51 mm) extended from Florida to eastern Virginia, with some locations recording over 3 inches (76 mm). Norfolk, VA recorded 3.06 inches (78 mm) on the 28th, which is the third wettest March day on record (since 1871). While most of the region was wetter than average in March, some locations recorded below average totals for the month, including western portions of Virginia such as Charlottesville (84 percent of normal), Blacksburg (62 percent of normal) and Roanoke (83 percent of normal), as well as parts of central Florida, such as Orlando (46 percent of normal). \nPrecipitation was variable across the U.S. Caribbean. Above average precipitation was observed across the northern and southern slopes of Puerto Rico, while below average precipitation was observed along the eastern and western slopes as well as the outlying islands. Trujillo, located in the northern coastal region, recorded 4.27 inches (108 mm) on the 26th, making it the second wettest March day on record (since 1957). Precipitation was generally below average in Saint Thomas and near average in Saint Croix. Most CoCoRaHS gauges in Saint John recorded less than 1 inch (25 mm) for the month. \nIn terms of winter precipitation, trace amounts of snowfall, ice pellets, and up to 0.1 inches (2.5 mm) of freezing rain were reported across western portions of North Carolina and Virginia on the 1st of the month. Up to 0.5 inches (13 mm) of snow was reported across northern and western portions of Virginia, as well as western portions of North Carolina on the 10th of the month. Trace amounts of snow were also reported across western Virginia on the 18th and 19th. For the month, Mount Mitchell, NC recorded just a trace of snow. This ties the lowest March snowfall total on record (since 1925). The lack of snowfall has been persistent across parts of the region. On the 18th of the month, Asheville, NC and Charlotte, NC broke their previous records for the greatest number of consecutive days without measurable snowfall with runs of 737 and 779 days, respectively. Other locations reached one of their top 5 longest runs of days without measurable snowfall, including Greenville-Spartanburg, SC, Greensboro, NC, and Raleigh-Durham, NC.\nDrought conditions generally improved in March. Abnormal dryness (D0) was eliminated across the interior of the region and along the northern Gulf Coast but persisted across the West Coast of Florida and eastern portions of North Carolina. A very small pocket of moderate (D1) drought also persisted in eastern North Carolina. Over 97 percent of the region was free of any drought or abnormal dryness at the end of the month, the highest percentage since September 2021. Drought conditions also improved in Puerto Rico. Abnormal dryness (D0) was eliminated across the interior of the island. Moderate (D1) drought was also eliminated on the southwestern end of the island and contracted on the northwestern and eastern ends. Abnormal dryness (D0) persisted on Saint Thomas, while Saint John and Saint Croix remained free of any drought or abnormal dryness.\nWet conditions limited field activities in parts of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, and delayed some spring planting, notably for corn and other vegetables. Wet conditions also caused issues with seed germination and led to rotting of some young seedlings. Heavy precipitation in parts of southwest Georgia caused some agricultural facilities to flood and spoiled cases of produce before they could be shipped. Freezing temperatures during the month damaged some of the peach crop in South Carolina, though most peaches in Georgia were unharmed. Strawberries and blueberries were also spared as farmers were able to cover their crops ahead of time. While many places continued to see too much precipitation, some locations benefited from the additional moisture, especially across Florida, where the greening of pastures helped improve grazing conditions and reduced the amount of supplemental feed needed for livestock. Warm temperature and adequate soil moisture also allowed for preparation of spring planting across much of the state.\nThere were 101 reports of severe weather across the Southeast in March, which is less than half of the median frequency of 208 reports over the period 2000 to 2022 (49 percent of normal). There were five confirmed tornadoes (1 EF-0, 3 EF-1s, 1 EF-2), which is below the median frequency of 20 (25 percent of normal). Four of these occurred across southern Alabama and Georgia, and northern Florida as part of a severe weather outbreak on the 9th of the month. Most of the damage consisted of downed trees with some structural damage to homes and outbuildings. The strongest tornado was an EF-2 that touched down near the community of Nahunta in Brantley County, GA, causing extensive damage to mobile homes, some of which were flattened and wrapped around trees. At least five people were injured. \nThere were 57 wind reports in March, which is below the median frequency of 119 reports (48 percent of normal). Wind gusts over 50 mph (22 m/s) were reported from Florida to Virginia in association with the low pressure system that tracked through the region on the 9th and 10th of the month. Some gusts approached 70 mph (31 m/s) across parts of southwestern Virginia and northwestern North Carolina. Wind gusts over 60 mph (27 m/s) were reported across portions of Alabama and Georgia on the 15th and 16th. These storms also produced golf ball-sized hail and an EF-0 tornado in DeKalb County, AL. Wind gusts of 50 to 60 mph (22 to 27 m/s) were recorded across coastal sections of North Carolina and Virginia in association with the low pressure system off the East Coast from the 23rd to the 25th of the month. A severe thunderstorm produced a 75 mph (34 m/s) wind gust in Valdosta, GA on the morning of the 27th, resulting in downed trees that destroyed over 30 homes. There were 38 hail reports in March, which is below the median frequency of 69 reports (55 percent of normal). The largest hailstone was 2 inches (51 mm), or hen egg-sized, in the community of White City in Gulf County, FL on the 27th of the month. \nThe famous Cherry Blossoms in Washington D.C. reached their peak bloom on the 17th of the month, which tied for the second earliest bloom date since the National Park Service began tracking their phenology in 1921. The earliest bloom date on record is just two days earlier (March 15, 1990). Raleigh, NC recorded a daily pollen concentration of 2,040 grains per cubic meter on the 21st of the month, which is the fourth highest daily concentration and highest concentration to date in the season since 2002. On the 25th, Atlanta, GA recorded a daily concentration of 4,117 grains per cubic meter, which is the highest value to date in the season since 2012. There were five rip current fatalities in March, all in Puerto Rico.\nFor more information, please visit the Southeast Regional Climate Center Home Page.\nHigh Plains (Information provided by the High Plains Regional Climate Center)\nA late winter storm impacted the region at the end of March, bringing blizzard conditions and severe weather. Despite the significant storm, much of the region received below normal precipitation this month. \nIn a typical display of the unpredictability and whiplash of the plains, parts of western Kansas were under both tornado and blizzard warnings at the same time. Several tornadoes touched down, followed by up to 6 inches (15.24 cm) of snow and wind gusts of 40 mph (64 km/h). A brief EF-1 tornado with 90 mph (145 km/h) winds hit the town of Garden City, causing minor damage.\nThe winter weather associated with the system wreaked havoc in nearly every state in the region. Major interstates were closed, with poor road conditions stretching from Kansas to North Dakota. The hardest hit states were Colorado and South Dakota, with reports of up to 12 inches (30.48 cm) of snow. Strong winds led to whiteout conditions, leading to a rash of wrecks.\nMarch brought cooler temperatures for parts of the west, while the eastern portions of the region remained warm. The system that pushed through the region in late March led to a cool-down for many.\nWhile temperatures for the month were on both ends of the spectrum, nothing was out of the ordinary. The only major location to rank in the top 10 warmest or coldest was Laramie, Wyoming. The city ranked as the 8th warmest with an average temperature of 35.3 degrees F (1.8 degrees C), while surrounding locations such as Cheyenne or Rawlins were just outside the top 10. \nThe front that pushed through late in the month provided some relief to the eastern parts of the region. While no records were broken, it did lead temperatures to drop below freezing for some and created potential issues for blooming plants.\nPrecipitation was spotty throughout the region except for Colorado. Parts of the state experienced record wetness, while parts of south-central Kansas reported trace to no precipitation. \nMuch of the precipitation in Colorado this month was snow, falling from a significant storm in the middle of the month. Highways were closed across the state and over 800 flights were canceled at Denver International Airport. The snow was extremely heavy, leading to branches breaking and causing scattered power outages. Over 60 inches (152.4 cm) fell in parts of the Rockies, while portions of the foothills received over 12 inches (30.48 cm) this month. Canon City and Fruita crushed their precipitation records by over an inch (2.54 cm) due to the exceptional wetness.\nWhile much of Nebraska was dry, a record-setting snowstorm impacted North Platte early this month. In the city, 15.3 inches (38.86 cm) of snow fell on the 7th and set a new single-day record. The snow was extremely heavy at times, with up to 3 inches (7.62 cm) falling per hour. This narrow band stretched to the Broken Bow area; however, snowfall totals were much lower elsewhere. \nDespite most of Colorado being wet, the eastern plains were very dry. Minimal amounts of precipitation were reported around Campo and Lamar, with some areas receiving less than 0.10 inches (2.54 mm). Just across the border in Kansas, areas between Dodge City and Wichita received similar amounts resulting in drought expansion.\nDrought conditions within the region are in decent shape at the end of March. Expansion and intensification were sporadic, but not serious. Overall, the region observed a slight increase of less than a percent of D0 to D4 (abnormally dry to exceptional drought conditions).\nThe drought that has plagued central and eastern Nebraska has slowly improved over the past few months, with a pocket of D2 (severe drought) remaining between Lincoln and Grand Island. This is a significant improvement over the previous year, when D4 was present within the state.\nSimilar to Nebraska, Kansas is in much better shape than 2023. Although there was a slight intensification in the south-central part of the state where it was nearly bone-dry, the current situation is significantly less bleak than the previous year when D4 covered the southwestern portions of the state. Elsewhere in the region, other improvements and degradation were observed.\nFor more information, please visit the High Plains Regional Climate Center Home Page.\nSouth (Information provided by the Southern Regional Climate Center)\nHeavy rains led to flooding and school closures across Arkansas on March 15th. The largest wildfire in Texas state history continued to impact the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma in early March.\nTemperatures were above normal across much of the Southern Region during March, with stations in the northern portions of the region recording temperatures as much as 5 degrees F above normal. The only area recording below normal temperatures was Far West Texas, where temperatures were zero to two degrees F below normal. Statewide averages were above normal for all states in the Region: Oklahoma (22nd warmest, out of 130 years), Tennessee (23rd warmest), the Southern Region as a whole (25th warmest), Texas (27th warmest), Arkansas (28th warmest), Mississippi (38th warmest), and Louisiana (39th warmest). The warmest recorded temperature in the Region was 99 F at three stations, all in Texas: Laredo on March 13th. Faith Ranch on March 13th, and Rio Grande Village on March 30th. The coldest recorded temperature was 9 F at Mt. Leconte, Tennessee on March 19th. The coldest lowland temperature was 14 F near Goodwell, Oklahoma on March 26th. No long-term stations in the Southern Region set records for highest maximum monthly or lowest minimum monthly temperature during March.\nPrecipitation was mixed across the Southern Region during March. Much of Louisiana, Mississippi, East Texas, and southern Arkansas recorded precipitation ranging from 125 and 200 percent of normal. The remainder of the Region was near to below normal with the driest conditions being recorded in the west of the Region. State totals were above normal for Mississippi (27th wettest) and Louisiana (34th wettest) and below normal for Tennessee (41st driest). Precipitation totals for Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and the Southern Region as a whole were near their historical median values. Three stations, one WBAN and two CoCoRaHS, recorded more than 13 inches of precipitation in March: near Collinsville, Mississippi (13.83 inches), New Orleans Audubon, Louisiana (13.32 inches), and near Monroe, Louisiana (13.13 inches). Two stations, both in Arkansas, reported more than six inches of precipitation on one day: Magnolia (7.2 inches, March 15th) and El Dorado (6.3 inches, March 15th). Six long-term stations set single day accumulations records for March with the greatest difference between the old and new records being Magnolia, Arkansas on March 15th (7.2 inches vs 5.95 inches).\nDuring March, drought conditions remained largely steady across the Southern Region, with some areas of Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, and East Texas seeing improvements in existing drought conditions of one to two categories, according to the US Drought Monitor. The only areas experiencing degradation in drought conditions were north-central Oklahoma and isolated areas of Central and South Texas. As of March 26th, Louisiana and Arkansas are essentially drought free; none of the Region is in Exceptional Drought. Given normal to above average precipitation for much of the Region over the previous months, subsoil moisture has rebounded across the Region with the USDA reporting at least 50 percent of land having Adequate subsoil moisture in all states in the Region except Texas which reported 46 percent of land having Adequate subsoil moisture. Planting of field crops began in southern portions of the Region during March with Texas and Louisiana reporting 32 and 51 percent of rice acres planted and Texas reporting 57 percent of corn acres planted as of March 31st.\nThe Smokehouse Creek Fire, which began in February, continued to affect the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma. The fire was 100 percent contained as of March 16th according to the Texas A&M Forest Service. In total, the fire destroyed over 100 homes, burned over a million acres of rangeland, killed thousands of cattle, and led to two confirmed fatalities in Texas. The fire is the largest recorded in Texas state history and the largest in the United States so far in 2024. Heavy rains associated with thunderstorms on March 15th led to reports of flooding across portions of Arkansas and caused Magnolia Arkansas Public Schools to close for the day.\nThere were 11 tornadoes reported across the Southern Region in March: 7 rated EF0, 3 EF1, and 1 EF2 affecting the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi. There were no injuries or fatalities associated with these tornadoes. There were 172 reports of hail across the Region in March, with the largest being 5.25 inches near Ada, Oklahoma on March 14th. There were 86 severe wind reports with the fastest being 77 mph on March 15th near Sugar Land, Texas.\nFor more information, please visit the Southern Regional Climate Center Home Page.\nWest (Information provided by the Western Region Climate Center)\nMarch came in like a lion for California and much of the Southwest as a powerful, multi-day storm impacted the region bringing heavy rain and mountain snow, and high winds. Mid-month saw a lull in storms and then several slow moving, cutoff low-pressure systems impacted the Southwest again during the latter half of the month. Regionally, the Southwest saw well above normal precipitation and temperatures were near-to-below normal. Continued dry and warm conditions persisted for much of the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies with record low snowpack for some locations raising concerns about worsening drought conditions.\nTemperatures were one to three degrees Fahrenheit above normal (in the 70th to 90th percentile) for much of Washington, northern Idaho, western Montana, and southeast New Mexico. Quillayute, Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula, had a monthly average temperature of 47.5 degrees Fahrenheit, 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit above normal and the third warmest on record; Portland, Oregon mean monthly temperature was 50 degrees Fahrenheit and 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. Below normal temperatures were found throughout north central Montana, California, the Great Basin, and much of Arizona. The Sierra Nevada, California was one of the colder locations in the West; mean monthly temperature departures were 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit below normal at Blue Canyon, 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit below normal at Yosemite Village, and 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit below normal at Tahoe City.\nConditions were generally drier than normal in Washington, northern Oregon, northern Idaho, western Montana, and southeast New Mexico. The Washington Cascades and parts of the Rockies in Montana were particularly dry with SNOTEL stations reporting 40 percent to 60 percent of normal monthly precipitation; six SNOTEL stations in Washington and five in Montana are reporting the second lowest March precipitation totals on record. Low precipitation is being reflected in the well below normal snowpack in this region. Several strong storms impacted the Southwest bringing above normal monthly precipitation to the Sierra Nevada, northern Great Basin, most of Utah, and the mountains of Arizona and New Mexico; most SNOTEL sites in this region reported greater than 150 percent of normal precipitation for the month. In southeast Idaho, both Pocatello and Idaho Falls had the wettest march on record with 3.28 inches and 1.98 inches, respectively. Reno, Nevada logged 2.20 inches of precipitation coming in as the fourth wettest March on record.\nAccording to the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) at the end of March, 23 percent of the West was in drought. Areas of extreme (D3) and exceptional (D4) drought are found in far southeast Arizona, southern New Mexico, and western Montana. Minor drought improvements were made throughout much of the West. However, the April 1 snowpack across Washington, northern Idaho, and western Montana was well below normal, and at record low levels for some locations, and worsening drought conditions are expected heading into summer as a result.\nPrecipitation was below normal for much of South Central, the Interior, and the southern half of the Panhandle. Ketchikan received 8.34 inches of precipitation for the month at 76 percent of normal and Petersburg received 4.87 inches at 64 percent of normal; this continues a several month dry stretch for the southern Panhandle which has led to below normal snowpack and potential summer drought impacts. Western coastal Alaska saw above normal precipitation with Nome at 228 percent of normal and Kotzebue at 173 percent of normal. Most of the state saw temperature anomalies of one to four degrees Fahrenheit above normal with some isolated areas in southern Alaska much warmer including Northway at 6.8 degrees Fahrenheit above normal and Talkeetna at 6.1 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. Parts of southwest Alaska had slightly below normal temperatures.\nHawaii saw drier than normal conditions across the entire chain of islands except for the east coast of the Big Island. Lihue had its sixth driest March with 0.89 inches of precipitation (16 percent of normal), Molokai had its sixth driest March with 0.45 inches of precipitation (15 percent of normal), and Honolulu the tenth driest with 0.23 inches of precipitation (10 percent of normal). Drought currently covers 42 percent of Hawaii with severe drought (D2) found only on the Big Island and Maui; spatial drought coverage has increased since the start of the calendar year but is still much less than the 81 percent of area covered at the start of the water year.\nFour-day blizzard buries Sierra Nevada and strands motorists: A powerful storm impacted California during the first four days of March with the northern Sierra Nevada, near Lake Tahoe, being one of the hardest hit areas. Five to seven feet of snow fell, with locally higher amounts, and strong winds gusted to over 150 mph. Large Sierra storms are common; however, this storm was one of the strongest in the past 40 years when considering 4-days increases in snow water equivalent. Many cars and tractor trailers were stranded overnight on interstate 80 as extreme conditions forced the closure of the road without being able to first get all vehicles to safety. No injuries were reported.\nFor more information, please go to the Western Regional Climate Center Home Page.\nCiting This Report\nMetadata\nFOLLOW US\nCONTACT US\n",

Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.  \nThe Alaska summer temperature was 51.7\u00b0F, 1.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.\nFor the January\u2013August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9\u00b0F, 3.0\u00b0F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January\u2013August period on record.\nThe Alaska January\u2013August temperature was 31.2\u00b0F, 2.4\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\n\n\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June\u2013August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.  \nFor summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.  \nThe January\u2013August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January\u2013August period.  \nThe January\u2013August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\n\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month\u2019s consolidation.\n\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October. Precipitation consolidation guidance has trended wetter across the northern tier of the CONUS, resulting in an expansion of elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the northern High Plains and Great Lakes relative to last month. Above-normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska.\n\nImpacts and Outlooks for Your Region\nMap of the United States depicting the Seasonal Precipitation Outlook for October\u2013December 2024.\n\nAlaska and Northwestern Canada Region\u00a0\nGreat Lakes Region\nGulf Coast Region\nGulf of Maine Region\nMid-Atlantic Region\u00a0\nMidwest Region\nMissouri River Basin Region\nPrairies and High Plains Region\nNortheast Region\nPacific Region\nSoutheast Region\nSouthern Region\nWestern Region\n\nCreating These Quarterly Summaries\nNOAA\u2019s Regional Climate Services lead the production of these quarterly summaries of climate impacts and outlooks for various regions of the United States as well as parts of Canada along the border.

      "ADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\n2024 crop yield expectations are reduced in Minnesota\nThe one consistency being echoed by most crop experts is that the 2024 crop yields are likely to be highly variable and are very difficult to predict. \nAugust is typically the month when we get the first producer survey yield estimates from USDA, as well as yield projections from major private firms. \nThis yield data is gathered in different formats from producer surveys, crop tours and satellite technology. There is not necessarily a method that has proven more accurate than any other, as all methods have some strengths as well as some limitations. As usual, the one consistency being echoed by most crop experts is that the 2024 crop yields are likely to be highly variable and are very difficult to predict. \nADVERTISEMENT\nSome areas of the eastern and central Corn Belt have experienced excellent growing conditions this year, while portions of the upper Midwest such as the southern third of Minnesota were negatively impacted by flooding and excessive rainfall during June. Most of the crop information in these estimates was based on crop conditions in early-to-mid August, so any major changes in conditions after that time frame could alter final state or national yield numbers.\nThe statewide and national corn and soybean yield estimates in the USDA Crop Report that was released on Aug. 12, 2024, were based on crop conditions as of Aug. 1. The USDA report was based on a survey of over 15,000 crop producers from across the United States that was conducted by the National Ag Statistics Service (NASS). The next USDA Crop Report will be released on Sept. 12 and will be based on crop conditions as of Sept. 1. This report will include actual field survey data in the yield and production estimates.\nTwo of the main private firms that release crop yield and production estimates during August use different methods and technology to arrive at their projections. The \u201cPro Farmer Crop Tour\u201d is quite well established and has been around for several decades. Pro Farmer Tour gathers \u201cin-person\u201d field yield data from the primary corn and soybean production areas in seven states during the third or fourth week of August, which is then adjusted for crop maturity and historical differences between tour data and final yield numbers. Yield adjustments are also made in states that have unique conditions in certain areas of a state, such as drought conditions, irrigation in Nebraska, and geographical differences in states like Minnesota.\nFor several years, DTN has conducted a \u201cdigital yield tour\u201d of the primary corn and soybean production areas in the United States. DTN derives their yield estimates utilizing satellite imagery taken during the second week of August, which is then adjusted based on actual rainfall amounts and temperature data, as well as for the drought index. The DTN yield data will continue to be updated into September. DTN did not issue a national corn or soybean yield estimate in the August estimates.\nNationally, the Pro Farmer corn yield estimate was 181.1, compared to 183.1 bushels per acre in the Aug. 12 USDA Crop Report. The 2024 national corn yield projections from USDA and Pro Farmer both exceed the final 2023 record average U.S. corn yield of 177.3 bushels per acre. The 2024 national corn yield projections also compare to other national average U.S. corn yields of 173.3 bushels per acre in 2022, 177 bushels per acre in 2021, 172 bushels per acre in 2020, and 167.4 bushels per acre in 2019.\nThe national yield differences between the USDA corn yield estimate (183.1 bu./acre) and the Pro Farmer projection (181.1 bu./acre) may not seem significant; however, that could potentially represent a difference in the final total 2024 U.S. corn production level. Depending on U.S. and world corn demand, that yield difference could affect the U.S. corn supply, which in turn could impact grain market prices in the coming months. \nThe current difference between the corn yield estimates from USDA and Pro Farmer is two bushels per acre. Based on the USDA estimate of 82.7 million harvested acres of corn in the U.S. in 2024, that yield difference represents over 165 million bushels of corn. USDA is currently estimating the 2024-25 U.S. corn ending stocks at nearly 2.1 billion bushels, based on the USDA estimated yield of 183.1 bushels per acre. A national yield decline of two bushels per acre in 2024 would potentially reduce U.S. corn carryout levels by about 8%.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn many instances, there was not a lot of consistency in the state-by-state average corn yield estimates from the various sources. Some states had higher projected corn yields in the Aug. 12 USDA crop report compared to estimates released by the crop tours and digital surveys, while in other states the USDA projected yield trailed the private estimates. For example, USDA estimated the 2024 Minnesota corn yield at 185 bushels per acre and DTN was at 186.7 bushels per acre, compared to the estimate of 170 bushels per acre by Pro Farmer. \nIn South Dakota, the corn yield estimates were 162 bushels per acre by USDA and 166.7 bushels per acre by DTN, while Pro Farmer was at 156 bushels per acre. On the other hand, the private company corn yield projections for Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska were fairly close to the USDA yield estimates. Crop and weather conditions in the northern Corn Belt have been much more variable than in the eastern Corn Belt during the 2024 growing season.\nNASS estimated the 2024 U.S. national average soybean yield at 53.3 bushels per acre in the Aug. 12 USDA Report, which compares to national soybean yield estimate of 54.9 bushels per acre by Pro Farmer. The USDA and Pro Farmer 2024 soybean yield estimates would far exceed the final 2023 national yield of 50.6 bushels per acre and the record national average soybean yield of 51.9 bushels per acre in 2016. Other recent national soybean average yields were 49.5 bushels per acre in 2022, 51.4 bushels per acre in 2021, 50.5 bushels per acre in 2020, and 47.4 bushels per acre in 2019. \nThe various state-by-state soybean yield projections in the northern Corn Belt showed less variation between the August USDA yield estimates and the 2024 yield projections by the private firms than existed with corn. However, the statewide soybean yield projections in the eastern Corn Belt showed more variation among the various estimates, which could be partially due to the different methodologies that are used to calculate yields and the drier weather pattern that have developed in portions of the region.\nBased on the Aug. 19 USDA Crop Progress Report, 67% of the U.S. corn crop is \u201cgood-to-excellent,\u201d which compares to late August crop ratings of 58% in 2023 and 55% in 2022. Only 11% of the U.S. corn crop was rated \u201cpoor-to-very poor.\u201d The highest statewide \u201cgood-to-excellent\u201d ratings were Missouri at 79%, Iowa at 77%, Illinois at 76%, Indiana at 73%, Nebraska at 72%, and South Dakota at 70%. Lower \u201cgood-to excellent\u201d corn ratings were recorded in other Midwest states with Wisconsin at 64%, Minnesota and North Dakota at 61%, and Ohio at 55%. The lowest corn ratings were in Texas at 41% and Kansas at 45%. Most 2024 statewide corn ratings in the Midwest for mid-August exceeded comparable 2023 corn ratings, except in Ohio which had better ratings a year ago.\nThe weekly USDA crop ratings on Aug. 19 listed 68% of the soybean crop in the U.S. as \u201cgood-to-excellent,\u201d which was well above the ratings of 59% in 2023 and 57% in 2022 at this point in the year. Many of the Midwest States with the largest soybean acreage were in the higher crop ratings categories. Iowa led the way at 77%, followed by Nebraska at 74%, Indiana at 72% and Illinois at 70%. The soybean \u201cgood-to-excellent\u201d ratings in other States included Minnesota at 69%, South Dakota at 68%, Wisconsin at 62% North Dakota at 57%, and Ohio at 56%. All of the Midwest States in the primary soybean production area in the U.S., except Ohio, had higher \u201cgood-to-excellent\u201d ratings in late August this year, as compared to 2023.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAreas of the Midwest that were not impacted by adverse weather earlier in the growing season and continue to receive frequent rainfall events during August could actually see a boost in final yield results. There could be some concern in Minnesota, northwest Iowa, North Dakota, and Wisconsin with getting the later planted crops and the replanted soybeans mature, especially if the first frost occurs in September.\nKent Thiesse is a Farm Management Analyst and writes the weekly \"Focus on Ag\" column.

Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.  \nThe Alaska summer temperature was 51.7\u00b0F, 1.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.\nFor the January\u2013August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9\u00b0F, 3.0\u00b0F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January\u2013August period on record.\nThe Alaska January\u2013August temperature was 31.2\u00b0F, 2.4\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\n\n\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June\u2013August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.  \nFor summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.  \nThe January\u2013August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January\u2013August period.  \nThe January\u2013August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\n\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month\u2019s consolidation.\n\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October. Precipitation consolidation guidance has trended wetter across the northern tier of the CONUS, resulting in an expansion of elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the northern High Plains and Great Lakes relative to last month. Above-normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska.\n\nImpacts and Outlooks for Your Region\nMap of the United States depicting the Seasonal Precipitation Outlook for October\u2013December 2024.\n\nAlaska and Northwestern Canada Region\u00a0\nGreat Lakes Region\nGulf Coast Region\nGulf of Maine Region\nMid-Atlantic Region\u00a0\nMidwest Region\nMissouri River Basin Region\nPrairies and High Plains Region\nNortheast Region\nPacific Region\nSoutheast Region\nSouthern Region\nWestern Region\n\nCreating These Quarterly Summaries\nNOAA\u2019s Regional Climate Services lead the production of these quarterly summaries of climate impacts and outlooks for various regions of the United States as well as parts of Canada along the border.

      "ADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\n2024 crop yield expectations are reduced in Minnesota\nThe one consistency being echoed by most crop experts is that the 2024 crop yields are likely to be highly variable and are very difficult to predict. \nAugust is typically the month when we get the first producer survey yield estimates from USDA, as well as yield projections from major private firms. \nThis yield data is gathered in different formats from producer surveys, crop tours and satellite technology. There is not necessarily a method that has proven more accurate than any other, as all methods have some strengths as well as some limitations. As usual, the one consistency being echoed by most crop experts is that the 2024 crop yields are likely to be highly variable and are very difficult to predict. \nADVERTISEMENT\nSome areas of the eastern and central Corn Belt have experienced excellent growing conditions this year, while portions of the upper Midwest such as the southern third of Minnesota were negatively impacted by flooding and excessive rainfall during June. Most of the crop information in these estimates was based on crop conditions in early-to-mid August, so any major changes in conditions after that time frame could alter final state or national yield numbers.\nThe statewide and national corn and soybean yield estimates in the USDA Crop Report that was released on Aug. 12, 2024, were based on crop conditions as of Aug. 1. The USDA report was based on a survey of over 15,000 crop producers from across the United States that was conducted by the National Ag Statistics Service (NASS). The next USDA Crop Report will be released on Sept. 12 and will be based on crop conditions as of Sept. 1. This report will include actual field survey data in the yield and production estimates.\nTwo of the main private firms that release crop yield and production estimates during August use different methods and technology to arrive at their projections. The \u201cPro Farmer Crop Tour\u201d is quite well established and has been around for several decades. Pro Farmer Tour gathers \u201cin-person\u201d field yield data from the primary corn and soybean production areas in seven states during the third or fourth week of August, which is then adjusted for crop maturity and historical differences between tour data and final yield numbers. Yield adjustments are also made in states that have unique conditions in certain areas of a state, such as drought conditions, irrigation in Nebraska, and geographical differences in states like Minnesota.\nFor several years, DTN has conducted a \u201cdigital yield tour\u201d of the primary corn and soybean production areas in the United States. DTN derives their yield estimates utilizing satellite imagery taken during the second week of August, which is then adjusted based on actual rainfall amounts and temperature data, as well as for the drought index. The DTN yield data will continue to be updated into September. DTN did not issue a national corn or soybean yield estimate in the August estimates.\nNationally, the Pro Farmer corn yield estimate was 181.1, compared to 183.1 bushels per acre in the Aug. 12 USDA Crop Report. The 2024 national corn yield projections from USDA and Pro Farmer both exceed the final 2023 record average U.S. corn yield of 177.3 bushels per acre. The 2024 national corn yield projections also compare to other national average U.S. corn yields of 173.3 bushels per acre in 2022, 177 bushels per acre in 2021, 172 bushels per acre in 2020, and 167.4 bushels per acre in 2019.\nThe national yield differences between the USDA corn yield estimate (183.1 bu./acre) and the Pro Farmer projection (181.1 bu./acre) may not seem significant; however, that could potentially represent a difference in the final total 2024 U.S. corn production level. Depending on U.S. and world corn demand, that yield difference could affect the U.S. corn supply, which in turn could impact grain market prices in the coming months. \nThe current difference between the corn yield estimates from USDA and Pro Farmer is two bushels per acre. Based on the USDA estimate of 82.7 million harvested acres of corn in the U.S. in 2024, that yield difference represents over 165 million bushels of corn. USDA is currently estimating the 2024-25 U.S. corn ending stocks at nearly 2.1 billion bushels, based on the USDA estimated yield of 183.1 bushels per acre. A national yield decline of two bushels per acre in 2024 would potentially reduce U.S. corn carryout levels by about 8%.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn many instances, there was not a lot of consistency in the state-by-state average corn yield estimates from the various sources. Some states had higher projected corn yields in the Aug. 12 USDA crop report compared to estimates released by the crop tours and digital surveys, while in other states the USDA projected yield trailed the private estimates. For example, USDA estimated the 2024 Minnesota corn yield at 185 bushels per acre and DTN was at 186.7 bushels per acre, compared to the estimate of 170 bushels per acre by Pro Farmer. \nIn South Dakota, the corn yield estimates were 162 bushels per acre by USDA and 166.7 bushels per acre by DTN, while Pro Farmer was at 156 bushels per acre. On the other hand, the private company corn yield projections for Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska were fairly close to the USDA yield estimates. Crop and weather conditions in the northern Corn Belt have been much more variable than in the eastern Corn Belt during the 2024 growing season.\nNASS estimated the 2024 U.S. national average soybean yield at 53.3 bushels per acre in the Aug. 12 USDA Report, which compares to national soybean yield estimate of 54.9 bushels per acre by Pro Farmer. The USDA and Pro Farmer 2024 soybean yield estimates would far exceed the final 2023 national yield of 50.6 bushels per acre and the record national average soybean yield of 51.9 bushels per acre in 2016. Other recent national soybean average yields were 49.5 bushels per acre in 2022, 51.4 bushels per acre in 2021, 50.5 bushels per acre in 2020, and 47.4 bushels per acre in 2019. \nThe various state-by-state soybean yield projections in the northern Corn Belt showed less variation between the August USDA yield estimates and the 2024 yield projections by the private firms than existed with corn. However, the statewide soybean yield projections in the eastern Corn Belt showed more variation among the various estimates, which could be partially due to the different methodologies that are used to calculate yields and the drier weather pattern that have developed in portions of the region.\nBased on the Aug. 19 USDA Crop Progress Report, 67% of the U.S. corn crop is \u201cgood-to-excellent,\u201d which compares to late August crop ratings of 58% in 2023 and 55% in 2022. Only 11% of the U.S. corn crop was rated \u201cpoor-to-very poor.\u201d The highest statewide \u201cgood-to-excellent\u201d ratings were Missouri at 79%, Iowa at 77%, Illinois at 76%, Indiana at 73%, Nebraska at 72%, and South Dakota at 70%. Lower \u201cgood-to excellent\u201d corn ratings were recorded in other Midwest states with Wisconsin at 64%, Minnesota and North Dakota at 61%, and Ohio at 55%. The lowest corn ratings were in Texas at 41% and Kansas at 45%. Most 2024 statewide corn ratings in the Midwest for mid-August exceeded comparable 2023 corn ratings, except in Ohio which had better ratings a year ago.\nThe weekly USDA crop ratings on Aug. 19 listed 68% of the soybean crop in the U.S. as \u201cgood-to-excellent,\u201d which was well above the ratings of 59% in 2023 and 57% in 2022 at this point in the year. Many of the Midwest States with the largest soybean acreage were in the higher crop ratings categories. Iowa led the way at 77%, followed by Nebraska at 74%, Indiana at 72% and Illinois at 70%. The soybean \u201cgood-to-excellent\u201d ratings in other States included Minnesota at 69%, South Dakota at 68%, Wisconsin at 62% North Dakota at 57%, and Ohio at 56%. All of the Midwest States in the primary soybean production area in the U.S., except Ohio, had higher \u201cgood-to-excellent\u201d ratings in late August this year, as compared to 2023.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAreas of the Midwest that were not impacted by adverse weather earlier in the growing season and continue to receive frequent rainfall events during August could actually see a boost in final yield results. There could be some concern in Minnesota, northwest Iowa, North Dakota, and Wisconsin with getting the later planted crops and the replanted soybeans mature, especially if the first frost occurs in September.\nKent Thiesse is a Farm Management Analyst and writes the weekly \"Focus on Ag\" column.

During the late grain filling, daytime temperature was above-normal and nighttime temperature was near or below-normal, except for NE with above-average night temperatures. Rainfall was well below normal across the entire region, with most sites receiving little or no rain during the past three weeks. Rainfall was near normal only in the northernmost region (ND and northern MN) and a couple of locations in IA and KS. A summary of weather conditions during the past three weeks is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\nFigure 2. Simulated developmental stage for irrigated and rainfed corn at each location. R4: dough; R5: dent; physiological maturity: Matured. Separate maps are shown for irrigated corn (top) and rainfed corn (bottom).\nNear Average Yields in Irrigated Corn\nForecasted end-of-season irrigated yields are shown in Figure 3 and 4. Almost every irrigated site (11 out of 13) exhibited near-average yields. Although temperatures in NE have been above average over the past three weeks, yields remain consistent with our previous forecast and similar to the historical averages, while being higher than the previous (2023) season.\nRainfed Corn: Near-to-Above Average Yields Across Rainfed Sites\nThere is a high probability of near to above-average yields for most sites. Overall, 46% of the sites (18 out of 39) are projected to achieve near average yields, while 36% (14 out of 39) are expected to obtain above-average yields. Above-average yields are expected in sites located in MN, NE, KS, MO, IL and eastern OH (Figures 3 and 4). Only a few sites in western NE and KS and southern OH exhibited below-average yields.\nOverall, the 2024 yield scenario is above the long-term average, which is in line with our previous report in late August. When compared with the 2023 season results, the current season's scenario is more optimistic in ND, MN, IA, IL and MO. Conversely, the forecasts are more pessimistic in OH compared with last season, while KS, NE and IN are expected to have fairly similar yields overall.\n\n\nFigure 3. Vertical lines indicate the range of forecasted 2024 corn yield potential by Sept. 17 based on average 2024 planting date at each location. Horizontal lines indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles of the yield distribution (associated with respective adverse and favorable weather scenarios during the rest of the season). The blue squares indicate the long-term (2005-2023) average yield potential at each location and the red dots represent the forecasted 2024 corn yield potential at sites that have already reached maturity. Separate charts are shown for irrigated corn (top) and rainfed corn (bottom).\n\n\nFigure 4. Probability of the 2024 yield potential to be below (at least 10% below for rainfed sites or 5% for irrigated sites, red color), near (\u00b110% for rainfed sites or \u00b15% for irrigated sites, yellow color), and above (at least 10% above for rainfed sites or 5% above for irrigated sites, green color) the long-term (2005-2023) average yield potential at each location. Separate maps are shown for irrigated corn (top) and rainfed corn (bottom). The larger a color section is within the pie chart, the higher the probability that end-of-season corn yield will be in that category.\nConclusions\nAggregated at regional level, our forecasted yield potential this season is 6% above the historical yield trend. In line with USDA predictions (view USDA charts here), our forecast foresees higher average corn yield compared to that from last year. Our forecast suggests a near average year for a majority of irrigated sites.\nFor rainfed corn, most sites (>80%) expect near or above average yields, except for a few sites in western NE and KS and southern OH, where there is a high probability of below-average yields.\nNote that these forecasts do not take into consideration problems with stand emergence, hail/flooding damage, replanting situations, disease or nitrate leaching. In fields negatively affected by these constraints, actual yields will be lower than estimates provided here.\nIt is important to keep in mind that yield forecasts are not field specific and, instead, represent an estimate of average on-farm yield for a given location and surrounding area in absence of the yield-reducing factors mentioned here. Likewise, crop stages and forecasted yields will deviate from those reported here in fields with planting dates or hybrid maturities that differ markedly from those used as the basis for these forecasts.\nTags:\u00a0\n2024 Corn Yield Forecasts\nCorn Yield Forecasts\nCorn\nHybrid-Maize\nOnline Master of Science in Agronomy\nWith a focus on industry applications and research, the online program is designed with maximum flexibility for today's working professionals.\nLearn More\n\n\n\nAddress\n105 Ag.

High level findings (download local data, including monthly precipitation)\n\n\nSeptember temperature anomalies in the U.S. were elevated across much of the country: 171 out of 191 analyzed cities were warmer than normal. The highest anomalies were in the Midwest and northern Great Plains (Figure 1).\n\n\nThis was the hottest September on record in 12 cities \u2013 including Denver, Minneapolis, and Phoenix \u2013 and was in the top 5 hottest Septembers for an additional 26 cities.\n\n\nThe Northern Rockies and Plains, as well as the Upper Midwest showed particularly elevated September temperatures. Average temperatures across the Northern Rockies and Plains were 5.4 \u00b0F higher than normal, and 4.3 \u00b0F in the Upper Midwest.\n\n\nClimate Shift Index (CSI) values meanwhile followed a different trend: Southwest and Florida cities stood out, experiencing the highest number of days with climate change-influenced temperatures at or above CSI 3 (temperatures made at least 3x more likely because of climate change).\n\n\nOn average, cities analyzed in the Southwest experienced at least 10 days with temperatures resulting in CSI values greater than or equal to 3. With the exception of the Southeast (with an average of 6 days), this was more than double the number of CSI 3 days experienced on average by cities in any other region.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Threaded ACIS temperature anomalies for September 2024\u00a0 relative to the 1991-2020 standard normal period. Analysis based on ERA5 data (September 1-26) and GFS data (September 27-30).\n\nFigure 2. Days with a CSI of 3 or higher for September 2024 for ACIS threaded stations.\n2. Local temperature anomaly analysis\u00a0(download local data, including monthly precipitation)\n\n\nThe most unusually hot city in September was Rapid City, South Dakota, where it was 8.70\u00b0F hotter than normal. Septembers in Rapid City have warmed 4.2\u00b0F on average since 1970.\n\n\nBismarck, North Dakota, stood out as the 3rd most unusually warm city (with a temperature anomaly of 7.63\u00b0F), and as the city with the 7th strongest warming trend since 1970 (an average September today is 6.7\u00b0F warmer on average than in 1970)\n\n\n14 cities had September temperature anomalies greater than 5\u00b0F. These were in Montana (3 cities), Colorado (2), North Dakota (2), Minnesota (2), South Dakota (2), Arizona (1), Michigan (1), Washington (1), and Wisconsin (1).\n\n\n189 out of 191 ACIS stations analyzed had positive temperature trends for September, indicating that these cities have been warming on average since 1970.\n\n\nReno, NV had a moderately warm September (with an average daily temperature anomaly of 1.16\u00b0F), and is the fastest-warming ACIS station for September on average, warming 10.6 \u00b0F on average since 1970.\n\n\n3. Local Climate Shift Index analysis (download local data, including monthly precipitation)\n\n\n19 out of 191 ACIS stations analyzed had at least one week with daily CSI values greater than or equal to 3, indicating that temperatures on those days were made at least three times as likely due to climate change in those cities.\n\n\nSan Juan, Puerto Rico had 30 days at CSI 5, indicating that temperatures on these days were made at least 5 times more likely to occur because of climate change.\n\n\n5 out of the top 10 cities with the strongest climate signal were in Florida (Miami, West Palm Beach, Fort Myers, Sarasota, Tampa). Additionally, each of these cities had at least 9 days of temperatures with CSI values of 5.\n\n\nOn average, cities analyzed in the Southwest experienced at least 10 days with temperatures resulting in CSI values greater than or equal to 3. With the exception of the Southeast (with an average of 6 days), this was more than double the number of CSI 3 days experienced on average by cities in any other region.\n\n\nMethods\nCalculating the Climate Shift Index\nAll Climate Shift Index (CSI) levels reported in this brief are based on daily average temperatures and\u00a0 ERA5 data from September 1 to September 26, 2024, and GFS data from September 27 to September 30, 2024. See the frequently asked questions for details on computing the Climate Shift Index, including a summary of the multi-model approach described in Gilford et al. (2022).\nCity Analysis\nWe analyzed 191 Applied Climate Information System (ACIS) stations associated with U.S. cities. For each city, we found the CSI time series from the nearest 0.25\u00b0 grid cell. We calculated the number of days at CSI levels 2, 3, 4, and 5. We used ACIS data to find the average monthly temperatures, temperature anomalies, and precipitation information, and to derive average monthly warming trends for each city.\nClick here for more information about the Climate Shift Index\nMajor funding provided by the Bezos Earth Fund and The Schmidt Family Foundation.\nCustom email signup\nGet updates, media alerts, and climate reporting resources\nSign up\nSupport our work\nThere are lots of ways to help fund Climate Central today\nLearn more\n\n\nContact Us\n\nCareers\n\n\nGive now\n\n\nWays to give\n\n\nFinancials\n\n\nFunders\n\n\nInstagram\n\nFacebook\nX\nYouTube\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Climate Central\n\nTerms of use\nPrivacy policy\nEditorial independence\n\n",

(DTN) -- A pair of new names joined two familiar ones amongst the list of wheat growers earning the title of \"Bin Buster\" in the 2024 National Wheat Yield Contest. On Monday, the National Wheat Foundation (NWF) announced this year's 26 national and 94 state winners, including those who topped the contest's four main categories.\nPhillip Gross of Warden, Washington, bested all contestants in 2024 and earned Bin Buster honors with his irrigated hard red winter wheat entry that yielded 223.08 bushels per acre (bpa). It's the second-highest yield recorded in the contest's nine-year history and Gross' fifth time atop the category.\nThe dryland winter wheat Bin Buster was Steve VanGrunsven of Forest Grove, Oregon, who earned the title for the second time with soft white winter wheat that averaged 170.63 bpa. Jess Blatchford of Baker City, Oregon, was named Bin Buster for the first time with irrigated soft white spring wheat yielding 174.74 bpa; while Nick Pfaff of Bismarck, North Dakota, also a first-time Bin Buster, took the dryland spring wheat category with an entry of 117.60 bpa.\nThe NWF yield contest is designed to encourage wheat growers to strive for high yield, quality and profit while trying new and innovative management strategies. DTN/Progressive Farmer is the official media outlet of the competition.\nThe overall contest record was set in 2022 by Rylee Reynolds of Castleford, Idaho, who produced 231.37 bpa of irrigated soft white winter wheat.\nAdditional national awards were presented to dryland wheat growers who raised a crop that excelled when compared to others in the county where it was produced. Entries are judged based on their percentage above their five-year Olympic county average, a figure published annually by USDA. This levels the playing field and provides a means of recognizing growers who succeed at producing wheat in lower-yielding areas.\nThis year, David Ebers of Wellston, Oklahoma, produced dryland hard red winter wheat that yielded 136.42 bpa -- 350.52% above his county average of 30.28 bpa. In Richardton, North Dakota, Greg Messer raised dryland hard red spring wheat that yielded 106.65 bpa, which was 166.49% above his county average of 40.02 bpa.\nNWF also tested out a new category, Digital Yield, as part of this year's contest. Open to dryland spring wheat growers in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, this pilot category allowed growers to use technologies such as John Deere Operations Center, Climate FieldView or Bushel -- along with data from their calibrated grain cart scales -- to submit their yield into the contest from a 20-acre selected area from a previously entered field. By comparison, the four main categories require that contestants harvest and report at least 1.5 contiguous acres.\nBrad Disrud of Rolla, North Dakota, won this new category with a hard red spring wheat that yielded 102 bpa across 20 acres. John Hofer of Milnor, North Dakota, earned the digital yield award for highest percentage above county average with a yield of 98 bpa, which was 61.98% above his county average of 60.5 bpa.\n\"We are pleased with how the pilot digital yield category went and how much we can learn from it,\" said Anne Osborne, NWF project manager for the contest. \"We expect to continue this type of category and will take time this winter to gather feedback from the participants and our partners who helped us develop this category to refine it even more.\"\nBoth spring and winter wheat growers faced their share of weather challenges while producing this year's crop. DTN Ag Meteorologist John Baranick noted extensive drought was ongoing to start the planting season for winter wheat last fall in the Central and Southern Plains -- but only in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, southern Oklahoma and Texas. The majority of the soft red winter wheat areas were in much better shape, though they did get dry for a few weeks during the early growing period.\n\"There was a nice burst of precipitation in October 2023 with a strong storm system that went through, otherwise the fall was rather dry,\" Baranick said. \"The winter was not. It was a very active period through most of the middle of the country and Pacific Northwest, especially in January.\n\"While the Northern Plains didn't end up with a lot of snow, they did get decent enough moisture as soils rarely froze and frost lines were very shallow,\" he added. \"The good precipitation either reduced or eliminated drought for most all wheat-growing territories, bringing in some good soil moisture and making it available as spring started early with warm temperatures in February and March.\"\nThough temperatures were generally above normal in April and May, Baranick said there were a couple of cold snaps that brought some frost damage in hard red winter wheat areas and some northern soft red winter ones.\n\"The pattern stayed active in spring, though it was patchy,\" he said. \"Some areas of drought came and went, but by the beginning of May, almost none of the wheat territory in the country had drought.\"\nThe exception, he noted, was central and western Kansas, a region that just seemed to miss out on most of the rainfall while kernels were filling. The weather improved in June, but by that point, it was too late.\n\"And the severe weather that was now very active became more of a hindrance,\" Baranick concluded. \"In contrast, spring wheat areas in the Northern Plains and even much of the Pacific Northwest continued to have largely favorable weather into the summer. Drought stayed low until the crop was starting to undergo harvest when the pattern turned hotter and drier.\"\nThanks to the combination of a mostly conducive growing season and the creation of a new website, interest in the contest soared in 2024. Osborne said total entries reached a record 516 this year, eclipsing the contest's all-time high set in 2020 by nearly 100 entries.\n\"The new website, along with all our great partners promoting the contest, created more interest and enthusiasm for the contest,\" said Bernard Peterson, NWF chairman and farmer from Bardstown, Kentucky. \"We appreciate all the growers who participated and our partners who supported the contest. Congratulations to all the winners and to everyone who is learning how to raise higher yield and quality wheat through their experiences in the contest.\"\nIn total, 94 state yield contest winners were named from 29 states. Their yield average across all categories was 133.09 bpa, up from 127 bpa in 2023. The 24 national winners in the contest's four traditional categories hail from 11 states. Their entries' yield average was 145.05 bpa, an increase from 144 bpa last year.\nThough contest winners are selected based on yield, emphasis is also placed on the production of high-quality grain. The 26 national winners are required to submit a 10-pound sample that will be analyzed for milling and baking qualities. The soft wheat samples will be tested at the Wheat Marketing Center in Portland, Oregon; the hard wheat samples will be sent to the Great Plains Analytical Laboratory in Kansas City, Missouri. A panel of experts will rank the wheat samples by quality, and the winners will be announced in mid-January.\nNational winners are awarded a trip to the Commodity Classic, which will be held in March 2025 in Denver where they will be recognized at the NWF Winner's Reception on March 2, 2025.\nPartnering sponsors for the 2024 National Wheat Yield Contest included WestBred, John Deere, U.S. Wheat Associates, BASF, Croplan, Eastman, Limagrain Cereal Seeds, The McGregor Companies, AgriMAXX, Ardent Mills, Bushel, Climate FieldView, Corteva, DynaGro, GrainSense, Kentucky Small Grain Growers Association, Mennel, North Carolina Small Grain Growers Association, Ohio Corn & Wheat, PlainsGold, Siemer Milling Company, UPL, UniSouth Genetics, Grain Craft, Kansas Wheat, Miller Milling, Michigan Wheat, Montana Grain Growers Association, Northern Crops Institute and North Dakota Mill & Elevator.\nVisit www.dtnpf.com in the coming weeks for profiles of this year's \"Bin Buster\" award winners.\n**\n2024 NATIONAL WINNERS\nWINTER WHEAT DRYLAND CATEGORY WINNERS:\n-- Bin Buster: Steve VanGrunsven\nForest Grove, Oregon\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds Shine\nYield: 170.63 bpa\n-- First Place: Jeffery Krohn\nOwendale, Michigan\nVariety: DF Seeds 271\nYield: 170.10 bpa\n-- Second Place: Clint Zenner\nGenesee, Idaho\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds Shine\nYield: 167.03 bpa\n-- Third Place: Garrett Warren\nDayton, Washington\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds 50% Shine/50% Jefe\nYield: 164.68 bpa\n-- Fourth Place: Scott Truszkowski\nStewartsville, New Jersey\nVariety: Dyna-Gro 9070\nYield: 152.33 bpa\n-- Fifth Place: Mark Deysher\n\n                    More Recommended for You\n                \n\n                    Recommended for You\n                \nBath, Pennsylvania\nVariety: Seedway SW65\nYield: 152.32 bpa\n**\nWINTER WHEAT DRYLAND ABOVE COUNTY AVERAGE WINNERS:\n-- First Place: David Ebers\nWellston, Oklahoma\nVariety: WestBred WB4422\nYield: 136.42 bpa, 350.52% above Lincoln County, Oklahoma, average\n-- Second Place: Koby Dickerson\nVernon, Texas\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds Steel AX\nYield: 102.80 bpa, 305.69% above Wilbarger County, Texas, average\n-- Third Place: Tom Hill\nTonkawa, Oklahoma\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds Warbird AX\nYield: 135.64 bpa, 282.72% above Kay County, Oklahoma, average\n-- Fourth Place: Dylan Lindsey\nLamont, Oklahoma\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds Atomic AX\nYield: 130.05 bpa, 270.51% over Grant County, Oklahoma, average\n-- Fifth Place: Cheryl Lindsey\nTonkawa, Oklahoma\nVariety: PlainsGold Kivari AX\nYield: 130.32 bpa, 267.71% above Kay County, Oklahoma, average\n**\nWINTER WHEAT IRRIGATED CATEGORY:\n-- Bin Buster: Phillip Gross\nWarden, Washington\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds Jet\nYield: 223.08 bpa\n-- First Place: Oree Reynolds\nCastleford, Idaho\nVariety: WestBred WB1621\nYield: 220.81 bpa\n-- Second Place: Zach Balahtsis\nTonkawa, Oklahoma\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds Warbird AX\nYield: 177.52 bpa\n**\nSPRING WHEAT DRYLAND CATEGORY:\n-- Bin Buster: Nick Pfaff\nBismarck, North Dakota\nVariety: Croplan 3099A\nYield: 117.60 bpa\n-- First Place: John Wesolowski\nWarren, Minnesota\nVariety: WestBred WB9590\nYield: 114.93 bpa\n-- Second Place: Dale Flikkema\nBozeman, Montana\nVariety: WestBred WB9668\nYield: 113.74 bpa\n-- Third Place: Bruce & Helle Ruddenklau\nAmity, Oregon\nVariety: WestBred WB9668\nYield: 106.95 bpa\n**\nSPRING WHEAT DRYLAND ABOVE COUNTY AVERAGE WINNERS:\n-- First Place: Greg Messer\nRichardton, North Dakota\nVariety: WestBred WB9590\nYield: 106.65 bpa, 166.49% above Stark County, North Dakota, average\n-- Second Place: Austin Kautzman\nMott, North Dakota\nVariety: WestBred WB9590\nYield: 90.13 bpa, 147.01% above Grant County, North Dakota, average\n-- Third Place: Jordan Christman\nHettinger, North Dakota\nVariety: WestBred WB9590\nYield: 87.36 bpa, 137.40% above Adams County, North Dakota, average\n**\nSPRING WHEAT IRRIGATED CATEGORY:\n-- Bin Buster: Jess Blatchford\nBaker City, Oregon\nVariety: WestBred WB6341\nYield: 174.74 bpa\n-- First Place: Dallin Wilcox\nRexburg, Idaho\nVariety: WestBred WB7589\nYield: 169.94 bpa\n-- Second Place: Joel Zwainz\nReardan, Washington\nVariety: WSU Tekoa\nYield: 165.35 bpa\n**\nPILOT DIGITAL YIELD - SPRING WHEAT DRYLAND\n-- High Yield: Brad Disrud\nRolla, North Dakota\nVariety: WestBred WB9590\nYield: 102.00 bpa\n-- High Above County Yield: John Hofer\nMilnor, North Dakota\nVariety: WestBred WB9590\nYield: 98.00 bpa, 61.98% above Ranson County, North Dakota, average\n**\nFor more information on the yield contest and to view past winners, go to: https://www.wheatcontest.org/\u2026.\nJason Jenkins can be reached at jason.jenkins@dtn.com\nFollow him on social platform X @JasonJenkinsDTN\n(c) Copyright 2024 DTN, LLC.

      "Production Outlook: Turning a Corner in 2024\nAs harvest rolls throughout the U.S. Plains, farmers see the culmination of their year\u2019s hard work and investment as crops move from field to bin, eventually becoming products consumed worldwide. After three years of drought that reduced yields, impacted quality, and drove near-record abandonment, the 2024 harvest season stands out as the most promising in recent memory.\nThe following will outline current harvest progress, crop conditions, and export trends for the marketing year to date as the 2024 crop suggests production will \u201cturn a corner\u201d away from the challenges seen over the last three years.\nWhen the 2023 U.S. winter wheat crop was seeded in 2022, income potential for wheat appeared favorable, with prices still elevated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. As a result, total seeded wheat area for 2023 was up 8% from the prior year. With current prices falling in line, or in some cases below pre-war trends, and input prices remaining high, profit margins have tightened, placing additional pressure on farmers. As a result, 2024 wheat acres were down 5% to 47.2 million acres, nearly even with the five-year average.\nLooking at the acreage by class, the area included 24.1 million acres of HRW (down 6% year over year), 6.1 million acres of SRW (down 17%), 10.6 million acres of HRS (up 1%), 2.2 million acres of durum (up 31%), and 4.6 million acres of white wheat (up 6%). Although the 2024 wheat area is lower year over year, the July 2024 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) put U.S. wheat production a 54.6 MMT, up 10% from the year prior on increased yields, improved weather, and good moisture. Source: July WASDE\nAs the U.S. winter wheat harvest begins to wind down, the July 21 Crop Progress Report estimates that 76% of winter wheat is in the bin, up 11 points from the year prior and 4 points ahead of the five year average. Warm weather and improved moisture accelerated crop maturation across much of the hard red winter (HRW) growing region and the first by class estimates put HRW production at 20.8 MMT, a 27% increase from the year prior. On the other hand, soft red winter (SRW) production estimates sit at 9.4 MMT, down 23% from last year\u2019s record yields, though still sitting 4% ahead of the five-year average.\nSpring wheat development remains on schedule with 89% of the crop headed, nearly even with the five-year average. As of July 21, 77% of the crop sits in good to excellent condition, up from 49% last year as rains and cool weather boost yield potential. A reflection of the good ratings, the July WASDE put hard red spring (HRS) production at 14.5 MMT and durum at 2.4 MMT, a yearly increase of 14% and 51%, respectively. For white wheat (which includes both winter and spring varieties), production estimates sit at 7.6 MMT, a 19% increase year over year.\nAlthough the 2024 wheat area is lower year over year, the July 2024 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) put U.S. wheat production a 54.6 MMT, up 10% from the year prior on increased yields, improved weather, and good moisture. The USDA estimates also show renewed optimism for exports, with the July projections setting exports at 22.4 MMT, the highest since 2020/21, but still 15% below the pre-drought five-year average. Source: July WASDE\n\u00a0\nMore normalized production has helped prices become more competitive in recent weeks. When U.S. wheat prices hit multi year lows in late June, buyers responded with increased purchases of U.S. wheat, peaking at 805,300 MT on June 27, 2024. Over the last month, weekly net sales averaged 576,200 MT and as of July 11, the total known outstanding sales for MY 2024/25 reached 7.7 MMT, 49% ahead of last year\u2019s pace.\nCustomers worldwide have increased their purchases relative to last year, with notable increases in four of the top five U.S. wheat importers to date. Likewise, buyers in Panama, Brazil, Thailand, and Indonesia have logged additional sales, showing increase of 571%, 240%, 175%, and 273%. Source: USDA FAS Export Sales Data\nCustomers worldwide have increased their purchases relative to last year, with notable increases in four of the top five U.S. wheat importers to date. The USDA\u2019s July projections reflect this renewed optimism, setting exports at 22.4 MMT, the highest since 2020/21, though still 15% below the pre-drought five-year average.\nAs the harvest progresses, there is an opportunity to capitalize on the value of U.S. wheat. Price spreads have narrowed and continue to align more closely with other origins. Improved production simplifies purchasing decisions, and as always, U.S. Wheat Associates is ready to help customers find the best value.\nWheatletter Sidebar\nQuick Links\nWheat Letter Related Blogs\nA Look Ahead: What We Know about the 2025/26 Crop\nVideo: USW Shares Story of U.S. Wheat with Southeast Asia\u2019s Flour Millers at IAOM Meeting\nStay up to date on wheat industry news!\nThink Farm Export Programs Don\u2019t Matter?

      "Iowa Soybean Harvest Explained in 3 Simple Pie Charts\nIowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said combines have been \u201crolling in many parts of the state as fields are ready.\u201d \nCharmayne Hefley grew up in southern California where she spent her first ten years riding horses and competing in barrel-racing. These days, she writes the weekly drought monitor article for Successful Farming as a freelance writer.\u00a0\n Soybean harvest in Iowa is off to a typical start, according to Monday\u2019s Crop Progress report. Here\u2019s a summary of the season so far, as explained by farmers, agronomists, and three simple pie charts.\n\n  Soybean harvest and yield  \n Farmers in Iowa harvested 9% of the state\u2019s corn crop before the Sept. 23 report. According to USDA's June Acreage report, that means there are still more than 8.9 million acres of soybeans to be harvested in the state.\n\n This year\u2019s soybean harvest is equal to last year at this time, when 9% of the state\u2019s crop had been harvested. Both this year and last year\u2019s harvest is ahead of the five-year average of 7%.\u00a0\n\n Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said combines have been \u201crolling in many parts of the state as fields are ready.\u201d\u00a0\n\n Some rain over the weekend of Sept. 21 slowed harvest progress for some farmers, Naig said, but harvest is only expected to continue ramping up statewide. \u201cThe warmer and drier outlook into early October should provide an excellent window of opportunity for many farmers.\u201d\n\n On Monday, Cael Garrett of Crawford County, Iowa, said he just had two more fields of soybeans left to harvest. \u201cOne is 73 acres that had some water damage,\u201d he said, \u201cso we had to replant most of it. It\u2019s going to be a couple more days before we start on that.\u201d\n\n The other field wrapped up harvest on Monday, Garrett said. This would put Garrett well ahead of the rest of the state\u2019s farmers when it comes to harvesting soybeans, which he says is a result of desiccating his farm\u2019s beans. \u201cWe\u2019re much further ahead than the majority of the people in our area,\u201d he said. \u201cThe average person is around half done or more.\u201d\n\n As harvest wraps up for Garrett, he said his yield average is between 60 to 65 bushels per acre (bpa) this year.\u00a0\n\n  Soybean condition  \n Despite another week of hot and dry weather in Iowa, soybean conditions remained predominantly good to excellent for the week ending Sept. 22.\n\n USDA\u2019s most recent ratings were 1% very poor, 3% poor, 18% fair, 60% good, and 18% excellent.\n\n These ratings are a significant improvement from last year at this time, when USDA rated Iowa\u2019s soybean crop 4% very poor, 10% poor, 37% fair, 43% good, and 6% excellent.\n\n  Time for fieldwork  \n USDA said there were 6.3 days suitable for fieldwork for the week ending Sept. 22. Due to the warm conditions, farmers were able to continue progressing with both corn and soybean harvest.\n\n Justin Glisan, Iowa state climatologist, said that unseasonable warmth continued as summer came to a close, \u201cwith most Iowa stations reporting temperature 8\u00b0 to 12\u2109 above normal.\u201d\u00a0\n\n The statewide average temperature was 10.6\u2109 above normal at 73.1\u2109, Glisan said.\u00a0\n\n Below-normal precipitation also impacted Iowa farmers for the third consecutive reporting period, Glisan said, \u201cwith the driest conditions in eastern and extreme western Iowa.\u201d\u00a0\n\n The 6- to 10-day precipitation outlook published Sept. 24 by NOAA shows below normal rainfall for Iowa for Sept. 30 through Oct. 4.\n\nNational Weather Service\nRelated Articles\nFollow Us\n"

      "A Quick Look at the 2024 Rice Market\n\u22c5 BY RYAN LOY \u22c5\nUniversity of Arkansas Division of Agriculture\nFollowing two consecutive years of decline (see Figure 1), United States rice production increased to roughly 2.9 million acres in 2023. In 2022 and 2023, the world was consuming more rice, which showed up in the long grain rice Marketing Year Average Prices (MYAP) of $16.70/cwt and $15.7/cwt, respectively. Production increases in 2023 (see Figure 1) followed 2022 high prices that were last seen around harvest of 2013. Fast forward to March 2024, where the then current November rough rice futures contract was trading at $14.66/cwt. The November contract price decline has been steady since late December 2023 but has recently begun to increase again ($0.44/cwt since Feb. 27, 2024).\u00a0\n\n\nThere was an extreme multi-year drought in California during the 2022 growing season. During this time, California rice producers could not plant nearly 300,000 acres, due to a lack of water for irrigation. Arkansas (a state that almost exclusively grows long-grain varieties) responded by increasing its acreage of medium-grain rice by 55,000 acres in 2023. However, California rebounded in 2023 and surpassed 500,000 acres of medium-grain rice. An abundance of medium-grain rice could hinder any upside price potential if the demand for medium-grain remains at normal levels.\nAn Eastern Pacific El Ni\u00f1o has also disrupted off-season rice production for Thailand, Burma, and Indonesia. These countries rely on off-season production to improve their stocks and export amounts. Now, they face extreme drought, impacting yields and production, and may not have enough carry over and ending stocks to bring rice to the global economy. The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts that global rice production for 2023/24 will exceed 2022/23 by only 0.1% (583,000 metric tons). Thus, the El Ni\u00f1o conditions are poised to further tighten global rice supplies in these major exporting countries.\u00a0\nGlobal rice supplies are also strained from India\u2019s July 2023 export ban on non-basmati rice. The ban was implemented to help lower domestic rice prices and to ensure rice availability in India. On a global scale, India accounted for nearly 40% of all rice exports in 2022, further showing the global impact of India\u2019s exports. Referring to Figure 2, the ban forced a 93% decline in non-basmati rice exports between August and November of 2023. Importing countries are now forced to turn to alternative suppliers to meet their rice demands. It\u2019s worth noting that India is currently in an election year and it\u2019s doubtful the ban would be lifted before a general election in April or May. If the ban is lifted post-election, watch for Indian rice to flood the market and put further downward pressure on global rice prices.\u00a0\nOverall, the 2024 rice market will be extremely sensitive to ongoing global conflicts, weather, government policies, and shipping issues such as low water levels in the Panama Canal, a potential return to low water levels in the Mississippi River, and conflicts in the Red Sea. There could continue to be opportunities in the export market should Mississippi River levels stabilize during harvest and if India\u2019s export ban continues. With it being early in the season, it\u2019s worth highlighting that on a per-bushel basis, the recent soybean-to-rice price ratio for November 2024 delivery was 1.78 ($11.73/$6.60). This ratio has continued to decline since 2021, when the ratio was 2.41. All to say that the relative prices of other commodities, such as soybeans, are in a similar declining price environment as rice.\u200a\u00a0\nIndustry News: May 2024\nPartnership Between LSU AgCenter, Horizon Ag to Benefit Rice Industry\nMSU Scientists on Team to Digitize Crop Nutrient Management\n\n\nWebsite by Web Publisher PRO\n\u00a9 2007 -  2024 One Grower Publishing.

Recently, innovative agricultural practices, advanced sensors, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices have made it possible to improve the efficiency of water use. However, it is the application of control strategies based on advanced machine learning techniques that enables the adoption of smart irrigation scheduling and the immediate economic, social, and environmental benefits. This challenging research area has attracted the attention of many researchers worldwide, who have proposed several technological and methodological solutions. Unfortunately, the results of these scientific efforts have not yet been categorized in a thematic survey, making it difficult to understand how far we are from optimal water management based on machine learning. This paper fills this gap by focusing on smart irrigation systems with an emphasis on machine learning. More specifically, the generic structure of a smart agriculture system is presented, and existing machine learning strategies and available datasets are discussed. Furthermore, several open issues are identified, especially in the processing of long-term data, also due to the lack of corresponding annotated datasets. Finally, some interesting future research directions to be pursued in order to build scalable, domain-independent approaches are proposed.\n\n\nKeywords: smart irrigation; machine learning; water resources management; precision agriculture\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n  1.

Since then, however, the job market has shifted back to more typical levels of employment, giving many Americans a renewed sense of normalcy.\nBut some industries and parts of the country are still hurting for workers\u2014a trend with ongoing ramifications for consumers and workers alike.\nJobTest.org analyzed Bureau of Labor Statistics data compiled by the Chamber of Commerce to illustrate the current state of Nebraska's ongoing labor shortage based on a national analysis. The analysis uses the most recent data available at the national and state levels, from July and June 2024 respectively.\nAccording to government jobs data, there were 8.2 million open jobs in the U.S. in July and only 7.1 million unemployed workers. Even if every unemployed worker had a job, the nation would still have millions of unfilled positions.\nA shortage of workers can be a double-edged sword for consumers. When there are jobs available, it can give workers some leverage to negotiate higher wages. But a worker shortage can also cause companies to raise the price of the goods and services they offer to cover wage increases to attract more job candidates. In the case of industries like health care or public education, difficulty finding skilled professionals to fill open positions can also make it harder for institutions to provide necessary services to the communities they serve.\nNot every unemployed worker is suited for the jobs available, however. As seen in recent years, workers in some metro areas have seen their cost of living rise so dramatically that the jobs offered in industries for which they may be qualified\u2014such as hospitality, food service, and retail\u2014are no longer appealing or even feasible to cover basic expenses like housing, food, and transportation.\nWith job openings clustered in specific areas, location also influences companies' ability to find qualified workers that fit open positions. Only three states\u2014Washington, Nevada, and California\u2014had more unemployed workers than job openings.\nOver the last few years, as job openings far exceeded the unemployed population, reports have suggested that labor shortages could be due in part to discrepancies between workers and employers, with mismatched expectations on wages being among the most prominent. In response, employers have raised pay in certain industries like hospitality to attract viable candidates.\nTake a look at how your state stacks up below.\n\u00a0\nJune Nebraska employment at a glance\n- There were 55 workers for every 100 jobs available in the state.\n- Companies in the state had 22,000 fewer workers compared to what would be needed for full employment.\n- The unemployment rate for the state was 2.6%.\n\nTop 10 states where jobs outpace available workers\n10.

If these planting estimates hold up, Nebraska corn farmers will invest nearly 3.1 billion dollars into the state\u2019s economy over a two-month period as calculated by the University of Nebraska \u2013 Lincoln\u2019s crop budgets. This total is a result of inputs, such as seed, fuel and fertilizer, but does not include land costs, labor or equipment. Despite the seemingly high investments now, the full economic impact will be realized over time.\nCorn planting season has begun in Nebraska, and farmers are expected to invest nearly $3.1 billion into this year\u2019s crop.\n\u201cFarmers are preparing for a large investment during the 2024 planting season,\u201d said Kelly Brunkhorst, executive director of the Nebraska Corn Board (NCB). \u201cAs farmers begin in the fields, the immense pressure of the past year\u2019s drought still weighs heavily on them. A new year brings new possibilities, and producing the strongest quality crop shows an investment in both time and resources in the industry.\u201d\nFarmers in Nebraska historically begin to plant their corn in mid-April and try to finish by mid-May. However, weather often dictates when farmers can plant. The latest Crop Progress report issued by the USDA (released April 15, 2024), showed Nebraska farmers are just starting planting with 2% completed with corn planting, ahead of the five-year average (1%).\n\u201cThe planting season is beginning slowly, as many farmers wait for some much-needed rain to coincide with the warm weather we\u2019ve received,\u201d said Jay Reiners, chairman of NCB and farmer from Juanita. \u201cBe patient as you prepare and make decisions on when to plant; the season is only starting. As you move equipment both to the fields and to the next field, be cautious on rural roads. In the same way, drivers, be conscious of farmers who may be moving slowly. We want each farmer and driver to be safe this planting season.\u201d\nFor more crop progress information throughout the year, follow the Nebraska Corn Board on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nRelated Articles\nCorn Board to Meet, November 2024\n The Nebraska Corn Board will hold its next meeting on Tuesday, November 26, 2024, at The Cornhusker Marriott (333 South 13th Street) in Lincoln, Nebraska.

This was up from 60% the week prior and slightly ahead of the five-year average 73%.\n\n USDA says across all of the top 18 growing states, 29% of the corn crop had reached maturity. This was up from 19% the week prior and ahead of the five-year average 24%.\n\n The USDA says across nine of the top growing states 5% of the crop had been harvested. This was ahead of the five-year average of 3%.\n\n According to the report, the condition of the corn crop in the top growing states, as of Sept. 8, was as follows:\n\n  Soybean crop progress  \n As of Sept. 8, 97% of the soybean crop in the top 18 growing states had reached the pod growth stage, the USDA said. This was up from 94% the week prior and slightly ahead of the five-year average 96%.\n\n The report said across all of those states, 25% of soybeans were dropping leaves. This was up from 13% the week prior and ahead of the five-year average 21%.\n\n According to the report, the condition of the soybean crop in the top growing states as of Sept. 8 was as follows:\n\n  Oat crop progress  \n As of Sept. 8, 94% of oats in the top nine producing states had been harvested, the USDA said. This was up from 89% the week prior and on track with the five-year average.\n\n  Spring wheat progress  \n As of Sept. 8, 85% of the spring wheat crop across the top six growing states had been harvested, the USDA said. This was up from 70% the week prior and ahead the five-year average of 83%.\n\n  Winter wheat progress  \n According to the report, 6% of winter wheat across 11 of the top 18 growing states had been planted as of Sept. 8.

March 29, 2024\nArkansas Rice Update 2024-01\nMarch 29, 2024\nJarrod Hardke, Trent Roberts, and Bob Scott\n\u201cWelcome back my friends to the show that never ends.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nSurvey Says\nThe Prospective Plantings report is in.\u00a0 Check out the tables later in the report for full details across states.\nFor Arkansas, my expectation is that we\u2019ll end up with 1.4-1.5 million total acres.\u00a0\n                              The decline in medium-grain acres combined with the long-grain seed situation puts\n                              a cap on my total possible expectation.\u00a0 While anything is possible, it seems difficult\n                              to climb north of 1.5 million total acres (1.4 million long-grain).\nFall of 2023 and certain windows in late winter / early spring 2024 have a great deal\n                              of ground ready for planting.\u00a0 Some rice planting began in the central and northern\n                              areas of the state beginning last week (~March 20) while the southern area can\u2019t miss\n                              a rain.\u00a0 The unfortunate comment at this time is that the current overall forecast\n                              for April is wetter than normal (Fig. 1).\nIt appears we\u2019ll need to be geared up for whatever window we\u2019re given to take off\n                              planting.\u00a0 Right now, there are conflicting expectations for next week, but local\n                              forecasts and the NOAA precipitation outlook (Fig. 2) are showing declining rain totals for Monday-Tuesday.\u00a0 If we escape that event,\n                              hold onto your hat, next week\u2019s rice planting progress is going to get wild.\nFig. 1.\u00a0 Monthly precipitation outlook for April 2024.\n\nFig. 2.\u00a0 NOAA 7-day precipitation forecast.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2024 Rice Management Guide now available\nThe 2024 Rice Management Guide publication is made possible by the rice growers of Arkansas through the Arkansas\n                              Rice Check-Off administered by the Arkansas Rice Research and Promotion Board and\n                              support from the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.\u00a0 It contains\n                              the most requested production recommendations for rice in a single, easy-to-reference\n                              PDF.\u00a0 It is now available for download, and copies are now available at local county\n                              Extension offices.\n\u00a0\nNitrogen Starter / Early Post-Emergence Fertilizer\nJarrod Hardke and Trent Roberts\nEveryone is looking for an edge this growing season, and several questions regarding\n                              early season (starter) nitrogen (N) applications have come up.\u00a0 Whether we\u2019re talking\n                              ammonium sulfate (AMS), diammonium phosphate (DAP), poultry litter, or liquid N forms,\n                              here are some thoughts.\nPoultry litter is a little different animal so let\u2019s get it out of the way first.\n                                    If litter is applied and incorporated at planting, there will still be some N available\n                                    to rice.\u00a0 We recommend counting 25% of the litter\u2019s N (on an as-is basis) toward your\n                                    preflood N rate.\u00a0 If litter is surface-applied and not incorporated, N loss via ammonia\n                                    volatilization and surface runoff is more of a concern and less N would be available.\nIn general, do not apply starter N fertilizers at planting. Rice plants live off of\n                                    the seed until around the 2-leaf growth stage.\u00a0 Preplant, at-planting, and early post-emergent\n                                    (1-2 leaf) applications of N can be unavailable or lost before rice has a large enough\n                                    root system to take up any of the applied N.\nIf applying an early post-emergence fertilizer, the 2-3 leaf stage is the earliest you should consider making this application. By this time the plant has more of a\n                                    root system and is beginning to rely on the soil N rather than the seed for its nutrient\n                                    demands.\nOn silt loam soils, when applying early post-emergence N at 2-3 leaf or beyond, there\n                                    should be no expectation of a growth or yield response, and any yield response is\n                                    unlikely to cover the cost of fertilizer and application ($35 or 5.2 bu at $6.75 rice).\nOn clay soils, we can expect to see a growth increase of possibly 1-2 inches in plant\n                                    height compared to no early N applied. While a yield increase is still not expected,\n                                    greater plant size may help with flooding fields earlier and saving on herbicide applications\n                                    while also harvesting earlier.\u00a0 The better the growing conditions, the less likely\n                                    a positive growth response will occur when applying early post-emergence N to rice.\nIf rice is progressing slowly or injured, it may be worth considering an early post-emergence\n                                    N application on a field-specific basis. However, in most cases, the rainfall/flush\n                                    incorporating the fertilizer is most beneficial rather than the actual fertilizer\n                                    itself.\nIf you decide to apply early post-emergence N at 2-3 leaf rice or later, do not count\n                                    any of the N toward your preflood N rate. We could possibly count 5-10 lbs N but the\n                                    actual number is highly variable so it is best to not count it towards the preflood\n                                    N rate.\nThere have been some questions about using a liquid N form to go out with herbicide\n                                    at planting. The same arguments apply as above \u2013 it\u2019s too early to be useful and prone\n                                    to loss.\nMake starter/early post-emergence N decisions on a field-specific basis and keep in\n                              mind that environmental conditions will affect what, if any, response is observed\n                              from them.\n\u00a0\nResults of 2022-2023 Planting Date Studies\nJarrod Hardke\nBelow in Figures 3 and 4 are results of planting date studies averaged across 2022 and 2023 for the RREC at\n                              Stuttgart and the NERREC at Harrisburg.\u00a0 Other cultivars that have been included (and\n                              full 2023 results) can be found in the results of the Arkansas Rice Performance Trials publication.\nOne thing that continues to stand out for the study at RREC is that yields are generally\n                              highest planted early (into mid or late April) and begin to decline after we hit early\n                              May.\u00a0 At NERREC, the past two years things have looked a little different, with very\n                              early not being that great while all of April looked optimal with a decline in early\n                              May before a steep drop after that.\nWith the acres we need to cover, getting started on the early side continues to look\n                              good, but if we can end up with most of our rice planted in April we\u2019re going to be\n                              in great shape.\u00a0 The goal is to get rice in by the first week of May if possible.\nFigure 3.\u00a0 Average grain yield by planting date for selected cultivars at the Rice\n                                 Research and Extension Center, Stuttgart, 2022-2023.\n\nFigure 4.\u00a0 Average grain yield by planting date for selected cultivars at the Northeast\n                                 Rice Research and Extension Center, Harrisburg, 2022-2023.\n\n\u00a0\nHerbicide Plant-Back Restrictions\nJarrod Hardke and Bob Scott\nAs we gear up for a hopefully nearing planting window, some fields have been sprayed\n                              with burndown applications somewhat recently. \u00a0A few notable plant-back intervals\n                              to rice for our burndown herbicides are included in Table 1.\u00a0 For additional information see MP519 Row Crop Plant-Back Intervals for Common Herbicides.\nOne herbicide not listed here, but that has been mentioned repeatedly at winter meetings,\n                                 is Dual (s-metolachlor) \u2013 if it was applied in the fall it is not safe to plant rice\n                                 on that field this spring.\nTable 1.\u00a0 Notable burn-down herbicides with plant-back intervals to rice.\n2,4-D\n21 days\nDicamba1\n22 days\nElevore\n14 days\nGoal\n10 months\nLeadoff\n10 months\nMetribuzin\n12 months\nPython\n6 months\nReviton\n120 days\nSelect Max\n30 days\nValor / Afforia\n30 days\nZidua SC (3.25 oz)\n12 months\n1 Plant-back days are rate dependent, days presented are for lowest labeled rate.\nAlways read and follow label directions.\n\u00a0\nThoughts on Prospective Plantings Report\nJarrod Hardke\nIn late November and early December, we seemed destined for a slight decline in Arkansas\n                              to around 1.3 million acres.\u00a0 Since then, prices of competing crops rapidly declined\n                              and changed the game.\u00a0 Since January it has looked as though we would plant similar\n                              acres or more compared to last year\u2019s 1.4+ million acres.\u00a0 So, the total acreage (Table 2) number puts us right in that neighborhood.\u00a0 From a national standpoint, some are\n                              slightly increasing while others and slightly decreasing resulting in not much change.\nMore on Arkansas though:\u00a0 long-grain acres are showing a dramatic increase (Table 3) while medium-grain acres are showing a dramatic decrease (Table 4).\u00a0 It was thought long-grain could go higher but seed shortages seem to be holding\n                              it back.\u00a0 Medium-grain, however, may still be projected a little high in this estimate\n                              but with the long-grain seed shortage some are looking to medium-grain seed as a way\n                              to get more rice acres in.\nOverall, at this point in time, the acreage projection is right in the wheelhouse\n                              for Arkansas though a little higher number toward 1.5 million total acres was where\n                              I was leaning.\u00a0 Spring weather will tell the story on what actually gets planted of\n                              course.\nTable 2.

Scott\n\u201cThe moon is bright and you\u2019re alright down here.\u201d\n\nClimbing the Harvest Ladder\nCrops are disappearing fast in certain areas while others are just really starting\n                              to pick up steam this week.\u00a0 Harvest progress should easily top 20% in Monday\u2019s upcoming\n                              report.\u00a0 Given the outlook for the next week, it will be amazing how much gets out\n                              of the field as grain moistures are beginning to fall rapidly on the heels of the\n                              cooler, dry air we enjoyed for much of this week.\u00a0 Now we\u2019ll get more sun and heat\n                              to cook out the rest.\nThe longer outlook in the 8-14 day range calls for more average temperatures and the\n                              potential for some rainfall.\u00a0 As dry as some of this rice is already starting to get\n                              in places that could spell bad news for quality.\nInterestingly so far, milling yields have continued to be underwhelming.\u00a0 At this\n                              early stage, I still don\u2019t have an answer for that.\u00a0 As far as an idea, the couple\n                              periods of milder temperatures with overcast conditions that occurred over the past\n                              month may have prevented grains from finishing up as firmly and strongly as we would\n                              normally expect.\u00a0 We\u2019ll study on this topic more as we get deeper into harvest \u2013 with\n                              low stink bug numbers and limited periods of high nighttime temperature concern we\n                              would expect better milling yields.\nOn the positive side \u2013 early yields continue to be strong around the state.\u00a0 There\n                              are always hiccup fields, but the vast majority of yield reports are very positive.\nLet us know if we can help.\nFig. 1.\u00a0 NOAA 7-day precipitation forecast.\n\nFig. 2.\u00a0 2012-2024 Arkansas rice harvest progress by week (USDA-NASS).\n\nUSA Rice Leadership

estimate of converting rice kernel counts to harvest loss.\u00a0\n                              There\u2019s a process for arriving at an accurate average number though.\nThe most accurate way to do the count is to count a 10 ft2 area across the entire header width.\u00a0 For a 30 ft header, that\u2019s an area 30 ft wide\n                              x 4 inches.\u00a0 Not a real feasible or convenient count to make.\nInstead, it may be much more straightforward to take a few simple counts from respective\n                              areas behind the machine.\nFor a 30-ft header, think of it as having three 10-ft sections.\u00a0 Take a single square\n                              foot count in the center of each of these 10-ft sections.\u00a0 Add the three counts and\n                              divide them by three to give you an average per square foot.\nRemember to count any kernels already on the ground in an unharvested area to deduct\n                              from your count that has already shattered on the ground.\nTable 2.\u00a0 Converting rice field loss counts into bushels per acre.\n25\n1.3\n50\n2.5\n75\n3.7\n100\n5.1\n125\n6.4\n250\n12.8\n\u00a0\nHerbicide-Resistant Weed Samples\nJason Norsworthy & Bob Scott\nAs harvest gets in full swing, now is often a good time to collect samples from possible\n                              herbicide-resistant weed populations.\u00a0 The primary weeds to be evaluated are barnyardgrass,\n                              Pennsylvania smartweed, weedy rice, and white-margined flatsedge.\nBarnyardgrass samples will be screened against Roundup, Command, Facet, Newpath, Regiment,\n                              Ricestar, and Propanil.\nSmartweed samples will be screened against Gambit and Regiment.\nWeedy rice samples will be screened against Newpath, Provisia, and Rogue.\nTo submit samples:\nCollect 40-50 seedheads from a field.\nPlace seedheads in a paper bag.\nIf submitting multiple samples, keep in separate, labeled bags.\nAllow seedheads to dry for ~7 days.\nDo not use plastic bags or sealed bags as seeds can rot.\nComplete a herbicide resistance screening form for each sample (obtain at county Extension\n                                    office).\nSubmit samples and forms to county Extension office.\nSamples must be received by Nov. 15 \u2013 anything after that date will not be screened.\u00a0\n                                 Results are typically ready in early March.\n\u00a0\nRice Market Update\nScott Stiles\nRice Market Update\nScott Stiles\nMonday\u2019s Crop Progress report from NASS included harvest estimates as of August 18th.\u00a0 Harvest of the 2024 crop continues to advance faster than last year as well as\n                              the 5-year average.\u00a0 Tropical activity in the U.S. Gulf has been surprisingly low-key\n                              this year considering earlier forecasts.\u00a0 Currently there are no organized systems\n                              in the Atlantic.\nTable 3.\u00a0 Rice Harvest - Selected States (%

futures shot 25 cents higher Monday and has since then settled into\n                              a range between $14.80 and $15. When reviewing the rally that occurred from July 19th to August 1st, trading this week has retraced 50% to 62% of that price move.\u00a0 For the time being,\n                              $14.80 is initial support.\nFig. 3.\u00a0 CME November 2024 Rough Rice Futures.\n\nThursday\u2019s Export Sales report didn\u2019t provide much fuel as long-grain business was quiet last week.\u00a0 There\n                              were two rough rice sales of 5,000 tons each reported to Guatemala and Honduras. \u00a0Thus\n                              far, rough rice sales are off to a very strong start in 24/25 with just over 331,000\n                              tons sold compared to 142,893 a year ago.\nThere was one rough rice shipment last week of 25,092 tons to Mexico.\u00a0 Regarding rail\n                              shipping to Mexico, effective from August 21 to September 20, BNSF Railway (BNSF)\n                              will not issue any permits for grain shuttle trains destined to Mexico. \u00a0Service to\n                              Mexico by other railroads (i.e., Union Pacific Railroad or CPKC) is expected to continue\n                              during the Aug. 21 to Sept. 20 timeframe.\nMilled rice sales last week were limited with Haiti, Iraq and Saudi Arabia all absent.\u00a0\n                              A total of 1,924 tons were sold to four (4) markets, most of which was to Mexico.\n                              \u00a0Milled rice sales are 39% behind last year with 132,258 tons sold compared with 216,779\n                              a year ago.\nOptimism from early yield reports and the open stretch of weather for harvest will\n                              be a fundamental headwind for the rice market.\u00a0 However, the cash basis for rice has\n                              remained steady this month.\u00a0 As of Friday, spot delivery bids at mills were hovering\n                              around $6.50/bu for August to October delivery.\nAs the Mississippi River continues to slide lower, the basis for corn and soybeans\n                              has turned weaker this month.\u00a0 At some locations along the Mississippi River, the\n                              corn basis has weakened about 30 cents this month and soybeans 43 cents.\u00a0 Current\n                              forecasts have the Mississippi River at Memphis dropping to its \u201clow threshold\u201d of\n                              -5 feet by September 6th.\u00a0 The weather outlook has Midsouth harvest advancing well into next week without\n                              interruption. \u00a0Barge freight rates are increasing.\u00a0 And, if the Mississippi River\n                              continues to head lower, expect additional weakness in corn and soybean basis over\n                              the upcoming month.\nFuel Market:\nThe chart below provides a look at nearby diesel futures over the past year.\u00a0 This\n                              week\u2019s trading has been in the $2.23 to $2.33 range.\u00a0 The $2.23 trade is the lowest\n                              point diesel has traded since late May 2023. \u00a0The energy markets tend to be volatile\n                              and can turn sharply higher on unforeseen geopolitical events.\u00a0 Plus, with harvest\n                              ramping up in the U.S. there will be increased demand for diesel over the next few\n                              months.\nFig. 4.\u00a0 Diesel nearby futures.\n\n\u00a0\nDD50 Rice Management Program is Live\nThe

give it away, give it away now.\u201d\n\nPicking up Speed\nMore combines rolling each day now and gaining steam, with lines beginning to form\n                              at mills and dryers.\u00a0 As of Monday we were listed at 2% harvested which will increase\n                              with progress this week but not dramatically.\u00a0 By the end of next week we should have\n                              reached a noticeable jump.\nThe overall crop continues to look good and that is reflected in the 78% good-excellent\n                              crop rating right now.\u00a0 Moistures are dropping fast around the state, so most should\n                              be in the saddle next week and things will really get wild.\nLimited yield reports so far continue to be positive.\u00a0 Nobody is talking any kind\n                              of record yields, but most are pleased with their field yields.\u00a0 Through the coming\n                              week we should hear more confirmed yields to see how things are holding across a larger\n                              portion of the state.\u00a0 Milling yields still have room for improvement, but given the\n                              delay between harvest and getting milling results back, we have even less of a picture\n                              on where that\u2019s headed going forward.\nOn the rice stink bug front with Nick Bateman \u2013 stink bugs are still building in green\n                              rice.\u00a0 No major blowout numbers but they\u2019re higher than last week.\u00a0 Would expect to\n                              see some high numbers next week.\nWith dry and warm conditions for the extended forecast, including in the 8-14 day\n                              outlook, we have the makings of a good early harvest run through the remainder of\n                              August.\u00a0 Efficiency will be the name of the game \u2013 as grain moistures begin to fall\n                              out more rapidly, grain will begin to get more susceptible to overdrying and the dreaded\n                              re-wetting of dry grain from rains that may pop up later and can cause milling issues.\nLet us know if we can help.\nFig. 1.\u00a0 NOAA 7-day precipitation forecast.\n\nFireSMART App Available for Prescribed Burning\nJarrod Hardke\nWith harvest underway, some field burning of crop residue is already beginning under\n                              dry conditions.\u00a0 For those fields where burning rice residue may be an appropriate\n                              option, there is a new tool available.\nThe FireSMART mobile app (https://arkfiresmart.com/) was released to offer row crop producers and forest landowners a simple, easy way\n                              to check conditions and report prescribed burns.\nWith the new app, producers can select the area they plan to burn on a map and the\n                              application will generate real-time weather data, letting producers know if current\n                              conditions align with the state\u2019s Voluntary Smoke Management Guidelines.\u00a0 Under these guidelines, producers and landowners report prescribed burns to the Arkansas\n                              Department of Agriculture\u2019s Dispatch Center.\u00a0 The FireSMART app also streamlines this\n                              process, making the app a one-stop shop for reporting and information.\nNot only will burning under the best conditions lead to a better residue burn in the\n                              field, but it will also minimize potential impact on surrounding areas.\n\u00a0\nFSA Crop Acreage\nJarrod Hardke\nON Monday (8/12),

      "Connor N. Sible and Fred E. Below Crop Physiology Laboratory Department of Crop Sciences University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 2 2023 Biological Testing for Soybean Production Report We examined different biological products, application methods, and agronomic management systems with the goal of showing which products have the greatest chance of success. Research Approach Six different biological products were tested in two different management systems (standard or progressive) with two genetically diverse soybean varieties (GH3762E3 and AG38XF1). This approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation of product performance and can help to decide if, how, and where to use a specific biological product. How Biological Products were Evaluated From our previous experience evaluating biological products, we know that a given product may enhance early season growth and the potential yield, but often not the final yield when other in-season factors like nutrient deficiency or leaf disease are present. Thus, biological products were evaluated in both \u2018standard\u2019 and \u2018progressive\u2019 management systems (Table 1) Table 1. Agronomic management systems used in the evaluation of biological products for soybean at Champaign, IL in 2023.

The \u2018standard\u2019 system for soybean includes no upfront fertility with no subsequent in-season management, while the \u2018progressive\u2019 system has at-planting fertility of nitrogen and sulfur along with a fungicide and insecticide application at R3 for foliar protection (Table 1). Pre-plant fertility was provided as ammonium sulfate (21-0-0-24S) and foliar protection (fungicide with insecticide) as Miravis Top (13.7 oz per acre; Syngenta) with Endigo (4 oz per acre; Syngenta). All plots were seeded to achieve a final plant population of 140,000 plants per acre. Trial Design We also know that non-uniformity within fields causes field spatial variability that can mask the yield response to both agronomic management and to the biological product application. Thus, a pair-wise field design was used where every treated plot had an adjacent untreated control, and this allows for an unbiased comparison of biological products and their efficacy under different levels of agronomic management (Figure 1). Experimental plots were arranged in a split-split block design where the main plot was the biological product, the sub-plot was variety, and the sub-sub-plot was the management system. All treatments were replicated six times. Using this design, eight different biological products were evaluated (Table 2). Figure 1. Pair-wise design used to evaluate biological products under different levels of agronomic management and with two different hybrids. Each biological product was evaluated in a similar approach, with twelve main plots randomized across six replications.

Foliar applications were applied with Petrichor surfactant at 4 oz per acre for the BioPath and Super Nitro treatments while Li700 was supplied at 2.4 oz per acre for the Sanovita applications. All foliar applications were blended with water for total application volume of 15 gallons per acre. Trial Implementation Replicated blocks of the experimental plots were planted at Champaign, IL (40\u00b03'35\"N, 88\u00b014'13\"W) on 19 April using a precision plot planter (SeedPro 360, ALMACO). Preplant soil test levels are shown in Table 3. Plots were 36 feet in length and four rows in width, with rows 1 and 4 serving as border and rows 2 and 3 harvested for yield. For weed control, a pre-plant application of Boundary (34 oz per acre; Syngenta) was made on 17 April. In-season weed control in was applied 18 May as FirstRate (0.5 oz per acre; Corteva) and FlexstarGT (3.5 pt per acre; Syngenta) and on 7 June as Zidua (3.25 oz per acre; BASF), Liberty (36 oz per acre; BASF), FusiladeDX (8 oz per acre; Syngenta), and RoundUp Powermax 3 (30 oz per acre; Bayer Crop Science).

Presented values are the average of the six replications. Biological Product Applications The unique pairwise design allows for unbiased comparisons among biological products that are applied as a seed treatment, in-furrow, or foliar spray. Seed treatments were treated 19 April and in-furrow applications were mixed within an hour of application on date of planting. Early vegetative growth stage (V4) foliar applications were supplied on 3 June. The reproductive foliar (R1) applications of individual biologicals were supplied on 30 June and the R3 applications along with the foliar protection of the progressive management plots were applied on 30 July. Application Methods Seed treatments were blended with water for a total application of 6 oz per cwt using a Hege11 seed treater (Wintersteiger). Both in-furrow biological entries were blended with water for a total application volume of 12 gallons per acre and supplied using a planter-attached liquid application system (SureFire Ag Systems). Foliar applications were balanced with water for a total application volume of 15 gallons per acre and supplied using a pressurized CO2 backpack sprayer. Growing conditions The growing season started dry with below-average precipitation for April, resulting in well aerated soils and early planting for the county (Table 4). The months of May, June, and July all ended with below-normal precipitation (3.1, 1.9, and 1.5 inches below average, respectively), resulting in a moderate drought during the vegetative and early reproductive growth stages. However, the month of August received adequate rainfall during seed fill, resulting in extended plant health and a final trial average yield of 86 bushels per acre. 4 Table 4.

Data obtained from the Illinois State Water Survey. Data Collection, Analysis, and Interpretation At maturity, plots were harvested with a two-row plot combine and grain yield is reported as bushels per acre at 13% moisture (Tables 5 and 6). The experimental design was a split-split plot arrangement in six randomized complete blocks. Statistical analysis was performed using a linear mixed model approach with PROC MIXED in SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and means between treatments were separated using Fisher\u2019s protected LSD test at the 0.10 level of significance. Paired T-tests were conducted to evaluate an individual product\u2019s yield response to the respective untreated controls. Soybean Response to Management was limited in 2023 The response to agronomic management was minimal, with only a 0.6 bushel per acre response when averaged across the two varieties (Table 5). Multiple university studies and farmer testimonials highlight the value of early planted soybean (three to four weeks ahead of normal) to improve field average yields when compared to previous years and later plantings. In 2023, only 15% of Illinois soybean acres had been planted by 23 April (USDA-NASS), placing this study among early planted acres. As a result, the trial average yield of 86 bushels per acre was well above regional yield averages reported in previous years. In a dry year with little sulfate leaching and limited disease pressure, along with improved yield potential due to early planting, there was less need for management to maximize grain yields in 2023. Response to Biologicals was Variety and Management Dependent Yield responses to biologicals varied with both positive and negative responses observed between the treated plots and their respective paired controls. The GH3762E3 variety resulted in a positive yield response in seven of the twelve comparisons while the AG38XF1 only responded positively to applications in three of the twelve comparisons (Table 6). Two of the positive responses for AG38XF1 variety were with the in-furrow application of BioPath or the seed treatment application of PhosN to the standard management system, resulting in a 3.2 or 2.0 bushel response, respectively. Each of these products were placed in the root zone and contain Bacillus spp. bacteria that enhance soil nutrient availability, in particular phosphorus, which can be a limiting nutrient for high-yielding soybean during grain fill. The PhosN seed treatment also significantly improved the yield of the GH3762E3 variety under standard management by 5 bushels, providing a consistent response across varieties for low-input systems. Conversely, these applications resulted in negative responses for both varieties under progressive management where supplied nitrogen and sulfur fertility may have stimulated native microbial release of soil phosphorus, negating the effect of the biologicals. Foliar supplied biologicals were most responsive when applied to the GH3762E3 variety with progressive management, where the Super Nitro, BioPath, and Herbagreen products numerically improved yields by 3.2, 3.7, and 3.0 bushels, respectively. These applications were less responsive with the standard management for this variety with responses of 0.7, -1.0, or 2.3 bushels, respectively, and induced negative responses when supplied to the AG38XF1 variety in five of the six comparisons. Conclusions This study shows that early planted soybean can result in a high yield potential, and with an extended growing season the response to additional management factors of fertility, foliar protection, or biologicals was limited. The findings here highlight the impact that variety and management system can have on soybean response to other agronomic inputs like biologicals, and that the addition of a given product type and/or application method must take into consideration other agronomic practices being utilized on the farm. 5 Table 5.

      "2024 Field Corn Variety Demonstration Plot Yields at the Jay Research Facility Jennifer Bearden, Hardeep Singh, Guilherme Trimer Morata, Murilo Trimer Morata This report summarizes the 2024 field corn large plot demonstration trial at West Florida Research and Education Center, Jay, Florida and an on-farm large plot demonstration in Jay, Florida. It shows the yields of 18 varieties in the nonreplicated demonstration trial. 2024 Growing Conditions and Demonstration Design On 17 April 2024, field corn varieties were planted at 2 seed/ft. (approximately 30,000 seed/A) under conventional tillage. The demonstration plots were planted over an area of Red Bay sandy loam and Orangeburg sandy loam soils that was planted in cotton in the summer of 2023. Prior to planting, any vegetation present was killed with an application of Glyphosate at 1 qt/A. Dual Magmum (1.3pt/A) was applied on 18 April 2024. On 24 April, the plots were irrigated (1 in). Glyphosate (1 qt/A) was applied on 15 May 2024. The fungicide, Miravis (4 oz/A), was applied on 30 May. On 14 June, the plots received another 1 in irrigation. The nonreplicated plots were 4 rows spaced 36 in. apart (12 ft wide) by 340 ft long. The plots were fertilized in 3 split applications. On 19 April, the plots received 134lbs of Phosphorus, 200lbs of Potassium, 39lbs of Sulfur (in accordance to the soil sample results). On 8 May, the plots received 56lbs of Nitrogen. On 17 May, the plots received 224lbs of nitrogen. Yield data was collected from the middle 2 rows of each demonstration plot; plots were harvested on 26 August 2024. Rainfall in Jay, FL for April and May were close to average while June was above average and July and August were below average. Table 1. Weather conditions during the 2024 field corn demonstration.

However, the role of plant resistance has largely been ignored. Here, we determine whether host plant resistance mediates decreased pest populations in organic systems and identify potential underpinning mechanisms. We demonstrate that fewer numbers of leafhoppers (Circulifer tenellus) settle on tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) grown using organic management as compared to conventional. We present multiple lines of evidence, including rhizosphere soil microbiome sequencing, chemical analysis and transgenic approaches, to demonstrate that changes in leafhopper settling between organically and conventionally grown tomatoes are dependent on salicylic acid accumulation in plants and mediated by rhizosphere microbial communities. These results suggest that organically managed soils and microbial communities may play an unappreciated role in reducing plant attractiveness to pests by increasing plant resistance.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\n\n        Access Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\n      \n\n        Get Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n      \n\n$29.99 /\u00a030\u00a0days\n\ncancel any time\nSubscribe to this journal\n\n        Receive 12 digital issues and online access to articles\n      \n$119.00 per year\nonly $9.92 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nTowards an agroecological approach to crop health: reducing pest incidence through synergies between plant diversity and soil microbial ecology\n                                        \n\n\nSoil microbiome manipulation triggers direct and possible indirect suppression against Ralstonia solanacearum and Fusarium oxysporum\n\n\n\nPredatory protists reduce bacteria wilt disease incidence in tomato plants\n                                        \n\nData availability\nAll data that support these findings are available from C.L.C., A.G. and R.L.V. upon request.

This article delves into the intricacies of supply and demand dynamics, climate-related challenges and trade patterns, offering a comprehensive exploration of the key factors shaping the global grain market.\nThe global grain outlook for 2024 is expected to be characterized by both opportunities and challenges. As the world population continues to grow, reaching an estimated 8.5 billion by 2030, the demand for grains, particularly staple crops like wheat, rice, soybeans and corn, is projected to increase significantly.\nBy 2050, there is a forecast of a 70% increase in global demand for food and a doubling in demand for energy and all this growth will come from grain production on agricultural land which, therefore, must be intensified.\nThe dynamics of demand for grains are constantly changing on the global stage, driven by a complex intersection of factors that shape both consumption and trade in these agricultural commodities. Some of the influences are:\nThe growing demand for biofuels, especially corn ethanol, which has boosted the production and consumption of grains such as corn, soybeans, and sugar cane.\nThe recovery of Chinese demand for soybeans, after the health crisis that affected its pig herd in 2019 and 2020. China is the world\u2019s largest importer of soybeans and has increased its purchases from Brazil, the world\u2019s largest producer of the oilseed. We should expect a potential reduction in demand attributed to China, the country responsible for importing close to 90% of Brazil\u2019s soybean production.\nThe scenarios for grain prices in the next fiscal year are under the influence of a series of factors, whose impacts can vary between positive and negative on the prices of agricultural commodities. Among these determinants, it is essential to consider:\nThe dynamics of global supply and demand are intricately linked to production, consumption and stock conditions in the main grain-producing and importing countries. The supply, subject to variables such as climatic, sanitary, and logistical factors, among others, has the capacity to be reduced or expanded in the market. Demand, in turn, is sensitive to economic, political, and social factors, among others, and can stimulate or discourage grain consumption in different segments. The interrelationship between supply and demand, crucial in determining market balance or imbalance, has a direct influence on grain prices.\nIn addition to the above, we will have a year of 2024 with challenges, but none of them will be new to players in the commodities market. Climate issues, oil prices, global demand and China\u2019s positioning are enough to affect and reflect on prices worldwide.\nFor today we have: Argentina with the promise of a better harvest, the US recovering corn production but with a decline in soybeans, and Brazil with its opposite positions, less corn, and more soybeans for 2024., China with a slight decline in demand for food, which could translate into falling prices and reduced margins.\nARGENTINA\nClimate issues that hurt Argentina\u2019s last harvest seem to have changed direction, giving abundant rainfall over farming heartlands is likely to boost production of soybeans, corn, and wheat in one of the world\u2019s largest grain exporting nations.\nAccording to Argentina\u2019s Rosario Grains Exchange (BCR), 95% of early planted corn and 75% of soybeans are in \u201cexcellent to very good\u201d conditions, thanks to rains since the end of October across the country\u2019s Pampas region.\nBRAZIL\nAccording to the twelfth Conab field research, it was observed and confirmed the record production already predicted in previous research, and indicate production at 322.8 million tons, corresponding to a growth of 18.4% or 50.1 million tons about the previous season.\nThis result is 0.8% higher than the forecast in the previous survey, released in August, mainly due to the advance in the second corn harvest, which has been presenting higher productivity than initially foreseen, combined with the better performance of wheat and sorghum crops.\nThe planted area, estimated at 78.5 million hectares, is 5.3% or 3.9 million hectares higher than that sown in 2021/22. The largest increases are observed in soybeans, with an increase of 2.58 million hectares or 6.2%; in corn, with an increase of 686.8 thousand hectares or 3.2%; and in wheat, with an increase of 364.3 thousand hectares or 11.8%.\nSoya\nThe 2022/23 harvest in Brazil reached 154,617.4 thousand tons, 1.5% higher than the first harvest estimate made by Conab, in October 2022, and 10.9% higher than the production record achieved in the 2020/21 harvest. These results occurred due to the excellent weather conditions in most of the producing regions, except for Rio Grande do Sul, and the high technology used by producers.\nThe productivity achieved reflected the favorable conditions occurring in the main producing regions. Rio Grande do Sul had a negative highlight in this harvest because of La Ni\u00f1a, which despite being moderate in intensity, caused a drop in productivity in most states. However, the record productivity recorded in several states, with emphasis on the Matopiba and Mato Grosso, compensated, with surplus, the losses recorded in the South.\nIn this harvest, Brazil sowed 44,075.6 thousand hectares, 6.2% higher than the previous harvest, with an average productivity of 3,508 kg/ha, recording historical records of planting area, productivity, and production.\nCorn\nThe climatic conditions were beneficial to the development of the culture in most producing regions in Brazil. Despite the drop in productivity, in relation to the initial estimates, which occurred in Rio Grande do Sul because of La Ni\u00f1a, well-distributed rainfall, combined with the investment of producers, provided similar or higher productivity compared to the last harvest in all states, even in Rio Grande do Sul.\nThe sown area of the first corn harvest was 4,444 thousand hectares, 2.3% lower than the last harvest, but with a production of 27,373.2 thousand tons, 9.4% higher than that obtained in the 2021/22 harvest, demonstrating the impact of the climate more favorable and productive efficiency in the sector.\nExport Numbers\n2023 was a busy year in Brazilian ports with record exports of commodities, mainly soybeans and corn. Comparing the same period from January to December, Brazil exported a total of 108.8 million tons of soybeans in 2023, compared to 87.5 million in 2022, while corn exported 42.6 million tons compared to 37.9 million in 2022.\nJapan\nOnce again Brazil surprises and takes part of the United States corn market, this time supplying Japan. Brazil\u2019s corn exports to Japan surpassed the United States in overall volume in 2022/23, with Japan importing 6.9 million tons of corn from Brazil. In contrast, U.S. exports to Japan dropped to just under 6.9 million tons, a nearly 2.9 million ton drop year over year. Over the past 4 years, Japan ranked as the fourth-largest corn importer in the world. In dollar terms, U.S. corn trade to Japan is worth around $2.4 billion on average, around 20 percent of the value of U.S. corn exports to the world each year.\nLOGISTICS\nAs mentioned in several of my speeches, we need to change focus and think outside the box, Brazil is huge and has a lot of unexplored area that can alleviate much of our logistics, not only in road and rail modes but also in the expansion of ports in the northern side of the country.\nRecently, an investment of around R$1.6 billion was announced in the port of Itaqui, in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, to increase the port\u2019s capacity by more than 8 million tons. This will benefit the MAPITO region and part of the Midwest. Another recently announced project is Porto Paratudal in C\u00e1ceres, Mato Grosso, scheduled for delivery in 2026, and will connect Mato Grosso to the Paraguay-Paran\u00e1 waterways and the La Plata Basin in Argentina. These two projects join many other projects in different stages of maturity, both in Arco Sul and Arco Norte, to meet export demand in the coming years.\nWe have frequently seen an exaggerated number of waiting time in southern ports, the port of Paranagua recorded up to 93 days in the last week of the year, and Santos with maximum of 37 days.\nPotential Decrease in 2024 Grain Harvest vs. 2023\nAccording to the second forecast of the Agricultural Production Survey, recently released by IBGE, the Brazilian harvest of grains, cereals and legumes is expected to total 306.2 million tons in 2024. This production represents declines of 0.7% in relation to the first estimate made in October, and 3.2% (or 10.1 million tons) compared to the 2023 harvest.\nSoya\nGrowth of 2.8% in the forecast area and production estimated at 160.2 million tons. Plans are underway, with the highest percentages observed in the Central-West states, with 98.7% completed in Mato Grosso, 96% in Paran\u00e1 and 95% in S\u00e3o Paulo.\nAs in 2022/23, Brazil is expected to maintain its productivity record for the 2023/24 harvest under conditions of tight margins. The recovery of the Argentine harvest, the reduction in productivity in the United States and the slight retraction in Chinese demand make up the scenario. Even so, we hope to maintain the levels of soybean exports to China, which represents 40% of Brazilian shipments. Soybean producers should expect challenging prices in the seesaw between the summer harvest, second harvest and the international scenario.\nCorn\nReduction of 5.3% in the total area to be cultivated (first, second and third harvests), estimated at 21.1 million hectares, with a forecast of 118.5 million tons.\nWheat\nThe current harvest for 2023 is currently underway with an estimated production volume of 8.1 million tonnes. This marks a 22.8% reduction from the previous harvest, a decrease attributed to adverse weather conditions and excessive rainfall experienced during the crop\u2019s developmental stages.\nKEY FACTORS INFLUENCING THE GRAIN MARKET\nClimate Changes:\u00a0Weather plays a crucial role in grain production. Factors such as rainfall, temperature, and drought can significantly impact crop yields.\nGovernment Policies:\u00a0The supply chain and prices of the grain market can be impacted by government laws such as trade policies, import/export rules, and safety guidelines.\nGlobal demand: The demand for grain products, including food, animal feed, and biofuels, is a critical factor in the grain industry. Fluctuations in demand can influence prices and trade patterns.\nMarket Competition:\u00a0As businesses compete for market share the level of competition in the grain market may have an impact on the cost and availability of grain products.\nEnergy Prices: The prices of oil and other energy sources can impact the demand for biofuels, which are often made from grains.\nEconomic Factors:\u00a0Economic factors, such as inflation, interest rates, and currency rates, can have an impact on the pricing as well as the general demand for grain-based products.\nRISK ASSESSMENT FOR THE GLOBAL GRAIN TRADE\nPrice volatility:\u00a0Uncertainty in grain production due to climate change can lead to tremendous price volatility.\nDisruptions in supply chains:\u00a0Extreme weather events can disrupt supply chains, making it difficult to transport grains from where they are grown to where they are needed.\nTrade barriers:\u00a0In response to these disruptions, some countries or groups of countries might impose trade barriers like export restrictions or quotas to safeguard their domestic food security.\nRelocation of production: As climate conditions shift, some regions may become less suitable for grain production while others become more favorable.\nIn conclusion, the global grain outlook for 2024 presents both opportunities and challenges. Meeting the increasing demand for grains will require significant efforts to boost production, improve agricultural practices, and adapt to climate change. Addressing resource scarcity, managing trade policies, and promoting sustainable farming methods will be crucial for ensuring food security and maintaining stable grain markets worldwide.\nWHO WE ARE\nSA Commodities excels in the commodities market, delivering tailored solutions globally.

US corn ending stocks for the 2024/2025 marketing year outperformed trade expectations by nearly 17 million bushels. Soybean ending stocks for the 2024/2025 marketing year is estimated at 470 million bushels, which is 65 million bushels less than expected. Wheat ending stocks (815 mil/bu) slightly exceeded trade expectations for the 2024/2025 marketing year.\nWorld ending stocks for the 2024/2025 marketing year for corn, soybean and wheat all slightly exceeded trade expectations with corn seeing the largest discrepancy of 2.65 MMT.\u00a0\nTable 1\u00a0shows some key report estimates along with trade analyst expectations.\u00a0\nTable\u00a01. November 2024 USDA WASDE vs Market Expectations\n\u00a0\nUS corn production estimates decreased by 60 million bushels in the 2024/2025 marketing year and yield per acre slightly decreased by 0.7 bushels per acre. Soybean production decreased by 121 million bushels for the 2024/2025 marketing year. Total wheat production estimates decreased by 11 million bushels from October to November for the 2024/2025 marketing year.\u00a0\nWorld corn, soybean, and wheat ending stocks increased slightly by 1.57, 0.05, and 0.07 MMT in the 2023/2024 marketing year. World corn ending stocks decreased by nearly 2 MMT in the 2024/2025 marketing year, while soybeans slightly increased by 0.07 MMT and wheat remained the same in the 2024/2025 marketing year.\u00a0\nThe USDA\u2019s Brazil and Argentina corn and soybean production estimates remain unchanged from October to November.\u00a0\nInitial Market Reaction\nThe immediate market reaction to the USDA reports saw corn, soybean, and wheat prices increase initially before soybean and wheat prices began to fall. Corn prices reached a peak of $4.35 after the WASDE was released. March corn futures prices increased to $4.47 and were last observed at $4.44. Soybeans prices immediately increased by 20 cents to $10.30 before dropping back to $10.11. Soybean futures contracts for January, March, and May followed a similar trend. Soybean meal prices decreased by 1 cent today and soybean oil decreased by less than 1 cent. Wheat prices increased by 2 cents after the WASDE was released, before decreasing 3 cents.\u00a0\nChanges to Domestic Balance Sheets\nFor corn, production, imports, ending stocks, total supply, total domestic, and total use all remain unchanged for the 2023/2024 marketing year. \u00a0For the 2024/2025 marketing year, area planted and harvested stayed constant, while yields per acre decreased by 0.7 bushels per acre. Beginning stocks stayed constant, but ending stocks decreased by 61 million bushels respectively. Production and total supply decreased by 60 and 61 million bushels respectively. Expected average farm prices remain unchanged for 2023/2024 and 2024/2025 at $4.55 and $4.10 respectively.\nTable\u00a02. November 2024 WASDE Corn Balance Sheet\n\n\u00a0\nFor soybeans, there were no changes in the 2023/24 balance sheet. For the 2024/25 marketing year, area planted and harvested remain unchanged, but yields per harvested acre decreased by 1.4 bushels per acre to 51.7 bushels per acre. Production and total supply decreased by 121 million bushels. Total domestic, exports, and total use each decreased by 16, 25, and 41 million bushels respectively. Ending stocks decreased by 80 million bushels, while average farm price remained constant from October to November.\u00a0\nTable\u00a03. November 2024 WASDE Soybean Balance Sheet\n\n\u00a0\nCorn and Soybean Yield Estimates\nIn aggregate the US corn yield forecast decreased from 183.8 bushels per acre to 183.1 bushels per acre. Changes to state yield estimates were mixed, especially across the corn belt. Iowa has an estimated 213 bushels per acre which is a 0.5% decrease from October (Figure 1). Indiana (209 bu/ac) and North Dakota (149 bu/ac) experienced the highest positive percentage in corn yield with each seeing an increase of 3.5% (Figure 1).\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. November 2024 US Corn Yield\nSoybean yield estimates decreased by -2.6% nationally, with Iowa seeing a 4.7% increase to 61 bushels per acre. Indiana, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and George were the only states to have soybean yields increase from October to November with Pennsylvania having the largest increase of 4.9% (Figure 2). Many states experienced a decrease in soybean yield, but Oklahoma, Alabama, Missouri, and Wisconsin saw much larger percent changes.\u00a0\n\nFigure 2.

      "Breaking Down 5 Projections in the USDA 2024 Corn Outlook\nFebruary 16, 2024\nBreaking Down 5 Projections in the USDA 2024 Corn Outlook\nFeb 16, 2024\nKey Issues:Production\nAuthor: Krista Swanson\nUSDA released the Grains and Oilseeds Outlook this week providing an initial look at the 2024/25 marketing year projections that include lower production, greater domestic use, increased exports, and higher ending stocks as compared to the current 2023/24 market years. The following is a summary and some additional context for five projections from the latest outlook.\n\u00a0\nYield\nCorn yield is projected at 181 bushels per acre. Yield projections depend on the modeling approach and time series used. While a 3.7 bushel per acre increase over the 2023 record 177.3 bushels per acre may seem like a stretch, a regression on annual yields from 2023 to several different historical points including 1934, 1980, and 1996 all predict 2024 yields within about one bushel of the USDA projection.\n\u00a0\nTrendline yields are a reasonable expectation at this point. Adverse weather is generally thought to have a negative impact on yields but in 2023 a record yield was achieved in a year with widespread drought in the growing season. That may influence in-season expectations for the impact of adverse weather on yields going forward. \u00a0On the other hand, optimal environmental conditions in the growing season could support above-trend yields. It\u2019s been more than a decade since there has been significant deviation in U.S. corn yield from the trendline \u2013 either above or below.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAcres\nUSDA left the expected corn planted area at 91.0M acres and harvested area at 83.1M acres, both unchanged from long-term projections released in November. The projection for 2024 corn acres is 3.6M acres less than farmers planted in 2023, but 2.4M acres greater than 2022 planted acres.\n\u00a0\nThe USDA projection doesn\u2019t always align with what farmers do. We saw that last year, when farmers planted 94.6M acres of corn, well above USDA\u2019s February 2023 projection of 91M acres for the year. Aside from market signals, farmers weigh factors like agronomic advantages of rotation, farm yield of specific crops relative to the average, timing of seeding and harvest, and general management practices when they decide what to plant.\n\u00a0\nProduction\nCorn production is projected at 15,040 million bushels. This would be the third highest production, behind 2016, and the new record 15,341 million bushels set in 2023. Here are two examples to show what it would take to break that record, one keeping the harvested acres projection and one keeping the yield projection.\n\u00a0\nWith 83.1 million harvested acres, a 184.6 bushel per acre yield would be needed to break the 2023 production record. With a 181 bushel per acre yield, 84.8 million harvested acres are needed, corresponding to about 91.1 million planted acres. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nDemand\nTotal U.S. corn use is forecast higher in 2024/25 due to growth in all three of the leading use categories:\u00a0feed, ethanol, and exports.\nAlthough the cattle inventory is at the lowest level since 1951 and likely to decline further in 2024 putting a damper on beef production in 2024, increased production is expected for the hog sector and broiler meat production is forecast at a record level. Positive movement in production in some livestock segments, larger corn supply, and lower corn prices push feed demand to increase about 1%\u00a0to 5.75 billion bushels.\n\u00a0\nEthanol is forecast to use 5.4 billion bushels of corn, with expectations of modestly higher motor gasoline consumption and continued strength in ethanol exports. The expectation for modest global trade growth pushes corn exports 50 million bushels higher to 2.15 billion bushels.\n\u00a0\nPrice\nThe forecast market year average price for 2024/25 is $4.40, forty cents lower than the $4.80 market year average price expected for 2023/24 and more than $2 lower than the $6.54 price for 2022/23.\n\u00a0\nUsing the USDA cost of production forecast for corn and the 181 bushel per acre yield projection, the average cost of production is $4.80 per bushel for the 2024 crop. Lower yields would mean an even higher per-unit cost of production.\n\u00a0\nThe average cost of production for corn drops just 6.2%\u00a0from 2022 to the 2024 forecast, while the market year average price for corn drops 32%. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nSummary\nThe latest USDA projections for corn include a record yield and the third-highest production, despite a forecast drop in acres. The forecast for rising domestic and export demand is positive but growing production results in plentiful supply and lower prices. Cost of production isn\u2019t a factor in market price, but it\u2019s certainly important to U.S. corn farmers. The fall in corn price has been five times greater than the slight relief in cost of production. The USDA March Prospective Plantings Report will be out in six weeks providing greater insight into what farmers intend to plant that could change the outlook.\nNewsletter Signup\n",

Rotation corn, rotation soybean, and wheat yields for average soils are based on the long-run trends in state average yields reported by the Indiana office of the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Continuous corn yields are 94% of rotation corn yields. Double-crop soybean yields are 70% of full-season soybean yields. Continuous corn yields assume a chisel plow tillage system. Double-crop soybean yields apply to central and southern Indiana. 3Harvest corn price is December 2024 CME Group futures price less $0.25 basis. Harvest soybean price is November 2024 CME Group futures price less $0.35 basis. Harvest wheat price is July 2024 CME Group futures price less $.35 basis. Harvest prices were based on opening prices on March 22, 2024. These prices will change. 1Estimated yields and costs are for yields with average management for three different soils representing low, average, and high productivity. The high productivity soils represent soils capable of producing corn and soybeans with yields about 20% higher than average soils. Low productivity soils represent soils capable of producing corn and soybeans with yields about 20% lower than the average soils. Both product prices and input prices may have significantly changed since these estimates were prepared.\nTable 1. Estimated per Acre Crop Budgets for Low, Average, and High Productivity Indiana Soils Crop Budgets for Three Yield Levels1 Low Productivity Soil Average Productivity Soil High Productivity Soil Contribution margin13 (Revenue - variable costs) per acre 2024\u00a0Purdue\u00a0Crop\u00a0Cost\u00a0&\u00a0Return Guide March\u00a02024\u00a0Estimates Table 1 (Continued) 13Contribution margin is the return to labor and management, machinery ownership, land resources, and risk.\n12Includes crop insurance, general farm insurance, and miscellaneous cost. The cost of crop insurance represents the premium projected for a Revenue Protection (RP) policy at the 80% coverage level. Crop insurance is included in budgets for corn and full-season soybeans, but is not included for wheat and double-crop soybeans.\n11Interest is based on 9.0% annual rate for 9 months for seed, fertilizer, and chemicals, and for 6 months for half the machinery fuel and repairs, and all miscellaneous expenses.\n8Fuel used to dry crop to a safe moisture level for storage. For double-crop soybeans, the drying charge represents the drying of wheat in order to allow an earlier planting of soybeans.\n9Repairs are based on approximately 5-year-old machinery. For older machinery, per acre repairs and downtime cost will be higher.\n7Includes insecticides and herbicides. For corn, rootworm insecticide is applied to the refuge acres. In some areas of Indiana, this may not be required. Cost projections include the application of fungicide to corn every other year. Fungicide applications are assumed to cost $28 to $32 per acre for material and application. Pesticide costs can vary widely based on herbicides selected, required rate of application, and product pricing. 10Hauling charge represents moving grain from field to storage.\n6Corn seed prices assume a biotech variety with multiple traits. A 20%-refuge is planted with varieties that do not contain insect resistant traits, but do include herbicide tolerance. Seeding rates for corn are 27,000 seeds per acre on low productivity soils and 33,000 seeds per acre on average and high productivity soils. Soybean seed prices include Round-Up Ready\u00ae varieties. Rotation soybeans are drilled with a seeding rate of 169,000 seeds per acre with a 90% germination rate. Double-crop soybeans are drilled with a seeding rate of 195,000 seeds per acre. The seeding rate for wheat is two bushels per acre.\n5Phosphate, potash, and lime applications are based on Tri-State Fertilizer Recommendations (Source: Purdue Extension Bulletin, AY-9-32, July 1995). Lime amounts represent the pounds of standard ag lime needed to neutralize the acidity from the nitrogen supplied from sources other than ammonium sulfate. Nitrogen application rate for corn is based on research from the Department of Agronomy, Purdue University. Anhydrous ammonia is used as the nitrogen source for corn. Urea is used as the nitrogen source for wheat. Pounds of N, P205, K20, and lime by crop and soil were as follows: continuous corn, 240-47-55-720, 240-59-63-720, 240-71-72-720; rotation corn, 200-50-57-600, 200-63-66-600, 200-75-75-600; rotation beans, 0-34-79-0, 0-42-93-0, 0-50-107-0; wheat, 58-38-42-172, 84-47-48-251, 110-57-53-330; double crop beans, 0-23-61-0, 0-29-70-0, 0-34-80-0. Fertilizer prices per lb.: NH 3 @ $0.49; urea @ $0.58; P205 @ $0.72; K20 @ $0.44; lime @ $30/ton spread on the field. For very poorly drained soils, consider increasing N rates by 5-10%. For well-drained soils, consider reducing N rates by 5-10%. All soil tests for phosphorus and potassium are assumed to be in the maintenance range, and the pH is in the recommended range. ID-166-W Purdue Extension 4Input prices for variable costs reflect expected prices for 2024. These prices will vary by location and time of the year. Users need to adjust these prices to reflect their own expectations and price situation.\n2024 Purdue Crop Cost & Return Guide March 2024 Estimates Farm Acres 900 1000 2700 3000 900 1000 2700 3000 900 1000 2700 3000 Rotation1 c-c c-b c-c c-b c-c c-b c-c c-b c-c c-b c-c c-b Crop contribution margin2 $73 $199 $73 $199 $145 $281 $145 $281 $247 $382 $247 $382 Government payment3 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 Total contribution margin $73 $199 $73 $199 $145 $281 $145 $281 $247 $382 $247 $382 Annual overhead costs: Machinery ownership4 $147 $139 $98 $92 $147 $139 $98 $92 $147 $139 $98 $92 Family and hired labor5 $71 $64 $44 $40 $71 $64 $44 $40 $71 $64 $44 $40 Land6 $207 $207 $207 $207 $253 $253 $253 $253 $305 $305 $305 $305 Earnings or (losses) -$352 -$210 -$277 -$140 -$326 -$174 -$251 -$104 -$276 -$125 -$201 -$55 Average Productivity Soil High Productivity Soil It is the policy of the Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service that all persons have equal opportunity and access to its educational programs, services, activities, and facilities without regard to race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin or ancestry, marital status, parental status, sexual orientation, disability or status as a veteran.

Cash rents are expected to remain stable through 2024. 1Rotations are as follows: c-c = all of the farm acres in continuous corn; c-b = one-half of the farm acres in rotation corn and one-half in rotation soybeans. 2Crop's contribution margin is the per acre contribution margin from Table 1.\n3It is assumed that the current farm bill will not provide ARC-CO or PLC payments for base acres in 2024.\n4The same basic machinery set, which is timely for each rotation, is used for both the c-c and c-b rotation. The larger farm size requires larger, more expensive machinery. Corn production utilizes a chisel plow tillage system, and soybeans utilize no-till. Average annual replacement costs for the larger farm size were calculated using the Purdue Machinery Cost Calculator for a timely machinery set. Seven-year trading policy is assumed for combine and planter, 10-year policy for other field machinery. On livestock farms where fewer hours each day are available for crops, or on small farms, machinery costs and/or labor costs will be higher. On well-drained soils where more days are suitable for spring field work, machinery costs could be lower. A 10-year trading policy was assumed for all machinery on the smaller acreages. Machinery ownership costs are likely to vary widely from farm to farm.\n5For the larger acreages, operator labor expense incoroporates information pertaining to total family living, net nonfarm income, and income and self-employment taxes obtained from FINBIN, Center for Farm Financial Management, University of Minnesota. The larger acreages also included hired labor. FINBIN data was used to compute hourly hired labor wages. For the smaller acreages, labor expense includes the same family living withdrawal and no hired labor. Labor costs are likely to vary widely from farm to farm.\nTable 2.

      "ADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nHarvest season progresses rapidly across Midwest\nAn extremely warm and dry fall has allowed harvest to progress quickly across the northern Plains.\nThe very warm and dry weather in the upper Midwest during September this year has pushed the 2024 corn and soybean crop very rapidly toward maturity. September 2024 was the sixth warmest on record at the University of Minnesota Southern Research and Outreach Center at Waseca, only trailing the warmest September on record in 1931 by 1.6 degrees. By early October, soybean harvest was 50% or more completed in western portions of region, while some areas further east still needed a bit more time for soybeans to fully mature. Many corn hybrids had also reached physiological maturity by late September and were also ready to be harvested, with some corn already at desirable moisture levels for harvest.\nAs of Oct. 2, a total of 2,722 growing degree units had been accumulated since May 1 at the U of M Research Center at Waseca, which is comparable to many areas of southern Minnesota and northern Iowa.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs of Oct. 7, the Waseca location has not yet had the first freezing temperatures of the year, so GDU accumulation for the year continues. The 2024 GDU accumulation at Waseca was similar to the 2022 GDU accumulation in early October and exceeded the normal GDU accumulation by 9%; however, it was 133 GDU\u2019s below the GDU accumulation at this point in 2023. The extra growing degree units, combined with warm weather in September, helped this year\u2019s corn and soybean crop reach maturity, as well as to dry down rapidly in the field.\nIn addition to September being extremely warm for most of the month in 2024, it was also one of the driest September\u2019s on record in many areas of the upper Midwest. The overall Minnesota statewide average precipitation in September was a record-low amount of only .55 inches, with many locations in the southern and western portions of the state reporting less than .25 inches of total precipitation during the month. \nSeptember rainfall at the Waseca Research Center totaled only .48 inches, which was the second driest on record. The U.S. Drought Monitor released on Oct. 3 shows a large majority of the upper Midwest as \u201cabnormally dry or in \u201cmoderate drought,\u201d as compared to late August when only a small portion of the region was shown on the weekly drought monitor. Minnesota is now listed as 94% \u201cabnormally dry\u201d and 43% in \u201cmoderate drought,\u201d including a large portion of southwest and south central Minnesota in the higher drought category.\nSoybean harvest has been underway for the past 2-3 weeks in many locations across upper Midwest. Most soybeans have now reached maturity, except for soybeans that were planted very late due to wet field conditions or that were replanted following heavy rains and hail damage in June. As expected, soybean yields have been highly variable across the upper Midwest due to impacts from heavy rainfall amounts in June and the amount of crop loss in some locations, as well as yield reductions from the very warm and dry conditions late in the growing season. \nIn areas such as the southern half of Minnesota and portions of northern Iowa and eastern South Dakota that were impacted by the heavy rainfall and drown-out damage in June, many soybean yields have been 20-40% below the crop insurance APH (average) yields. Generally, the soybean yields have been average or slightly above and much more consistent in areas that were fortunate enough to receive more appropriate and timely rainfall during the growing season, including much of Iowa, Illinois and Indiana.\nMost of the corn in the upper Midwest has reached physiological maturity, which is the \u201cblack layer\u201d stage, or is very close to reaching maturity. Corn is usually at 30-32% moisture when it reaches the \u201cback layer\u201d stage, and then begins to dry down naturally in the field. Ideally, growers like to see corn dried down in the field to at least 20-22% moisture, or lower, before they harvest the corn. This greatly saves on corn drying costs and improves the quality of the corn being harvested and going into storage. Corn is usually dried down to a final moisture content of 15-16% moisture for safe storage on the farm until the following summer. The moisture content on much of the corn being harvested in many areas has now dropped to 20% or lower.\nIf favorable drying weather continues in the coming weeks, it is likely that corn drying costs in many areas will be greatly reduced in 2024, which is certainly beneficial in a year such as this.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt is a bit early to project 2024 corn yields across the Midwest; however, early indications are that corn yields in many areas will be just as variable as the soybean yields. In portions of the upper Midwest, such as the eastern and southern Corn Belt, that had timely and adequate rainfall during the growing season, 2024 corn yields may end up average or slightly above average. However, in those areas that were severely impacted by the excessive rainfall in June, especially in southern Minnesota and potions of northern Iowa, corn yields will likely be greatly reduced. Similar to soybeans, many \u201cwhole field\u201d final corn yields in the hardest hit areas could end up 20-40% below the 10-year average APH (average) crop insurance yields. In southern Minnesota many of those APH yields are 200 bushels per acre or more, meaning that many final \u201cwhole field\u201d corn yields in 2024 could end up at 120-160 bushels per acre, which would be some of the lowest corn yields in the past two to three decades.\nUSDA Grain Stocks report summary\nThe Sept. 30 USDA Grain Stocks Report surprised most grain marketing analysts and was viewed as somewhat \u201cbullish\u201d for future corn markets and considered basically neutral for soybean markets. Grain stock estimates for corn were about 5% lower than pre-report estimates by grain traders, while soybean stocks were fairly close to the anticipated grain-trade projections. Following the release of the USDA report, December corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade showed some strength. November soybean futures showed very little movement in either direction.\nThe biggest surprise in the Sept. 30 report was the estimated total U.S. corn stocks at 1.76 billion bushels, up by 400 million bushels from this time last year but 84 million bushels lower than the pre-report estimates. USDA estimated that just over 780 million bushels of corn was stored on farms as of Sept. 1, which is up by 172 million bushels or 29% from a year ago. Even though there was an initial positive market reaction to the grain stocks data, it may be short-lived due to the much higher total stocks level in 2024 compared to recent years.\nThe latest report implies total corn usage for feed, ethanol, exports, etc., from July 1 to Sept. 30 this year at 3.24 billion bushels, which is up 50 million bushels or 18% from a year ago. In addition, USDA adjusted the final 2023 U.S. corn production totals downward by 1 million bushels from previous estimates, based on adjustments in the final 2023 U.S. corn acreage and average yield. The CBOT December corn futures closing price on Sept. 30, 2024, was $4.32 per bushel, compared to similar CBOT corn prices on Sept. 30 of $4.76 in 2023, $6.17 in 2022, $5.37 in 2021, $3.79 in 2020, $3.88 in 2019, and $3.56 in 2018.\nThe USDA soybean stocks estimate of 342 million bushels as of Sept. 1, which was about 30% above the U.S. soybean inventory of just over 264 million bushels a year ago on Sept. 1. The soybean stocks estimate on Sept. 1, 2024, was at the highest level at this point of the year in recent years. It was estimated that 111 million bushels of soybeans were stored on farms as of Sept. 1, which represented approximately 33% of the total stocks. \n\nThe \u201con-farm\u201d soybean inventory is 55% higher than a year ago at this time, which probably explains why soybean basis levels in late summer and early fall at many grain elevators and processing plants in the upper Midwest have been at wider levels than in recent years.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe market reaction to the higher soybean stocks in the latest USDA report has been somewhat tempered by the projected soybean usage of 628 million bushels for processing, exports, etc. from July 1 to Sept. 30 in 2024. This represents an 18% increase compared to the soybean usage of 528 million bushels during the same period in 2023; however, the 2024 estimated soybean use level is still well below the usage level of 858 million bushels during that same period as recently as 2020. \n\nThe CBOT November soybean futures price closed at $10.37 per bushel on Sept. 30, compared to late September soybean prices of $12.75 per bushel in 2023, $13.66 in 2022, $12.56 in 2021, $10.23 in 2020, $9.06 in 2019, and $8.45 in 2018.\nKent Thiesse is a Farm Management Analyst and writes the weekly \"Focus on Ag\" column.

Rotation corn, rotation soybean, and wheat yields for average soils are based on the long-run trends in state average yields reported by the Indiana office of the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Continuous corn yields are 94% of rotation corn yields. Double-crop soybean yields are 70% of full-season soybean yields. Continuous corn yields assume a chisel plow tillage system. Double-crop soybean yields apply to central and southern Indiana. 3Harvest corn price is December 2024 CME Group futures price less $0.25 basis. Harvest soybean price is November 2024 CME Group futures price less $0.35 basis. Harvest wheat price is July 2024 CME Group futures price less $.35 basis. Harvest prices were based on opening prices on March 22, 2024. These prices will change. 1Estimated yields and costs are for yields with average management for three different soils representing low, average, and high productivity. The high productivity soils represent soils capable of producing corn and soybeans with yields about 20% higher than average soils. Low productivity soils represent soils capable of producing corn and soybeans with yields about 20% lower than the average soils. Both product prices and input prices may have significantly changed since these estimates were prepared.\nTable 1.

The cost of crop insurance represents the premium projected for a Revenue Protection (RP) policy at the 80% coverage level. Crop insurance is included in budgets for corn and full-season soybeans, but is not included for wheat and double-crop soybeans.\n11Interest is based on 9.0% annual rate for 9 months for seed, fertilizer, and chemicals, and for 6 months for half the machinery fuel and repairs, and all miscellaneous expenses.\n8Fuel used to dry crop to a safe moisture level for storage. For double-crop soybeans, the drying charge represents the drying of wheat in order to allow an earlier planting of soybeans.\n9Repairs are based on approximately 5-year-old machinery. For older machinery, per acre repairs and downtime cost will be higher.\n7Includes insecticides and herbicides. For corn, rootworm insecticide is applied to the refuge acres. In some areas of Indiana, this may not be required. Cost projections include the application of fungicide to corn every other year. Fungicide applications are assumed to cost $28 to $32 per acre for material and application. Pesticide costs can vary widely based on herbicides selected, required rate of application, and product pricing. 10Hauling charge represents moving grain from field to storage.\n6Corn seed prices assume a biotech variety with multiple traits. A 20%-refuge is planted with varieties that do not contain insect resistant traits, but do include herbicide tolerance. Seeding rates for corn are 27,000 seeds per acre on low productivity soils and 33,000 seeds per acre on average and high productivity soils. Soybean seed prices include Round-Up Ready\u00ae varieties. Rotation soybeans are drilled with a seeding rate of 169,000 seeds per acre with a 90% germination rate. Double-crop soybeans are drilled with a seeding rate of 195,000 seeds per acre. The seeding rate for wheat is two bushels per acre.\n5Phosphate, potash, and lime applications are based on Tri-State Fertilizer Recommendations (Source: Purdue Extension Bulletin, AY-9-32, July 1995). Lime amounts represent the pounds of standard ag lime needed to neutralize the acidity from the nitrogen supplied from sources other than ammonium sulfate. Nitrogen application rate for corn is based on research from the Department of Agronomy, Purdue University. Anhydrous ammonia is used as the nitrogen source for corn. Urea is used as the nitrogen source for wheat. Pounds of N, P205, K20, and lime by crop and soil were as follows: continuous corn, 240-47-55-720, 240-59-63-720, 240-71-72-720; rotation corn, 200-50-57-600, 200-63-66-600, 200-75-75-600; rotation beans, 0-34-79-0, 0-42-93-0, 0-50-107-0; wheat, 58-38-42-172, 84-47-48-251, 110-57-53-330; double crop beans, 0-23-61-0, 0-29-70-0, 0-34-80-0. Fertilizer prices per lb.: NH 3 @ $0.49; urea @ $0.58; P205 @ $0.72; K20 @ $0.44; lime @ $30/ton spread on the field. For very poorly drained soils, consider increasing N rates by 5-10%. For well-drained soils, consider reducing N rates by 5-10%. All soil tests for phosphorus and potassium are assumed to be in the maintenance range, and the pH is in the recommended range.

Cash rents are expected to remain stable through 2024. 1Rotations are as follows: c-c = all of the farm acres in continuous corn; c-b = one-half of the farm acres in rotation corn and one-half in rotation soybeans. 2Crop's contribution margin is the per acre contribution margin from Table 1.\n3It is assumed that the current farm bill will not provide ARC-CO or PLC payments for base acres in 2024.\n4The same basic machinery set, which is timely for each rotation, is used for both the c-c and c-b rotation. The larger farm size requires larger, more expensive machinery. Corn production utilizes a chisel plow tillage system, and soybeans utilize no-till. Average annual replacement costs for the larger farm size were calculated using the Purdue Machinery Cost Calculator for a timely machinery set. Seven-year trading policy is assumed for combine and planter, 10-year policy for other field machinery. On livestock farms where fewer hours each day are available for crops, or on small farms, machinery costs and/or labor costs will be higher. On well-drained soils where more days are suitable for spring field work, machinery costs could be lower. A 10-year trading policy was assumed for all machinery on the smaller acreages. Machinery ownership costs are likely to vary widely from farm to farm.\n5For the larger acreages, operator labor expense incoroporates information pertaining to total family living, net nonfarm income, and income and self-employment taxes obtained from FINBIN, Center for Farm Financial Management, University of Minnesota. The larger acreages also included hired labor. FINBIN data was used to compute hourly hired labor wages. For the smaller acreages, labor expense includes the same family living withdrawal and no hired labor. Labor costs are likely to vary widely from farm to farm.\nTable 2.

      "ADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nHarvest season progresses rapidly across Midwest\nAn extremely warm and dry fall has allowed harvest to progress quickly across the northern Plains.\nThe very warm and dry weather in the upper Midwest during September this year has pushed the 2024 corn and soybean crop very rapidly toward maturity. September 2024 was the sixth warmest on record at the University of Minnesota Southern Research and Outreach Center at Waseca, only trailing the warmest September on record in 1931 by 1.6 degrees. By early October, soybean harvest was 50% or more completed in western portions of region, while some areas further east still needed a bit more time for soybeans to fully mature. Many corn hybrids had also reached physiological maturity by late September and were also ready to be harvested, with some corn already at desirable moisture levels for harvest.\nAs of Oct. 2, a total of 2,722 growing degree units had been accumulated since May 1 at the U of M Research Center at Waseca, which is comparable to many areas of southern Minnesota and northern Iowa.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs of Oct. 7, the Waseca location has not yet had the first freezing temperatures of the year, so GDU accumulation for the year continues. The 2024 GDU accumulation at Waseca was similar to the 2022 GDU accumulation in early October and exceeded the normal GDU accumulation by 9%; however, it was 133 GDU\u2019s below the GDU accumulation at this point in 2023. The extra growing degree units, combined with warm weather in September, helped this year\u2019s corn and soybean crop reach maturity, as well as to dry down rapidly in the field.\nIn addition to September being extremely warm for most of the month in 2024, it was also one of the driest September\u2019s on record in many areas of the upper Midwest. The overall Minnesota statewide average precipitation in September was a record-low amount of only .55 inches, with many locations in the southern and western portions of the state reporting less than .25 inches of total precipitation during the month. \nSeptember rainfall at the Waseca Research Center totaled only .48 inches, which was the second driest on record. The U.S. Drought Monitor released on Oct. 3 shows a large majority of the upper Midwest as \u201cabnormally dry or in \u201cmoderate drought,\u201d as compared to late August when only a small portion of the region was shown on the weekly drought monitor. Minnesota is now listed as 94% \u201cabnormally dry\u201d and 43% in \u201cmoderate drought,\u201d including a large portion of southwest and south central Minnesota in the higher drought category.\nSoybean harvest has been underway for the past 2-3 weeks in many locations across upper Midwest. Most soybeans have now reached maturity, except for soybeans that were planted very late due to wet field conditions or that were replanted following heavy rains and hail damage in June. As expected, soybean yields have been highly variable across the upper Midwest due to impacts from heavy rainfall amounts in June and the amount of crop loss in some locations, as well as yield reductions from the very warm and dry conditions late in the growing season. \nIn areas such as the southern half of Minnesota and portions of northern Iowa and eastern South Dakota that were impacted by the heavy rainfall and drown-out damage in June, many soybean yields have been 20-40% below the crop insurance APH (average) yields. Generally, the soybean yields have been average or slightly above and much more consistent in areas that were fortunate enough to receive more appropriate and timely rainfall during the growing season, including much of Iowa, Illinois and Indiana.\nMost of the corn in the upper Midwest has reached physiological maturity, which is the \u201cblack layer\u201d stage, or is very close to reaching maturity. Corn is usually at 30-32% moisture when it reaches the \u201cback layer\u201d stage, and then begins to dry down naturally in the field. Ideally, growers like to see corn dried down in the field to at least 20-22% moisture, or lower, before they harvest the corn. This greatly saves on corn drying costs and improves the quality of the corn being harvested and going into storage. Corn is usually dried down to a final moisture content of 15-16% moisture for safe storage on the farm until the following summer. The moisture content on much of the corn being harvested in many areas has now dropped to 20% or lower.\nIf favorable drying weather continues in the coming weeks, it is likely that corn drying costs in many areas will be greatly reduced in 2024, which is certainly beneficial in a year such as this.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt is a bit early to project 2024 corn yields across the Midwest; however, early indications are that corn yields in many areas will be just as variable as the soybean yields. In portions of the upper Midwest, such as the eastern and southern Corn Belt, that had timely and adequate rainfall during the growing season, 2024 corn yields may end up average or slightly above average. However, in those areas that were severely impacted by the excessive rainfall in June, especially in southern Minnesota and potions of northern Iowa, corn yields will likely be greatly reduced. Similar to soybeans, many \u201cwhole field\u201d final corn yields in the hardest hit areas could end up 20-40% below the 10-year average APH (average) crop insurance yields. In southern Minnesota many of those APH yields are 200 bushels per acre or more, meaning that many final \u201cwhole field\u201d corn yields in 2024 could end up at 120-160 bushels per acre, which would be some of the lowest corn yields in the past two to three decades.\nUSDA Grain Stocks report summary\nThe Sept. 30 USDA Grain Stocks Report surprised most grain marketing analysts and was viewed as somewhat \u201cbullish\u201d for future corn markets and considered basically neutral for soybean markets. Grain stock estimates for corn were about 5% lower than pre-report estimates by grain traders, while soybean stocks were fairly close to the anticipated grain-trade projections. Following the release of the USDA report, December corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade showed some strength. November soybean futures showed very little movement in either direction.\nThe biggest surprise in the Sept. 30 report was the estimated total U.S. corn stocks at 1.76 billion bushels, up by 400 million bushels from this time last year but 84 million bushels lower than the pre-report estimates. USDA estimated that just over 780 million bushels of corn was stored on farms as of Sept. 1, which is up by 172 million bushels or 29% from a year ago. Even though there was an initial positive market reaction to the grain stocks data, it may be short-lived due to the much higher total stocks level in 2024 compared to recent years.\nThe latest report implies total corn usage for feed, ethanol, exports, etc., from July 1 to Sept. 30 this year at 3.24 billion bushels, which is up 50 million bushels or 18% from a year ago. In addition, USDA adjusted the final 2023 U.S. corn production totals downward by 1 million bushels from previous estimates, based on adjustments in the final 2023 U.S. corn acreage and average yield. The CBOT December corn futures closing price on Sept. 30, 2024, was $4.32 per bushel, compared to similar CBOT corn prices on Sept. 30 of $4.76 in 2023, $6.17 in 2022, $5.37 in 2021, $3.79 in 2020, $3.88 in 2019, and $3.56 in 2018.\nThe USDA soybean stocks estimate of 342 million bushels as of Sept. 1, which was about 30% above the U.S. soybean inventory of just over 264 million bushels a year ago on Sept. 1. The soybean stocks estimate on Sept. 1, 2024, was at the highest level at this point of the year in recent years. It was estimated that 111 million bushels of soybeans were stored on farms as of Sept. 1, which represented approximately 33% of the total stocks. \n\nThe \u201con-farm\u201d soybean inventory is 55% higher than a year ago at this time, which probably explains why soybean basis levels in late summer and early fall at many grain elevators and processing plants in the upper Midwest have been at wider levels than in recent years.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe market reaction to the higher soybean stocks in the latest USDA report has been somewhat tempered by the projected soybean usage of 628 million bushels for processing, exports, etc. from July 1 to Sept. 30 in 2024. This represents an 18% increase compared to the soybean usage of 528 million bushels during the same period in 2023; however, the 2024 estimated soybean use level is still well below the usage level of 858 million bushels during that same period as recently as 2020. \n\nThe CBOT November soybean futures price closed at $10.37 per bushel on Sept. 30, compared to late September soybean prices of $12.75 per bushel in 2023, $13.66 in 2022, $12.56 in 2021, $10.23 in 2020, $9.06 in 2019, and $8.45 in 2018.\nKent Thiesse is a Farm Management Analyst and writes the weekly \"Focus on Ag\" column.

      "Economic Research Service/USDA Price Determination for Corn and Wheat / TB-1878 3 Prices are determined by the interaction of the supply and demand functions, which historically have been influenced by government agricultural policies. This section provides information regarding supply and demand factors for the corn and wheat markets.\nSelected agricultural policies are also discussed because they, too, can affect the supply, demand, and pricing of commodities. Some policies have affected supply or demand factors and thus have influenced prices indi-rectly. Such policies include, for example, acreage reduction programs that affected supplies of corn and wheat, and export programs that affected demand. The price effects of these policies are usually embedded in the supply and demand data and thus do not need to be modeled separately. These policies are discussed within the context of the relevant supply and demand factors.\nOther policies have affected the pricing of corn and wheat more directly, beyond the effects on supply and demand and, therefore, need to be considered separately in pricing models. In particular, governmental price sup-port and commodity storage programs have affected market prices for corn and wheat in certain periods. And public stockholding by the Government has influenced prices. These programs are discussed in a separate policy section.\nSupply Factors for Corn and Wheat The components of supply are beginning stocks, imports, and production. Corn is the largest feed grain domestically and globally. Corn accounts for over 85 percent of total U.S. feed grain production. The United States is the largest producer of corn in the world, aver-aging 210 million metric tons in 1990-96, representing about 40 percent of global production. U.S. farmers\u0092 cash receipts from corn averaged nearly $16 billion in 1990-96, the largest of all field crops. Wheat is the principal food grain in the United States and throughout much of the world. The United States is the third largest producer of wheat in the world, averag-ing 63.6 million metric tons in 1990-96, accounting for about 11 percent of world production. Cash receipts for wheat in the United States averaged almost $8 billion in 1990-96, the third largest of all field crops (soybeans ranked second).\nBeginning Stocks Carryover stocks from the previous year become the current year\u0092s beginning stocks and augment current production in determining total supply. Large stocks can provide additional supplies in a low production year while small stocks provide less cushion. Imports Corn and wheat imports have been fairly insignificant relative to total supply for many years. U.S. corn imports continue to have little impact on domestic sup-ply as they averaged 15 million bushels during 1990-96, less than 1 percent of supply. Imports of seed and trade with Canada account for most U.S. corn imports. Wheat imports were an insignificant factor for the U.S. wheat supply for many years, representing less than 1 percent of domestic wheat supply between 1960 and 1989.\nHowever, imports of wheat (including wheat products) from Canada in the 1993/94 marketing year pushed total wheat imports to 109 million bushels, or 4 percent of supply. Wheat imports have since declined to about 3 percent of supply, but the United States remains an attractive market for Canadian wheat.\nProduction Production is the major component of supply and is determined by the amount of acreage harvested for grain and the yield per acre. Acreage. Acreage planted generally reflects producer net returns per acre for a given commodity compared with returns for competing crops. Government policy and agronomic considerations, such as crop rotations, can also influence plantings. Income support and supply management/production control programs were impor-tant in affecting land use from 1974 through 1995.\nIncome support policies may have provided economic incentives to increase acreage during those years, but supply management policies, such as acreage reduction programs, could be offsetting. In an effort to influence production, support farm income, and limit government costs, various acreage limitation programs have been employed, such as the acreage reduction program, paid land diversions, and Price Determination Factors for Corn and Wheat 4 Price Determination for Corn and Wheat / TB-1878 Economic Research Service/USDA the voluntary 0,50/85-92 programs.1, 2 In addition, the long-term Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) affected acreage available for production.3 Income support through the target price/deficiency pay-ment system provided economic incentives for produc-ers to participate in annual farm programs, thereby influencing farmers\u0092 planting decisions. For an individ-ual farmer, program benefits would be compared with costs of participating in the programs, such as comply-ing with any requirement to idle land under a supply management program. Planting choices were also affected by program rules for determining crop-specific acreage bases to maintain eligibility for future farm pro-gram benefits. The 1996 Farm Act replaced deficiency payments with annual production flexibility contract payments, eliminated annual supply control programs, and decoupled planting decisions from program param-eters. Thus, planting decisions now are mostly based on market prices rather than farm programs. Corn area planted and harvested for grain averaged 76.0 and 68.7 million acres, respectively, for 1990-96, com-pared with averages of 66.5 and 56.8 million acres in 1965-70. Wheat plantings and area harvested averaged 72.3 and 62.6 million acres, respectively, for 1990-96, compared with averages of 57.1 and 50.5 million acres in 1965-70. The proportion of corn planted area that is harvested for grain has been trending upward during the last 20 to 25 years. Low harvest-to-planting ratios for corn typically occur in years of weather-related production and yield shortfalls. For wheat, the relationship between area planted and harvested for grain can vary by region, but at the national level, the harvest-to-planting ratio has been more stable. Typically, the harvest-to-planting ratio for wheat reflects the yield and quality of the crop, mar-ket prices, farm program provisions, and, in some regions, the relative grazing value.\nAcreage for both corn and wheat in the future is expect-ed to reflect relative net returns from the marketplace as farmers use full planting flexibility provided by the 1996 Farm Act to respond to changes in domestic and international demand.\nYields. Many factors affect U.S. yields for corn and wheat, including climatic conditions, weather, farm management practices, crop variety, and soil type. Trend yields are a good composite indicator of gains related to productivity from production practices, management skills, technology, and input use. In any given year, weather events are crucial and can push yields above or below trends. Major deviations from trend yields may have a significant impact on prices. Corn yields increased from 74.1 bushels per acre in 1965 to 127.1 bushels per acre in 1996, a 72-percent increase. Corn yields trended upward by 1.5 to 2 bushels per acre per year from 1965 to 1997. Yields are expected to continue to increase, assuming producers adopt favorable production practices developed through research and select hybrids with high yield potential. Average U.S. wheat yields rose from around 30 bushels per acre in the mid-1970\u0092s to 37 bushels per acre in 1990-96. The current yield trend for wheat is about 0.2 to 0.3 bushel per acre per year. 1 Acreage reduction programs (ARP\u0092s) began in the early 1980\u0092s, replacing set-aside programs of the late 1970\u0092s. If supplies were estimated by USDA to be excessive, ARP\u0092s were required and paid land-diversion programs (PLD\u0092s) were permitted. To participate in the annual farm programs and be eligible for program benefits, farmers were required to idle a crop-specific percentage of their acreage base, as specified by the ARP. No payments were made for idled ARP land. Some PLD\u0092s were optional and some were required for program participation.\n2 0,50/85-92 programs are the 50/85 and 50/92 provisions for rice and cotton and the 50/92, 0/92, and 0/85 provisions for wheat and feed grains that were in effect in various forms from 1986 through 1995. Under these provisions, farmers could idle all or part of their permitted acreage, putting the land in a conserving use, and receive deficiency payments for part of the acreage. A minimum planting requirement of 50 percent of maximum payment acreage applied for rice and cotton for all years during that period, and applied for feed grains and wheat in 1986 and 1987. For feed grains and wheat in 1991 through 1995, producers could plant acreage in this program to selected alternative crops (minor oilseeds, sesame, crambe, or \u0093industrial and other crops\u0094) instead of idling the land. 3 The CRP was created by the Food Security Act of 1985 to reduce erosion and protect water quality, initially on up to 45 million acres of farmland. Under the program, landowners who sign contracts agree to convert environmentally sensitive land to approved perma-nent conserving uses for 10 to 15 years. In exchange, the landowner receives an annual rental payment and an initial payment of up to 50 percent of the cost of establishing permanent vegetative cover.\nThe 1996 Farm Act caps CRP acreage at 36.4 million acres. Over 40 percent of current CRP enrollments come from wheat and corn cropland.\nEconomic Research Service/USDA Price Determination for Corn and Wheat / TB-1878 5 Demand Factors for Corn and Wheat Major components of demand for corn and wheat include food, seed, industrial, feed and residual, exports, and carryover stocks. Domestic use is a growing com-ponent of total U.S. consumption for both corn and wheat. Domestic corn use averaged 79 percent of total disappearance in 1990-96 compared with 69 percent in 1975-80. Increased production of alcohol fuels and corn sweeteners contributed significantly to this growth.\nDomestic consumption of U.S. wheat accounts for about 50 percent of total wheat disappearance, up from an average 39 percent during 1975-80, with much of this gain reflecting increased wheat flour consumption.\nFood, Seed, and Industrial Use Food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use is a growing com-ponent of total demand for both corn and wheat, with its relative share rising. Such a situation strengthens prices at the farm level. FSI use for corn represented an aver-age of 19 percent of total use in 1990-96, up from an average of 9 percent in 1975-80. Food and seed uses for wheat accounted for 39 percent of total wheat disap-pearance in 1990-96, compared with 34 percent in 1975-80.\nFood use. Consumption of corn or wheat for food pur-poses usually follows a trend because gains are largely related to population growth. Changes in tastes or pref-erences may at times alter consumption trends. Annual growth for food-use items also depends on whether the market is new and developing, with relatively strong growth, or has reached a stage of mature or stable growth. Food uses of corn and wheat are relatively unresponsive (inelastic) to farm-level prices since the farm value of grain in consumer food items is small.\nFood use of corn, consisting of cereals and other prod-ucts, starch, beverage alcohol, and corn sweeteners, has grown sharply over the past 20 years. Demand for corn-based cereals, snack foods, and baked goods is expected to increase near the rate of population growth. Use of corn starch as a thickening agent for food also is expected to grow in line with population gains. Demand for corn sweeteners has been stimulated indirectly by the sugar program. The U.S. sugar program has kept the price of domestically refined sugar high, thereby stimu-lating consumption of high-fructose corn syrup, an alternative sweetener. Future growth in demand for corn sweeteners is expected to exceed population growth, but will likely be much less than the sharp gains in the early to mid-1980\u0092s. Wheat food use has been the largest and most stable component of domestic wheat use and is characterized by a steady growth rate, closely tied to population, tastes, and preferences. Wheat food use accounted for an average of 35 percent of total wheat disappearance in 1990-96, compared with an average of 30 percent in 1975-80. Wheat is unique because it is the only cereal grain with sufficient gluten to produce bread without requiring mixing with another grain. Understanding the different classes of wheat, their uses, and their degree of substitutability is an important demand consideration. Hard red winter wheat, possess-ing a typical protein content of 9 to 14 percent, is gener-ally used for making white breads and rolls. Hard red spring wheat, typically consisting of 11.5 to 18 percent protein, is used for making whole-wheat and hearth breads. Soft red winter wheat has a protein content from 8.25 to 11.75 percent and is generally used to produce cakes, cookies, crackers, or pastries with a tender, flaky, or crisp texture. Soft white wheat has a protein content ranging from about 6.75 to 10.5 percent and is used to produce cookies, cakes, pastries, and cereal. New hard white wheat varieties are being developed with milling and end-use characteristics superior to hard red winter wheat. Finally, durum wheat is primarily used for spaghetti, macaroni, and other pastas. The amount of potential substitution among the different wheat classes depends on the end use. Thus, the greatest degree of substitutability is between hard red winter and hard red spring wheats. This substitutability allows blending of these two varieties to achieve minimum protein require-ments in various end uses if protein content of either variety is low. Additional substitution potential exists between the hard red wheats and new hard white vari-eties.\nSeed use. Seed use is a relatively small component of total demand for corn and wheat. Seed use reflects the amount of land planted to the crop and the per-acre seeding rates. Seeding rates for corn and wheat vary across States due to differences in soil types and pro-duction practices, and change slowly over time as pro-duction practices evolve. As a result, national average seeding rates for these crops tend to be fairly stable.\nThus, variations in total seed use for corn and wheat are 6 Price Determination for Corn and Wheat / TB-1878 Economic Research Service/USDA mostly due to changes in acreage, which historically have reflected provisions of annual supply management programs.\nIndustrial use. Industrial use of corn reflects the pro-duction of starch and alcohol. Corn starch is used in the paper industry for coating paper and in the construction industry as an ingredient for wallboard construction.\nCorn used in starch production follows the growth rate of population and the general economy. Corn use for fuel alcohol depends on government incentives and policies, technology, corn prices, prices of production byproducts, and prices of energy substitutes. Fuel alcohol use of corn, which began in the late 1970\u0092s, averaged about 425 million bushels in 1990-96.\nFeed and Residual Feed and residual use is a major demand component for corn, but represents a relatively smaller component of total demand for wheat. Despite corn\u0092s rising levels of feed use, its share of total disappearance remained fairly constant between 1975 and 1996. In contrast, the share of wheat feed use of total wheat disappearance is more variable, reflecting both feed wheat\u0092s small share of total wheat use and wheat\u0092s primary use as a food grain.\nThe reported data for the category \u0093feed and residual\u0094 are derived by subtracting other domestic uses (food, seed, and industrial uses), exports, and ending stocks from total supply. As a result, some variation in this category reflects unaccounted statistical measurement errors in other categories of supply and demand.\nFeed use of corn is related to the number of animals on feed, the price of corn, and prices of competing feed grains and feed wheat. Feed and residual use for corn averaged 5.0 billion bushels during 1990-96, about 60 percent of total disappearance for corn. This compares with an average corn feed and residual use of 4.0 billion bushels during 1975-80, again about 60 percent of total corn use. Corn feed use may vary annually, reflecting changes in the numbers of animals fed and adjustments in rations made by feeders in response to relative prices and availability of corn and competing feed ingredients. Feed use for wheat is more variable than food use and is related to wheat prices, feed grain prices, and wheat crop quality. Feed and residual use for wheat accounted for 18-20 percent of total disappearance in the 1986 and 1990 crop years, years of lower wheat prices, compared with about 6 percent in 1988 and 1995, years of higher wheat prices. Typically, most feed use of wheat occurs in the summer, when wheat prices are seasonally low following the wheat harvest but before new crops of corn and sorghum are harvested. Exports Exports are important to both the corn and wheat mar-ket. Crop developments in other countries and U.S.\nagricultural policies (such as EEP4 and P.L. 480 pro-grams5) can affect the demand for U.S. exports and, consequently, the U.S. price. A crop shortfall in a major producing foreign country can increase the demand for U.S. exports, strengthening U.S. prices. Or an abundant crop in an importing country can reduce U.S. export demand, lowering U.S. prices. One expected result of global trade liberalization is that export demand for U.S. corn and wheat will become more responsive to price changes (more price-elastic) as foreign import demand and export supply become more elastic. Corn exports averaged 21 percent of total U.S. corn consumption in 1990-96, compared with an average of 31 percent in 1975-80. In fiscal 1996, corn exports accounted for 14 percent of the total value of U.S. agri-cultural exports, or $8.4 billion. The United States is the world\u0092s largest exporter of corn, with a world market share averaging over 70 percent in 1990-96. 4 The Export Enhancement Program (EEP) was initiated in May 1985 under the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act to help U.S. exporters meet competitors\u0092 subsidized prices in targeted mar-kets. The program was later authorized by the Food Security Act of 1985 and has continued under subsequent legislation. Under the EEP, exporters are awarded cash payments to enable the sale of cer-tain commodities to specified countries at competitive prices. The 1996 Farm Act caps EEP program levels annually through 2002 and allows the Secretary to target up to $100 million annually (under certain conditions) for the sale of intermediate-value products.\n5 Public Law 480 (P.L. 480), the common name for the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, seeks to expand for-eign markets for U.S. agricultural products, combat hunger, and encourage economic development in developing countries. P.L. 480 is also referred to as the Food for Peace Program. Title I of P.L. 480 makes U.S. agricultural commodities available by financing export sales on concessional terms, such as using low interest rates for up to 30 years. Donations for emergency food relief and nonemergency humanitarian assistance are provided under Title II. Title III author-izes a Food for Development program that provides government-to-government grant food assistance to least developed countries. The 1996 Farm Act extends the authority to enter into new P.L. 480 agreements through fiscal year 2002. Economic Research Service/USDA Price Determination for Corn and Wheat / TB-1878 7 U.S. exports of wheat are very important to the U.S.\nwheat market. Wheat exports averaged 49 percent of total disappearance in 1990-96, compared with an aver-age of 61 percent in 1975-80. In fiscal 1996, wheat exports accounted for 12 percent of the total value of U.S. agricultural exports, or $7.0 billion. Although the United States is the world\u0092s largest exporter of wheat, it has a smaller world-market share than for corn, averag-ing slightly over 30 percent of global wheat trade in 1990-96. Since wheat can be grown in more different climates than corn, relatively greater production occurs in other countries. Consequently, the United States has a less dominant role in the international wheat market than it does in the global corn market. Major wheat trade competitors include the European Union (EU), Canada, Australia, and Argentina. U.S. wheat exports have been boosted by a variety of agricultural export programs, including food aid, export credit guarantees, export enhancement programs, and market development and market promotion programs.\nBetween 1986 and 1994, over half of U.S. wheat exports received EEP subsidies. Although the EEP has not been used for U.S. wheat exports since July 1995, the 1996 Farm Act continues the program, but annual funding is limited by the 1996 Act and by WTO (World Trade Organization) export subsidy commitments. Carryover Stocks In general, changes in carryover stocks are inversely related to the marketing year price. If total use rises relative to supply, ending stocks decline and farm prices tend to rise. On the other hand, if supply rises relative to total use, prices tend to decline as ending stocks build. For corn and wheat, government programs his-torically have influenced the holding of stocks, either through direct government (public) ownership of stocks or through programs that influence stockholding by the private sector. Government programs led to a large buildup of stocks in the early to mid-1980\u0092s. Total ending stocks for corn exceeded 4 billion bushels from 1985 through 1987, an average of 61 percent of annual use. Wheat carryover stocks reached levels greater than 1 billion bushels between 1981 and 1987, with ending stocks represent-ing an average of 62 percent of annual use. Many of these stocks were in the Farmer-Owned Reserve (FOR) or held by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC).\nHowever, as 1985 and 1990 farm legislation steered the sector toward greater market orientation, grain stocks declined. Year-ending stocks of corn averaged about 1.2 billion bushels (14.5 percent of use) in 1990-96, while wheat carryover stocks averaged about 540 million bushels (22 percent of use). Publicly held stocks owned by the Government (CCC) represent stocks acquired through loan defaults or mar-ket purchases. Stocks owned by the Government have historically influenced corn and wheat prices because these stocks have generally not been readily accessible to the marketplace. This reflects CCC sales price restrictions, which, until removed in the 1996 Farm Act, prohibited the Government from selling commodities it owned unless prices reached specified levels.\nGovernment-owned stocks of corn and wheat were high in the early to mid-1980\u0092s, but have fallen in recent years with more market-oriented stockholding policies.\nAt the end of the 1996 crop year, the CCC held only 2 million bushels of corn and 93 million bushels of wheat. For wheat, government-owned stocks have included those held in the Food Security Wheat Reserve (FSWR). The FSWR was created in the 1980/81 mar-keting year to provide a government-held reserve of up to 4 million metric tons (about 147 million bushels) of wheat for emergency food needs in developing coun-tries. The FSWR was replaced in the 1996 Farm Act by a new Food Security Commodity Reserve (FSCR) that may include corn, grain sorghum, and rice, in addition to wheat. Almost all of the 93 million bushels of wheat held by the Government at the end of the 1996 crop year were in this grain reserve. Privately held stocks have also been influenced by gov-ernment programs, such as the government price-sup-port loan program and, historically, the FOR program.\nDepending on the accessibility of these stocks, some of these government policies have affected prices. 8 Price Determination for Corn and Wheat / TB-1878 Economic Research Service/USDA Agricultural Policies: Price Support and Commodity Storage Programs, 1975 to 1996 Beyond the effects of domestic agricultural policies on supply and demand factors, some policies have affected market prices more directly. The most important have been price support and commodity storage programs.\nThis section discusses how these programs evolved from 1975 to 1996 and how their interactions with each other and with additional farm programs affected mar-ket prices.\nCommodity price support programs for corn and wheat allow producers to receive a loan from the Government at a designated loan rate per unit of production by pledging some of their grain production as loan collater-al. Following harvest of the crop, a farmer who has enrolled in the farm program may obtain a loan for all or part of the new crop. For each bushel put under loan and pledged as loan collateral, the farmer receives a per-bushel amount equal to that year\u0092s loan rate. Under the loan program, the producer must keep the crop des-ignated as loan collateral in approved storage to pre-serve the crop\u0092s quality. The producer may repay the loan at any time during the length of the loan, usually 9 months for corn and wheat. Prior to 1993, when marketing loans were implemented for corn and wheat (discussed below), the farmer would pay back the loan principal plus accrued interest charges. However, rather than repaying the loan, the farmer could choose instead to default on the loan at the end of the 9-month loan period, keeping the loan money and forfeiting ownership of the loan collateral (the grain) to the Government. If market prices were below the loan rate, the farmer would benefit from defaulting on the loan and keeping the higher loan rate. Additionally, if market prices were above the loan rate, but below the loan rate plus interest, defaulting on the loan would also make economic sense because the cost of settling the loan (loan rate plus interest) would be greater than the market value of the grain.\nHistorically, loan rates for corn and wheat were raised in the late 1970\u0092s and remained relatively high through the mid-1980\u0092s (figs. 1 and 2). Loan program defaults pushed government-owned stocks of corn to more than 1.1 billion bushels in 1982, or 16 percent of annual use (fig. 3), while government-owned stocks of wheat rose to almost 200 million bushels, representing 8 percent of annual use (fig. 4). Stocks owned by the Government have historically influenced corn and wheat prices because these stocks have generally not been readily accessible to the marketplace. 77 79 81 83 85 87 89 91 93 95 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 4.00 4.50 5.00 1975 X = Higher FOR loan rate, 1980-82.\nCrop year Wheat price Wheat loan rate Wheat price and loan rate Dollars per bushel Figure 2 X = Higher FOR loan rate, 1980-82.\nCrop year Corn price Corn loan rate Figure 1 Corn price and loan rate Dollars per bushel 77 79 81 83 85 87 89 91 93 95 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 1975 Economic Research Service/USDA Price Determination for Corn and Wheat / TB-1878 9 Also, a multi-year FOR program was initiated in the late 1970\u0092s under the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977.\nThe FOR provided storage subsidies to farmers to store grain under loan for 3 to 5 years (with some exten-sions)\uf8e7farmers agreed not to market their FOR grain for this time period unless the average farm price reached a specified release level. Additional price sup-port was provided under the FOR program in 1980-82, with a higher reserve loan rate than available under the regular, 9-month loan program. The long duration of the FOR program, combined with high release prices need-ed for grain to exit the reserve, effectively isolated a large amount of grain from the marketplace. By 1982, corn held in the FOR rose to almost 1.9 billion bushels, about 26 percent of annual use, and the wheat FOR exceeded 1 billion bushels, representing 44 percent of annual use. Thus, high price supports along with the isolation of FOR stocks from the marketplace resulted in a significant policy effect on corn and wheat prices.\nChanges in the price support program since 1986 have reduced the interference of that program with price determination. Three important policy features of pro-grams enacted in 1985 farm legislation significantly changed the loan program and the effect of price sup-ports on market prices starting in 1986. These changes were part of a general movement in U.S. agricultural policy toward more market orientation. First, price sup-port levels for grains were sharply reduced. Loan rates for corn and wheat were lowered \uf8e7corn from $2.55 per bushel in 1985 to $1.92 per bushel in 1986, wheat from $3.30 to $2.40. Second, corn produced in 1986-90 was not permitted to enter the FOR; the wheat FOR was opened for wheat produced in 1990, but not for 1986-89 crops. Finally, a new policy instrument, generic certifi-cates,6 made grain in the reserve more available to the marketplace by allowing early access to that grain before its FOR contract expired.\nThese policy changes facilitated a reduction in grain stocks in the late 1980\u0092s. Corn stocks fell from over 4 billion bushels at the end of the 1986/87 season to 1.5 billion bushels at the end of 1990/91 while government-owned and FOR corn stocks fell from nearly 3 billion bushels to under 400 million bushels, declines accelerated in 1988 by a major drought in the Corn Belt region that sharply lowered corn production.\nSimilarly, total wheat stocks fell from about 1.8 billion bushels at the end of 1986/87 to under 900 million bushels by the end of 1990/91. Government-owned and FOR wheat stocks dropped from nearly 1.3 billion bushels to about 175 million bushels, with less than 14 million bushels in the FOR. As with corn, production difficulties for wheat (in 1988 and 1989) accelerated the decline in stocks.

They could be used to acquire stocks held as collateral on government loans (regular loans or FOR loans) or stocks owned by the CCC.\nFarmers received generic certificates as payment for participation in numerous government programs. Grain merchants and commodity groups also were issued certificates through the Export Enhancement Program and the Targeted Export Assistance Program. 10 Price Determination for Corn and Wheat / TB-1878 Economic Research Service/USDA tion of lower price supports for corn and wheat, no further corn FOR entry and only limited wheat FOR entry, and generic certificates that allowed access to FOR stocks reduced the strong policy effect on price determination for these grains. Essentially, the loan pro-gram continued to provide corn and wheat producers a source of short-term liquidity, but it no longer supported prices. Also, the lower level of stocks held by the Government reduced the price effects of public stock-holding.\nPolicy changes since 1990 have continued to keep the price effects of government price support and commodi-ty storage programs small. Since 1991, the corn loan rate has ranged from $1.62 to $1.89 per bushel, while wheat loan rates have ranged from $2.04 to $2.58 per bushel. Until recently, these loan rates have been well below market prices in most years. Further, marketing loans for corn and wheat were implemented starting in 1993 and continued under the 1996 Farm Act. Marketing loans allow repayment of commodity loans at less than the original loan rate if market prices are lower, which decreases the loan program\u0092s potential effect on supporting prices because stock accumulation by the Government through loan defaults is reduced.\nAdditionally, although the availability of generic certifi-cates declined in the early 1990\u0092s, new FOR rules in the 1990 Farm Act permitted farmers to repay their FOR loans and re-acquire the loan collateral at any time rather than when prices reached specific FOR release levels, thereby continuing the accessibility of those stocks to the marketplace. The 1996 Farm Act suspend-ed the FOR. Finally, government-owned stockholding has continued to decline, with only 2 million bushels of corn held by the CCC at the end of the 1996 crop year and 93 million bushels of wheat held, nearly all of the latter in the Food Security Commodity Reserve. As a consequence, since 1986, prices for corn and wheat have largely been based on market supply and demand conditions with a reduced influence of government price support and commodity stockholding programs."

Its density, combined with its high protein content and gluten strength, make durum the wheat of choice for producing premium pasta and couscous products. Pasta made from durum is firm with consistent cooking quality. Du-rum kernels are amber colored and larger than those of other wheat classes. Also unique to durum is its yellow endosperm, which gives pasta its golden hue and the best color for couscous.\nWhen durum is milled, the endosperm is ground into a granular product called semolina. A mixture of water and semolina forms a stiff dough. Pasta dough is then forced through dies, or metal discs with holes, to create hundreds of different shapes.\nDurum production is geographically concentrated to the Northern Plains because it demands a special agronomic environment. In most years, the states of North Dakota and Montana produce 90 percent of the U.S. durum crop.\nTable of Contents AVERAGE SHARE OF U.S. DURUM EXPORTS BY PORT (2020-2023) LAKES 45% GULF 49% PNW 6% Montana North Dakota 3 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Overview The 2024 Northern Durum production was 23% higher than last year at 71 million bushels (1.9 MMT). Planted area was 35% higher than last year and average yields reached record levels in North Dakota, but were reduced in Montana due to hot, dry conditions Field conditions were mostly good at planting time with decent moisture. Cool weather at the beginning of the growing season promoted plant growth and yield potential. The latter part of the growing season produced hotter, drier conditions which stressed the crop in western areas. Disease pressure was minimal to non-existent in the major production areas. Harvest was done under mostly dry conditions with few quality issues. Spotty rains in parts of the region did cause some color loss. Growing season weather differed by region, causing greater than typical variance in yields and some crop quality parameters. This year\u2019s crop GRADES a No. 1 Hard Amber Durum with 38% of the crop making that top grade. This crop shows a bit wider grade distribution due to some samples with lower test weight or higher damage. Vitreous kernel content at 83% is higher than last year and the same as the five-year average. Average test weight in this year\u2019s crop trended slightly lower at 60.8 lbs./bu. (79.2 kg/hl). While nearly two-thirds of the crop has test weight of 60 lbs./bu. or higher, there is a larger percent of the crop with some lower test weights due to late season heat and drought stress. Damage, at 0.6% is slightly higher than 2023, but lower than the five-year average. Average moisture of the crop is 12.2%, higher than last year and average due to wetter growing and harvest conditions in some areas of the production region.\nPROTEIN in this year\u2019s crop is notably higher at a 14.3% average, with exceptionally high protein in Montana, where growing conditions were more stressful to the crop. There is still quite a bit of variabil-ity in the protein, with larger percentages of this year\u2019s crop in both the very high and very low ranges. The majority of the crop has protein that is 13.0% or higher. THOUSAND KERNEL WEIGHTS are lower this year at 35.5 grams, versus 40.9 in 2023. Smaller kernels are the result of hot, dry growing conditions in western areas. Falling number values are very sound in this year\u2019s crop with an average 463 seconds. DON levels are once again generally low at <0.5 ppm for a crop average, but a small portion of samples did show above average levels, primarily in the lower production eastern areas. MILLING for the 2024 survey samples was performed on a Quadromat Junior mill, similar to the last five years, and is not indicative of commercial milling performance. Semolina extraction is significantly higher at 60.7%, nearly 5% above the average. Semolina color values are similar to last year and the five-year average with the b-value at 30.0. Ash is higher than last year at 0.68% and speck counts are lower. Protein in the flour average 12.3%, similar to last year. Protein loss in the milling process was slightly higher at 2%, likely due to more of the protein being stored in the bran and some areas of small, thin kernels.\nDOUGH STRENGTH parameters indicated strength very similar to last year and what is typical of an average durum crop. Dry spaghetti evaluations reveal a crop with slightly lower color scores, low-er cooked weight, but improved cooked firmness.\nThe 2024 crop has many positive attributes including high protein, a high grade profile, low damage, sound kernels, high vitreous kernel content, and a crop with good pasta quality performance. As is normal for most crop years, buyers should be aware of variance in all quality parameters, especially grades, test weight and protein, and adjust contract specifications as needed. The performance of the crop is typical of an average Northern Durum crop and should meet buyers\u2019 specifications. 2024 Production Data 2024 2023 2019-23 AVERAGE MILLION BUSHELS Montana 19.8 20.9 19.6 North Dakota 51.5 32.0 28.8 U.S. Total 80.1 59.3 56.1 MILLION METRIC TON Montana 0.54 0.57 0.53 North Dakota 1.40 0.85 0.78 U.S. Total 2.18 1.61 1.53 Source: USDA 2024 Small Grains Summary 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report 4 Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Seasonal Conditions - 2024 0 20 40 60 80 100 Planted 24 5 Yr Avg Planted 23 ND PLANTING PROGRESS Apr 21 Apr 28 May 5 May 12 May 19 June 2 Percent May 26 0 20 40 60 80 100 Harvest 24 5 Yr Avg Harvest 23 ND HARVEST PROGRESS Aug 25 Sept 1 Sept 8 Sept 15 Sept 23 Percent Sept 29 approximate share of regional production A 5% Montana North Dakota B 23% A 42% B 11% C 6% D 13% PLANTING of the Northern Durum crop started well ahead of average due to milder weather and limited snowfall over the winter. While some drier conditions persisted in early spring, mois-ture conditions at planting were much improved from previous years and some spring rain helped improved soil moisture conditions. There were very few planting delays and the majority of the crop was planted by early June. The crop EMERGED under mostly favorable conditions. Early development benefited from pre-cipitation and cooler temperatures and strong yield potential was predicted. As the growing season progressed, precipitation became more limited. Conditions became drier, and combined with hot temperatures, the crop was stressed in portions of western North Dakota and Montana. These condi-tions adversely affected yield potential. Production areas further east saw more adequate moisture which helped maintain overall good yield potential. Disease pressure was low. HARVEST began in early August, ahead of average. Conditions were mostly dry, with minimal delays. There were spotty areas of rainfall at harvest, which did cause some quality impacts, but overall harvest progress was fairly smooth. North Dakota saw good yields, while Montana had lower yields due to hotter, drier growing conditions. Harvest progress was slightly ahead of average and mostly finished by the end of September.\nPRODUCTION of this year\u2019s crop is estimat-ed at 80 million bushels, an increase of over 35% from the previous year due to a sizeable increase in planted acreage and higher yields in eastern production regions.\n5 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Wheat Characteristics WHEAT GRADES as defined by the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) of the USDA Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), reflect the general quality and condition of a representative sample. U.S. grades are based on test weight and include limits on damaged kernels, for-eign material, shrunken and broken kernels, and wheat of contrasting classes. Each determination is made on the basis of the grain when free from dockage and shrunken and broken kernels.\nSUBCLASS is as separate marketing factor based on the number of kernels that are dark, hard and vitreous. For durum wheat, the subclasses are: \u2022 Hard Amber Durum (HAD) \u2013 at least 75 percent or more hard, vitreous kernels; \u2022 Amber Durum (AD) \u2013 between 60 and 74 percent hard, vitreous kernels; \u2022 Durum (D) \u2013 less than 60 percent hard, vitreous kernels.\nU.S. sample grade is wheat that: a. Does not meet the requirements for U.S. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5; or b. Has a musty, sour or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or c. Is heating or of distinctly low quality.\n1. Includes damaged kernels (total), foreign material and shrunk-en and broken kernels.\n2. Unclassed wheat of any grade may contain not more than 10.0 percent of wheat of other classes.\n3. Includes contrasting classes.\n4.

Millers can control spec count by selecting durum that is free of disease and foreign material, thoroughly clean-ing the durum, properly tempering and conditioning the wheat before milling, and by using purifiers to remove small bran particles from the semolina.\nPROTEIN CONTENT in semolina has a high correlation with gluten content and, in turn, mechanical strength and cooking quality. Wet gluten is a quan-titative measure of the gluten forming proteins in semolina that are primarily responsible for its mechanical strength and pasta quality.\n2024 Semolina quality data GLUTOPEAK STATE AND CROP REPORTING AREA SEMOLINA EXTRACTION % ASH % SPECKS NO/10 SQ IN % PROTEIN (14% MOISTURE) % WET GLUTEN % GLUTEN INDEX % PEAK TIME SEC MAX TORQUE BE MONTANA Area A 60.9 0.72 20 13.2 35.0 97 207 48 Area B 55.9 0.72 17 14.1 36.1 84 120 55 State Avg. 2024 56.8 0.72 18 14.0 35.9 86 136 54 State Avg. 2023 50.1 0.67 24 12.9 34.1 88 174 41 NORTH DAKOTA Area A 62.4 0.65 27 11.6 30.2 89 164 43 Area B 63.6 0.72 30 11.2 29.9 90 158 42 Area C 62.3 0.70 35 11.0 27.7 96 141 39 Area D 60.2 0.65 25 12.4 31.3 89 180 44 State Avg. 2024 62.2 0.66 28 11.7 30.1 90 164 43 State Avg. 2023 53.4 0.61 28 12.1 30.7 93 183 41 REGION AVERAGE Avg. 2024 60.7 0.68 25 12.3 31.7 89 156 46 Avg. 2023 52.0 0.63 27 12.4 32.1 91 179 41 Five-Year Avg 55.3 0.63 27 12.6 33.8 77 175 41 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report 10 Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report DRY PASTA PROCESSORS want a finished product that is visually appealing, elastic and strong enough to resist breakage during cutting, packaging, handling and shipping, able to withstand the rigors of cooking, and satisfying to the consumer palate.\nYellow color in semolina and pasta is a traditional, rather than functional, mark of quality. In the early days of the pasta industry, before sophisticated testing evolved, consumers assumed that a yellow pasta was made from durum wheat, which is known to make pasta with superior cooking quality compared to that made from other hard wheats.\nMost consumers prefer pasta that is \u201cal dente,\u201d meaning it has some firmness to the bite. Good quality pasta that is cooked according to package directions should not be sticky or mushy when eaten.\n2024 Semolina & Spaghetti data STATE AND CROP REPORTING AREA SEMOLINA COLOR L (BLACK-WHITE) SEMOLINA COLOR A (GREEN-RED) SEMOLINA COLOR B (BLUE-YELLOW) SPAGHETTI COLOR L (BLACK-WHITE) SPAGHETTI COLOR A (GREEN-RED) SPAGHETTI COLOR B (BLUE-YELLOW) SPAGHETTI COOKED WEIGHT G SPAGHETTI COOKING LOSS % SPAGHETTI COOKED FIRMNESS G CM MONTANA Area A 80.5 -2.7 30.8 50.5 3.7 24.1 30.5 7.1 7.2 Area B 80.8 -2.8 30.3 51.2 3.6 23.4 29.8 6.7 7.6 State Avg. 2024 80.8 -2.8 30.4 51.1 3.6 23.5 29.9 6.8 7.5 State Avg. 2023 83.3 -2.5 30.6 52.9 2.9 25.8 31.8 7.3 4.1 NORTH DAKOTA Area A 81.4 -3.2 30.5 52.3 2.9 24.1 30.2 7.5 6.4 Area B 80.8 -3.1 29.1 52.0 2.8 23.4 30.9 8.2 6.0 Area C 81.2 -3.1 27.4 52.8 2.9 23.1 31.0 6.6 6.0 Area D 81.5 -3.2 29.4 51.9 3.3 24.2 28.8 6.4 6.6 State Avg. 2024 81.3 -3.2 29.9 52.2 3.0 23.9 30.1 7.3 6.3 State Avg. 2023 83.4 -2.6 29.7 53.7 2.9 25.3 31.6 7.4 3.8 REGION AVERAGE Avg. 2024 81.1 -3.1 30.0 51.9 3.1 23.8 30.1 7.2 6.7 Avg. 2023 83.4 -2.5 30.1 53.3 2.9 25.5 31.6 7.3 3.9 Five-Year Avg 83.3 -2.4 30.2 53.3 3.1 25.4 31.4 7.3 4.1 Montana North Dakota 2024 Average cooked firmness by Area A 7.2 (G CM) B 7.6 A 6.4 B 6.0 C 60 D 6.6 11 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report * Semolina color performed on CIE color scale.

North Dakota Grain Inspection service, Devils Lake, ND, provided grades for composite wheat samples representing each crop reporting area.\nVITREOUS KERNELS \u2022 Approximate percentage of kernels having vitreous endosperm, based on weights.\nDOCKAGE \u2022 Official USDA procedure. All matter other than wheat which can be removed readily from a test portion of the original sample by use of an approved device (Carter Dockage Tester). TEST WEIGHT \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists Mothod 55-10.01 approved April 1961, revised October 1999. Measured as pounds per bushel (lb/bu), kilograms per hectoliter (kg/hl) = (lbs/bu X 1.292) + 0.630. Approved Methods of the ANALYSIS \u2022 Half of the total wheat samples col-lected were analyzed for grad and other physical kernel characteristics. The data obtained from the analyses was used to generate frequency distributions as a percentage of the harvested crop. Distribution results may differ from the data presented in the various tables, because the latter are derived from production adjusted averages, rather than simple averages. All samples received in the laboratory were sub-sampled to obtain one composite sample for each of the four areas in North Dakota and one composite each of two areas for Montana. These were analyzed for grade and physical characteristics as well as milling performance and spaghetti processing qualities. Again, all state and regional averages have been adjusted to reflect production as opposed to simple averaging.\nAmerican Association of Cereal Chemists, Cereal Laboratory Methods (10th edition), St. Paul, MN (2000) THOUSAND KERNEL WEIGHT \u2022 Based on 10 gram sample of cleaned wheat (free of foreign material and broken kernels) counted by electronic seed counter.\nKERNEL SIZE DISTRIBUTION \u2022 Determinations made according to the procedure described in Cereal Science Today 5:(3), 71 (1960). Kernels re-maining over a Tyler No. 7 (2.92 mm opening) are classified as \u201clarge;\u201d kernels passing through the top sieve but remaining on a Tyler No. 9 (2.24 mm opening) are classified as \u201cmedium\u201d size kernels. Kernels passing through the second sieve are classed as \u201csmall.\u201d Size is reported as percentage of large, medium, and small kernels.\nPROTEIN \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC) Method: 46-30.01 (Combustion Method), expressed on dry basis and 12 percent moisture basis.\nASH \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists Method 08-01.01, approved April 1961, revised Octo-ber 1999; expressed on a 14 percent moisture basis.\nU.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Montana North Dakota 15 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report DON \u2022 Analysis was done on ground wheat using a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector as described in J.

The average of the three readings was converted to the number of specks per 10 square inches.\nGLUTOPEAK \u2022 Glutopeak is a shear-based device that measures the aggregation behavior of gluten. Flour and solvent are mixed at a constant speed with a rotating paddle, resulting in the separation of gluten and aggregation. The gluten aggregate mass exerts a resistance force on the paddle, and creates a torque curve. The curve records the complexity of aggregation and gluten breakdown, measured as Peak Maximum Time (PMT, in seconds), and the Maximum Torque (MT, in Brabender equiva-lents (BE)).\nNDSU laboratory procedure: The semolina sample (8.5 g, 14% mb) was placed in 9.5 g solution of 0.5mol L-1 CaCI2. e temperature at 350C. The mixing paddle was set to rotate at 2,750 rpm and the test was run for 5 min at 35C.\nSpaghetti PROCESSING \u2022 Pasta was made using the laboratory procedure described by Walsh, Ebeling, and Dick, Cereal Sci. Today: 16(11) 385, 1971. A 1-Kg semolina was mixed with the appropriate amount of water that gave a dough consistency of 32 percent total water absorption. The other processing conditions used were: Water temperature, 40 C, extruder shaft speed, 25 rpm and vacuum, 18 in. HG; the dough was pressed through an 84-strand teflon-coated spaghetti die with 0.157 cm openings. The extruded spaghetti samples were dried at high temperature for 12 hrs, using maximum temperature and relative humidity of 73 C and 83 percent, respectively.\nCOLOR \u2022 Color scores were determined by light reflectance (AACC Method 14-22.01, 1983), using a Minolta Color Difference Meter (Model CR 410, Minolta Camera Co., Japan). The scores were generated according to the new color map designed by Debbouz (Pasta J. vol 6, No 6, 1994). A spaghetti sample with a score of 8.0 or higher is considered to have good color.\nCOOKED WEIGHT \u2022 10 g of dry spaghetti were palced in 300 ml boiling distilled water and cooked for 12 min. The cooked and drained spaghetti sample was weighed and the results were reported in grams.\nCOOKING LOSS \u2022 AACC Method 66-50.01. Solids lost to the cooking water. After drying the residue was weighed and reported as percentage of the original dry sample.\nFIRMNESS \u2022 AACC Method 66-50.01 with a Plexiglass tooth attached to a Texture Analyzer (Model TA-XT2, Texture Technology Corp., Scarsdale, New York).\n2024 U.S. durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Funding & Support Provided by: U.S. Wheat Associates North Dakota Wheat Commission Montana Wheat and Barley Committees North Dakota State University Plant Sciences Department",

Its density, combined with its high protein content and gluten strength, make durum the wheat of choice for producing premium pasta and couscous products. Pasta made from durum is firm with consistent cooking quality. Du-rum kernels are amber colored and larger than those of other wheat classes. Also unique to durum is its yellow endosperm, which gives pasta its golden hue and the best color for couscous.\nWhen durum is milled, the endosperm is ground into a granular product called semolina. A mixture of water and semolina forms a stiff dough. Pasta dough is then forced through dies, or metal discs with holes, to create hundreds of different shapes.\nDurum production is geographically concentrated to the Northern Plains because it demands a special agronomic environment. In most years, the states of North Dakota and Montana produce 90 percent of the U.S. durum crop.\nTable of Contents AVERAGE SHARE OF U.S. DURUM EXPORTS BY PORT (2020-2023) LAKES 45% GULF 49% PNW 6% Montana North Dakota 3 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Overview The 2024 Northern Durum production was 23% higher than last year at 71 million bushels (1.9 MMT). Planted area was 35% higher than last year and average yields reached record levels in North Dakota, but were reduced in Montana due to hot, dry conditions Field conditions were mostly good at planting time with decent moisture. Cool weather at the beginning of the growing season promoted plant growth and yield potential. The latter part of the growing season produced hotter, drier conditions which stressed the crop in western areas. Disease pressure was minimal to non-existent in the major production areas. Harvest was done under mostly dry conditions with few quality issues. Spotty rains in parts of the region did cause some color loss. Growing season weather differed by region, causing greater than typical variance in yields and some crop quality parameters. This year\u2019s crop GRADES a No. 1 Hard Amber Durum with 38% of the crop making that top grade. This crop shows a bit wider grade distribution due to some samples with lower test weight or higher damage. Vitreous kernel content at 83% is higher than last year and the same as the five-year average. Average test weight in this year\u2019s crop trended slightly lower at 60.8 lbs./bu. (79.2 kg/hl). While nearly two-thirds of the crop has test weight of 60 lbs./bu. or higher, there is a larger percent of the crop with some lower test weights due to late season heat and drought stress. Damage, at 0.6% is slightly higher than 2023, but lower than the five-year average. Average moisture of the crop is 12.2%, higher than last year and average due to wetter growing and harvest conditions in some areas of the production region.\nPROTEIN in this year\u2019s crop is notably higher at a 14.3% average, with exceptionally high protein in Montana, where growing conditions were more stressful to the crop. There is still quite a bit of variabil-ity in the protein, with larger percentages of this year\u2019s crop in both the very high and very low ranges. The majority of the crop has protein that is 13.0% or higher. THOUSAND KERNEL WEIGHTS are lower this year at 35.5 grams, versus 40.9 in 2023. Smaller kernels are the result of hot, dry growing conditions in western areas. Falling number values are very sound in this year\u2019s crop with an average 463 seconds. DON levels are once again generally low at <0.5 ppm for a crop average, but a small portion of samples did show above average levels, primarily in the lower production eastern areas. MILLING for the 2024 survey samples was performed on a Quadromat Junior mill, similar to the last five years, and is not indicative of commercial milling performance. Semolina extraction is significantly higher at 60.7%, nearly 5% above the average. Semolina color values are similar to last year and the five-year average with the b-value at 30.0. Ash is higher than last year at 0.68% and speck counts are lower. Protein in the flour average 12.3%, similar to last year. Protein loss in the milling process was slightly higher at 2%, likely due to more of the protein being stored in the bran and some areas of small, thin kernels.\nDOUGH STRENGTH parameters indicated strength very similar to last year and what is typical of an average durum crop. Dry spaghetti evaluations reveal a crop with slightly lower color scores, low-er cooked weight, but improved cooked firmness.\nThe 2024 crop has many positive attributes including high protein, a high grade profile, low damage, sound kernels, high vitreous kernel content, and a crop with good pasta quality performance. As is normal for most crop years, buyers should be aware of variance in all quality parameters, especially grades, test weight and protein, and adjust contract specifications as needed. The performance of the crop is typical of an average Northern Durum crop and should meet buyers\u2019 specifications. 2024 Production Data 2024 2023 2019-23 AVERAGE MILLION BUSHELS Montana 19.8 20.9 19.6 North Dakota 51.5 32.0 28.8 U.S. Total 80.1 59.3 56.1 MILLION METRIC TON Montana 0.54 0.57 0.53 North Dakota 1.40 0.85 0.78 U.S. Total 2.18 1.61 1.53 Source: USDA 2024 Small Grains Summary 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report 4 Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Seasonal Conditions - 2024 0 20 40 60 80 100 Planted 24 5 Yr Avg Planted 23 ND PLANTING PROGRESS Apr 21 Apr 28 May 5 May 12 May 19 June 2 Percent May 26 0 20 40 60 80 100 Harvest 24 5 Yr Avg Harvest 23 ND HARVEST PROGRESS Aug 25 Sept 1 Sept 8 Sept 15 Sept 23 Percent Sept 29 approximate share of regional production A 5% Montana North Dakota B 23% A 42% B 11% C 6% D 13% PLANTING of the Northern Durum crop started well ahead of average due to milder weather and limited snowfall over the winter. While some drier conditions persisted in early spring, mois-ture conditions at planting were much improved from previous years and some spring rain helped improved soil moisture conditions. There were very few planting delays and the majority of the crop was planted by early June. The crop EMERGED under mostly favorable conditions. Early development benefited from pre-cipitation and cooler temperatures and strong yield potential was predicted. As the growing season progressed, precipitation became more limited. Conditions became drier, and combined with hot temperatures, the crop was stressed in portions of western North Dakota and Montana. These condi-tions adversely affected yield potential. Production areas further east saw more adequate moisture which helped maintain overall good yield potential. Disease pressure was low. HARVEST began in early August, ahead of average. Conditions were mostly dry, with minimal delays. There were spotty areas of rainfall at harvest, which did cause some quality impacts, but overall harvest progress was fairly smooth. North Dakota saw good yields, while Montana had lower yields due to hotter, drier growing conditions. Harvest progress was slightly ahead of average and mostly finished by the end of September.\nPRODUCTION of this year\u2019s crop is estimat-ed at 80 million bushels, an increase of over 35% from the previous year due to a sizeable increase in planted acreage and higher yields in eastern production regions.\n5 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Wheat Characteristics WHEAT GRADES as defined by the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) of the USDA Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), reflect the general quality and condition of a representative sample. U.S. grades are based on test weight and include limits on damaged kernels, for-eign material, shrunken and broken kernels, and wheat of contrasting classes. Each determination is made on the basis of the grain when free from dockage and shrunken and broken kernels.\nSUBCLASS is as separate marketing factor based on the number of kernels that are dark, hard and vitreous. For durum wheat, the subclasses are: \u2022 Hard Amber Durum (HAD) \u2013 at least 75 percent or more hard, vitreous kernels; \u2022 Amber Durum (AD) \u2013 between 60 and 74 percent hard, vitreous kernels; \u2022 Durum (D) \u2013 less than 60 percent hard, vitreous kernels.\nU.S. sample grade is wheat that: a. Does not meet the requirements for U.S. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5; or b. Has a musty, sour or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or c. Is heating or of distinctly low quality.\n1. Includes damaged kernels (total), foreign material and shrunk-en and broken kernels.\n2. Unclassed wheat of any grade may contain not more than 10.0 percent of wheat of other classes.\n3. Includes contrasting classes.\n4.

Millers can control spec count by selecting durum that is free of disease and foreign material, thoroughly clean-ing the durum, properly tempering and conditioning the wheat before milling, and by using purifiers to remove small bran particles from the semolina.\nPROTEIN CONTENT in semolina has a high correlation with gluten content and, in turn, mechanical strength and cooking quality.

In the early days of the pasta industry, before sophisticated testing evolved, consumers assumed that a yellow pasta was made from durum wheat, which is known to make pasta with superior cooking quality compared to that made from other hard wheats.\nMost consumers prefer pasta that is \u201cal dente,\u201d meaning it has some firmness to the bite. Good quality pasta that is cooked according to package directions should not be sticky or mushy when eaten.\n2024 Semolina & Spaghetti data STATE AND CROP REPORTING AREA SEMOLINA COLOR L (BLACK-WHITE) SEMOLINA COLOR A (GREEN-RED) SEMOLINA COLOR B (BLUE-YELLOW) SPAGHETTI COLOR L (BLACK-WHITE) SPAGHETTI COLOR A (GREEN-RED) SPAGHETTI COLOR B (BLUE-YELLOW) SPAGHETTI COOKED WEIGHT G SPAGHETTI COOKING LOSS % SPAGHETTI COOKED FIRMNESS G CM MONTANA Area A 80.5 -2.7 30.8 50.5 3.7 24.1 30.5 7.1 7.2 Area B 80.8 -2.8 30.3 51.2 3.6 23.4 29.8 6.7 7.6 State Avg. 2024 80.8 -2.8 30.4 51.1 3.6 23.5 29.9 6.8 7.5 State Avg. 2023 83.3 -2.5 30.6 52.9 2.9 25.8 31.8 7.3 4.1 NORTH DAKOTA Area A 81.4 -3.2 30.5 52.3 2.9 24.1 30.2 7.5 6.4 Area B 80.8 -3.1 29.1 52.0 2.8 23.4 30.9 8.2 6.0 Area C 81.2 -3.1 27.4 52.8 2.9 23.1 31.0 6.6 6.0 Area D 81.5 -3.2 29.4 51.9 3.3 24.2 28.8 6.4 6.6 State Avg. 2024 81.3 -3.2 29.9 52.2 3.0 23.9 30.1 7.3 6.3 State Avg. 2023 83.4 -2.6 29.7 53.7 2.9 25.3 31.6 7.4 3.8 REGION AVERAGE Avg. 2024 81.1 -3.1 30.0 51.9 3.1 23.8 30.1 7.2 6.7 Avg. 2023 83.4 -2.5 30.1 53.3 2.9 25.5 31.6 7.3 3.9 Five-Year Avg 83.3 -2.4 30.2 53.3 3.1 25.4 31.4 7.3 4.1 Montana North Dakota 2024 Average cooked firmness by Area A 7.2 (G CM) B 7.6 A 6.4 B 6.0 C 60 D 6.6 11 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report * Semolina color performed on CIE color scale.

These samples reflect the condition of the grain at the point of origin. Collection began in mid August and continued through the end of September. A total of 251 samples were collected from Montana (86) and North Dakota (165).\nMethods, terms and Symbols - WHEAT SAMPLE COLLECTION \u2022 Each sample contained approximately 2 to 3 pounds of wheat, stored in securely closed, moisture proof plastic bags.\nMOISTURE \u2022 Official USDA procedure using Motomco Moisture Meter.\nGRADE \u2022 Official United States Standards for Grain, as determined by a licensed grain inspec-tor. North Dakota Grain Inspection service, Devils Lake, ND, provided grades for composite wheat samples representing each crop reporting area.\nVITREOUS KERNELS \u2022 Approximate percentage of kernels having vitreous endosperm, based on weights.\nDOCKAGE \u2022 Official USDA procedure. All matter other than wheat which can be removed readily from a test portion of the original sample by use of an approved device (Carter Dockage Tester). TEST WEIGHT \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists Mothod 55-10.01 approved April 1961, revised October 1999. Measured as pounds per bushel (lb/bu), kilograms per hectoliter (kg/hl) = (lbs/bu X 1.292) + 0.630. Approved Methods of the ANALYSIS \u2022 Half of the total wheat samples col-lected were analyzed for grad and other physical kernel characteristics. The data obtained from the analyses was used to generate frequency distributions as a percentage of the harvested crop. Distribution results may differ from the data presented in the various tables, because the latter are derived from production adjusted averages, rather than simple averages. All samples received in the laboratory were sub-sampled to obtain one composite sample for each of the four areas in North Dakota and one composite each of two areas for Montana. These were analyzed for grade and physical characteristics as well as milling performance and spaghetti processing qualities. Again, all state and regional averages have been adjusted to reflect production as opposed to simple averaging.\nAmerican Association of Cereal Chemists, Cereal Laboratory Methods (10th edition), St. Paul, MN (2000) THOUSAND KERNEL WEIGHT \u2022 Based on 10 gram sample of cleaned wheat (free of foreign material and broken kernels) counted by electronic seed counter.\nKERNEL SIZE DISTRIBUTION \u2022 Determinations made according to the procedure described in Cereal Science Today 5:(3), 71 (1960). Kernels re-maining over a Tyler No. 7 (2.92 mm opening) are classified as \u201clarge;\u201d kernels passing through the top sieve but remaining on a Tyler No. 9 (2.24 mm opening) are classified as \u201cmedium\u201d size kernels. Kernels passing through the second sieve are classed as \u201csmall.\u201d Size is reported as percentage of large, medium, and small kernels.\nPROTEIN \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC) Method: 46-30.01 (Combustion Method), expressed on dry basis and 12 percent moisture basis.\nASH \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists Method 08-01.01, approved April 1961, revised Octo-ber 1999; expressed on a 14 percent moisture basis.\nU.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Montana North Dakota 15 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report DON \u2022 Analysis was done on ground wheat using a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector as described in J.

WET GLUTEN \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists Method 38-12.01, approved October 1999; expressed on a 14 percent moisture basis determined with the glutomatic instrument.\nGLUTEN INDEX \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists Method 38-12-02, approved October 1999; determined with the glutomatic instrument as an indication of gluten strength.\nSemolina EXTRACTION \u2022 Durum tempered to 15.5% moisture and milled on a Brabender Quadrumat Jr mill configured to mill semolina. ASH \u2022 AACC Method 08-01.01, approved April 1961, revised October 1999; expressed on a 14 percent moisture basis.\nPROTEIN \u2022 AACC Method 46-30.01 (combustion method), approved September 1995, revised October 1999, N x 5.7, expressed on a 14 percent moisture basis.\nSPECKS \u2022 The number of specks in semolina was determined on a flat surface under a constant light source, and counting the visible specks (brown and black particles) in three different one-inch square areas. The average of the three readings was converted to the number of specks per 10 square inches.\nGLUTOPEAK \u2022 Glutopeak is a shear-based device that measures the aggregation behavior of gluten. Flour and solvent are mixed at a constant speed with a rotating paddle, resulting in the separation of gluten and aggregation. The gluten aggregate mass exerts a resistance force on the paddle, and creates a torque curve. The curve records the complexity of aggregation and gluten breakdown, measured as Peak Maximum Time (PMT, in seconds), and the Maximum Torque (MT, in Brabender equiva-lents (BE)).\nNDSU laboratory procedure: The semolina sample (8.5 g, 14% mb) was placed in 9.5 g solution of 0.5mol L-1 CaCI2. e temperature at 350C. The mixing paddle was set to rotate at 2,750 rpm and the test was run for 5 min at 35C.\nSpaghetti PROCESSING \u2022 Pasta was made using the laboratory procedure described by Walsh, Ebeling, and Dick, Cereal Sci. Today: 16(11) 385, 1971. A 1-Kg semolina was mixed with the appropriate amount of water that gave a dough consistency of 32 percent total water absorption. The other processing conditions used were: Water temperature, 40 C, extruder shaft speed, 25 rpm and vacuum, 18 in. HG; the dough was pressed through an 84-strand teflon-coated spaghetti die with 0.157 cm openings. The extruded spaghetti samples were dried at high temperature for 12 hrs, using maximum temperature and relative humidity of 73 C and 83 percent, respectively.\nCOLOR \u2022 Color scores were determined by light reflectance (AACC Method 14-22.01, 1983), using a Minolta Color Difference Meter (Model CR 410, Minolta Camera Co., Japan). The scores were generated according to the new color map designed by Debbouz (Pasta J. vol 6, No 6, 1994). A spaghetti sample with a score of 8.0 or higher is considered to have good color.\nCOOKED WEIGHT \u2022 10 g of dry spaghetti were palced in 300 ml boiling distilled water and cooked for 12 min. The cooked and drained spaghetti sample was weighed and the results were reported in grams.\nCOOKING LOSS \u2022 AACC Method 66-50.01. Solids lost to the cooking water. After drying the residue was weighed and reported as percentage of the original dry sample.\nFIRMNESS \u2022 AACC Method 66-50.01 with a Plexiglass tooth attached to a Texture Analyzer (Model TA-XT2, Texture Technology Corp., Scarsdale, New York).\n2024 U.S. durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Funding & Support Provided by: U.S. Wheat Associates North Dakota Wheat Commission Montana Wheat and Barley Committees North Dakota State University Plant Sciences Department"

Its density, combined with its high protein content and gluten strength, make durum the wheat of choice for producing premium pasta and couscous products. Pasta made from durum is firm with consistent cooking quality. Du-rum kernels are amber colored and larger than those of other wheat classes. Also unique to durum is its yellow endosperm, which gives pasta its golden hue and the best color for couscous.\nWhen durum is milled, the endosperm is ground into a granular product called semolina. A mixture of water and semolina forms a stiff dough. Pasta dough is then forced through dies, or metal discs with holes, to create hundreds of different shapes.\nDurum production is geographically concentrated to the Northern Plains because it demands a special agronomic environment. In most years, the states of North Dakota and Montana produce 90 percent of the U.S. durum crop.\nTable of Contents AVERAGE SHARE OF U.S. DURUM EXPORTS BY PORT (2020-2023) LAKES 45% GULF 49% PNW 6% Montana North Dakota 3 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Overview The 2024 Northern Durum production was 23% higher than last year at 71 million bushels (1.9 MMT). Planted area was 35% higher than last year and average yields reached record levels in North Dakota, but were reduced in Montana due to hot, dry conditions Field conditions were mostly good at planting time with decent moisture. Cool weather at the beginning of the growing season promoted plant growth and yield potential. The latter part of the growing season produced hotter, drier conditions which stressed the crop in western areas. Disease pressure was minimal to non-existent in the major production areas. Harvest was done under mostly dry conditions with few quality issues. Spotty rains in parts of the region did cause some color loss. Growing season weather differed by region, causing greater than typical variance in yields and some crop quality parameters. This year\u2019s crop GRADES a No. 1 Hard Amber Durum with 38% of the crop making that top grade. This crop shows a bit wider grade distribution due to some samples with lower test weight or higher damage. Vitreous kernel content at 83% is higher than last year and the same as the five-year average. Average test weight in this year\u2019s crop trended slightly lower at 60.8 lbs./bu. (79.2 kg/hl). While nearly two-thirds of the crop has test weight of 60 lbs./bu. or higher, there is a larger percent of the crop with some lower test weights due to late season heat and drought stress. Damage, at 0.6% is slightly higher than 2023, but lower than the five-year average. Average moisture of the crop is 12.2%, higher than last year and average due to wetter growing and harvest conditions in some areas of the production region.\nPROTEIN in this year\u2019s crop is notably higher at a 14.3% average, with exceptionally high protein in Montana, where growing conditions were more stressful to the crop. There is still quite a bit of variabil-ity in the protein, with larger percentages of this year\u2019s crop in both the very high and very low ranges. The majority of the crop has protein that is 13.0% or higher. THOUSAND KERNEL WEIGHTS are lower this year at 35.5 grams, versus 40.9 in 2023. Smaller kernels are the result of hot, dry growing conditions in western areas. Falling number values are very sound in this year\u2019s crop with an average 463 seconds. DON levels are once again generally low at <0.5 ppm for a crop average, but a small portion of samples did show above average levels, primarily in the lower production eastern areas. MILLING for the 2024 survey samples was performed on a Quadromat Junior mill, similar to the last five years, and is not indicative of commercial milling performance. Semolina extraction is significantly higher at 60.7%, nearly 5% above the average. Semolina color values are similar to last year and the five-year average with the b-value at 30.0. Ash is higher than last year at 0.68% and speck counts are lower. Protein in the flour average 12.3%, similar to last year. Protein loss in the milling process was slightly higher at 2%, likely due to more of the protein being stored in the bran and some areas of small, thin kernels.\nDOUGH STRENGTH parameters indicated strength very similar to last year and what is typical of an average durum crop. Dry spaghetti evaluations reveal a crop with slightly lower color scores, low-er cooked weight, but improved cooked firmness.\nThe 2024 crop has many positive attributes including high protein, a high grade profile, low damage, sound kernels, high vitreous kernel content, and a crop with good pasta quality performance. As is normal for most crop years, buyers should be aware of variance in all quality parameters, especially grades, test weight and protein, and adjust contract specifications as needed. The performance of the crop is typical of an average Northern Durum crop and should meet buyers\u2019 specifications. 2024 Production Data 2024 2023 2019-23 AVERAGE MILLION BUSHELS Montana 19.8 20.9 19.6 North Dakota 51.5 32.0 28.8 U.S. Total 80.1 59.3 56.1 MILLION METRIC TON Montana 0.54 0.57 0.53 North Dakota 1.40 0.85 0.78 U.S. Total 2.18 1.61 1.53 Source: USDA 2024 Small Grains Summary 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report 4 Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Seasonal Conditions - 2024 0 20 40 60 80 100 Planted 24 5 Yr Avg Planted 23 ND PLANTING PROGRESS Apr 21 Apr 28 May 5 May 12 May 19 June 2 Percent May 26 0 20 40 60 80 100 Harvest 24 5 Yr Avg Harvest 23 ND HARVEST PROGRESS Aug 25 Sept 1 Sept 8 Sept 15 Sept 23 Percent Sept 29 approximate share of regional production A 5% Montana North Dakota B 23% A 42% B 11% C 6% D 13% PLANTING of the Northern Durum crop started well ahead of average due to milder weather and limited snowfall over the winter. While some drier conditions persisted in early spring, mois-ture conditions at planting were much improved from previous years and some spring rain helped improved soil moisture conditions. There were very few planting delays and the majority of the crop was planted by early June. The crop EMERGED under mostly favorable conditions. Early development benefited from pre-cipitation and cooler temperatures and strong yield potential was predicted. As the growing season progressed, precipitation became more limited. Conditions became drier, and combined with hot temperatures, the crop was stressed in portions of western North Dakota and Montana. These condi-tions adversely affected yield potential. Production areas further east saw more adequate moisture which helped maintain overall good yield potential. Disease pressure was low. HARVEST began in early August, ahead of average. Conditions were mostly dry, with minimal delays. There were spotty areas of rainfall at harvest, which did cause some quality impacts, but overall harvest progress was fairly smooth. North Dakota saw good yields, while Montana had lower yields due to hotter, drier growing conditions. Harvest progress was slightly ahead of average and mostly finished by the end of September.\nPRODUCTION of this year\u2019s crop is estimat-ed at 80 million bushels, an increase of over 35% from the previous year due to a sizeable increase in planted acreage and higher yields in eastern production regions.\n5 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Wheat Characteristics WHEAT GRADES as defined by the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) of the USDA Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), reflect the general quality and condition of a representative sample. U.S. grades are based on test weight and include limits on damaged kernels, for-eign material, shrunken and broken kernels, and wheat of contrasting classes. Each determination is made on the basis of the grain when free from dockage and shrunken and broken kernels.\nSUBCLASS is as separate marketing factor based on the number of kernels that are dark, hard and vitreous. For durum wheat, the subclasses are: \u2022 Hard Amber Durum (HAD) \u2013 at least 75 percent or more hard, vitreous kernels; \u2022 Amber Durum (AD) \u2013 between 60 and 74 percent hard, vitreous kernels; \u2022 Durum (D) \u2013 less than 60 percent hard, vitreous kernels.\nU.S. sample grade is wheat that: a. Does not meet the requirements for U.S. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5; or b. Has a musty, sour or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or c. Is heating or of distinctly low quality.\n1. Includes damaged kernels (total), foreign material and shrunk-en and broken kernels.\n2. Unclassed wheat of any grade may contain not more than 10.0 percent of wheat of other classes.\n3. Includes contrasting classes.\n4. Includes any combination of animal filth, castor beans, crota-laria seeds, glass, stones or unknown foreign substance.\n2024 Production Data U.S. GRADES GRADING FACTORS 1 2 3 4 5 DURUM - MINIMUM TEST WEIGHTS Pounds per bushel 60.0 58.0 56.0 54.1 51.0 Kilograms per hectoliter 78.2 75.6 73.0 70.4 66.5 MAXIMUM PERCENT LIMITS OF: Damaged kernels Heat (part of total) 0.2 0.2 0.0 1.0 3.0 Total 2.0 4.0 7.0 10.0 15.0 Foreign material 0.4 0.7 1.3 3.0 5.0 Shrunken/broken kernels 3.0 5.0 8.0 12.0 20.0 Total 3.0 5.0 8.0 12.0 20.0 Wheat of other class2 Contracting classes 1.0 2.0 3.0 10.0 20.0 Total1 3.0 5.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 Stones 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 MAXIMUM COUNT LIMITS OF: Other material Animal filth 1 1 1 1 1 Castor beans 1 1 1 1 1 Crotalaria seeds 2 2 2 2 2 Glass 0 0 0 0 0 Stones 3 3 3 3 3 Unknown foreign material 3 3 3 3 3 Total4 4 4 4 4 4 Insect-damaged kernels 31 31 31 31 31 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report 6 Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 2024 Avg.

Millers can control spec count by selecting durum that is free of disease and foreign material, thoroughly clean-ing the durum, properly tempering and conditioning the wheat before milling, and by using purifiers to remove small bran particles from the semolina.\nPROTEIN CONTENT in semolina has a high correlation with gluten content and, in turn, mechanical strength and cooking quality. Wet gluten is a quan-titative measure of the gluten forming proteins in semolina that are primarily responsible for its mechanical strength and pasta quality.\n2024 Semolina quality data GLUTOPEAK STATE AND CROP REPORTING AREA SEMOLINA EXTRACTION % ASH % SPECKS NO/10 SQ IN % PROTEIN (14% MOISTURE) % WET GLUTEN % GLUTEN INDEX % PEAK TIME SEC MAX TORQUE BE MONTANA Area A 60.9 0.72 20 13.2 35.0 97 207 48 Area B 55.9 0.72 17 14.1 36.1 84 120 55 State Avg. 2024 56.8 0.72 18 14.0 35.9 86 136 54 State Avg. 2023 50.1 0.67 24 12.9 34.1 88 174 41 NORTH DAKOTA Area A 62.4 0.65 27 11.6 30.2 89 164 43 Area B 63.6 0.72 30 11.2 29.9 90 158 42 Area C 62.3 0.70 35 11.0 27.7 96 141 39 Area D 60.2 0.65 25 12.4 31.3 89 180 44 State Avg. 2024 62.2 0.66 28 11.7 30.1 90 164 43 State Avg. 2023 53.4 0.61 28 12.1 30.7 93 183 41 REGION AVERAGE Avg. 2024 60.7 0.68 25 12.3 31.7 89 156 46 Avg. 2023 52.0 0.63 27 12.4 32.1 91 179 41 Five-Year Avg 55.3 0.63 27 12.6 33.8 77 175 41 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report 10 Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report DRY PASTA PROCESSORS want a finished product that is visually appealing, elastic and strong enough to resist breakage during cutting, packaging, handling and shipping, able to withstand the rigors of cooking, and satisfying to the consumer palate.\nYellow color in semolina and pasta is a traditional, rather than functional, mark of quality. In the early days of the pasta industry, before sophisticated testing evolved, consumers assumed that a yellow pasta was made from durum wheat, which is known to make pasta with superior cooking quality compared to that made from other hard wheats.\nMost consumers prefer pasta that is \u201cal dente,\u201d meaning it has some firmness to the bite.

These samples reflect the condition of the grain at the point of origin. Collection began in mid August and continued through the end of September. A total of 251 samples were collected from Montana (86) and North Dakota (165).\nMethods, terms and Symbols - WHEAT SAMPLE COLLECTION \u2022 Each sample contained approximately 2 to 3 pounds of wheat, stored in securely closed, moisture proof plastic bags.\nMOISTURE \u2022 Official USDA procedure using Motomco Moisture Meter.\nGRADE \u2022 Official United States Standards for Grain, as determined by a licensed grain inspec-tor.

Measured as pounds per bushel (lb/bu), kilograms per hectoliter (kg/hl) = (lbs/bu X 1.292) + 0.630. Approved Methods of the ANALYSIS \u2022 Half of the total wheat samples col-lected were analyzed for grad and other physical kernel characteristics. The data obtained from the analyses was used to generate frequency distributions as a percentage of the harvested crop. Distribution results may differ from the data presented in the various tables, because the latter are derived from production adjusted averages, rather than simple averages. All samples received in the laboratory were sub-sampled to obtain one composite sample for each of the four areas in North Dakota and one composite each of two areas for Montana. These were analyzed for grade and physical characteristics as well as milling performance and spaghetti processing qualities. Again, all state and regional averages have been adjusted to reflect production as opposed to simple averaging.\nAmerican Association of Cereal Chemists, Cereal Laboratory Methods (10th edition), St. Paul, MN (2000) THOUSAND KERNEL WEIGHT \u2022 Based on 10 gram sample of cleaned wheat (free of foreign material and broken kernels) counted by electronic seed counter.\nKERNEL SIZE DISTRIBUTION \u2022 Determinations made according to the procedure described in Cereal Science Today 5:(3), 71 (1960).

The average of the three readings was converted to the number of specks per 10 square inches.\nGLUTOPEAK \u2022 Glutopeak is a shear-based device that measures the aggregation behavior of gluten. Flour and solvent are mixed at a constant speed with a rotating paddle, resulting in the separation of gluten and aggregation. The gluten aggregate mass exerts a resistance force on the paddle, and creates a torque curve. The curve records the complexity of aggregation and gluten breakdown, measured as Peak Maximum Time (PMT, in seconds), and the Maximum Torque (MT, in Brabender equiva-lents (BE)).\nNDSU laboratory procedure: The semolina sample (8.5 g, 14% mb) was placed in 9.5 g solution of 0.5mol L-1 CaCI2. e temperature at 350C. The mixing paddle was set to rotate at 2,750 rpm and the test was run for 5 min at 35C.\nSpaghetti PROCESSING \u2022 Pasta was made using the laboratory procedure described by Walsh, Ebeling, and Dick, Cereal Sci. Today: 16(11) 385, 1971. A 1-Kg semolina was mixed with the appropriate amount of water that gave a dough consistency of 32 percent total water absorption. The other processing conditions used were: Water temperature, 40 C, extruder shaft speed, 25 rpm and vacuum, 18 in. HG; the dough was pressed through an 84-strand teflon-coated spaghetti die with 0.157 cm openings. The extruded spaghetti samples were dried at high temperature for 12 hrs, using maximum temperature and relative humidity of 73 C and 83 percent, respectively.\nCOLOR \u2022 Color scores were determined by light reflectance (AACC Method 14-22.01, 1983), using a Minolta Color Difference Meter (Model CR 410, Minolta Camera Co., Japan). The scores were generated according to the new color map designed by Debbouz (Pasta J. vol 6, No 6, 1994). A spaghetti sample with a score of 8.0 or higher is considered to have good color.\nCOOKED WEIGHT \u2022 10 g of dry spaghetti were palced in 300 ml boiling distilled water and cooked for 12 min. The cooked and drained spaghetti sample was weighed and the results were reported in grams.\nCOOKING LOSS \u2022 AACC Method 66-50.01. Solids lost to the cooking water. After drying the residue was weighed and reported as percentage of the original dry sample.\nFIRMNESS \u2022 AACC Method 66-50.01 with a Plexiglass tooth attached to a Texture Analyzer (Model TA-XT2, Texture Technology Corp., Scarsdale, New York).\n2024 U.S. durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Funding & Support Provided by: U.S. Wheat Associates North Dakota Wheat Commission Montana Wheat and Barley Committees North Dakota State University Plant Sciences Department",

Its density, combined with its high protein content and gluten strength, make durum the wheat of choice for producing premium pasta and couscous products. Pasta made from durum is firm with consistent cooking quality. Du-rum kernels are amber colored and larger than those of other wheat classes. Also unique to durum is its yellow endosperm, which gives pasta its golden hue and the best color for couscous.\nWhen durum is milled, the endosperm is ground into a granular product called semolina. A mixture of water and semolina forms a stiff dough. Pasta dough is then forced through dies, or metal discs with holes, to create hundreds of different shapes.\nDurum production is geographically concentrated to the Northern Plains because it demands a special agronomic environment. In most years, the states of North Dakota and Montana produce 90 percent of the U.S. durum crop.\nTable of Contents AVERAGE SHARE OF U.S. DURUM EXPORTS BY PORT (2020-2023) LAKES 45% GULF 49% PNW 6% Montana North Dakota 3 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Overview The 2024 Northern Durum production was 23% higher than last year at 71 million bushels (1.9 MMT). Planted area was 35% higher than last year and average yields reached record levels in North Dakota, but were reduced in Montana due to hot, dry conditions Field conditions were mostly good at planting time with decent moisture. Cool weather at the beginning of the growing season promoted plant growth and yield potential. The latter part of the growing season produced hotter, drier conditions which stressed the crop in western areas. Disease pressure was minimal to non-existent in the major production areas. Harvest was done under mostly dry conditions with few quality issues. Spotty rains in parts of the region did cause some color loss. Growing season weather differed by region, causing greater than typical variance in yields and some crop quality parameters. This year\u2019s crop GRADES a No. 1 Hard Amber Durum with 38% of the crop making that top grade. This crop shows a bit wider grade distribution due to some samples with lower test weight or higher damage. Vitreous kernel content at 83% is higher than last year and the same as the five-year average. Average test weight in this year\u2019s crop trended slightly lower at 60.8 lbs./bu. (79.2 kg/hl). While nearly two-thirds of the crop has test weight of 60 lbs./bu. or higher, there is a larger percent of the crop with some lower test weights due to late season heat and drought stress. Damage, at 0.6% is slightly higher than 2023, but lower than the five-year average. Average moisture of the crop is 12.2%, higher than last year and average due to wetter growing and harvest conditions in some areas of the production region.\nPROTEIN in this year\u2019s crop is notably higher at a 14.3% average, with exceptionally high protein in Montana, where growing conditions were more stressful to the crop. There is still quite a bit of variabil-ity in the protein, with larger percentages of this year\u2019s crop in both the very high and very low ranges. The majority of the crop has protein that is 13.0% or higher. THOUSAND KERNEL WEIGHTS are lower this year at 35.5 grams, versus 40.9 in 2023. Smaller kernels are the result of hot, dry growing conditions in western areas. Falling number values are very sound in this year\u2019s crop with an average 463 seconds. DON levels are once again generally low at <0.5 ppm for a crop average, but a small portion of samples did show above average levels, primarily in the lower production eastern areas. MILLING for the 2024 survey samples was performed on a Quadromat Junior mill, similar to the last five years, and is not indicative of commercial milling performance. Semolina extraction is significantly higher at 60.7%, nearly 5% above the average. Semolina color values are similar to last year and the five-year average with the b-value at 30.0. Ash is higher than last year at 0.68% and speck counts are lower. Protein in the flour average 12.3%, similar to last year. Protein loss in the milling process was slightly higher at 2%, likely due to more of the protein being stored in the bran and some areas of small, thin kernels.\nDOUGH STRENGTH parameters indicated strength very similar to last year and what is typical of an average durum crop. Dry spaghetti evaluations reveal a crop with slightly lower color scores, low-er cooked weight, but improved cooked firmness.\nThe 2024 crop has many positive attributes including high protein, a high grade profile, low damage, sound kernels, high vitreous kernel content, and a crop with good pasta quality performance. As is normal for most crop years, buyers should be aware of variance in all quality parameters, especially grades, test weight and protein, and adjust contract specifications as needed. The performance of the crop is typical of an average Northern Durum crop and should meet buyers\u2019 specifications. 2024 Production Data 2024 2023 2019-23 AVERAGE MILLION BUSHELS Montana 19.8 20.9 19.6 North Dakota 51.5 32.0 28.8 U.S. Total 80.1 59.3 56.1 MILLION METRIC TON Montana 0.54 0.57 0.53 North Dakota 1.40 0.85 0.78 U.S. Total 2.18 1.61 1.53 Source: USDA 2024 Small Grains Summary 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report 4 Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Seasonal Conditions - 2024 0 20 40 60 80 100 Planted 24 5 Yr Avg Planted 23 ND PLANTING PROGRESS Apr 21 Apr 28 May 5 May 12 May 19 June 2 Percent May 26 0 20 40 60 80 100 Harvest 24 5 Yr Avg Harvest 23 ND HARVEST PROGRESS Aug 25 Sept 1 Sept 8 Sept 15 Sept 23 Percent Sept 29 approximate share of regional production A 5% Montana North Dakota B 23% A 42% B 11% C 6% D 13% PLANTING of the Northern Durum crop started well ahead of average due to milder weather and limited snowfall over the winter. While some drier conditions persisted in early spring, mois-ture conditions at planting were much improved from previous years and some spring rain helped improved soil moisture conditions. There were very few planting delays and the majority of the crop was planted by early June. The crop EMERGED under mostly favorable conditions. Early development benefited from pre-cipitation and cooler temperatures and strong yield potential was predicted. As the growing season progressed, precipitation became more limited. Conditions became drier, and combined with hot temperatures, the crop was stressed in portions of western North Dakota and Montana. These condi-tions adversely affected yield potential. Production areas further east saw more adequate moisture which helped maintain overall good yield potential. Disease pressure was low. HARVEST began in early August, ahead of average. Conditions were mostly dry, with minimal delays. There were spotty areas of rainfall at harvest, which did cause some quality impacts, but overall harvest progress was fairly smooth. North Dakota saw good yields, while Montana had lower yields due to hotter, drier growing conditions. Harvest progress was slightly ahead of average and mostly finished by the end of September.\nPRODUCTION of this year\u2019s crop is estimat-ed at 80 million bushels, an increase of over 35% from the previous year due to a sizeable increase in planted acreage and higher yields in eastern production regions.\n5 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Wheat Characteristics WHEAT GRADES as defined by the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) of the USDA Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), reflect the general quality and condition of a representative sample. U.S. grades are based on test weight and include limits on damaged kernels, for-eign material, shrunken and broken kernels, and wheat of contrasting classes. Each determination is made on the basis of the grain when free from dockage and shrunken and broken kernels.\nSUBCLASS is as separate marketing factor based on the number of kernels that are dark, hard and vitreous. For durum wheat, the subclasses are: \u2022 Hard Amber Durum (HAD) \u2013 at least 75 percent or more hard, vitreous kernels; \u2022 Amber Durum (AD) \u2013 between 60 and 74 percent hard, vitreous kernels; \u2022 Durum (D) \u2013 less than 60 percent hard, vitreous kernels.\nU.S. sample grade is wheat that: a. Does not meet the requirements for U.S. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5; or b. Has a musty, sour or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or c. Is heating or of distinctly low quality.\n1. Includes damaged kernels (total), foreign material and shrunk-en and broken kernels.\n2. Unclassed wheat of any grade may contain not more than 10.0 percent of wheat of other classes.\n3. Includes contrasting classes.\n4. Includes any combination of animal filth, castor beans, crota-laria seeds, glass, stones or unknown foreign substance.\n2024 Production Data U.S. GRADES GRADING FACTORS 1 2 3 4 5 DURUM - MINIMUM TEST WEIGHTS Pounds per bushel 60.0 58.0 56.0 54.1 51.0 Kilograms per hectoliter 78.2 75.6 73.0 70.4 66.5 MAXIMUM PERCENT LIMITS OF: Damaged kernels Heat (part of total) 0.2 0.2 0.0 1.0 3.0 Total 2.0 4.0 7.0 10.0 15.0 Foreign material 0.4 0.7 1.3 3.0 5.0 Shrunken/broken kernels 3.0 5.0 8.0 12.0 20.0 Total 3.0 5.0 8.0 12.0 20.0 Wheat of other class2 Contracting classes 1.0 2.0 3.0 10.0 20.0 Total1 3.0 5.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 Stones 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 MAXIMUM COUNT LIMITS OF: Other material Animal filth 1 1 1 1 1 Castor beans 1 1 1 1 1 Crotalaria seeds 2 2 2 2 2 Glass 0 0 0 0 0 Stones 3 3 3 3 3 Unknown foreign material 3 3 3 3 3 Total4 4 4 4 4 4 Insect-damaged kernels 31 31 31 31 31 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report 6 Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 2024 Avg.

Millers can control spec count by selecting durum that is free of disease and foreign material, thoroughly clean-ing the durum, properly tempering and conditioning the wheat before milling, and by using purifiers to remove small bran particles from the semolina.\nPROTEIN CONTENT in semolina has a high correlation with gluten content and, in turn, mechanical strength and cooking quality. Wet gluten is a quan-titative measure of the gluten forming proteins in semolina that are primarily responsible for its mechanical strength and pasta quality.\n2024 Semolina quality data GLUTOPEAK STATE AND CROP REPORTING AREA SEMOLINA EXTRACTION % ASH % SPECKS NO/10 SQ IN % PROTEIN (14% MOISTURE) % WET GLUTEN % GLUTEN INDEX % PEAK TIME SEC MAX TORQUE BE MONTANA Area A 60.9 0.72 20 13.2 35.0 97 207 48 Area B 55.9 0.72 17 14.1 36.1 84 120 55 State Avg. 2024 56.8 0.72 18 14.0 35.9 86 136 54 State Avg. 2023 50.1 0.67 24 12.9 34.1 88 174 41 NORTH DAKOTA Area A 62.4 0.65 27 11.6 30.2 89 164 43 Area B 63.6 0.72 30 11.2 29.9 90 158 42 Area C 62.3 0.70 35 11.0 27.7 96 141 39 Area D 60.2 0.65 25 12.4 31.3 89 180 44 State Avg. 2024 62.2 0.66 28 11.7 30.1 90 164 43 State Avg. 2023 53.4 0.61 28 12.1 30.7 93 183 41 REGION AVERAGE Avg. 2024 60.7 0.68 25 12.3 31.7 89 156 46 Avg. 2023 52.0 0.63 27 12.4 32.1 91 179 41 Five-Year Avg 55.3 0.63 27 12.6 33.8 77 175 41 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report 10 Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report DRY PASTA PROCESSORS want a finished product that is visually appealing, elastic and strong enough to resist breakage during cutting, packaging, handling and shipping, able to withstand the rigors of cooking, and satisfying to the consumer palate.\nYellow color in semolina and pasta is a traditional, rather than functional, mark of quality. In the early days of the pasta industry, before sophisticated testing evolved, consumers assumed that a yellow pasta was made from durum wheat, which is known to make pasta with superior cooking quality compared to that made from other hard wheats.\nMost consumers prefer pasta that is \u201cal dente,\u201d meaning it has some firmness to the bite. Good quality pasta that is cooked according to package directions should not be sticky or mushy when eaten.\n2024 Semolina & Spaghetti data STATE AND CROP REPORTING AREA SEMOLINA COLOR L (BLACK-WHITE) SEMOLINA COLOR A (GREEN-RED) SEMOLINA COLOR B (BLUE-YELLOW) SPAGHETTI COLOR L (BLACK-WHITE) SPAGHETTI COLOR A (GREEN-RED) SPAGHETTI COLOR B (BLUE-YELLOW) SPAGHETTI COOKED WEIGHT G SPAGHETTI COOKING LOSS % SPAGHETTI COOKED FIRMNESS G CM MONTANA Area A 80.5 -2.7 30.8 50.5 3.7 24.1 30.5 7.1 7.2 Area B 80.8 -2.8 30.3 51.2 3.6 23.4 29.8 6.7 7.6 State Avg. 2024 80.8 -2.8 30.4 51.1 3.6 23.5 29.9 6.8 7.5 State Avg. 2023 83.3 -2.5 30.6 52.9 2.9 25.8 31.8 7.3 4.1 NORTH DAKOTA Area A 81.4 -3.2 30.5 52.3 2.9 24.1 30.2 7.5 6.4 Area B 80.8 -3.1 29.1 52.0 2.8 23.4 30.9 8.2 6.0 Area C 81.2 -3.1 27.4 52.8 2.9 23.1 31.0 6.6 6.0 Area D 81.5 -3.2 29.4 51.9 3.3 24.2 28.8 6.4 6.6 State Avg. 2024 81.3 -3.2 29.9 52.2 3.0 23.9 30.1 7.3 6.3 State Avg. 2023 83.4 -2.6 29.7 53.7 2.9 25.3 31.6 7.4 3.8 REGION AVERAGE Avg. 2024 81.1 -3.1 30.0 51.9 3.1 23.8 30.1 7.2 6.7 Avg. 2023 83.4 -2.5 30.1 53.3 2.9 25.5 31.6 7.3 3.9 Five-Year Avg 83.3 -2.4 30.2 53.3 3.1 25.4 31.4 7.3 4.1 Montana North Dakota 2024 Average cooked firmness by Area A 7.2 (G CM) B 7.6 A 6.4 B 6.0 C 60 D 6.6 11 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report * Semolina color performed on CIE color scale.

It is the dominant variety produced in the North Central region where it is primarily grown under contracted production. Alzada is a 2004 release from Westbred. It has competitive yields, excellent straw strength, and good sawfly tolerance. Alzada has uniquely strong gluten properties and excellent color scores. DIVIDE is the third most popular variety in Montana with a 12.8 percent acreage share, down from 16.8 percent in 2023. It is the seventh most popular in North Dakota with 3.8 percent of the acres. Divide was released in 2005 from NDSU, and remains popular with producers for its high yield potential and higher relative ratings for disease tolerance. Divide is rated good for end-use quality. montana 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report 14 Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Laboratory Analysis All quality data contained in this report is the result of testing and analysis conducted by or under the supervision of Dr. Frank Manthey, Wheat Quality Specialist and assisted by Cerly Rini Yeruva, Food Technologist Specialist, and James Perleberg, chemist of the Durum Wheat Quality and Pasta Processing Laboratory in the Department of Plant Science at North Dakota State University, Fargo, North Dakota, USA.\nCOLLECTION \u2022 The North Dakota and Montana state offices of the National Agricultural Statis-tics Service obtained durum wheat samples during harvest directly from growers, farm bins and local elevators. These samples reflect the condition of the grain at the point of origin. Collection began in mid August and continued through the end of September. A total of 251 samples were collected from Montana (86) and North Dakota (165).\nMethods, terms and Symbols - WHEAT SAMPLE COLLECTION \u2022 Each sample contained approximately 2 to 3 pounds of wheat, stored in securely closed, moisture proof plastic bags.\nMOISTURE \u2022 Official USDA procedure using Motomco Moisture Meter.\nGRADE \u2022 Official United States Standards for Grain, as determined by a licensed grain inspec-tor. North Dakota Grain Inspection service, Devils Lake, ND, provided grades for composite wheat samples representing each crop reporting area.\nVITREOUS KERNELS \u2022 Approximate percentage of kernels having vitreous endosperm, based on weights.\nDOCKAGE \u2022 Official USDA procedure. All matter other than wheat which can be removed readily from a test portion of the original sample by use of an approved device (Carter Dockage Tester). TEST WEIGHT \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists Mothod 55-10.01 approved April 1961, revised October 1999. Measured as pounds per bushel (lb/bu), kilograms per hectoliter (kg/hl) = (lbs/bu X 1.292) + 0.630. Approved Methods of the ANALYSIS \u2022 Half of the total wheat samples col-lected were analyzed for grad and other physical kernel characteristics. The data obtained from the analyses was used to generate frequency distributions as a percentage of the harvested crop. Distribution results may differ from the data presented in the various tables, because the latter are derived from production adjusted averages, rather than simple averages. All samples received in the laboratory were sub-sampled to obtain one composite sample for each of the four areas in North Dakota and one composite each of two areas for Montana. These were analyzed for grade and physical characteristics as well as milling performance and spaghetti processing qualities. Again, all state and regional averages have been adjusted to reflect production as opposed to simple averaging.\nAmerican Association of Cereal Chemists, Cereal Laboratory Methods (10th edition), St. Paul, MN (2000) THOUSAND KERNEL WEIGHT \u2022 Based on 10 gram sample of cleaned wheat (free of foreign material and broken kernels) counted by electronic seed counter.\nKERNEL SIZE DISTRIBUTION \u2022 Determinations made according to the procedure described in Cereal Science Today 5:(3), 71 (1960). Kernels re-maining over a Tyler No. 7 (2.92 mm opening) are classified as \u201clarge;\u201d kernels passing through the top sieve but remaining on a Tyler No. 9 (2.24 mm opening) are classified as \u201cmedium\u201d size kernels. Kernels passing through the second sieve are classed as \u201csmall.\u201d Size is reported as percentage of large, medium, and small kernels.\nPROTEIN \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC) Method: 46-30.01 (Combustion Method), expressed on dry basis and 12 percent moisture basis.\nASH \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists Method 08-01.01, approved April 1961, revised Octo-ber 1999; expressed on a 14 percent moisture basis.\nU.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Montana North Dakota 15 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report DON \u2022 Analysis was done on ground wheat using a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector as described in J.

The average of the three readings was converted to the number of specks per 10 square inches.\nGLUTOPEAK \u2022 Glutopeak is a shear-based device that measures the aggregation behavior of gluten. Flour and solvent are mixed at a constant speed with a rotating paddle, resulting in the separation of gluten and aggregation. The gluten aggregate mass exerts a resistance force on the paddle, and creates a torque curve. The curve records the complexity of aggregation and gluten breakdown, measured as Peak Maximum Time (PMT, in seconds), and the Maximum Torque (MT, in Brabender equiva-lents (BE)).\nNDSU laboratory procedure: The semolina sample (8.5 g, 14% mb) was placed in 9.5 g solution of 0.5mol L-1 CaCI2. e temperature at 350C. The mixing paddle was set to rotate at 2,750 rpm and the test was run for 5 min at 35C.\nSpaghetti PROCESSING \u2022 Pasta was made using the laboratory procedure described by Walsh, Ebeling, and Dick, Cereal Sci. Today: 16(11) 385, 1971. A 1-Kg semolina was mixed with the appropriate amount of water that gave a dough consistency of 32 percent total water absorption. The other processing conditions used were: Water temperature, 40 C, extruder shaft speed, 25 rpm and vacuum, 18 in. HG; the dough was pressed through an 84-strand teflon-coated spaghetti die with 0.157 cm openings. The extruded spaghetti samples were dried at high temperature for 12 hrs, using maximum temperature and relative humidity of 73 C and 83 percent, respectively.\nCOLOR \u2022 Color scores were determined by light reflectance (AACC Method 14-22.01, 1983), using a Minolta Color Difference Meter (Model CR 410, Minolta Camera Co., Japan). The scores were generated according to the new color map designed by Debbouz (Pasta J. vol 6, No 6, 1994). A spaghetti sample with a score of 8.0 or higher is considered to have good color.\nCOOKED WEIGHT \u2022 10 g of dry spaghetti were palced in 300 ml boiling distilled water and cooked for 12 min. The cooked and drained spaghetti sample was weighed and the results were reported in grams.\nCOOKING LOSS \u2022 AACC Method 66-50.01. Solids lost to the cooking water. After drying the residue was weighed and reported as percentage of the original dry sample.\nFIRMNESS \u2022 AACC Method 66-50.01 with a Plexiglass tooth attached to a Texture Analyzer (Model TA-XT2, Texture Technology Corp., Scarsdale, New York).\n2024 U.S. durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Funding & Support Provided by: U.S. Wheat Associates North Dakota Wheat Commission Montana Wheat and Barley Committees North Dakota State University Plant Sciences Department",

In 1949, government payments made up 1.4% of total net farm income \u2014 a measure of profit \u2014 while in 2000 government payments made up 45.8% of such profits.\nIn 2019, farms received $22.6 billion in government payments, representing 20.4% of $111.1 billion in profits.\nAt the center of many of these programs are two arms of the US Department of Agriculture: The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC). The CCC aids farms and takes measures to control the prices of commodities. The FCIC works with private insurers to run the nation\u2019s crop insurance system. Both came out of the Great Depression.\nBoth are also considered mandatory spending in terms of federal budget purposes, meaning their budgets are handled largely outside of the congressional appropriations process. The CCC can borrow up to $30 billion from the US Treasury for its programs that include its long-term programs created through legislation such as farm bills as well as the \u201cMarket Facilitation Program\u201d in response to US-China tariffs implemented in early 2020. Appropriations are used to recoup losses the CCC incurs, allowing it to maintain its borrowing ability from the Treasury.\nBetween 1996 and 2014, the CCC had a direct payment program for farms regardless of how much of a crop is produced. The 2014 farm bill changed how the CCC provided its subsidies, repealing a direct payment system that was based on historical yields but didn\u2019t consider if the producer actually had losses in a given year. The 2014 bill required farmers of a set of crops to choose between two types of subsidy payments: Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC), where payments are based on a commodity\u2019s yield and potential revenue losses, or Price Loss Coverage (PLC), where payments are made to protect against price decreases. The two programs accounted for 60.8% of CCC\u2019s government payments in 2017. (Conservation programs accounted for about a third.)\nThe CCC also provides loans known as marketing assistance loans (MAL) that allow producers to use their commodities as collateral. In some cases, producers may repay their loan at less than the loan principal, known as marketing loan gains (MLG), while others who qualify for a loan and choose not to take one may receive direct payments, or loan deficiency payments (LDP). These two programs are limited to producers making less than $900,000. In 2017, the CCC gave out a net total of $11.9 million of these types of payments, though it gave out $10.4 billion in 2000.\nThe FCIC works with private insurers to provide federal crop insurance. In 2019, 380 million acres of cropland were covered by federal crop insurance. The federal government also pays a portion of the premiums for the policies, covering 63% of the $10.1 billion in premiums in 2019.\nHow subsidies differ by crop\nBased on a required annual report filed with the World Trade Organization, the federal government gave farms $9.5 billion in subsidies tied specifically to the type of product. Corn growers received the most product-specific assistance with $2.2 billion in subsidies. That was only about 4.4% of the $50.4 billion in total corn production that year. Soybeans rank second in subsidies. While the US soybean industry produced $41.3 billion worth of products in 2017, it received $1.6 billion in subsidies in 2016, representing 3.9% of production.\nThe US sugar industry produced $2.5 billion worth of product in 2017 and received $1.6 billion in subsidies, according to the report. The support amounted to 63.5% of the value of total production.\nTop 10 commodities receiving subsidies in 2016\nLearn more from USAFacts and get the data directly in your inbox by signing up for our newsletter.\nExplore more of USAFacts\nRelated Articles\nEconomy\n\nAre credit reporting complaints on the rise?\n\nEconomy\n\nHow does the US government gather the monthly jobs report?\n\nEconomy\n\nHow have oil prices changed in the US?\n\nEconomy\n\nWhich states have the most and least subsidized (Section 8) housing?\n\nNewsletter\nData delivered to your inbox\nKeep up with the latest data and most popular content.\nUSAFacts is a not-for-profit, nonpartisan civic initiative making government data easy for all.\nSubscribe\n\n    Stay informed with unbiased, data-driven insights sent to your inbox weekly.\n  \n\nBrowse\nMore\nNewsletter\nData delivered to your inbox\nKeep up with the latest data and most popular content.\n"

In instances where data values were not available or not applicable, we used the weighted average of that school\u2019s scores from the categories that did have data. Thus, it would neither help nor hurt the school\u2019s ranking. This only occurred with a small number of values. In the case of unavailable SAT data for a specific school, the districtwide mean SAT scores were used. This occurred for only two public school districts.\nOnce the data was collected and cleansed, we compared each high school\u2019s data points to the overall average for all the schools. We then applied a percentage weight to the standardized value for each school to create an aggregate \u201cscore\u201d for each school. Then, the high schools were ranked based on that statistical score.\nOnly the data in columns denoted with a were factored into the rankings.\nNotes for selected categories: Average Class Size: We used the most recent data available from the NYSED website for core-4 reported class-size data points. These include ELA, Algebra I, Earth Science (or Biology I), and US History (or World History). We considered it more desirable to have a smaller class size than a larger one.\nStudent-to-Teacher Ratio: We considered it more desirable to have a lower ratio than a higher one.\nNo. of Counselors/Social Workers: This was based on the total number of counselors and social workers relative to the total 9-12 enrollment. We considered it more desirable to have a lower ratio than a higher one. This data was taken from the NYSED website in most cases.\nNo. of AP/IB Courses: This was based on the total number of AP/IB courses listed in our table in relation to the total 9-12 enrollment. We considered it more desirable to have a lower ratio than a higher one.\nAP/IB Participation Rate: We considered it desirable to have a higher participation rate than a lower one.\nAbout Our Rankings Expert: George Recck is director of the Math Resource Center and a member of the Math, Analytics, Science & Technology division at Babson College. He has extensive experience in information technology and statistical education and is the founder of Total Information Inc., a consulting firm that provides a range of information services to small businesses.

Some variation in results in subjects between years is always expected.\nHere are the headline takeaways from today\u2019s GCSE results, broken down by subject (scroll down or click the links below to go straight to each subject):\nGCSE maths\nThe proportion of overall entries receiving a pass or higher (grade 4/C) in maths this year was down slightly from 61 per cent last year to 59.6 per cent in 2024.\nThis year was the same as the 59.6 per cent who got a grade 4/C or above in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, 16.7 per cent received a grade 7/A or higher in maths GCSE this year - a decrease from 17.2 per cent who got the top grades in 2023 but above 15.9 per cent in 2019.\nThe 2023 GCSE results saw an uptick in the number of students failing to achieve grade 4 for English and maths and therefore an increase in those having to resit in November.\nHowever, less than a quarter of the students who took GCSE maths in November 2023 passed - meaning the majority failed their resits.\nOnly 17.4 per cent of entries from students aged 17 or over achieved a grade 4/C in maths in England this year - slightly up from 16.4 per cent in 2023.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nGCSE English language and literature\nLike in maths, achieving that grade 4/C needed to pass English language is key for GCSE students.\nThis year, 61.6 per cent of entries managed to achieve a passing grade or higher in English language, a fall from last year when 64.2 per cent were awarded grade 4/C or above.\nThe English language overall pass rate was also slightly below 2019, when 61.8 per cent of entries passed English language.\nHowever, much of this is driven by entries from students aged 17 or over who are likely resitting. In England, 20.9 per cent of entries from these students were awarded a grade 4/C - a drop from 25.9 per cent last year.\n\nSpeaking in a Joint Council for Qualifications briefing this morning, Claire Thomson, AQA\u2019s director of regulation and compliance, said the drop in pass rates was \u201clargely around the 17-year-olds and over who are skewing the distributions. If you look at just the 16-year-olds, they are very stable with minimal movement over the years\u201d.\n\u201cThe 17 and over cohort has grown and come back over pre-pandemic levels, which is altering the results,\u201d she added.\nFor English literature, 73.7 per cent of overall entries achieved a grade 4/C or higher - down slightly from 73.9 per cent in 2023 but up slightly from 73.4 per cent in 2019.\nIn literature, 20.1 per cent achieved a grade 7/A or above, and 15.6 per cent in language. This compares with the 20.6 per cent who achieved grade 7/A in literature in 2023 and 16 per cent in language.\nThis year, teachers with students doing the Romeo and Juliet option in AQA\u2019s English literature paper warned the extract students received was \u201cdifficult\u201d and could leave some young people disadvantaged.\nGCSE double science, biology, chemistry and physics\nIn the double science GCSE, the proportion of entries getting top grades (7/A and above) rose to 8.8 per cent from 8.5 per cent in 2023.\nMeanwhile, 57.1 per cent of entries received a pass or higher in double science, compared with 56.6 per cent last year.\n\nIn the three sciences, the proportion getting the top grades increased slightly for physics and chemistry and remained the same for biology.\nAlong with GCSE maths, physics and combined science students were  allowed to have formulae and equation sheets for another year.\nThis was to recognise the cohort had \u201cexperienced two years of national closures during secondary school\u201d.\nIn biology, 42 per cent achieved the top grades - compared with 42 per cent in 2023 and 42.3 per cent in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile in physics, 44 per cent achieved the top grades - higher than the 43 per cent in 2023 and 43.8 per cent in 2019.\n\nIn chemistry, 44.7 per cent achieved the top grades - higher than the 43.6 per cent in 2023 and 43.9 per cent in 2019.\nGCSE Spanish, French and German\nThe proportion of entries receiving top grades in modern foreign languages rose this year.\nIn Spanish, 26.7 per cent received a grade 7/A or higher and 69.8 per cent passed with a grade 4/C or higher. These are compared with 26.1 per cent that got the top grades in 2023 and 69.2 per cent that passed.\nAdjustments were made to grading standards for French and German GCSEs again this year to better align results with Spanish.\nLast year, exam boards were required by Ofqual to award more generously at grades 9, 7 and 4. This year, exam boards were asked to make further positive adjustments at the same grades for GCSE German, and grades 7 and 4 for French.\n\nConsidering this, 32.1 per cent achieved a grade 7/A above in German, compared with 27.6 per cent last year, and 28 per cent in French, up from 26 per cent in 2023.\nThe pass rate also increased. In French, 71.2 per cent were awarded a grade 4/C or higher - up from 70.5 per cent last year and 69.7 in 2019.\nIn German, 77.5 per cent passed - up from 76.9 per cent in 2023 and 75.8 per cent in 2019.\nJust 9.3 per cent achieved a grade 9 in German GCSE last year, though this was up from 5.8 per cent in 2019. This has continued to rise to 10.4 per cent in 2024.\nGCSE history and geography\nThis year, 25.8 per cent of entries scored the top grades (grade 7/A or above) in GCSE history.\nThis is an increase of 0.5 percentage points from 25.3 per cent in 2023.\n\nIn geography, a similar proportion of entries achieved a grade 7/A or above at 24.5 per cent, the same as 24.5 per cent in both 2023 and 2019.\nThe pass rate in both GCSEs increased very slightly to 63.9 per cent in history and 65 per cent in geography.\nGCSE computing\nComputing GCSE saw an increase in both the proportion of top grades and the pass rate for 2024.\nThis year, 28.3 per cent of entries were awarded a grade 7/A or above, and 68.3 per cent a grade 4/C or above.\nThis is compared with last year when 24.4 per cent of entries received a grade 7/A or higher in computing, and 64.6 per cent made grade 4/C or higher.\nThese were still slightly above 2019 levels when 21.6 per cent got at least a grade 7/A and 62.6 per cent achieved a grade 4/C or above.\nAfter research into grading standards, Ofqual asked exam boards to award more generously at grades 9, 7 and 4 for computer science this year.\nGCSE art and design, drama, music and design and technology\nThere was a mixed picture for the arts in terms of increases and decreases for 2024 compared with last year.\nFor art and design, 23.6 per cent got a grade 7/A or above and 76.3 per cent a grade 4/C or above. In 2023, 23.9 per cent of entries achieved a grade 7/A or above and 76.1 per cent got at least a grade 4/C.\n\nLast year in design and technology, 64.8 per cent achieved a grade 4/C or higher, and 21 per cent got the top grades. This year saw some increases, with 22.4 per cent getting the top grades and 65.6 per cent achieving a pass of grade 4/C or better.\n\nMeanwhile, music top grades decreased slightly from 33.3 per cent in 2023 to 32.9 per cent this year. Last year, 76.4 per cent of students received a grade 4/C or higher, and this only decreased slightly to 75.9 per cent this year.\n\nSimilarly, in drama for 2024, 76.7 per cent achieved a passing grade. In 2023, 75.9 per cent achieved a grade 4/C and up.\nIn the top grades, 26.9 per cent of students got at least a grade 7/A this year, a small increase on 2023 when the figure was 25.8 per cent.\nGCSE PE\nGCSE PE saw 23 per cent of entries awarded a grade 7/A or above and 72.1 per cent getting a grade 4/C or above.\nThis is relatively similar compared to 2023, when 22.7 per cent of entries received the top grades and 72.4 per cent achieved a grade 4/C or higher.\n\u00a0\nNational Reference Test results\nThe results for the National Reference Test (NRT) in English and maths were also released this morning.\nThe test, which was sat by more than 13,000 students in February and March 2024, is used to provide evidence of the performance of 16-year-old students in English language and maths to support the awarding of GCSE grades.\nIn maths, the NRT results showed a statistically significant upward change at grade 7/A. In 2024, 22.4 per cent of students were expected to be at the grade, compared with 19.9 per cent in 2017.\nOfqual said this could be interpreted as \u201csuggesting a small upwards adjustment to grade standards would have been appropriate\u201d.\nHowever, after consideration, no change was made as results were similar to 2019 and the increase relative to 2017 is thought to be because of the introduction of the reformed GCSE qualification that year.\nThe English results of the NRT show a statistically significant downward change compared with 2017 at grade 4. In 2017, 69.9 per cent of students were expected to be at this level, compared with 65.1 per cent in 2024.\nBut again, no adjustment was made to grade standards.\nOfqual said: \u201cFor us to make an adjustment this summer we would need to be confident that the decline in performance indicated by the results of the NRT reflected a genuine change in the attainment of the GCSE cohort.\n\u201cGiven the context in recent years following the pandemic, we do not consider that there is sufficient evidence of a genuine decline in performance such that we should make a downwards adjustment this summer.\u201d\nFor the latest education news and analysis delivered every weekday morning, sign up for the Tes Daily newsletter\nWant to keep reading for free?\nRegister with Tes and you can read two free articles every month plus you'll have access to our range of award-winning newsletters.\nKeep reading for just \u00a31 per month\nYou've reached your limit of free articles this month.

      "Average Classroom Size (Square Feet/Meters) [2024]\nThe average size (surface area) of a classroom in the United States is approximately 900 square feet (84 m\u00b2). You\u2019ll find most classrooms varying between 700 and 1,100 square feet (65 and 102 m\u00b2). These dimensions apply to primary, middle, and high schools for normal educational activities.\nClassrooms are commonly square or slightly rectangular, typically with the teaching board on the shorter side. A common layout measures around 30 feet by 30 feet (9 meters by 9 meters). Ceiling height is typically about 9 feet (274 centimeters).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A layout of a 30ft x 30ft (900 square feet) classroom accommodating 24 desks in a grid formation. Create a custom-size layout.\nWhen class size is measured in students, the average and median number in the US hovers around 20 students, though figures can range from 15 to 26 students per classroom (see histogram visualization). This translates to roughly 45 square feet (4.2 square meters) per student, ensuring more than adequate space for each individual to learn and interact comfortably, well above minimum spatial requirements.\nVarious factors, such as the type of classroom, academic year, and geographical differences across states and countries, contribute to variations in classroom sizes. Additionally, the data on this topic can be sparse and sometimes inconsistent. Therefore, the floor area estimates we discuss here are based on a combination of direct data, reasoning, and educated guesses.\nMy motivation for researching classroom sizes came from the need to provide the best possible templates and defaults for the Seating Chart Maker users. I couldn\u2019t find any source that provides a comprehensive overview of classroom sizes, so I decided to compile information from sources such as state guidelines and architectural documents to give you a more complete picture.\nIn the following sections, I provide further details from various sources and discuss them. So, without further ado, let\u2019s dive into the details.\nContents\nA Closer Look at Average Classroom Size in Square Feet in the US\nClassroom dimensions play a key role in the learning environment. In the following sections, we\u2019ll review available data, such as state guidelines, estimations, and expert views on classroom sizes across the United States.\nDirect Data: Classroom Size Specifications\nAccording to an article from Architectural Record, classrooms in many schools typically range from 800 to 1,100 square feet (74 to 102 m\u00b2), planned to accommodate about 20 to 30 students. Mentioned common sizes are:\nThese dimensions result in square or slightly rectangular-shaped classrooms. The article is centered around the design of new wood-framed school buildings. Still, we can assume the presented figures describe the typical classroom sizes in the US, as they are presented as a background for school building design. There is no reason to believe classroom sizes should differ from the normal in wood-framed schools. However, the source of these numbers remains unspecified in the article, so we should take them with a grain of salt.\nTanner refers to the recommended classroom sizes in the US, noting that the typical elementary school classroom is approximately 900 square feet (84 m\u00b2). In contrast, for secondary schools, it is 1024 square feet (95 m\u00b2). However, as with the previous source, Tanner does not provide specific sources for his figures. Despite this, we can consider these as indicative of the current recommendations in effect, although further investigation is needed for absolute certainty.\nA Calculated Approach: Estimations Based on Indirect Data\nWe can estimate a typical classroom size from the average number of students and general recommendations or standards for per-student square footage in classrooms.\nFor instance, although a national standard for classroom square footage per student does not exist, some states have defined guidelines with classroom sizes ranging from 25 square feet (2.3 m\u00b2) to 45 square feet (4.2 m\u00b2) per student.\nAccording to the Illinois Administrative Code\u2019s Space Utilization Report, classroom capacity is calculated by dividing the net classroom area by 35 square feet (3.3 m\u00b2).\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data shows an average class size of 20 students, with most classes having 15 to 26 students. Consequently, an estimated average classroom size could fall between 525 square feet (35 sq ft/student times 15 students) and 910 square feet (35 sq ft/student times 26 students) (49 and 85 m\u00b2). However, this calculation has potential issues as classrooms should probably be designed with some tolerance to accommodate more students than the current average. Moreover, the average student count per class in the US has seen a slight decrease over time (NCES). Therefore, the average classroom size will likely exceed the estimated range.\nRequired Classroom Sizes: State Minimum Standards\nIn California, under the California Code of Regulations, Title 5, School Facilities Construction, classrooms constructed for grades one through twelve should have at least 960 square feet (89 m\u00b2) of floor space. Justifications are required for classrooms smaller than this, explaining the classroom\u2019s suitability for the district\u2019s educational program.\nMeanwhile, the New York State Education Department (NYSED) requires a minimum of 770 square feet (72 m\u00b2) for both elementary and secondary school classrooms (for up to 15 students), maintaining a standard of 50 square feet (4.6 m\u00b2) per student. Here, classroom designs favor a rectangular layout rather than a perfect square.\nThe Texas Education Agency (TEA) sets a minimum requirement of 700 square feet (65 m\u00b2) and a per-student space of 28-30 square feet (2.6-2.8 m\u00b2).\nOn the other hand, Georgia\u2019s Department of Education (GaDOE) has defined a minimum classroom size of 600-750 square feet (56-70 m\u00b2).\nState minimums for classroom sizes, varying from 600 to 960 square feet (56 to 89 m\u00b2), suggest that the average classroom size in the US likely exceeds these figures. These minimums provide a baseline, with actual sizes possibly influenced by current and possible future class sizes, other tolerances, estimated benefits of extra space, availability of spaces, and teaching methodologies.\nBased on the above data, the estimated average classroom size is approximately 900 square feet (84 m\u00b2), typically between 700 and 1,100 square feet (65 and 102 m\u00b2). There\u2019s no evidence suggesting that the distribution of classroom sizes is skewed. Hence, it\u2019s reasonable to deduce that the median classroom size also approximates 900 square feet.\nClassroom Size by US State\nIn the United States, a national standard specifying the required square footage per student for general classrooms has yet to be created. However, specific states, including Illinois, have implemented such requirements, with the average classroom size ranging from 25 to 45 square feet (2.3 to 4.2 m\u00b2) per student (Space Utilization Report).\nBelow is a table indicating the required classroom size in square feet per student and the total required classroom size in square feet in select states.\nClassroom Size by State\nThe data presented in the table is applicable to primary and secondary education classrooms and does not include special classrooms such as those for science, art, or music.\nThe table displays a variety of classroom size standards across six states in the US. Notably, some states, such as New York City and Pennsylvania, provide specifications regarding square footage per student, while others, like California and Georgia, set requirements for total classroom size. Texas offers both types of measures.\nClassroom Size by Activity Type, Age, and Student Count\nClassroom sizes can vary significantly based on the type of activity, the age of the students, and the number of students in a class. This section of the article explains how these factors influence the average square-foot classroom size.\nAge Factor in Classroom Size\nGenerally, the recommendations are that classrooms for younger students are larger in comparison to those used by older students. For instance, here are some average sizes according to grade level:\nThis difference in space allocation could be attributed to the diverse learning needs of younger children, which require more physical space for learning activities.\nIn addition, younger students likely require, on average, more teaching staff per student, which could necessitate larger classrooms. Teachers also need their space in the classroom.\nClassroom Size Based on Activity Type\nIn addition to age, the nature of the activities taking place within a classroom also plays a crucial role in determining its size. Classrooms designated for specific subjects such as music, science, or art usually require more space than standard academic classrooms (GaDOE). For those looking to design or redesign their classroom layouts, a seating chart maker software can help visualize different setups efficiently, whether for general instruction or specialized subjects like art and science.\nIt is important to note that, unless stated otherwise, the measurements provided in this article primarily refer to regular classrooms, not specialized ones.\nClassroom Size Recommendations Derived from Research\nAccording to research conducted by Tanner, it is proposed that the ideal classroom size for an elementary school accommodating 20 students and one teacher is 1,029 square feet (96 m\u00b2). In contrast, secondary school classrooms should be 1,344 square feet (125 m\u00b2). More than just the raw square footage, the density of a classroom plays a significant role.\nIn addition, it was noted that the classroom should provide at least 72 square feet (6.70 m\u00b2) of window area for natural light. Additionally, the classrooms should offer views that foster engagement and learning, and there should be direct access to the outdoors (Tanner and Heschong Mahone Group).\nCriticism of Tanner\u2019s Study\nHowever, Tanner himself recognizes that the methodologies and outcomes of his study can be criticized. One key point of criticism is Tanner\u2019s reliance on \u2018social distance\u2019 as a metric for determining optimal classroom size.\nAnother issue is the assumption of a causal link (instead of just a correlation) between classroom size (in square feet) or density and learning outcomes. Larger or less dense classrooms could result from more extensive resources that also contribute to improved learning results regardless of the classroom size, leading to a correlation versus causality debate.\nStandard Classroom Size for Different Class Sizes\nThe average class size in the US is 20 students, with most classes having 15 to 26 students. An average classroom size of 900 square feet (84 m\u00b2) results in an estimated average of 45 square feet (4.2 m\u00b2) per student. Most state guidelines allow for less area per student. For example, Illinois calculates classroom student capacity as 35 sq ft per student number.\nLet\u2019s calculate some estimated classroom sizes for different class sizes.\nPlease note that while the calculated square footage is precise, the length and width of the room in feet are approximated examples, assuming a nearly square room.\nEstimated Classroom Sizes for Different Class Sizes\nThe table shows an estimated standard classroom size for 20 students would be from 700 to 900 square feet (65 to 84 m\u00b2). The typical classroom size for 25 students would be 875 to 1125 square feet (81 to 105 m\u00b2). The standard classroom sizes for 30 students would be 1050 to 1350 square feet (98 to 125 m\u00b2). And so on.\nAs the class size increases, the standard classroom size likely increases slower. This is because the classroom size is determined by the number of students and the required space for the teacher and other furniture, which is a constant. Another reason is that larger classes are more likely to be held in more lecture-style classrooms, where students are seated in rows, which can accommodate more students in a smaller area.\nComparing Classroom Sizes in Square Feet Across Countries\nThis section presents an international perspective on the average classroom area, with data from several countries.\nAccording to a 2009 OECD study, Asian nations like Korea and Japan, who are known to perform well when it comes to education, demonstrate larger class sizes in comparison to the US\u2014with 31 students in Korea and 28 in Japan. However, more recent class size trends show that at least Korean class sizes have decreased in recent years. This may suggest that the average classroom area tends to be larger in these Asian countries.\nIn contrast, some European nations and Russia have slightly smaller class sizes than the US average, indicating smaller classroom areas.\nReports from China show that the country can have colossal class sizes that exceed 100 students. Despite the very large number of students, these classrooms maintain a compact environment of roughly 20 square feet (1.9 m\u00b2) per student. Consequently, the classroom size reaches approximately 2,000 square feet (186 m\u00b2) \u2014 double the size of the average US classroom.\nStandard Dimensions of School Desks\nFor reference, here are some typical school furniture sizes. The standard measurements for school desks can vary. Here\u2019s a brief overview of typical dimensions:\nConclusion\nThe average size of a classroom in the United States is approximately 900 square feet (84 m\u00b2)-often between 700 and 1,100 square feet (65 and 102 m\u00b2).\nClassrooms typically accommodate an average of 20 students, or around 45 square feet per student (4.2m\u00b2).\nClassroom sizes vary significantly with country, classroom type, school year, and more. The size requirements also differ by state; for example, California requires a minimum of 960 square feet per classroom, while Texas sets a minimum of 700 square feet.\nFor those interested in exploring different classroom configurations, such as grids, rows, or clusters, to maximize space and enhance learning, consider reading our resource on different classroom layout templates.\nReferences\nRead next\nClass Size Statistics & Trends: Visualized & Curated [2024]\nThe typical class size in US public schools is 16-23 students. In the academic year 2020-2021, the mean class size was 18.3 students, a slight decrease from the 2017-2018 average of 19.6 students.

      "\nEducation\n\nU.S. reading and math scores drop to lowest level in decades\n\n\n      Sequoia Carrillo\n    \n\nThe average test scores for U.S. 13-year-olds have dipped in reading and dropped sharply in math since 2020, according to new data from National Assessment of Educational Progress. \nThe average scores, from tests given last fall, declined 4 points in reading and 9 points in math, compared with tests given in the 2019-2020 school year, and are the lowest in decades. The declines in reading were more pronounced for lower performing students, but dropped across all percentiles.\nThe math scores were even more disappointing. On a scale of 500 points, the declines ranged from 6 to 8 points for middle and high performing students, to 12 to 14 points for low performing students.\nThe math results also showed widening gaps based on gender and race. Scores decreased by 11 points for female students over 2020 results, compared with a 7-point decrease for male students.\nAmong Black students, math scores declined 13 points, while white students had a 6-point drop. Compared with the 35-point gap between Black and white students in 2020, the disparity widened to 42 points.\nEducation \nHistory and civics scores drop for U.S. eighth-graders on national test\n\"Unfinished learning continues to weigh on students across all grades and subjects,\" said Denise Forte, president and CEO of The Education Trust, a nonprofit advocacy group. \"And this is especially true for Black and Latino students, English learners, and students from low-income backgrounds who experienced the brunt of pandemic-related upheaval and uncertainties,\"\nThe latest results are from the NAEP Long-Term Trend Assessment, traditionally administered every four years by the National Center for Education Statistics.\nIn releasing the data, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said the scores strongly reflect the losses caused by the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, which in many cases left schools closed for more than a year. The results, he said in a statement, confirmed predictions that \"the pandemic would have a devastating impact on students' learning across the country and that it would take years of effort and investment to reverse the damage.\"\nWhile the scores show a drop from the pre-pandemic years, the results also show that there are other factors at work. The decline is even more substantial when compared with scores of a decade ago: The average scores declined 7 points in reading and 14 points in mathematics.\nThe Education Department says plans are underway to address the learning loss.\n\"Schools have committed nearly 60 percent of their American Rescue Plan funds to address lost learning time and accelerate academic recovery,\" Cardona said in a statement on Wednesday. Those funds can be used for things like hiring more teachers, counselors, and support staff or providing increased tutoring and one-on-one support to students.\nSponsor Message\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n",

The consensus now is that the outcomes were overwhelmingly negative. Closing schools created sizable learning losses and likely widened racial and economic achievement gaps. \nYet schools continue to offer\u2014and even expand\u2014remote-learning options. And demand has grown strongly. Between 2021 and 2022, there was a 47 percent increase in families enrolling in exclusively virtual schools, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\nWhy are schools and families opting for online learning given the evidence from the past few years? Investigating this question, Brown\u2019s Jesse Bruhn, Chicago Booth\u2019s Christopher Campos, and University of Texas\u2019s Eric Chyn\u00a0find that while remote schooling may be detrimental to learning for most students, a specific subset appears to have benefited from it.\nThe researchers ran a two-part survey in Los Angeles, where the school district fully returned after more than a year of remote learning in fall 2021 but said it would maintain an online option\u2014and then opened 60 new virtual academies in 2023. In the first survey, conducted in April 2022, Bruhn, Campos, and Chyn asked 100,000 families with children in grades 3\u20138 or 11 questions about their experience with remote learning, including whether they were satisfied with the virtual option and whether they felt their child excelled relative to in-person learning.\nWho benefited from a virtual classroom?\u00a0\nFor most students, the research finds, online schooling brought down test scores. But students whose families had a high preference for remote learning saw an improvement, possibly because these students learn best at their own pace or with less social pressure.\nThe second part of the survey gave parents 10 hypothetical scenarios, each asking which of three schools they preferred. The schools varied along three attributes: distance from survey takers\u2019 home, academic achievement of the student body, and instruction being either remote or in person. By pooling answers to these surveys, the researchers were able to construct a picture of school preference, including how much demand families have for remote learning. They matched these results with test scores from the 2021\u201322 school year to connect this demand with student outcomes. (The sample of parents who responded to survey tended to have higher-achieving students who were less likely to be in special education.)\nIn many ways, the results reinforce the current narrative of remote schooling: 62 percent of parents, reflecting back on a year when school buildings were closed, said their child did not enjoy remote learning, and nearly 80 percent said they were unlikely to choose remote learning in the future. The hypothetical choice experiment reveals that academic achievement at a given school would need to increase by 40 percent for most parents to accept remote over in-person learning. That\u2019s an unlikely scenario, since academic performance for the average student dropped when attending school remotely.\nBut 22 percent of survey takers said their student excelled in remote learning. While most students who went remote saw a decline in test scores, about 10 percent performed better\u2014and their parents expressed a preference for remote learning. The researchers can\u2019t explain why this small group of students benefited, but several theories exist. Among them, is that bullying declined during remote learning, as a team of researchers from Boston University find, in which case it\u2019s possible that reduced social pressure led to academic gains. \nThe findings reveal a gap in how educators and policy makers understand the potential of remote learning. To accept the average experience of students over the course of the pandemic as universally true, Campos says, ignores the fact that some kids benefit from staying home, that there is important variability in how receptive families are to the upsides of virtual schooling.\n\u201cDiscourse in the press and academia thus far tends to simply lump the issue into negative territory,\u201d he says. \u201cThis does tend to be true on average, but policy makers need to understand these families in the other 10 percent, and perhaps better target them with remote options. There is a lot more to be learned about remote learning in the postpandemic landscape.\u201d\n\nWorks Cited\n\n\nMore from Chicago Booth Review\nDoes Restricting Choice Lead to Better Schools?\nIn Los Angeles, students and schools benefited from small pockets of competition.\nSome Fathers Are Less Willing to Spend on Daughters than on Sons\nFindings from a series of surveys suggest that simple gender preference may be the explanation.\nCommunity College Is a Viable Route to Higher Incomes\u2014for Some\nCommunity college can boost outcomes, particularly for disadvantaged students and those who would otherwise not attend college.

      "Long-term trends in reading and mathematics achievement\nQuestion:\nWhat are the long-term trends in student achievement in reading and mathematics?\nResponse:\nSince the 1970s, the long-term trend National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has reported periodic data on the reading and mathematics achievement of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds enrolled in public and private schools.1 Five decades of results offer an extended view of student achievement in reading and mathematics.\nIn 2022, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) conducted a special administration of the\u202fNAEP long-term trend (LTT) reading and mathematics assessments for age 9 students to examine student achievement during the COVID-19 pandemic.2 This Fact Fact focuses on these results. For recent findings for age 13 students, see NAEP Long-Term Trend Assessment Results: Reading and Mathematics.\nAverage scores for age 9 students in 2022 declined 5 points in reading and 7 points in mathematics compared to 2020. This is the largest average score decline in reading since 1990, and the first ever score decline in mathematics.\nAverage reading and mathematics scale scores on the long-term trend National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP): Selected years, 1971 through 2022\n* Significantly different (p < .05) from 2022.\nNAEP reports scores at five selected percentiles to show the progress made by lower- (10th and 25th percentiles), middle- (50th percentile), and higher- (75th and 90th percentiles) performing students. In 2022, reading and mathematics scores for students at all five selected percentile levels declined compared to 2020. In both subjects, scores for lower-performing age 9 students declined more than scores for higher-performing students compared to 2020.\nAll students who took the long-term trend assessments in 2022 were asked if they ever attended school from home or somewhere outside of school for any duration during the last school year (2020\u201321) because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventy percent of 9-year-old students recalled learning remotely during the last school year, while 19 percent reported they did not learn remotely, and 11 percent did not remember.\nOf the 70 percent of 9-year-olds who learned remotely during the 2020\u201321 school year, higher performers (those at or above the 75th percentile) had greater access to a desktop computer, laptop, or tablet all the time; a quiet place to work available some of the time; and a teacher available to help them with mathematics or reading schoolwork every day or almost every day compared to lower performers (those below the 25th percentile).\nPercentage of 9-year-old students who recalled experiencing remote learning in 2020\u221221 school year in NAEP long-term trend reading, by selected percentiles and by selected survey questionnaire variables: 2022\nNOTE: Although rounded numbers are displayed, the figures are based on unrounded data. This figure is reproduced from the original report. To view the \u201cfull question\u201d links, please visit the report, which is hyperlinked in the SOURCE box, below.\n1 Long-term trend NAEP results may differ from the main NAEP results presented in other National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) publications. The long-term trend assessment measures a consistent body of knowledge and skills over an extended period, while the main NAEP undergoes changes periodically to reflect current curricula and emerging standards. In addition, several changes were made to the long-term trend assessment in 2004 to align it with current assessment practices and policies applicable to the NAEP main assessments. This included allowing accommodations for students with disabilities and for English learners. These changes have been carried forward in more recent data collections. Despite these changes to the assessment, the trend analysis is still valid.\n2 Since the 1970s, the NAEP long-term trend assessments have been administered to monitor the academic performance of students across three age levels (9-, 13-, and 17-year-old students). This Fast Fact focuses on the comparison of age 9 students (typically in grade 4) between 2020 and 2022. A report summarizing results for 9-year-old students across all administrations back to the early 1970s will be released in the spring of 2023, along with results for 13-year-old students.\nFor the latest NAEP long-term trend results for 13-year-olds, see Reading and Mathematics Score Trends from the Condition of Education (COE) 2022. For the latest NAEP long-term trend results for 17-year-olds, see Reading and Mathematics Score Trends from COE 2016.\nSOURCE: 2022 Age 9 Long-Term Trend Reading and Mathematics Highlights Report.

      "Map Options\nU.S. Literacy Rates by State 2024\nU.S. Literacy Rates by State 2024\nThe literacy rate is the total number of literate persons (people able to both read and write) in a given age group, expressed as the percentage of that age group. The adult literacy rate measures literacy among persons age 15 and older.\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics, about four out of five U.S. adults (79%) have medium to high English literacy skills. These literacy levels are sufficient to compare and contrast information, paraphrase, and make low-level inferences. This means that about one in five U.S. adults (21%) have low literacy skills, translating to about 43.0 million adults.\nOf those who have low English literacy skills, 35% are White, 2% of whom are born outside of the U.S.; 23% are Black, 3% of whom are born outside of the U.S.; 34% are Hispanic, 24% of whom are born outside of the U.S.; 8% are of other races/ethnicities. Non-U.S.-born adults comprise 34% of the U.S. population with low literacy skills.\nLiteracy rates vary greatly by state and are affected by several factors.\nStates with the High Literacy Rates\nNew Hampshire has the lowest percentage (5.8%) of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills, making New Hampshire's literacy rate of 94.2%. About 36.6% of adults in New Hampshire have a Bachelor's degree or higher, the seventh-highest rate in the country, and 60.8% of the population are registered library users, also the seventh-highest in the country.\nMinnesota has the second-highest literacy rate of 94.0%, with only 6% of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills. About 69.9% of Minnesota residents are registered library users, the second-highest in the country.\nNorth Dakota has the third-highest literacy rate of 93.7%, with 6.3% of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills. North Dakota, however, has the lowest percentage of registered library users of 35.9%.\nVermont has the fourth-highest literacy rate of 93.4%, with 6.6% of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills. Vermont is also the fourth-most educated state in the U.S.. Vermont has the highest number of libraries per 100,000 people of 29.8 and has the eighth-highest Bachelor's degree or higher attainment of 36.4%.\nSouth Dakota has the fifth-highest literacy rate of 93.0%, with 7.0% of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills. South Dakota has 16.4 public libraries per 100,000 residents, the fifth-highest in the country.\nStates with the Lowest Literacy Rates\nCalifornia's 23.1% of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills make California have the lowest literacy rate of 76.9%. The state of California and the state Department of Education are being blamed and sued for the failing literacy rate, as families and students believe that they are not receiving a quality education in reading and writing.\nNew York has the second-highest percentage of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills of 22.1%, equaling a literacy rate of 77.9%. Despite this, New York has the ninth-highest percentage of adults with Bachelor's degrees or higher of 35.7%.\nFlorida has the third-highest percentage of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills of 19.7%, equaling a literacy rate of 80.3%. Florida has the lowest number of public libraries per 100,000 residents of 2.6.\nTexas has the fourth-lowest literacy rate of 81.0%, with 19.0% of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills. Texas has the fourth-lowest number of libraries of 3.2 per 100,000 residents.\nThe fifth-lowest literacy rate in the United States is in New Jersey, where 16.9% of adults lack basic prose literacy skills, and 83.1% are literate. Despite this, 38.6% of New Jersey adults have a Bachelor's degree or higher, the country's fifth-highest. Additionally, New Jersey also has the third-best public schools.\nU.S. Literacy Rates by State 2024\n50 states\nSources\n",
      "Michigan Journal of Economics\nThe Relationship between Socioeconomic Status and Literacy: How Literacy is Influenced by and Influences SES\nBy Maren Blanchard\nABSTRACT\nLiteracy levels in children have strong implications for future employment opportunities and level of SES. In this research article, we evaluate literature regarding one\u2019s level of literacy and socioeconomic status (SES) to find how literacy influences SES and how SES influences literacy. In this context, SES is measured by level of income. A strong positive correlation is found between literacy and SES, with higher income being linked to higher literacy.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe cycle of poverty is widely acknowledged in the U.S. economic system and society at large; however, the deeply intertwined cycle of literacy is lesser known. The cycle of literacy and the cycle of poverty both describe how one\u2019s circumstances at birth can influence their future life outcomes. Those born into a low SES often have fewer opportunities and experience more difficulty obtaining a higher SES. Similarly, those born to parents with low literacy will not have a strong foundation for literacy before entering school and are more likely to fall behind and have lower literacy levels. SES and literacy intersect in the educational and job markets, where higher-paying careers often require higher education, which in turn requires higher levels of literacy.\nIn this context, the term \u201cliteracy level\u201d does not merely represent one element of reading or writing, but rather a composite evaluation determined by factors such as phonological awareness, vocabulary, fluency, and many others. Literacy research is a deeply complex field of study with many intersections, one of these intersections being socioeconomic status. SES in this context is measured by level of income. In this research article, we will answer the question \u201chow does socioeconomic status impact literacy, and how can literacy impact socioeconomic status?\u201d and discuss the implications of this relationship from childhood (SES influencing literacy) to adulthood (literacy influencing SES).\nJust as those born into poverty have a stronger likelihood of remaining impoverished, those born into a family with low literacy levels are likely to have weak literacy skills themselves (Rea, 2020). This seems logical, as parents who are not comfortable with literature will interact with it less than parents with higher literacy levels. Similarly, as these parents are likely not confident in teaching their children how to read or write, these children will lack a strong home-literacy foundation, thus leading to a lower level of literacy.\u00a0 A low literacy level may disadvantage someone searching for a higher-paying job, as many skilled positions require strong literacy. Many may argue that the child\u2019s school district is solely responsible for developing literacy, but this assumes the child\u2019s family is living in an area with a good school district. Being born into a low SES likely means one will attend a school with lower levels of funding, creating a learning environment that is not as strong as their middle or upper-class peers (Rea, 2020). Considering shortages of teachers and behavioral issues often present in poorly funded school districts, these schools may be unable to teach crucial aspects of literacy development, causing students to lack certain foundational skills and lag behind their peers who attend better-funded schools. We observe that literacy and socioeconomic status are intertwined in multiple ways.\u00a0 Many people of lower socioeconomic statuses have lower literacy levels, this relationship resulting both from how SES can influence literacy and from how literacy can influence SES (Rea, 2020).\nLITERATURE REVIEW\nRelated literature within the topic shows both that SES influences literacy and literacy influences SES. We separate these two relationships to evaluate how research indicates that literacy is influenced by SES and how SES is influenced by literacy, both SES and literacy being part of a reverse causation relationship. We discuss this relationship and the implications of these relationships for children and adults.\nSES Influencing Literacy\nWhile many understand that there are gaps in academic achievement for different incomes, a study by Reardon and colleagues (2012) helps illustrate the extent to which SES influences academic success. The data for this study was collected from the 2009 ECLS-K data report from the National Center for Education Statistics and the National Assessment of Educational Progress-Long Term Trend (NAEP-LTT), combining the sources to understand the severity of the literacy disparities between income groups. This research found that in the United States, eighth graders in the study\u2019s lowest income group had literacy skills comparable to high-income third graders (Reardon et al., 2012, p. 26). Compared to fellow eighth graders, these lower-income students were five years behind their high-income peers in literacy level (Rearson et al., p.26).\nThis difference in literacy due to income disparities is not unique to the United States. A study based in Scotland that focused on the influence of income volatility on children\u2019s cognitive abilities discovered that students with parents of lower SES were more likely to experience income volatility (Sosu & Schmidt, 2022). At around age three, the Naming Vocabulary and Picture Similarities subtests taken from the British Ability Scales were administered to participants to test the children\u2019s cognitive abilities. When students experienced a steady increase in family income, their scores on vocabulary assessments also increased at a rate greater than those from stable-income families. In contrast, students experiencing a downward or unstable fluctuation of income performed worse than those students whose family income was stable (Sosu & Schmidt, 2022, p. 7). This study, therefore, illustrates how a steady or rising SES can greatly benefit a child\u2019s literacy development, while those who experience instability in income will likely have greater financial stress and lower levels of literacy.\nIn Israel, Korat (2005) separated an assessment into contextual and non-contextual aspects of literacy. Contextual measures included the identification of reading and writing behavior, reading environmental print, and identification of print materials. Non-contextual measures evaluated were phonemic awareness, letter naming, concepts about print, emergent writing, and word recognition. Korat reports that for non-contextual aspects of literacy, students of lower SES significantly lag behind higher SES students, while contextual aspects are fairly similar between income levels (Korat,2005, p. 232). The findings of this study further support the idea that one\u2019s SES influences literacy, specifically aspects of non-contextual literacy development. The fact that contextual factors are similar among groups implies that while lower SES children can still identify letters and print materials, many of them are lacking the decoding skills necessary to understand and interpret text. Being able to identify letters or words is a skill entirely different from being able to piece the information together in order to comprehend what was read. This poses a threat to the literacy development of lower SES children, as the inability to decode what words and sentences truly mean may inhibit growth in subsequent grades. Without being taught crucial skills necessary for proficiency in reading and writing, we cannot expect these lower SES children to move on to higher grade levels, as they will only become further behind. These differences in the foundational literacy between children of low and high socioeconomic groups indicate an egregious disparity that, if unchecked, may prevent them from obtaining a higher socioeconomic status later in their lives.\nLiteracy Influencing SES\nIn regard to how literacy influences SES, a 1994 study evaluated how beneficial adult literacy programs might be in increasing employment opportunities. Most adults in the study with low literacy levels did have full-time employment, but their work was primarily confined to the service, labor, and construction industries. While these industries offer steady employment, they often contain few opportunities for professional growth. After completion of the literacy programs, many participants left these industries, indicating that their improved literacy allowed for job opportunities in more desirable fields (Malicky & Norman, 1994, p. 126). Similarly, a 2020 study evaluating literacy and numeracy in OECD countries found that many adults with low literacy can find jobs, but that higher literacy and skill levels give workers more opportunities for career and income growth (Cherry & Vignoles, 2020). This further illustrates the influence that literacy has on job acquisition and how crucial it can be to many higher-paying careers. In summary of the literature evaluated, socioeconomic status influences literacy while literacy can also influence the opportunities one has for employment and therefore influences socioeconomic status.\nRESULTS\nThe results of the studies support the idea that SES has a great influence on literacy levels, and that one\u2019s literacy proficiency can influence one\u2019s employment and overall economic stability. The Reardon et al. study not only found a significant income achievement gap for literacy but also that this gap has been increasing for the past several decades (Reardon et al., 2012, p. 26). The implications of this gap increase are discussed further in the discussion section, and overall pose great threats to individuals and the economy at lea\nSosu\u2019s results show the importance of income stability for the growth of cognitive abilities, and how volatility in income can hinder a child\u2019s cognitive development (Sosu & Schmidt, 2022). The Korat study\u2019s results similarly back up the relationship, with students of middle SES performing better than low SES students on assessments of non-contextual literacy (Korat, 2005). Below is a table describing these results and their relationship with SES.\nSource: Korat (2005), p. 231\nThese studies demonstrate a significant influence on the availability of job opportunities and skill development, following the idea that while SES contributes to literacy, literacy also contributes to SES.\nIt is important to note that the results of these studies are an overview of SES and literacy relations, but that there are several intersections that have more specific influences and can add further influence to SES or literacy development. Some of these factors include but are not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, and age (Rea, 2020). Intersectionality within SES and these demographic groups can influence SES which in turn can influence literacy, or can influence literacy and in turn influence SES. For example, gender disparities in income level can influence SES, and then as we have seen from the literature, SES can influence literacy levels in children of that earner. These demographic influences are important to consider in looking further into the literacy/SES relationship, but for the focus of this paper, we will only evaluate the overall relationships.\nDISCUSSION\nWhy is this relationship between SES and literacy significant? The influence of SES on literacy is not one-sided, and large-scale literacy improvements can lead to a better economic state. Nationally, low skill levels related to low literacy have estimated costs of $225 billion in workforce nonproductivity, lost tax revenue, and crime (National Council for Adult Learning, 2015). With this gap growing, we expect the costs to grow as well, with increasingly lower literacy generating increasingly less workforce productivity. As Reardon et al. finds, the gap in literacy achievement between socioeconomic statuses is increasing, which ought to be a serious concern for future generations. If the gap widens, the cycles of literacy and low SES will be perpetuated further, as will these economic losses, with lower literacy adults unable to gain career opportunities and contribute as much as they could to the economy. Therefore, intervention programs focused on literacy could have great economic benefits, leading to a more productive and economically efficient workforce.\nTo better understand how we can increase literacy both individually and on a large scale, future research should evaluate the effect of government-subsidized literacy programs for both children and adults of low SES. Possible benefits of these programs could be making home-literacy development more equitable by providing more resources for lower SES families or even trying to raise parental literacy. While these interventions would likely result in many benefits, a highly unequal level of accessibility would remain. Higher SES families and students have opportunities for private tutors, better schooling whether private or in a well-funded public school district, as well as more opportunities for higher education. Despite current programs in place, more help needs to be directed toward lower socioeconomic status individuals in order to boost their literacy and increase their opportunities to contribute to the economy.\nCONCLUSION\nThe available research suggests a strong relationship between literacy and socioeconomic status. Not only does SES contribute to literacy level, but one\u2019s literacy level can influence the SES they will hold throughout their lives. The differences in literacy levels between income levels are rising and will continue to rise. There is no clear answer to how to resolve the literacy gap, but the relationship between SES and literacy is one that will continue to influence our children and economy.\nReferences\nCherry, G., & Vignoles, A.

Analysis of the minor domain subject is more limited than when it is a major domain. in PISA 2022. For 2022, the PISA reading literacy assessment component included only trend items used in prior cycles of PISA, including the 2000, 2009, and 2018 cycles, when reading literacy was the major domain As the major domain, a greater proportion of the assessment is devoted to the subject area, including newly developed items, allowing for more detailed analyses of student performance in the subject.  In addition, most items in the background questionnaires for students and schools focus on some aspect of the major domain subject, such as how it is taught, school resources related to the teaching of the subject, or students' levels of engagement with the subject.. Read more about the latest version of the reading literacy framework for PISA.\nReading involves not only the printed page but also digital formats. Increasingly, it requires readers to distinguish between fact and opinion, synthesize and interpret texts from multiple sources, and deal with conflicting information across source materials.\nTo take better advantage of the administration of PISA on computer and to improve the measurement of the subject, the PISA 2022 assessment of reading literacy included multi-stage adaptive testing that was introduced in PISA 2018. Instead of using fixed, predetermined test booklets, the PISA 2022 reading assessment was dynamically determined, based on how a student performed in prior stages.

      "Economic Impacts of Dropouts\nEconomy\nEach year\u2019s class of dropouts will cost the country over $200 billion during their lifetimes in lost earnings and unrealized tax revenue (Catterall, 1985).\nThe estimated tax revenue loss from every male between the ages of 25 and 34 years of age who did not complete high school would be approximately $944 billion, with cost increases to public welfare and crime at $24 billion (Thorstensen, 2004).\nStudents from low-income families have a dropout rate of 10%; students from middle income families have a dropout rate of 5.2%, and 1.6% of students from high-income families dropout. (NCES, 2002).\nA cost of $10,038 for after-school programs produces benefits of $89,000 to $129,000 per participant (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2003d).\nIncreasing minority students\u2019 participation in college to the same percentage as that of white students would create an additional $231 billion in GDP and at least $80 billion in new tax revenues (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2003e).\nPersonal Income and Employment\nHigh school graduates, on the average, earn $9,245 more per year than high school dropouts. (Employment Policy Foundation, 2002).\nBetween October 2001 and October 2002, about 400,000 persons dropped out of high school. The unemployment rate for this group was 29.8 %\u2013almost 13 percentage points higher than the unemployment rate for recent high school graduates who were not enrolled in college (United States Department of Labor, 2003).\nA woman with a high school diploma earns a salary just above the poverty line for a family of three (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2003c).\nIn 2000, the median earnings for black females with a high school diploma and no college was $20,000 less than the median earnings for black females with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2003c).\nIn 2002, the unemployment rate of blacks ages 20-24 with no high school diploma was 32%, compared to 6% for those with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2003c).\nIn today\u2019s workplace, only 40% of adults who dropped out of high school are employed, compared to 60% of adults who completed high school and 80% for those with a bachelor\u2019s degree (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2003c).\nEmployment projections indicate that jobs requiring only a high school diploma will grow by just 9% by the year 2008, while those requiring a bachelor\u2019s degree will grow by 25% (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2003e).\nCrime\n75% of America\u2019s state prison inmates are high school dropouts (Harlow, 2003).\n59% of America\u2019s federal prison inmates did not complete high school (Harlow, 2003).\nHigh school dropouts are 3.5 times more likely than high school graduates to be arrested in their lifetime (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2003a).\nA 1% increase in high school graduation rates would save approximately $1.4 billion in incarceration costs, or about $2,100 per each male high school graduate (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2003a).\nA one-year increase in average education levels would reduce arrest rates by 11% (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2003a).\nLiteracy\nThe cost to taxpayers of adult illiteracy is $224 billion per year (National Reading Panel, 1999).\nU.S. companies lose nearly $40 billion annually because of illiteracy (National Reading Panel, 1999).\nIf literacy levels in the United States were the same as those in Sweden, the U.S. GDP would rise by approximately $463 billion and tax revenues would increase by approximately $162 billion (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2003e).\nFor juveniles involved in quality reading instruction programs while in prison, recidivism was reduced by 20% or more (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2003a).\nHealth\nTeen girls in the bottom 20% of basic reading and math skills are five times more likely to become mothers over a two-year high school period than teen girls in the top 20% (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2003b).\nMale and female students with low academic achievement are twice as likely to become parents by their senior year of high school, compared to students with high academic achievement (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2003b).\nThe U.S. death rate for those with fewer than 12 years of education is 2.5 times higher than the rate of those with 13 or more years of education (alliance for Excellent Education, 2003b).\nReferences\nAlliance for Excellent Education.

      "The Socioeconomic Achievement Gap in the US Public Schools\nPhoto by Katerina Holmes\nBy Kate Bradley\nPublished Fall 2022\nSpecial thanks to Grace Wilson for editing and research contributions.\nSummary+\nImpoverished children are severely disadvantaged before even reaching adulthood. In public schools, lower-income children are significantly less likely to succeed than their wealthier classmates. Poverty affects a child\u2019s brain development, inhibiting their ability to learn and understand. In addition, lower-income students go to schools with insufficient funding and resources: quality teachers or the lack thereof increase the inability to provide for these students adequately. The achievement gap affects students by increasing dropout rates. It involves the nation by costing the US nearly $700 billion annually.1 Even more grave than the financial consequences is the loss of every student\u2014each with untold potential. Fortunately, something is being done. Early childhood education has proven to equip students with the tools before entering a public school. Each attempt to help a student, no matter what stage of education they\u2019re at, can help close the achievement gap.\nKey Takeaways+\nKey Terms+\nAchievement Gap\u2014A gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally, the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more on the lack of resources than student output.\nECE\u2014Early childhood education.\nHigh Poverty\u2014A term used to describe a school with a significant population of impoverished students. A school is considered high poverty when 75% or more of the student population qualifies for free or reduced lunch.3\nLongitudinal Study\u2014A study that tracks the same participants over a long period of time. In the context of education, longitudinal studies are used to study the same individuals for different variables, using a variety of measurements such as test scores or qualitative data.4\nSES\u2014An acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5 It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\nTitle I\u2014A rating system that indicates a school is eligible to receive Title I funding from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It typically means a school where 40% or more of the student population qualifies for free or reduced lunch. 70% of public schools receive some form of Title I funding.6\nContext\nQ: What is the socioeconomic and academic achievement gap?\n\nA: An achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.\n  occurs when any group of students performs at a statistically significantly\n  lower rate than another group of students. This gap can appear at the\n  individual student performance level as well as at the school test level.7\n  Achievement gaps can be measured by race, ethnicity, gender, or social class.\n  When lower-income students perform lower than their higher-income classmates,\n  there is a socioeconomic status (SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.) academic achievement gap.8\n\n\n  Research has confirmed that lower-income students perform worse in school as\n  measured by academic tests\u2014roughly 1 standard deviation lower, or about 3\n  academic years behind.9 Low\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students enter high school with average literacy skills 5 years behind their\n  high SES counterparts.10 low SES students are behind in reading and\n  math proficiency by 20\u201326 percentage points compared to high SES students.11\n  The success rate of low SES students in STEM fields is significantly lower\n  than high SES students.12 Lower\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students are also disciplined and suspended more frequently and attend class\n  less.13 The socioeconomic\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.\n  has been correlated with increased dropout rates (7.2% low SES students\n  compared to 3.6% mid and 3.9% high SES students), lower likelihood of college\n  graduation (14% compared to 60%), and a higher likelihood of\n  incarceration.14, 15, 16\n\n\n  Q: How is socioeconomic status defined and measured? Who qualifies as having\n  lower socioeconomic status?\n\n\nA: As defined by the National Assessment of Educational\n  Progress (NAEP), a congressionally mandated program overseen by the Department\n  of Education, socioeconomic status is the combination of social and economic\n  factors that indicate a child\u2019s household income or opportunity.17\n  A variety of data is used to calculate\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  as accurately as possible, including household size, family income, parental\n  occupation, and parental level of education.18 For example, one\n  common standard of measurement is that a child is considered impoverished if\n  their guardians earn less than $25,926.00 per year.19 Globally, SES\n  is measured through the child\u2019s parents or guardians\u2019 education and occupation\n  as well as the number of books in the home.20\n\n\n  When poverty is measured within the context of American public education, such\n  as when schools are considered for\n  Title IA rating system that indicates a school is eligible to receive Title I\n    funding from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It typically means\n    a school where 40% or more of the student population qualifies for free or\n    reduced lunch. 70% of public schools receive some form of Title I\n    funding.6\n  funding, those eligible for free and reduced-price lunch (FRPL) is a proxy\n  measurement of household income used by the government. This data is reliably\n  available at the school level, unlike the poverty rate, income level, and\n  occupation of parents.21 A student is eligible for free lunch if\n  their family income is 130% at or below the poverty level and eligible for\n  reduced lunch if their family income falls between 130\u2013185% of the poverty\n  level.22 For the 2021\u20132022 school year, the federal poverty\n  guideline used to determine FRPL was an annual income of $26,500.00 for a\n  family of 4.23 There has been recognition of the flaws of using\n  FRPL as a proxy poverty measurement. In some cases, some students who live\n  above the poverty rate may still be eligible for free or reduced lunch.24\n  These may be students within a foster program with disabilities or students\n  who attend a school that is eligible to provide free lunch and breakfast for\n  all students.25, 26 It should also be noted that federal lunch\n  eligibility was extended to all schoolchildren during the outbreak of the\n  COVID-19 pandemic. Still, FRPL is utilized today both at the national level of\n  statistical analysis and in academic studies.27\n\n\n  The eligibility of FRPL is also used to measure the poverty level of public\n  schools.28 A school is considered\n  high povertyA term used to describe a school with a significant population of\n    impoverished students. A school is considered high poverty when 75% or more\n    of the student population qualifies for free or reduced lunch.3\n  when 75% or more of the student population qualifies for free or reduced\n  lunch.29\n\nQ: Who in the US is most likely to experience the SES achievement gap?\n\nA: Geographically, 17 states have higher child-poverty rates\n  than the national average poverty rate for children. Of those 17 states, 13\n  were located in the South.30 For children living in poverty, the\n  highest poverty rate is in mother-only households, while the lowest is in\n  married-couple households. It is highest within families where parents have\n  not completed high school and lowest where either parent has completed a\n  bachelor\u2019s or higher degree. In 2018, 32% of Black children were living in\n  poverty, 31% of Native American children, 25% of Hispanic children, and 25% of\n  Pacific Islander children.31\n\n\n  It is important to note that many disadvantaged populations, such as racial\n  and ethnic minorities, are significantly related to the wealth disparity in\n  students. According to the 2020 Census Bureau, a disproportionate amount of\n  children of color live in poverty.32 Many minority groups\n  experience higher poverty rates than their white counterparts.33\n  This disparity means minority students are more vulnerable to low\n  socioeconomic status. However, although socioeconomic status and race are\n  congruent, they are not interchangeable; the focus of this brief is solely on\n  the socioeconomic achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.. Researchers have largely focused on the racial achievement gap, resulting\n  in a lack of scholarship regarding the socioeconomic achievement gap.34\n  In fact, the racial achievement gaps appear to be decreasing, while the\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  achievement gap remains stagnant or increasing.35 This decrease is\n  likely due to greater awareness of the racial\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.\n  among Americans and the creation of more legislation to address it in recent\n  years.36\n\nQ: How has the achievement gap evolved over the years?\n\nA: Though the SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\nachievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant.

Due to racism and biases, no action was taken to address the SES\n  achievement gap for many years because of the high correlation between race\n  and low SES. As late as 1995, some scholars falsely attributed low school\n  performance to biological inadequacy among different races and\n  ethnicities.37 However, the SES achievement gap was still monitored\n  throughout the years. Among a 1950s cohort of schoolchildren, low SES children\n  were 4 years behind their high SES peers.38\n\n\n  Current research disagrees with whether the\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\nachievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant.

It typically means\n    a school where 40% or more of the student population qualifies for free or\n    reduced lunch. 70% of public schools receive some form of Title I\n    funding.6\n  of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as part of President\n  Lyndon Johnson\u2019s \u201cwar on poverty\u201d in 1965. The act offered grants to\n  lower-income school districts.44 This is why schools that receive\n  federal funding today are called Title 1 schools.

If schools consistently failed state and national standards for\n  at least 3 consecutive years, then the schools had to use Title I funding to\n  help lower-income students find resources or other options in the public or\n  private sector.46 The NCLB act focuses on literacy rates,\n  assessment of Title IA rating system that indicates a school is eligible to receive Title I\n    funding from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It typically means\n    a school where 40% or more of the student population qualifies for free or\n    reduced lunch. 70% of public schools receive some form of Title I\n    funding.6, and dropout prevention among disadvantaged students.47 At the\n  end of 2015, the Department of Education passed the Every Student Succeeds\n  Act, which focused on the equity of opportunity and allocating resources more\n  equally across schools in order to decrease the achievement gap. Despite these\n  policies and acts, there has been no significant nationwide decrease in the\n  SES achievement gap.\n\nQ: Where is the socioeconomic achievement gap prominent?\n\n  The socioeconomic achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.\n  exists in all countries to varying degrees; low\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students perform worse than their high SES peers in each country.\n  Additionally, a study comparing the international exams from 1964\u20132015 found\n  that the SES achievement gap is increasing globally.48 For\n  instance, low SES high school students in Canada performed 8% worse than their\n  high SES peers in mathematics and 9% worse in English.49 However,\n  for the purpose of this brief, we will focus on trends within the US.50\n\n\n  The research does not seem to indicate any significant trends by region in the\n  US, although more children live in poverty in the South.51 The\n  socioeconomic achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.\n  is also larger in areas near or within Native American reservations due to the\n  greater prevalence of poverty among indigenous reservations.52\n  Overall, low SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  is an issue everywhere in the US.\n\n\n  As mentioned previously, 34 of the 50 United States have shown no significant\n  change in the SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\nachievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant.

About 92% of public school funding comes through\n  state and local funding, with a wide range between states.54 For\n  example, the per pupil expenditure (PPE) in Massachusetts was 145% more than\n  the national average in the 2017\u20132018 school year. In comparison, Mississippi\n  and other states spend significantly less than the national average on\n  pupils.55 State funding for public schools varies widely between\n  states, mirroring the varied academic achievement of state schools. The\n  following paragraphs focus on 4 states that exemplify a variety of\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  achievement gap trends. The analysis includes 2019 NAEP mathematics test\n  scores for both high and low-income 8th graders. For comparison, the national\n  average score was 282.\n\n\n  Massachusetts has some of the highest PPE but also high socioeconomic status\n  and the highest test scores (1.18 grade levels above the average).56\n  While the achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant.

Diminished or harmed brain development can lead to\n  cognitive impairment. One study found that by age 5, just as children enter\n  school, impoverished children already experienced a significant difference in\n  cognitive skills than wealthier children, which only accumulated as the child\n  ages.78 A longitudinal studyA study that tracks the same participants over a long period of time. In\n    the context of education, longitudinal studies are used to study the same\n    individuals for different variables, using a variety of measurements such as\n    test scores or qualitative data.4\n  from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that lower-income infants\n  and toddlers had a significantly smaller amount of gray matter than their\n  higher-income peers over time.79 Gray matter is where all the\n  thinking processes, as well as motor control, happen within the brain.80\n  Having a smaller amount of gray matter is correlated with lower cognitive,\n  memory, and motor function.81 This finding is also concurrent with\n  another study, which showed that impoverished children ages 4\u201318 had the least\n  gray matter, the greatest delay in brain development, and the poorest academic\n  achievement compared to other children.82\n\n\n  Apart from cognitive development issues, poverty can negatively affect\n  students emotionally, which leads to behavioral issues that can negatively\n  affect their academics. Due to the brain being stressed for such long periods\n  of time, the child is more likely to overreact in low-stress situations.83\n  Additionally, a child\u2019s ability to regulate emotion and attention is affected,\n  as well as their ability to develop the mental process necessary for\n  remembering instructions, juggling tasks, and paying attention.84, 85\n  Students may act out or lack proper social skills in a school environment,86\n  which can affect academic performance. These negative effects on the cognitive\n  brain of the child lead to a lowered ability to control behavior and plan\n  ahead.87 These behaviors can widen the\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.\n  because they cause a spiral that leads to more punishment and less time in\n  class. For example, 35% of male students in low\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  schools were disciplined as compared to only 24% of their higher SES peers in\n  a 2006 study.88 Additionally, a 2014 study done by Indiana\n  University\u2019s Equity Project showed that low SES students receive higher rates\n  of out-of-school suspension.89\n\nInsufficient Funding and Lack of Resources\n\n  Insufficient funding and lack of resources also play an important role in the\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.. Low SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students do not have the same resources as their wealthier peers, so their\n  likelihood of academic success is limited. Since school funding comes from the\n  property taxes of the area, schools surrounded by lower-income families (who\n  own smaller, less-taxed properties) receive less funding from the local\n  community.90 In 2018, the US spent about $1,000.00 less per pupil\n  in a low SES school district than in a high SES district.91 One\n  report found that 263 districts nationwide did not consider the number of\n  impoverished children as an important factor when distributing funding.92\n  When school funding is allocated more equally across the school districts,\n  high and lower-income, the test score gap is smaller between lower-income\n  students and their wealthier peers.93\n\nPhoto by Oleksandr Pidvalnyi \n\n  Beyond funding, a lack of resources impacts students\u2019 opportunities for\n  academic success. High-poverty schools struggle to overcome obstacles that\n  low-poverty schools don\u2019t have. For example, there is a high teacher turnover\n  rate in high-poverty schools. Plus, less-experienced, cheap-to-hire teachers\n  tend to work at high-poverty schools, which contributes to the socioeconomic\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.\n  because teachers with multiple years of experience are more successful at\n  helping students perform well.94 In high school, fewer AP courses\n  are offered in lower-income high schools. Students from low\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  backgrounds are less likely to have access to informational materials about\n  college.95 Low SES schools have significantly fewer library\n  resources than high SES schools, including fewer full-time librarians and\n  fewer books added per year.96, 97, 98 Ultimately, the lack of\n  community funding and fewer resources limits the likelihood of success among\n  low SES students.\n\nInadequate Teacher Training and Retention\n\n  Public school teachers receive no specific training for lower\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students to meet students' needs, which perpetuates the\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.. Unique needs for low SES students include specialized tutoring, more staff\n  in the classroom,99 and parent intervention.100 Highly\n  qualified teachers are defined by their degree and certification, but no\n  requirement for poverty training.101 Poverty training mainly\n  entails educating teachers about their poverty biases and unpacking poverty\n  myths. Although there are a variety of nonprofit organizations that offer\n  accreditation in poverty training,102 there is little motivation\n  for teachers to get trained since there is no requirement.103 A\n  teacher may be considered highly qualified to teach children but lack any\n  preparation for the unique needs of low socioeconomic students.\n\n\n  Cross-cultural communication creates dissonance between lower-income students\n  and their teachers, whose perspective typically comes from a middle-class\n  demographic.104 In the 2017\u20132018 school year, 58% of public school\n  teachers held a post-baccalaureate degree and an average base salary of\n  $57,900.00.105 Most low SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students come from families with little formal education that may struggle to\n  relate to their teachers\u2019 expectations. A 2019 interview of teachers in\n  Pennsylvania found that teachers recognized the indirect sources of poor\n  academic achievement in low SES students (such as lack of food or poor\n  hygiene) but consistently disregarded the more important reasons for poor\n  achievement (such as parent involvement and home life).106\n\n\n  Many teachers feel poorly prepared to teach in low-income schools and lack the\n  time and resources to provide the attention that lower-income students\n  need.107 Few teachers change their curriculum to best suit the\n  needs of their lower-income students, even in\n  Title IA rating system that indicates a school is eligible to receive Title I\n    funding from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It typically means\n    a school where 40% or more of the student population qualifies for free or\n    reduced lunch. 70% of public schools receive some form of Title I\n    funding.6\n  schools where the majority of students are considered impoverished.108\n\n\n  In addition, high-poverty schools lack the resources to facilitate teaching\n  students with learning challenges, which can negatively affect academic\n  success. One study found that teachers determined low\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students to have more subjective learning disabilities (such as an emotional\n  disability) at around twice the rate as their wealthier classmates.109\n  Similarly, children from low SES backgrounds are twice as likely to exhibit\n  behavioral issues in schools, like inattention, disinterest, and a lack of\n  cooperation, than their peers from higher SES backgrounds.110 Many\n  teachers do not have the preparation to be able to recognize misbehavior as a\n  learning disability or trauma. Impoverished students are less likely to be\n  diagnosed with learning challenges like ADHD, which makes it difficult for\n  teachers to accommodate.111 Many teachers choose to send low SES\n  students into special needs education programs instead of addressing the\n  student\u2019s learning issues stemming from their socioeconomic status. These\n  unique accommodations take up a teacher\u2019s time and emotional resources, often\n  leading to frustration and increased amounts of teachers leaving to find work\n  elsewhere.\n\n\n  These differences in culture often lead teachers to leave the school or the\n  profession entirely,112 which can lead to poor academic results in\n  low SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students. When teachers leave high-poverty schools, the disruption has a\n  negative effect on students, who must then adapt to new teachers\u2019 teaching\n  styles and methods. Schools with high teacher turnover rates perform worse\n  than schools with low turnover rates; one study found that when teacher\n  turnover rates were high, students\u2019 mathematics scores declined from 8.2% to\n  10.2%.113 Turnover rate is a serious issue among high-poverty\n  schools: 39% of high-poverty schools experience the highest rates of teacher\n  turnover as opposed to only 13% of low-poverty schools.114\n  Therefore, teachers who are hired at these high-poverty schools are less\n  likely to have the experience and accreditation of a wealthier, better-funded\n  school. This teacher quality gap and high turnover rate result in disrupted\n  student learning ability and perpetuates the SES\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant.

In the short term, the achievement gap costs the US money\n  because high-poverty schools require more funding in an effort to decrease the\n  achievement gap with their more wealthy counterparts.115 In 2019,\n  the government, through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, granted\n  over $15 billion to low SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students who are most at risk of failing or are failing academically.116\n  The achievement gap has cost the US economy more than all the combined\n  recessions since the 1970s.117 If the US had eliminated the\n  socioeconomic achievement gap by 1998, the US GDP in 2008 would have increased\n  by $700 billion because of increased potential economic growth.118\n\n\n  Additionally, the achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant.

Each\n  student has the potential to work and provide value to the US economy and\n  therefore raise the value of the GDP. In countries where students perform well\n  in subjects such as math and science, economic growth and productivity are\n  greater than in those countries that do not provide such opportunities to\n  learn.119 Even so, the achievement gap stifles the potential of\n  thousands of profitable workers, and human capital is the base of the US\n  economic system.120 The potential of all the students in the public\n  education system is staggering, but the achievement gap decreases the\n  fulfillment of that potential, which is a costly disadvantage.\n\nPerpetuation of Poverty\n\n  One of the most debilitating effects of the socioeconomic\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant.

In 2012, a longitudinal studyA study that tracks the same participants over a long period of time. In\n    the context of education, longitudinal studies are used to study the same\n    individuals for different variables, using a variety of measurements such as\n    test scores or qualitative data.4\n  found that 16% of low SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  third graders who are not reading proficiently will not graduate high school\n  on time.121 Even those of lower income who are proficient readers\n  in third grade, 11% still don\u2019t finish high school.122 Impoverished\n  students already have to deal with higher insecurity that leads to a higher\n  dropout rate, including homelessness, job security, and family\n  instability.123 The socioeconomic class of a student directly\n  correlates with the dropout rate. A low-income student is 5 times more likely\n  to drop out of high school.124 In 2014, 11.6% of low-income\n  families had a high school dropout compared to 2.8% of high-income\n  families.125 According to the American Psychological Association,\n  this dropout can also be reflected in higher education; students who come from\n  families that earn the top 25% of income are 8 times more likely to receive a\n  degree than students from the bottom 25%.126 The achievement gap\n  persists in creating a high dropout rate for lower-income families.\n\n\n  Dropping out perpetuates poverty in lower-income families by impeding\n  employment, limiting salaries, and increasing the poverty rate of children in\n  the home. As more employers require higher credentials for employment and\n  lower-skilled job opportunities are shrinking, high school dropouts are\n  struggling to find and remain employed.127 The rate of unemployment\n  for high school dropouts is over 50%.128 Often these jobs are\n  unstable, with fewer benefits. Even if a high school dropout is employed, a\n  high school dropout aged 25\u201334 will earn about $26,000.00, while their peers\n  who have completed high school will earn about $32,000.00.129 The\n  dropout rate maintains poverty in the next generation as well. The poverty\n  rate for a child where neither parent has received a high school diploma is\n  43%. In comparison, in a family where either parent has a college degree, the\n  poverty rate is 4%.130\n\nPractices\nEarly Education\n\n  Poverty can disadvantage students at an early age, setting them up for failure\n  well before they enter the public education system. Impoverished children are\n  less likely to be read to and spoken to less before entering public\n  school.131 Early childhood education provides structure during a\n  foundational stage: the development of a child\u2019s cognitive, social, and\n  emotional skills.132 In this period, children are highly influenced\n  by the people and environment around them.133 Some early education\n  options include government-funded organizations such as Head Start or private\n  preschools.\n\n\n  Early education can help provide equal footing for children growing up in\n  lower-income households. Early education teaches students vocabulary, social\n  skills, and basic reading and math exposure. It also provides working parents\n  with a safe place for children to attend during work hours. However, only 19%\n  of low-income families enroll in high-quality early childhood education, while\n  29% of high-income families do.134\n\n\n  Research has shown that early education can have a meaningful impact on\n  impoverished children, both in the short term and the long term. In the short\n  term, early childhood education helps prepare students by developing their\n  social, emotional, and cognitive growth.135 One study found that\n  while students enrolled in ECEEarly childhood education.\n  tended not to receive better SAT or test scores, early education did affect\n  their social and mental well-being.136 This study accounted for the\n  variety of long-term success in students that matriculate in some form of\n  preschool.\n\n\n  In the long term, students who have received early education tend to minimize\n  threats that could potentially prolong their impoverished situation. Children\n  of the Perry Preschool Project, a research study conducted in the 1960s to see\n  if positive experiences in preschool had an impact on later school\n  performance, were significantly more likely to have graduated from high school\n  (66% versus 45%) and half as likely to have an unwanted teen pregnancy. By age\n  40, the participants were 46% less likely to be incarcerated or 33% less\n  likely to have committed a violent crime. A researcher studied the children of\n  these participants and also found the children to be less at-risk.137\n  More recently, a 2017 study reiterated that children who receive\n  ECEEarly childhood education.\n  are 22% less likely to be held behind and 74% more likely to graduate.138\n  The best practice of Early Childhood Education directly impacts significant\n  negative consequences of the\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant.

So what are the underlying causes? And how does every student who does not earn a high school diploma hurt society as a whole?\u00a0 My hope is that in discovering shared traits among dropouts, we can achieve higher high school graduation rates as a nation.\nWhy are students dropping out?\nOne unchanging factor when it comes to the dropout rate is socioeconomic background. Since the National Center for Education Statistics first started tracking different groups of high school students in the late 1960s, the socioeconomic status of each pupil has impacted the graduation rate. Students from low-income families are 2.4 times more likely to drop out than middle-income kids, and over 10 times more likely than high-income peers to drop out.\nHousehold income is the not the only disadvantage many dropouts have, though. Students with learning or physical disabilities drop out at a rate of 36 percent. Some behaviors that are often characteristic in dropouts include being retained from advancing a grade level with peers, relocating during the high school years and the general feeling of being left out or alienated by peers or adults at the school. Overall, a student who does not fit the traditional classroom mold, or who falls behind for some reason, is more likely to lose motivation when it comes to high school and decide to give up altogether.\nHow valuable is a high school diploma?\nThe U.S. Census Bureau estimates that dropouts bring in just $20,241 annually, which is $10,000 less than high school graduates and over $36,000 less than a person holding a bachelor\u2019s degree. The poverty rate for dropouts is over twice as high as college grads, and the unemployment rate for dropouts is generally 4 percentage points higher than the national average. In the end, the lifetime earnings of high school dropouts are $260,000 LESS than peers who earn a diploma.\nWhy should I care?\nThe financial ramifications of dropping out of high school hurt more than the individual. It\u2019s estimated that half of all Americans on public assistance are dropouts. If all of the dropouts from the class of 2011 had earned diplomas, the nation would benefit from an estimated $154 billion in income over their working lifetimes. Potentially feeding that number is the fact that young women who give up on high school are nine times more likely to be, or become, young single mothers. A study out of Northeastern University found that high school dropouts cost taxpayers $292,000 over the course of their lives.\nIt\u2019s not just about the money though. Over 80 percent of the incarcerated population is high school dropouts \u2013 making this an issue that truly impacts every member of the community. Numbers are higher for dropouts of color; 22 percent of people jailed in the U.S. are black males who are high school dropouts. As a society, we are not just paying into public assistance programs for dropouts, but we are paying to protect ourselves against them through incarceration.\nI wonder what these numbers would look like if we took the nearly $300K that taxpayers put in over the course of a dropout\u2019s lifetime and deposited it into their K-12 learning upfront. If we invested that money, or even half of it, into efforts to enhance the learning experience and programs to prevent dropping out, what would that do to dropout, poverty and incarceration rates? Right now the process seems to be reactionary. What would it look like if more preventative actions were put in place?\nWhat are some underlying causes of the high school dropout rate not mentioned here?\nphoto credit: ralph and jenny via photopin cc\nWhy the U.S. College Landscape Still Needs ...\nHow to Put Together a District-Level Reform ...\nMatthew Lynch\n\nRelated articles\nMore from author\n\nSearch\nRegistration and Login\nNewsletter\nSignup for The Edvocate Newsletter and have the latest in P-20 education news and opinion delivered to your email address!\n\n\n\nEmail address: \n\n\n\nFirst Name\n\n\n\nLast Name\n\n\n\n\n\n Matthew on Education Week\nAbout Us\nThe Edvocate was created in 2014 to argue for shifts in education policy and organization in order to enhance the quality of education and the opportunities for learning afforded to P-20 students in America.

      "The Socioeconomic Achievement Gap in the US Public Schools\nPhoto by Katerina Holmes\nBy Kate Bradley\nPublished Fall 2022\nSpecial thanks to Grace Wilson for editing and research contributions.\nSummary+\nImpoverished children are severely disadvantaged before even reaching adulthood. In public schools, lower-income children are significantly less likely to succeed than their wealthier classmates. Poverty affects a child\u2019s brain development, inhibiting their ability to learn and understand. In addition, lower-income students go to schools with insufficient funding and resources: quality teachers or the lack thereof increase the inability to provide for these students adequately. The achievement gap affects students by increasing dropout rates. It involves the nation by costing the US nearly $700 billion annually.1 Even more grave than the financial consequences is the loss of every student\u2014each with untold potential. Fortunately, something is being done. Early childhood education has proven to equip students with the tools before entering a public school. Each attempt to help a student, no matter what stage of education they\u2019re at, can help close the achievement gap.\nKey Takeaways+\nKey Terms+\nAchievement Gap\u2014A gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally, the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more on the lack of resources than student output.\nECE\u2014Early childhood education.\nHigh Poverty\u2014A term used to describe a school with a significant population of impoverished students. A school is considered high poverty when 75% or more of the student population qualifies for free or reduced lunch.3\nLongitudinal Study\u2014A study that tracks the same participants over a long period of time. In the context of education, longitudinal studies are used to study the same individuals for different variables, using a variety of measurements such as test scores or qualitative data.4\nSES\u2014An acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5 It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\nTitle I\u2014A rating system that indicates a school is eligible to receive Title I funding from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It typically means a school where 40% or more of the student population qualifies for free or reduced lunch. 70% of public schools receive some form of Title I funding.6\nContext\nQ: What is the socioeconomic and academic achievement gap?\n\nA: An achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.\n  occurs when any group of students performs at a statistically significantly\n  lower rate than another group of students. This gap can appear at the\n  individual student performance level as well as at the school test level.7\n  Achievement gaps can be measured by race, ethnicity, gender, or social class.\n  When lower-income students perform lower than their higher-income classmates,\n  there is a socioeconomic status (SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.) academic achievement gap.8\n\n\n  Research has confirmed that lower-income students perform worse in school as\n  measured by academic tests\u2014roughly 1 standard deviation lower, or about 3\n  academic years behind.9 Low\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students enter high school with average literacy skills 5 years behind their\n  high SES counterparts.10 low SES students are behind in reading and\n  math proficiency by 20\u201326 percentage points compared to high SES students.11\n  The success rate of low SES students in STEM fields is significantly lower\n  than high SES students.12 Lower\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students are also disciplined and suspended more frequently and attend class\n  less.13 The socioeconomic\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.\n  has been correlated with increased dropout rates (7.2% low SES students\n  compared to 3.6% mid and 3.9% high SES students), lower likelihood of college\n  graduation (14% compared to 60%), and a higher likelihood of\n  incarceration.14, 15, 16\n\n\n  Q: How is socioeconomic status defined and measured? Who qualifies as having\n  lower socioeconomic status?\n\n\nA: As defined by the National Assessment of Educational\n  Progress (NAEP), a congressionally mandated program overseen by the Department\n  of Education, socioeconomic status is the combination of social and economic\n  factors that indicate a child\u2019s household income or opportunity.17\n  A variety of data is used to calculate\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  as accurately as possible, including household size, family income, parental\n  occupation, and parental level of education.18 For example, one\n  common standard of measurement is that a child is considered impoverished if\n  their guardians earn less than $25,926.00 per year.19 Globally, SES\n  is measured through the child\u2019s parents or guardians\u2019 education and occupation\n  as well as the number of books in the home.20\n\n\n  When poverty is measured within the context of American public education, such\n  as when schools are considered for\n  Title IA rating system that indicates a school is eligible to receive Title I\n    funding from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It typically means\n    a school where 40% or more of the student population qualifies for free or\n    reduced lunch. 70% of public schools receive some form of Title I\n    funding.6\n  funding, those eligible for free and reduced-price lunch (FRPL) is a proxy\n  measurement of household income used by the government. This data is reliably\n  available at the school level, unlike the poverty rate, income level, and\n  occupation of parents.21 A student is eligible for free lunch if\n  their family income is 130% at or below the poverty level and eligible for\n  reduced lunch if their family income falls between 130\u2013185% of the poverty\n  level.22 For the 2021\u20132022 school year, the federal poverty\n  guideline used to determine FRPL was an annual income of $26,500.00 for a\n  family of 4.23 There has been recognition of the flaws of using\n  FRPL as a proxy poverty measurement. In some cases, some students who live\n  above the poverty rate may still be eligible for free or reduced lunch.24\n  These may be students within a foster program with disabilities or students\n  who attend a school that is eligible to provide free lunch and breakfast for\n  all students.25, 26 It should also be noted that federal lunch\n  eligibility was extended to all schoolchildren during the outbreak of the\n  COVID-19 pandemic. Still, FRPL is utilized today both at the national level of\n  statistical analysis and in academic studies.27\n\n\n  The eligibility of FRPL is also used to measure the poverty level of public\n  schools.28 A school is considered\n  high povertyA term used to describe a school with a significant population of\n    impoverished students. A school is considered high poverty when 75% or more\n    of the student population qualifies for free or reduced lunch.3\n  when 75% or more of the student population qualifies for free or reduced\n  lunch.29\n\nQ: Who in the US is most likely to experience the SES achievement gap?\n\nA: Geographically, 17 states have higher child-poverty rates\n  than the national average poverty rate for children. Of those 17 states, 13\n  were located in the South.30 For children living in poverty, the\n  highest poverty rate is in mother-only households, while the lowest is in\n  married-couple households. It is highest within families where parents have\n  not completed high school and lowest where either parent has completed a\n  bachelor\u2019s or higher degree. In 2018, 32% of Black children were living in\n  poverty, 31% of Native American children, 25% of Hispanic children, and 25% of\n  Pacific Islander children.31\n\n\n  It is important to note that many disadvantaged populations, such as racial\n  and ethnic minorities, are significantly related to the wealth disparity in\n  students. According to the 2020 Census Bureau, a disproportionate amount of\n  children of color live in poverty.32 Many minority groups\n  experience higher poverty rates than their white counterparts.33\n  This disparity means minority students are more vulnerable to low\n  socioeconomic status. However, although socioeconomic status and race are\n  congruent, they are not interchangeable; the focus of this brief is solely on\n  the socioeconomic achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.. Researchers have largely focused on the racial achievement gap, resulting\n  in a lack of scholarship regarding the socioeconomic achievement gap.34\n  In fact, the racial achievement gaps appear to be decreasing, while the\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  achievement gap remains stagnant or increasing.35 This decrease is\n  likely due to greater awareness of the racial\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant.

Due to racism and biases, no action was taken to address the SES\n  achievement gap for many years because of the high correlation between race\n  and low SES. As late as 1995, some scholars falsely attributed low school\n  performance to biological inadequacy among different races and\n  ethnicities.37 However, the SES achievement gap was still monitored\n  throughout the years. Among a 1950s cohort of schoolchildren, low SES children\n  were 4 years behind their high SES peers.38\n\n\n  Current research disagrees with whether the\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\nachievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant.

If schools consistently failed state and national standards for\n  at least 3 consecutive years, then the schools had to use Title I funding to\n  help lower-income students find resources or other options in the public or\n  private sector.46 The NCLB act focuses on literacy rates,\n  assessment of Title IA rating system that indicates a school is eligible to receive Title I\n    funding from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

Despite these\n  policies and acts, there has been no significant nationwide decrease in the\n  SES achievement gap.\n\nQ: Where is the socioeconomic achievement gap prominent?\n\n  The socioeconomic achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.\n  exists in all countries to varying degrees; low\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students perform worse than their high SES peers in each country.\n  Additionally, a study comparing the international exams from 1964\u20132015 found\n  that the SES achievement gap is increasing globally.48 For\n  instance, low SES high school students in Canada performed 8% worse than their\n  high SES peers in mathematics and 9% worse in English.49 However,\n  for the purpose of this brief, we will focus on trends within the US.50\n\n\n  The research does not seem to indicate any significant trends by region in the\n  US, although more children live in poverty in the South.51 The\n  socioeconomic achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant.

About 92% of public school funding comes through\n  state and local funding, with a wide range between states.54 For\n  example, the per pupil expenditure (PPE) in Massachusetts was 145% more than\n  the national average in the 2017\u20132018 school year. In comparison, Mississippi\n  and other states spend significantly less than the national average on\n  pupils.55 State funding for public schools varies widely between\n  states, mirroring the varied academic achievement of state schools.

Diminished or harmed brain development can lead to\n  cognitive impairment. One study found that by age 5, just as children enter\n  school, impoverished children already experienced a significant difference in\n  cognitive skills than wealthier children, which only accumulated as the child\n  ages.78 A longitudinal studyA study that tracks the same participants over a long period of time. In\n    the context of education, longitudinal studies are used to study the same\n    individuals for different variables, using a variety of measurements such as\n    test scores or qualitative data.4\n  from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that lower-income infants\n  and toddlers had a significantly smaller amount of gray matter than their\n  higher-income peers over time.79 Gray matter is where all the\n  thinking processes, as well as motor control, happen within the brain.80\n  Having a smaller amount of gray matter is correlated with lower cognitive,\n  memory, and motor function.81 This finding is also concurrent with\n  another study, which showed that impoverished children ages 4\u201318 had the least\n  gray matter, the greatest delay in brain development, and the poorest academic\n  achievement compared to other children.82\n\n\n  Apart from cognitive development issues, poverty can negatively affect\n  students emotionally, which leads to behavioral issues that can negatively\n  affect their academics. Due to the brain being stressed for such long periods\n  of time, the child is more likely to overreact in low-stress situations.83\n  Additionally, a child\u2019s ability to regulate emotion and attention is affected,\n  as well as their ability to develop the mental process necessary for\n  remembering instructions, juggling tasks, and paying attention.84, 85\n  Students may act out or lack proper social skills in a school environment,86\n  which can affect academic performance. These negative effects on the cognitive\n  brain of the child lead to a lowered ability to control behavior and plan\n  ahead.87 These behaviors can widen the\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.\n  because they cause a spiral that leads to more punishment and less time in\n  class. For example, 35% of male students in low\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  schools were disciplined as compared to only 24% of their higher SES peers in\n  a 2006 study.88 Additionally, a 2014 study done by Indiana\n  University\u2019s Equity Project showed that low SES students receive higher rates\n  of out-of-school suspension.89\n\nInsufficient Funding and Lack of Resources\n\n  Insufficient funding and lack of resources also play an important role in the\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant.

Low SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students do not have the same resources as their wealthier peers, so their\n  likelihood of academic success is limited. Since school funding comes from the\n  property taxes of the area, schools surrounded by lower-income families (who\n  own smaller, less-taxed properties) receive less funding from the local\n  community.90 In 2018, the US spent about $1,000.00 less per pupil\n  in a low SES school district than in a high SES district.91 One\n  report found that 263 districts nationwide did not consider the number of\n  impoverished children as an important factor when distributing funding.92\n  When school funding is allocated more equally across the school districts,\n  high and lower-income, the test score gap is smaller between lower-income\n  students and their wealthier peers.93\n\nPhoto by Oleksandr Pidvalnyi \n\n  Beyond funding, a lack of resources impacts students\u2019 opportunities for\n  academic success. High-poverty schools struggle to overcome obstacles that\n  low-poverty schools don\u2019t have. For example, there is a high teacher turnover\n  rate in high-poverty schools. Plus, less-experienced, cheap-to-hire teachers\n  tend to work at high-poverty schools, which contributes to the socioeconomic\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.\n  because teachers with multiple years of experience are more successful at\n  helping students perform well.94 In high school, fewer AP courses\n  are offered in lower-income high schools. Students from low\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  backgrounds are less likely to have access to informational materials about\n  college.95 Low SES schools have significantly fewer library\n  resources than high SES schools, including fewer full-time librarians and\n  fewer books added per year.96, 97, 98 Ultimately, the lack of\n  community funding and fewer resources limits the likelihood of success among\n  low SES students.\n\nInadequate Teacher Training and Retention\n\n  Public school teachers receive no specific training for lower\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students to meet students' needs, which perpetuates the\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.. Unique needs for low SES students include specialized tutoring, more staff\n  in the classroom,99 and parent intervention.100 Highly\n  qualified teachers are defined by their degree and certification, but no\n  requirement for poverty training.101 Poverty training mainly\n  entails educating teachers about their poverty biases and unpacking poverty\n  myths. Although there are a variety of nonprofit organizations that offer\n  accreditation in poverty training,102 there is little motivation\n  for teachers to get trained since there is no requirement.103 A\n  teacher may be considered highly qualified to teach children but lack any\n  preparation for the unique needs of low socioeconomic students.\n\n\n  Cross-cultural communication creates dissonance between lower-income students\n  and their teachers, whose perspective typically comes from a middle-class\n  demographic.104 In the 2017\u20132018 school year, 58% of public school\n  teachers held a post-baccalaureate degree and an average base salary of\n  $57,900.00.105 Most low SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students come from families with little formal education that may struggle to\n  relate to their teachers\u2019 expectations. A 2019 interview of teachers in\n  Pennsylvania found that teachers recognized the indirect sources of poor\n  academic achievement in low SES students (such as lack of food or poor\n  hygiene) but consistently disregarded the more important reasons for poor\n  achievement (such as parent involvement and home life).106\n\n\n  Many teachers feel poorly prepared to teach in low-income schools and lack the\n  time and resources to provide the attention that lower-income students\n  need.107 Few teachers change their curriculum to best suit the\n  needs of their lower-income students, even in\n  Title IA rating system that indicates a school is eligible to receive Title I\n    funding from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It typically means\n    a school where 40% or more of the student population qualifies for free or\n    reduced lunch. 70% of public schools receive some form of Title I\n    funding.6\n  schools where the majority of students are considered impoverished.108\n\n\n  In addition, high-poverty schools lack the resources to facilitate teaching\n  students with learning challenges, which can negatively affect academic\n  success. One study found that teachers determined low\n  SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students to have more subjective learning disabilities (such as an emotional\n  disability) at around twice the rate as their wealthier classmates.109\n  Similarly, children from low SES backgrounds are twice as likely to exhibit\n  behavioral issues in schools, like inattention, disinterest, and a lack of\n  cooperation, than their peers from higher SES backgrounds.110 Many\n  teachers do not have the preparation to be able to recognize misbehavior as a\n  learning disability or trauma. Impoverished students are less likely to be\n  diagnosed with learning challenges like ADHD, which makes it difficult for\n  teachers to accommodate.111 Many teachers choose to send low SES\n  students into special needs education programs instead of addressing the\n  student\u2019s learning issues stemming from their socioeconomic status. These\n  unique accommodations take up a teacher\u2019s time and emotional resources, often\n  leading to frustration and increased amounts of teachers leaving to find work\n  elsewhere.\n\n\n  These differences in culture often lead teachers to leave the school or the\n  profession entirely,112 which can lead to poor academic results in\n  low SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students. When teachers leave high-poverty schools, the disruption has a\n  negative effect on students, who must then adapt to new teachers\u2019 teaching\n  styles and methods. Schools with high teacher turnover rates perform worse\n  than schools with low turnover rates; one study found that when teacher\n  turnover rates were high, students\u2019 mathematics scores declined from 8.2% to\n  10.2%.113 Turnover rate is a serious issue among high-poverty\n  schools: 39% of high-poverty schools experience the highest rates of teacher\n  turnover as opposed to only 13% of low-poverty schools.114\n  Therefore, teachers who are hired at these high-poverty schools are less\n  likely to have the experience and accreditation of a wealthier, better-funded\n  school. This teacher quality gap and high turnover rate result in disrupted\n  student learning ability and perpetuates the SES\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant.

In the short term, the achievement gap costs the US money\n  because high-poverty schools require more funding in an effort to decrease the\n  achievement gap with their more wealthy counterparts.115 In 2019,\n  the government, through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, granted\n  over $15 billion to low SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  students who are most at risk of failing or are failing academically.116\n  The achievement gap has cost the US economy more than all the combined\n  recessions since the 1970s.117 If the US had eliminated the\n  socioeconomic achievement gap by 1998, the US GDP in 2008 would have increased\n  by $700 billion because of increased potential economic growth.118\n\n\n  Additionally, the achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.\n  limits the potential for long-term economic growth in the United States. Each\n  student has the potential to work and provide value to the US economy and\n  therefore raise the value of the GDP. In countries where students perform well\n  in subjects such as math and science, economic growth and productivity are\n  greater than in those countries that do not provide such opportunities to\n  learn.119 Even so, the achievement gap stifles the potential of\n  thousands of profitable workers, and human capital is the base of the US\n  economic system.120 The potential of all the students in the public\n  education system is staggering, but the achievement gap decreases the\n  fulfillment of that potential, which is a costly disadvantage.\n\nPerpetuation of Poverty\n\n  One of the most debilitating effects of the socioeconomic\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output.\n  is the continuance of chronic poverty, mainly through the high school dropout\n  rate. In 2012, a longitudinal studyA study that tracks the same participants over a long period of time. In\n    the context of education, longitudinal studies are used to study the same\n    individuals for different variables, using a variety of measurements such as\n    test scores or qualitative data.4\n  found that 16% of low SESAn acronym frequently used that stands for socioeconomic status.5\n    It can reference any socioeconomic class, such as low SES or high SES.\n  third graders who are not reading proficiently will not graduate high school\n  on time.121 Even those of lower income who are proficient readers\n  in third grade, 11% still don\u2019t finish high school.122 Impoverished\n  students already have to deal with higher insecurity that leads to a higher\n  dropout rate, including homelessness, job security, and family\n  instability.123 The socioeconomic class of a student directly\n  correlates with the dropout rate. A low-income student is 5 times more likely\n  to drop out of high school.124 In 2014, 11.6% of low-income\n  families had a high school dropout compared to 2.8% of high-income\n  families.125 According to the American Psychological Association,\n  this dropout can also be reflected in higher education; students who come from\n  families that earn the top 25% of income are 8 times more likely to receive a\n  degree than students from the bottom 25%.126 The achievement gap\n  persists in creating a high dropout rate for lower-income families.\n\n\n  Dropping out perpetuates poverty in lower-income families by impeding\n  employment, limiting salaries, and increasing the poverty rate of children in\n  the home. As more employers require higher credentials for employment and\n  lower-skilled job opportunities are shrinking, high school dropouts are\n  struggling to find and remain employed.127 The rate of unemployment\n  for high school dropouts is over 50%.128 Often these jobs are\n  unstable, with fewer benefits. Even if a high school dropout is employed, a\n  high school dropout aged 25\u201334 will earn about $26,000.00, while their peers\n  who have completed high school will earn about $32,000.00.129 The\n  dropout rate maintains poverty in the next generation as well. The poverty\n  rate for a child where neither parent has received a high school diploma is\n  43%. In comparison, in a family where either parent has a college degree, the\n  poverty rate is 4%.130\n\nPractices\nEarly Education\n\n  Poverty can disadvantage students at an early age, setting them up for failure\n  well before they enter the public education system. Impoverished children are\n  less likely to be read to and spoken to less before entering public\n  school.131 Early childhood education provides structure during a\n  foundational stage: the development of a child\u2019s cognitive, social, and\n  emotional skills.132 In this period, children are highly influenced\n  by the people and environment around them.133 Some early education\n  options include government-funded organizations such as Head Start or private\n  preschools.\n\n\n  Early education can help provide equal footing for children growing up in\n  lower-income households. Early education teaches students vocabulary, social\n  skills, and basic reading and math exposure. It also provides working parents\n  with a safe place for children to attend during work hours. However, only 19%\n  of low-income families enroll in high-quality early childhood education, while\n  29% of high-income families do.134\n\n\n  Research has shown that early education can have a meaningful impact on\n  impoverished children, both in the short term and the long term. In the short\n  term, early childhood education helps prepare students by developing their\n  social, emotional, and cognitive growth.135 One study found that\n  while students enrolled in ECEEarly childhood education.\n  tended not to receive better SAT or test scores, early education did affect\n  their social and mental well-being.136 This study accounted for the\n  variety of long-term success in students that matriculate in some form of\n  preschool.\n\n\n  In the long term, students who have received early education tend to minimize\n  threats that could potentially prolong their impoverished situation. Children\n  of the Perry Preschool Project, a research study conducted in the 1960s to see\n  if positive experiences in preschool had an impact on later school\n  performance, were significantly more likely to have graduated from high school\n  (66% versus 45%) and half as likely to have an unwanted teen pregnancy. By age\n  40, the participants were 46% less likely to be incarcerated or 33% less\n  likely to have committed a violent crime. A researcher studied the children of\n  these participants and also found the children to be less at-risk.137\n  More recently, a 2017 study reiterated that children who receive\n  ECEEarly childhood education.\n  are 22% less likely to be held behind and 74% more likely to graduate.138\n  The best practice of Early Childhood Education directly impacts significant\n  negative consequences of the\n  achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output..\n\n\n  A considerable gap in early education is the variety of early education\n  quality. There are few regulations on early childhood education and no\n  universal early childhood education in the United States. This variety leads\n  to a variety in the quality of ECEEarly childhood education..\n  Not all preschools are able to provide the structure and quality necessary to\n  combat the achievement gapA gap occurs when one group of students performs better than another, and\n    the difference is statistically significant. The groups may be classified by\n    race or ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic class.2 Occasionally,\n    the achievement gap will be referred to as an opportunity gap to focus more\n    on the lack of resources than student output..139 One study suggests that, above all other qualities, the\n  relationship between student and teacher is the most significant, even more,\n  important than teacher certifications.\n\nPreferred Citation: Bradley, Kate. \u201cThe Socioeconomic Achievement Gap in the US Public Schools.\u201d Ballard Brief.

So what are the underlying causes? And how does every student who does not earn a high school diploma hurt society as a whole?\u00a0 My hope is that in discovering shared traits among dropouts, we can achieve higher high school graduation rates as a nation.\nWhy are students dropping out?\nOne unchanging factor when it comes to the dropout rate is socioeconomic background. Since the National Center for Education Statistics first started tracking different groups of high school students in the late 1960s, the socioeconomic status of each pupil has impacted the graduation rate. Students from low-income families are 2.4 times more likely to drop out than middle-income kids, and over 10 times more likely than high-income peers to drop out.\nHousehold income is the not the only disadvantage many dropouts have, though. Students with learning or physical disabilities drop out at a rate of 36 percent. Some behaviors that are often characteristic in dropouts include being retained from advancing a grade level with peers, relocating during the high school years and the general feeling of being left out or alienated by peers or adults at the school. Overall, a student who does not fit the traditional classroom mold, or who falls behind for some reason, is more likely to lose motivation when it comes to high school and decide to give up altogether.\nHow valuable is a high school diploma?\nThe U.S. Census Bureau estimates that dropouts bring in just $20,241 annually, which is $10,000 less than high school graduates and over $36,000 less than a person holding a bachelor\u2019s degree. The poverty rate for dropouts is over twice as high as college grads, and the unemployment rate for dropouts is generally 4 percentage points higher than the national average. In the end, the lifetime earnings of high school dropouts are $260,000 LESS than peers who earn a diploma.\nWhy should I care?\nThe financial ramifications of dropping out of high school hurt more than the individual. It\u2019s estimated that half of all Americans on public assistance are dropouts. If all of the dropouts from the class of 2011 had earned diplomas, the nation would benefit from an estimated $154 billion in income over their working lifetimes. Potentially feeding that number is the fact that young women who give up on high school are nine times more likely to be, or become, young single mothers. A study out of Northeastern University found that high school dropouts cost taxpayers $292,000 over the course of their lives.\nIt\u2019s not just about the money though. Over 80 percent of the incarcerated population is high school dropouts \u2013 making this an issue that truly impacts every member of the community. Numbers are higher for dropouts of color; 22 percent of people jailed in the U.S. are black males who are high school dropouts. As a society, we are not just paying into public assistance programs for dropouts, but we are paying to protect ourselves against them through incarceration.\nI wonder what these numbers would look like if we took the nearly $300K that taxpayers put in over the course of a dropout\u2019s lifetime and deposited it into their K-12 learning upfront. If we invested that money, or even half of it, into efforts to enhance the learning experience and programs to prevent dropping out, what would that do to dropout, poverty and incarceration rates?

But America\u2019s students are doing better than average in science compared with pupils in these other countries.\nPew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans\u2019 ratings of K-12 STEM education in the United States. For this analysis, we surveyed 10,133 U.S. adults from Feb. 7 to 11, 2024.\nEveryone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology.\nHere are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\nWe also analyzed the latest data from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which tests 15-year-old students in math, reading and science in member and partner countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This analysis only includes scores from students in the 37 OECD countries that took the 2022 PISA.\nJust 28% of U.S. adults say America is the best in the world or above average in K-12 science, technology, engineering and math education compared with other wealthy nations. A third say the U.S. is average, while another 32% think the U.S. is below average or the worst in K-12 STEM education.\nSome demographic groups are more pessimistic than others about the state of U.S. STEM education. White Americans (24%) are less likely than Black (31%), Hispanic (37%) or English-speaking Asian (43%) Americans to say U.S. K-12 STEM education is the best in the world or above average. And fewer women (25%) than men (32%) say K-12 STEM education is at least above average.\nRepublicans and Democrats give similar ratings to K-12 STEM education: 31% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say it is at least above average, as do 27% of Republicans and GOP leaners.\nAmericans\u2019 views today are similar to those in a 2019 telephone survey by the Center, which was conducted before the coronavirus pandemic caused major disruptions in the country\u2019s schools.

(WDRB) \u2013 The Kentucky Department of Education\u2019s annual school report card lacks key academic measurements with the suspension of K-PREP testing in the spring, but other metrics provide some insight into how schools performed a school year upended by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPublic and private school systems throughout Kentucky shuttered their classrooms in March at the onset of the coronavirus outbreak, prompting the U.S. Department of Education to grant testing waivers for year-end assessments like K-PREP.\nWithout test scores for the 2019-20 school year, the report card does not include state accountability scores in areas like proficiency, growth and transition readiness; identification of significant achievement gaps; and star ratings assigned to districts and schools based on performance.\nThe report card also lacks attendance rates and chronic absenteeism for the 2019-20 school year because of reporting inconsistencies from school districts, according to KDE.\nSchools will retain their federal classifications for targeted or comprehensive support and improvement based on 2018-19 data, according to a Wednesday KDE release.\n\u201cThough there is limited data available,\u00a0we hope this information will be useful to start conversations between schools, families and community members about how to ensure all of our students are receiving a high-quality education,\u201d Education Commissioner Jason Glass said in a statement.\n\u201cWe know there still is a lot of work to be done.\u00a0The Kentucky Department of Education is here to work alongside our districts to provide the supports they need as they continue focusing on student achievement.\u201d\nWhile the school report card does not include as much academic data, the database provides some indicators of how schools and districts are performing.\nThe state\u2019s four-year graduation rate of 90.9% in 2020 is slightly higher than the previous two school years, up from 90.6% in 2019 and 90.3% in 2018.\nThe five-year graduation rate has also climbed, hitting 92% in 2020 compared to 91.6% in 2019 and 91.3% in 2018.\nHowever, Black students lag their white peers by nearly double digits in both categories across Kentucky.\nThe four-year graduation rate for Black students in 2020 was 83.2% compared to 92.7% for white students. Black students had a five-year graduation rate of 85.7% compared to 93.3% for white students.\nEnglish learners and special needs students also posted low four- and five-year graduation rates in 2020, according to state data. Students with disabilities had a four-year rate of 77.9% and a five-year rate of 79.2% while students learning English graduated in four years at a rate of 73.9% and in five years at a rate of 78.2%, state data show.\nJefferson County Public Schools trailed the state\u2019s average graduation rates last school year. The four-year graduation rate at Kentucky\u2019s largest school district in 2020 was 83.5%, and its five-year graduation rate was 84.8%.\nBoth rates are improvements over 2019 and 2018, according to state data.\nAlthough gaps between Black and white graduation rates at JCPS exist, they\u2019re slightly closer than the statewide averages in 2020.\nHowever, students with disabilities and those learning English had lower graduation rates at JCPS compared to other Kentucky schools in 2020. The four-year graduation rates for special needs students and English learners were 68.5% and 71.4%, respectively, while the five-year rates for both student groups were higher at 70.3% and 76.2%.\nThe state\u2019s report card shows that half of Kentucky\u2019s 2019 graduating class are attending college, 21% are working, 8.1% are doing a combination of work and school, 4.7% are getting technical training and 2.9% are enlisted in the military.\nMore than 13% of the 2019 class of graduates is categorized as \u201cother\u201d in the state\u2019s transition to adult life measurement.\nFor JCPS, two-thirds of its 2019 graduating glass is enrolled in college while 8.9% are working and 9.4% are doing a combination of both. Nearly 5% have enlisted in the military, 1.5% are getting technical training and 8.8% have been categorized as \u201cother.\u201d\nFor the first time, Kentucky\u2019s school report card also includes a look at how many inexperienced or out-of-field teachers work in disadvantaged schools.\nKDE found that 55.6% of students eligible for Title I benefits were taught by inexperienced educators compared to 44.3% for others.\nThat gap widened for non-white students, those from low-income homes, special needs students and those learning English. In fact, English learners eligible for Title I were most likely to have inexperienced teachers in their classrooms, 61.2% per state data, than any other student subgroup.\nThe state found far fewer students taught by out-of-field teachers, though Title I students were more likely to have them with 1.4% of disadvantaged students taught by out-of-field educators compared to 0.5% for others.\nWhile the rate of disadvantaged JCPS students taught by inexperienced teachers is better than the state average, the gap between those eligible for Title I and other students was considerably higher.\nKDE found that 49.9% of students eligible for Title I services were in classrooms with inexperienced teachers compared to 29% of their more affluent peers at JCPS.\nThose rates and gaps were highest for students who were nonwhite, poor, learning English or disabled, state data show.\nMore than 56% of nonwhite Title I students were taught by inexperienced teachers at JCPS in 2020, 30 percentage points higher than students from more affluent backgrounds.\nEnglish learners nearly matched that gap with 58.4% of Title I students in that category learning from inexperienced educators compared to 29.8% for others learning English.\nNearly 58% of economically disadvantaged Title I students had inexperienced teachers leading their classrooms compared to 30.8% for low-income students who did not receive Title I services in 2020.\nHalf of all students with disabilities who were eligible for Title I services in 2020 were taught by inexperienced educators at JCPS compared to 28.3% for others.\nCopyright 2020 by WDRB Media.

Dackin last week announced the release of the 2024 Ohio School Report Cards and Summary of Ohio School Report Cards. The report cards showcase the achievements of districts and schools, highlighting their efforts to prepare students for the future.\n\r\nDistricts and schools receive overall ratings of 1-5 stars in half-star increments. This year, nearly 90% of districts earned overall ratings of three stars or higher\u200b, meaning they met state expectations for performance. Overall graduation rates are the highest they have been in more than a decade, with 87.9% of the 2023 student cohort graduating within four years and 89.1% of the 2022 student cohort graduating within five years.\n\r\nKey points from this year\u2019s report cards include the following:\r\n\nGovernor DeWine\u2019s ReadOhio initiative aims to boost literacy achievement, ensuring every child reads at or above grade level.\r\n\tIt\u2019s important to acknowledge the gains in literacy scores for third, fourth, and fifth grade students, but also recognize there is significant improvement still needed. This year, 64.5% of third grade students are reading at or above grade level, an improvement from 62.3% last year. Ohio students are counting on us, and our work remains urgent.\u00a0\nMath proficiency has improved incrementally including gains in grades 4-7 and algebra, but only 53.5% of all students are proficient in math. The emphasis on learning supports and accelerating opportunities in mathematics remains critical to continuous improvement.\nOhio schools are leveraging partnerships to ensure students\u2019 wellness needs are being met. While chronic absenteeism has declined from 26.8% in the 2022-2023 school year to 25.6% in the 2023-2024 school year, it remains a challenge. It\u2019s more important than ever to keep students engaged in their learning and ensure families understand the importance of daily attendance.\nThe focus on creating valuable workforce experiences continues, equipping more students with practical skills for high-wage, in-demand careers. Although not included in the ratings, more than half of the Class of 2023 met at least one of the College, Career, Workforce, and Military Readiness Component measures demonstrating their preparedness for postsecondary education, the workforce, or the military.\n\r\nAdditional report card resources, including the 2024 report card guides, are available on the Department\u2019s Report Card Resources webpage. The report card guides provide an overview and explanation of the key components of each type of report card.\n\r\nTo view your school or district report card, visit: reportcard.education.ohio.gov\nUnderstanding Report Card Data: Virtual Appointments available\r\nDepartment team members are providing individual virtual work sessions to help school and district staff understand component calculations, data insights, and how to use data to drive school improvement.\n\r\nSign up for a report card work session.

      "Subscribe to the Brown Center on Education Policy Newsletter\n\n          Research\n        \nTargeted infrastructure spending can boost student outcomes\nSeptember 6, 2024\n\nEducation Access & Equity Education Policy K-12 Education \n\nGovernance Studies \n\nBrown Center on Education Policy \n\nElection \u201924: Issues at Stake \nDebates over school spending have a long and contentious history in politics, litigation, and research. Thankfully, research has reached more of a consensus in recent years\u2014finding consistent evidence that increasing overall school spending improves student outcomes. Now, the most pressing questions are about how and where to spend scarce school funding dollars. Yet, there are gaps in the school finance literature. Most analyses examine spending on day-to-day school operations, including educators, materials, and other school staff positions, but we have less evidence on the impacts of school infrastructure spending. This is an important spending category that includes classroom space, durable technological upgrades, health and safety improvements, and extracurricular facilities.\nThis is not without consequence. Spending on new capital infrastructure surpassed $90 billion nationally in each of the past two years, roughly 10% of total education spending. At the same time, federal survey data suggest that millions of students attend schools in fair or poor condition, and half of school districts need to replace or update multiple systems, like HVAC or plumbing. Moreover, nearly 80% of funding for capital infrastructure is generated locally, resulting in higher spending in higher-income school districts. This stands in contrast to operational expenditures, for which states play a more significant role and state-level school finance reforms have reduced the link between local income and school spending levels.\nOur research brings new, cross-state evidence on the impacts of school infrastructure spending. We examine data on roughly 14,000 local bond elections from 1990 to 2017 across 29 states. We also analyze ballot text from these elections to identify which facility improvements are funded with new bond dollars.\nWe then track outcomes several years before and after bond passage\u2014or failure\u2014including spending, demographics, test scores, and house prices. We find that, on average, capital spending improves test scores and boosts local property values, but the magnitude of these changes depends crucially on the local context. Key factors include district demographics, the level of past investment, and the type of school facility improvement being funded. These findings can offer guidance on how and where school capital investments can offer the biggest bang for the buck.\nPast research on school infrastructure funding shows mixed evidence\u00a0 \u00a0\nPrior research on school capital spending finds inconsistent impacts. Some state-level studies, like in Texas, find no evidence of academic improvements. Others, in California, find positive impacts on test scores and house prices. Meanwhile, studies from Michigan find inconsistent evidence of test score impacts, but notable reductions in arrest rates in adulthood.\nOthers have studied large facility improvement programs in specific districts\u2014most notably, in Los Angeles and New Haven\u2014finding improved test scores, student attendance, and local house prices. Meanwhile, one multi-state study looking at fiscal windfalls from new wind farm installations found little academic boost from the new facility investments.\nWhen averaged together, a recent meta-analysis found that the average effect of facility spending is positive, despite the variation in effects across studies.\nTwo reasons may explain the inconsistency of the research record. First, prior studies may fail to detect positive impacts because effects are small and spread over several years; the expected useful life of a new school building is often expected to span several decades. And second, the context of capital improvement varies, which may also be a source of the discrepancy. Districts invest in very different projects\u2014from new classroom space to athletic facilities\u2014that could produce different impacts. The baseline facility quality in districts also varies, and we might expect investments in places with poor-quality buildings to produce greater returns. And more broadly, states vary in their restrictions on districts\u2019 ability to finance new capital projects; for example, several states require that local bonds for school infrastructure receive a supermajority of votes to pass, as high as two-thirds. \u00a0\nInfrastructure improvements boost test scores and house prices\u2014but it depends on how and where money is spent\nTo better characterize average impacts and how they vary across contexts, our new study relies on detailed bond- and district-level data spanning nearly three decades. The key challenge we face in determining impacts is that capital spending is not random; most often, it is funded through local bond issuances that reflect community wealth, educational values, and politics.\nTo overcome this, we rely on a technique common in research using election data: We compare close winners and losers of bond elections. Intuitively, districts that barely fail and barely succeed in passing a bond are similar except in their subsequent school facility investments. We then track these districts over the next decade and restrict our comparisons to districts with similar histories of bond passage. Prior research has studied individual states using a similar approach; we expand on this and estimate national effects, examining differences in bond spending category and district characteristics across decades of election data from more than half of states.\nIn districts that barely succeed in passing bonds, we see a cumulative increase in capital spending of roughly $1,500 per student over the first four years post-passage. Then, eight years after bond passage grade 3 through 8 math and ELA test scores are significantly higher, by about eight percent of a (district-level) standard deviation. For reference, the magnitude of this estimate is akin to closing eight percent of the initial achievement gap between high- and low-SES districts in our data. We also looked at house prices, and they rise by about nine percent after eight years. \u00a0\nGoing beyond the simple average estimate, however, reveals a more nuanced picture. What the money is spent on, it turns out, makes a big difference. Investments in HVAC, STEM equipment, safety/health, plumbing/roofs/furnaces, and classroom facilities all produce notable and statistically significant improvements in test scores. HVAC investment has the largest impact\u2014roughly 20% of a standard deviation\u2014yet yields no detectable impact on house prices. In contrast, we find no positive impact of athletic facilities, land purchases, or transportation spending on test scores, but we do find that athletics spending increases nearby house prices.\nBeyond the question of \u201cwhat\u201d is being bought, the question of \u201cwho\u201d is spending matters as well. Positive effects are concentrated in districts with high shares of low-income and/or Black and Hispanic students. More white and affluent districts see no positive impacts from additional facility spending. Furthermore, districts with low prior capital stock\u2014which we measure by using past capital spending data going back to the 1970s\u2014have much larger impacts.\nWhen we jointly examine both income and prior facility quality, we see that income still makes a difference: For districts with low prior capital stock, those with more low-income students still see larger impacts on test scores and house prices. In other words, low-income districts see benefits for reasons beyond just the fact that they tend to have lower-quality facilities to begin with.\nTargeted policies to reduce spending gaps and invest in high-impact projects could help close achievement gaps\nUnderstanding how school facility spending impacts vary is important for policymakers. As mentioned earlier, capital funding is primarily locally provided, resulting in spending gaps by district income and wealth. Addressing these gaps and targeting additional education dollars towards lower-income districts\u2014and on higher-impact projects\u2014could help address existing test score gaps. Our findings can provide some guidance on the potential magnitude. Based on our estimates, eliminating the capital spending gap between low- and high-income districts could close around eight percent of the test score gap between them. But, if these additional funds were targeted toward the projects we estimate to have higher impact, including HVAC and other basic infrastructure, the impact could be larger\u2014closing up to 25% of the test score gap. \u00a0\nOf course, these back-of-the-envelope extrapolations abstract from other factors that we cannot measure. There could also be impacts on other academic and non-academic outcomes beyond the scope of our analysis. Nevertheless, our findings offer important new evidence on infrastructure spending and how to best utilize school funding to support student outcomes.\nAs education data improves and research on school spending advances, our results show that a nuanced understanding of the factors shaping infrastructure investments\u2014and how impacts vary across contexts\u2014is key to help policymakers better target facility funding to improve outcomes.\n\n        Related Content\n      \n\n\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaul Bruno, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHaeryun Kim\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            \n\n            February 21, 2024\n          \n\n\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBriana Ballis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            \n\n            October 7, 2024\n          \n\n\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLang (Kate) Yang\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            \n\n            December 6, 2022\n          \nAuthors\n\nEducation Access & Equity Education Policy K-12 Education \n\nGovernance Studies \n\nU.S. States and Territories \n\nBrown Center on Education Policy \n\nElection \u201924: Issues at Stake \n\n\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristine Apiot Okudi, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEllen Chigwanda, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThinley Choden, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSumbal Naveed, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMary Otieno, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJamila Razzaq, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNasrin Siddiqa, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJennifer L.

Thirty-seven percent of public schools had an average daily attendance rate of 95 percent or higher.\nWhen asked about their concerns related to student and teacher attendance and absences, 15 percent of public schools reported being \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about student absences. Obtaining substitute teachers was the top concern for public schools, with 35 percent of public schools reporting that they were \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about this issue.\nExtreme concern related to teacher and non-teaching staff absences were reported by lower percentages of public schools, with 8 percent saying they were \u201cextremely concerned\u201d with teaching absences and 7 percent saying they were \u201cextremely concerned\u201d with non-teaching staff absences.\n\u201cThe new, timely data on attendance help us understand the extent of absenteeism at public schools, as well as the extent to which absences by students, teachers, and staff are a concern to public school leaders,\u201c said NCES Commissioner Peggy G. Carr. \u201cThe data also show challenges our schools face when it comes to the supply chain for adequate goods and services needed to successfully operate, such as food services, laptops and other electronic devices, and office equipment.\u201d\nCompared to the overall percentage of public schools that reported being \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about student absences (15 percent), higher percentages of schools in high-poverty neighborhoods (26 percent), those with a student body made up of 76 percent or more students of color (26 percent), and high/secondary schools (21 percent) reported being \u201cextremely concerned.\u201d\nThe latest SPP survey also focused on supply chain-related procurement challenges. In November 2023, 52 percent of public schools reported experiencing procurement challenges that appeared to be the result of supply chain disruptions. This was a decrease of 31 percentage points compared to October 2022, when 83 percent of schools reported supply chain-related procurement challenges. The top procurement challenges were related to food services (27 percent), followed by access to laptops and other electronic devices (23 percent).\nAdditional data collected from 100 public K-12 schools in the U.S. Outlying Areas - American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands - are also available. Public school leaders across the Outlying Areas reported in November 2023 that their average daily attendance rate was 87 percent.\nThe findings released today, which also include data on school lunch programs and school improvement plans, are part of an experimental data product from the School Pulse Panel, NCES\u2019s innovative approach to delivering timely information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on public K-12 schools in the U.S. The data, collected between November 14 and November 28 of 2023, came from 1,536 participating public K-12 schools from every state and the District of Columbia.\nExperimental data products are innovative statistical tools created using new data sources or methodologies. Experimental data may not meet all of NCES\u2019s quality standards but are of sufficient benefit to data users in the absence of other relevant products to justify release. NCES clearly identifies experimental data products upon their release.\nAll data released today can be found on the School Pulse Panel dashboard at https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/spp/results.asp.\nKey Findings\nAttendance and Absenteeism\n\nPublic school leaders nationwide reported their average daily attendance rate was 90 percent as of November 2023.\nPublic schools reported daily attendance rates that fall into the following groups:\n\n>\\=95 percent\naverage daily\nattendance\n>\\=90 to <95 percent\naverage daily\nattendance\n>\\=85 to <90 percent\naverage daily\nattendance\n>\\=75 to <85 percent\naverage daily\nattendance\n<75 percent\naverage daily\nattendance\nPercentage of\npublic schools\n37 Percent\n40 Percent\n9 Percent\n6 Percent\n3 Percent\n\nWhen asked about their concerns related to student attendance and absences as of November 2023, the ability to obtain substitute teachers was the most concerning issue, with 35 percent of public schools reporting being \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about this issue.\nFifteen percent of public schools reported being \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about student absences; extreme concern related to teacher and non-teaching staff absences were reported by lower percentages of schools (8 and 7 percent, respectively).\nHigher percentages of public schools with the following characteristics reported being \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about student absences compared to the national estimate (15 percent):\nIn high-poverty neighborhoods (26 percent)\nWith a student body made up of 76 percent or more students of color (26 percent)\nHigh/secondary schools (21 percent)\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply Chain-Related Procurement Challenges & School Lunch Programs\n\nThere was a 31-point decrease in the percentage of public schools reporting any supply chain-related procurement challenges for the 2023-24 school year compared to the 2022-23 school year (52 percent versus 83 percent).\nThe top procurement challenges facing public schools during the 2023-24 school year are related to food services (27 percent) and laptops and other electronic devices (23 percent).\n\n\nNinety-two percent of public schools reported participating in United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) meal programs for the 2023-24 school year, a higher percentage that reported doing so than last school year (88 percent). Four percent of public schools reported offering a non-USDA school meal program.\nOf these schools, the top challenges they reported in operating their school meal programs for the 2023-24 school year were:\nSchool food service staff shortages (41 percent)\nConvincing parents to submit applications for free- or-reduced price meals (38 percent)\nIncreased program costs (21percent)\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool Improvement Plans (SIP)\n\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended, requires that states identify a school for comprehensive support and improvement (CSI) if it is a Title I school in the lowest 5 percent of Title I schools based on the state\u2019s accountability system, a public high school failing to graduate one third or more of its students, or a Title I school that was previously identified for additional targeted support and improvement (ATSI) and did not meet the statewide exit criteria for these plans. Among all public schools, 10 percent were identified for CSI.\nStates identify schools for targeted or additional targeted support and improvement (TSI/ATSI) if one or more student subgroups are \u201cconsistently underperforming\u201d as defined by the state or if one or more student subgroups are performing as poorly as the lowest performing 5 percent of Title I schools identified for CSI. Among all public schools, 18 percent were identified for TSI/ATSI.\nCompared to the overall percentage of public schools that were identified for CSI or TSI/ATSI (29 percent), higher percentages of schools with the following characteristics were identified for CSI or TSI/ATSI: In high-poverty neighborhoods (44 percent)\nWith a student body made up of 76 percent of more students of color (42 percent)\nIn the West (40 percent)\n\n\nLower percentages of schools with the following characteristics were identified for CSI or TSI/ATSI than the national percentage (29 percent):\nIn the Midwest (21 percent)\nWith a student body made up of 25 percent or fewer students of color (16 percent)\n\n\nAmong the 29 percent of schools identified for CSI or TSI/ATSI, the top areas prioritized for improvement in their SIPs were related to:\nCurriculum, assessment, or instructional materials (CAIM) for English/language arts (68 percent)\nCAIM for math (65 percent)\nCAIM for special populations (e.g., English learners and students with disabilities) (56 percent)\nSchool climate and culture (46 percent)\nFamily or community engagement (45 percent)\nStudent engagement (42 percent)\n\n\n\n# # #\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System, is the statistical center of the U.S. Department of Education and the primary federal entity for collecting and analyzing data related to education in the U.S. and other nations.

The adopted standards are based on the foundation and the tenets of the National Research Council\u2019s Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas and the Next Generation Science Standards (New York one of 27 lead states). Two public surveys gathered feedback from various stakeholders on the draft standards as part of the adoption process. July 2017: Initial Transition to the New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards Initial transition to the new State science learning standards began with the 2017-18 school year. Given the shift in classroom instruction called for by the standards NYSED staff, alongside key science stakeholders and groups in learning communities across the State, continue to work together to raise awareness and build capacity to move science education in NY forward through these new science standards. Ongoing Curriculum and Professional Development P-12 aligned to the standards are crucial components in this process. March 2018: New York State P-12 Science Roadmap Released The New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards Implementation Roadmap has been designed to assist and support educators in school districts and other key stakeholders with the transition process leading to full-implementation of the learning standards. The roadmap provides a recommended plan spread-over the next several years that highlights shared goals, objectives and activities to support the NYS Education Department, local school districts, and other key stakeholders with the transition process. Districts are encouraged to tailor the suggested implementation activities to develop specific actions designed to meet district level needs during the transition process. Grades P-8 September 2019 \u2013 June 2022: Phase II Transition and Implementation This is the start of Phase II where districts should be moving towards full implementation of curriculum and instructional programing aligned to the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards at the elementary and middle school levels, to prepare students for subsequent years of science learning. Instruction in the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards began in September 2019 for students in grades P-3 and grade 6. June 2022: Last Administration of grade 4 science test aligned to the 1996 Science Standards This last test administration signals to the field the need for a shift in instruction aligned to the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards. Students enrolled in grade 3 during the 2020-2021 school year should have received instruction in the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards. However, due to school closures related to COVID-19, the Department delayed the rollout of the state assessments aligned to the New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards for two years, to spring 2024. Therefore, such students will be assessed using the 1996 Science Learning Standards in the spring of 2022 as 4th graders. June 2023 will be a testing transition year for students in the grade 4 cohort. There will be no grade 4 science test; students in this cohort will take the new science test in grade 5 in 2024. Revised April 2021 September 2023: Continue Phase II Transition and Implementation This date signals the continued implementation PK-3 and grade 6 and initial transition of curriculum and instruction aligned to the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards for grades 4 and 7. June 2023: Testing Transition June 2023 will be a testing transition where there will be no grade 4 science test; these students will take the new science test in grade 5 in 2024. This will provide time for teachers and students to adapt to teaching and learning called for in the new standards. It provides the opportunity for full transition to the 2016 standards without having a cohort of students tested on the 1996 standards one year and the 2016 standards the following year. June 2023 will be the last administration of the Grade 8 Science test aligned to the 1996 standards. September 2023: Continue Phase II Transition and Implementation This date signals the continued implementation of instruction aligned to the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards for grades P-4 and grade 7; instruction in the 2016 New York State Science Learning Standards begins for grades 5 and 8. This results in all curriculum and instruction in grades P-8 aligned to the new 2016 standards. Spring 2024: First Administration of the new Grade 5 and Grade 8 exams Spring 2024 will mark the first administration of the Grade 5 Elementary-Level and Grade 8 Intermediate- Level science examinations aligned to the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards. Grades 9-12 September 2024: Phase III Implementation and Sustainability This date signals the continued implementation and transition of curriculum and instruction of two high school level science courses that culminate in a corresponding science Regents examination aligned to the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards for Earth and Space Sciences, and Life Science: Biology. These courses are those typically taught in grades 9 and 10. June 2025: First Administration of Earth and Space Sciences and Life Science: Biology Regents Exams June 2025 will mark the first administration of the Regents Exams for Earth and Space Sciences and Life Science: Biology. September 2025: Phase III Implementation and Sustainability This date signals the full transition and transition of curriculum and instruction of the two high school level science courses that culminate in a corresponding science regents examination aligned to the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards for Physical Science: Chemistry and Physical Science: Physics.

The adopted standards are based on the foundation and the tenets of the National Research Council\u2019s Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas and the Next Generation Science Standards (New York one of 27 lead states). Two public surveys gathered feedback from various stakeholders on the draft standards as part of the adoption process. July 2017: Initial Transition to the New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards Initial transition to the new State science learning standards began with the 2017-18 school year. Given the shift in classroom instruction called for by the standards NYSED staff, alongside key science stakeholders and groups in learning communities across the State, continue to work together to raise awareness and build capacity to move science education in NY forward through these new science standards. Ongoing Curriculum and Professional Development P-12 aligned to the standards are crucial components in this process. March 2018: New York State P-12 Science Roadmap Released The New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards Implementation Roadmap has been designed to assist and support educators in school districts and other key stakeholders with the transition process leading to full-implementation of the learning standards. The roadmap provides a recommended plan spread-over the next several years that highlights shared goals, objectives and activities to support the NYS Education Department, local school districts, and other key stakeholders with the transition process. Districts are encouraged to tailor the suggested implementation activities to develop specific actions designed to meet district level needs during the transition process. Grades P-8 September 2019 \u2013 June 2022: Phase II Transition and Implementation This is the start of Phase II where districts should be moving towards full implementation of curriculum and instructional programing aligned to the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards at the elementary and middle school levels, to prepare students for subsequent years of science learning. Instruction in the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards began in September 2019 for students in grades P-3 and grade 6. June 2022: Last Administration of grade 4 science test aligned to the 1996 Science Standards This last test administration signals to the field the need for a shift in instruction aligned to the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards. Students enrolled in grade 3 during the 2020-2021 school year should have received instruction in the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards. However, due to school closures related to COVID-19, the Department delayed the rollout of the state assessments aligned to the New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards for two years, to spring 2024. Therefore, such students will be assessed using the 1996 Science Learning Standards in the spring of 2022 as 4th graders. June 2023 will be a testing transition year for students in the grade 4 cohort. There will be no grade 4 science test; students in this cohort will take the new science test in grade 5 in 2024. Revised April 2021 September 2023: Continue Phase II Transition and Implementation This date signals the continued implementation PK-3 and grade 6 and initial transition of curriculum and instruction aligned to the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards for grades 4 and 7. June 2023: Testing Transition June 2023 will be a testing transition where there will be no grade 4 science test; these students will take the new science test in grade 5 in 2024. This will provide time for teachers and students to adapt to teaching and learning called for in the new standards. It provides the opportunity for full transition to the 2016 standards without having a cohort of students tested on the 1996 standards one year and the 2016 standards the following year. June 2023 will be the last administration of the Grade 8 Science test aligned to the 1996 standards. September 2023: Continue Phase II Transition and Implementation This date signals the continued implementation of instruction aligned to the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards for grades P-4 and grade 7; instruction in the 2016 New York State Science Learning Standards begins for grades 5 and 8. This results in all curriculum and instruction in grades P-8 aligned to the new 2016 standards. Spring 2024: First Administration of the new Grade 5 and Grade 8 exams Spring 2024 will mark the first administration of the Grade 5 Elementary-Level and Grade 8 Intermediate- Level science examinations aligned to the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards. Grades 9-12 September 2024: Phase III Implementation and Sustainability This date signals the continued implementation and transition of curriculum and instruction of two high school level science courses that culminate in a corresponding science Regents examination aligned to the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards for Earth and Space Sciences, and Life Science: Biology. These courses are those typically taught in grades 9 and 10. June 2025: First Administration of Earth and Space Sciences and Life Science: Biology Regents Exams June 2025 will mark the first administration of the Regents Exams for Earth and Space Sciences and Life Science: Biology. September 2025: Phase III Implementation and Sustainability This date signals the full transition and transition of curriculum and instruction of the two high school level science courses that culminate in a corresponding science regents examination aligned to the 2016 New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards for Physical Science: Chemistry and Physical Science: Physics. These courses are those typically taught in grades 11 and 12.\nRevised April 2021 June 2026: First Administration of Physical Science: Chemistry and Physical Science: Physics Regents Exams June 2026 will mark the first administration of the Regents Exams for Physical Science: Chemistry and Physical Science: Physics. In Summary: The above timeline lays out a thoughtful strategic implementation blueprint for science that allows adequate time for the necessary steps leading to the following: \u2022 Ongoing and targeted professional development for teachers \u2022 Curriculum development at expanding levels \u2022 Grades 5, 8, and Regents level assessment development, field testing and implementation *See attached list of organizations asked for feedback on the attached timeline"

What troubles some educators?\nNovember 19, 2024\nOctober 8, 2024\nElection 2024: How voters can help repair California schools\nView Now \nAugust 28, 2024\nGetting students back to school: Addressing chronic absenteeism\nView Now \nNews Topics\nFeatured Special Reports\nKindly Log In\nTesting and Accountability\nStatewide test scores improved in 2024, but achievement still not back to pre-Covid levels\nCalifornia students made some progress toward regaining their pre-Covid levels of achievement with incremental increases in English language arts, math and science scores last school year, according to state data released Wednesday.\nEnglish language arts test scores overall increased slightly, from 46.7% of the state\u2019s students meeting or exceeding proficiency standards in 2023 to 47% in 2024. Math and science scores also edged up incrementally, with 30.7% of students in both subjects meeting or exceeding proficiency standards compared with 30.2% the year before.\u00a0\nSmarter Balanced tests are given to students in third through eighth grades and in 11th grade. They are part of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP), which also includes the English Language Proficiency Assessment.\nLast school year was the third year students returned to school since the Covid pandemic pushed schools into distance learning and caused dramatic declines in test scores after years of progress. In 2019, more than half of California students, 51.7%, met or exceeded state standards in English language arts, and 37.1% met or exceeded state standards in math.\nLinda Darling-Hammond, president of the State Board of Education and an adviser to Gov. Gavin Newsom, said she found reason for encouragement in the scores. She said that the overall gains were consistent across grades and for Latino and Black students.\n\u00a0\u201cCalifornia\u2019s public schools are making encouraging gains in all of the key subject areas, and these gains are largest for our most vulnerable groups of students,\u201d Darling-Hammond said in a statement. \u201cOur governor and the Legislature have, in recent years, prioritized \u2026 accelerating learning and equity: community schools, expanded learning time, transitional kindergarten, and investments in literacy and math. Those efforts are paying dividends.\u201d\u00a0\nStudents from low-income households made larger gains in all three subjects on the tests than students overall \u2014 a change from initially after the pandemic. Low-income students\u2019 scores in English language arts increased 1.5 percentage points over the previous year, with 36.8% meeting or exceeding proficiency standards in English. There was a similar increase in both math and science, with 20.7% meeting or exceeding standards \u2014 a 1.4 percentage point increase in each.\nDarling-Hammond attributes the academic improvement to billions of dollars in federal and state assistance directed to students with the most needs. She acknowledged it\u2019s not possible to tease out the impact of the state\u2019s expanded after-school learning program relative to money spent on community schools or literacy coaches. But it\u2019s apparent that the combined money is making a difference; for families experiencing evictions and illnesses in high-poverty neighborhoods, the pandemic isn\u2019t over, she said.\u00a0\n\u201cMy heart goes out to those in the schools that deal daily with these issues,\u201d Darling-Hammond said.\nThis narrowing of the performance gaps occurred even though the proportion of low-income students in California has grown significantly in the last seven years, from 58% to 65%, Darling-Hammond said. And the numbers of homeless and foster children are up too, she said.\nAfter looking at the same state data, however, the nonprofit advocacy group Children Now expressed alarm. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s lack of progress in closing the education achievement gap over the past 10 years is completely unacceptable,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe have made almost no progress for our Black and Latino students, who make up more than 60% of California\u2019s TK-12 student population, since the start of the Local Control Funding Formula and associated accountability system a decade ago.\u201d\nAdditional protections are needed, Children Now stated, \u201cto ensure the equity-focused funding that is the hallmark (of the funding formula) goes to the schools and students most in need to close our state\u2019s unconscionable achievement gap.\u201d\nEnglish and math scores for students in all California schools and districts showing gaps in proficiency.\nCalifornia school districts have received record levels of one-time and ongoing funding since the start of the Covid pandemic. But the last $12.5 billion in federal pandemic relief \u2014 20% of which was required to be spent on learning recovery \u2014\u00a0had to be spent by last month.\nCalifornia schools are getting creative to continue to fund positions and other support once funded by Covid dollars, said Alex Traverso, spokesperson for the California State Board of Education. Some schools in San Diego County, for example, are funding counselors and social worker positions, once paid for with federal Covid dollars, with the community schools dollars.\n\u201cSo I think as much as we can, we are trying to find strategies and techniques that can keep these programs moving forward and keep student achievement on the rise,\u201d Traverso said.\nThe gap in proficiency between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students remains daunting in 2023-24: 29.3 percentage points in English language arts and 30.2 percentage points in math \u2014 about 1 percentage point smaller than in 2022-23.\nStates\u2019 scores flat after dropping\nAn analysis of third-grade reading by David Scarlett Wakelyn, a partner with Upswing Labs, a nonprofit that works with school districts to improve reading instruction, found that California\u2019s scores were similar to 29 other states he has examined: flat after falling sharply after the pandemic.\nThird grade is a benchmark year for achieving fluency. In 2018-19, the last year before the pandemic, 48.5% of California students were proficient or advanced; in 2023-24, 42.8% were, a drop of 5.7 percentage points. In the past three years, reading scores rose less than 1 percentage point.\nOther states that take the Smarter Balanced assessments followed the same pattern, including Oregon, Nevada and Delaware, whose scores were below California before the pandemic and were again in 2023-24. Washington State, where 55% of students were proficient in 2018-19, fell to 47% and has stayed there the past three years.\u00a0\u00a0\nNone of the nation\u2019s 10 largest states have bounced back to where they were before the pandemic, Wakelyn found. But in four \u201cbright spot\u201d states \u2014 Mississippi, West Virginia, Louisiana and South Carolina \u2014 reading scores increased by 3 to 5 percentage points each of the past three years and are now ahead of where they were before the pandemic. The state leadership in Louisiana, he said, has long focused on adopting high-quality instructional materials and giving teachers deep professional learning opportunities in the new curricula, he said.\u00a0\u00a0\nSmarter Balanced test results divide student scores into four achievement levels, but this year the names of the levels have changed. Instead of \u201cnot meeting standards,\u201d \u201cstandards nearly met,\u201d \u201cstandards met\u201d or \u201cstandards exceeded,\u201d\u00a0they are now \u201cadvanced,\u201d \u201cproficient,\u201d \u201cfoundational\u201d or \u201cinconsistent.\u201d\u00a0\nEnglish learners have mixed results\nFewer English learners tested as proficient on the summative English Language Proficiency Assessment for California (ELPAC) than last year. The percentage of English learners who tested as proficient went down from 16.5% in 2023 to 14.6% in 2024, while the percentage of English learners who had the most basic level of English increased from 20.33% to 23.93%.\nStudents classified as English learners have to take the summative ELPAC every year until they achieve proficiency. There are four levels of proficiency \u2014 \u201cbeginning to develop,\u201d \u201csomewhat developed,\u201d \u201cmoderately developed,\u201d and \u201cwell developed.\u201d\nShelly Spiegel-Coleman, strategic adviser to the Californians Together, a nonprofit organization that advocates for English learners, said it is difficult to know what these numbers mean, because they could be due to a change in the demographics of English learners. For example, the increase in the percentage of students with the most basic level of English could be due to an increase in students who recently arrived in the U.S., she said. In addition, there is no information about how many students are reclassified as proficient in English.\nHowever, she said, \u201cit would suggest that districts take a look at their English language development program and see if there is a need for intentional work to enhance it.\u201d\nRelated Reading\nOctober 10, 2024\nLos Angeles, Compton see gains\nThe number of students in Los Angeles Unified (LAUSD) who met or exceeded state proficiency standards in both English language arts and math increased by about 2 points since 2023. Now, 43% of students meet or exceed standards in English language arts and 32.83% of students meet or exceed standards in math.\nSchool board member Kelly Gonez said the district is committed to continuous improvement and equity.\n\u201cEvery day, we\u2019re showing up for our students, and it\u2019s showing results,\u201d Gonez said at a news conference in July, when the district announced preliminary scores. \u201cI believe that we\u2019re at the tipping point of really achieving the ambitious goals that we have for our students in our school district.\u201d\nNearby Compton Unified also saw improved test scores last school year. Roughly 43% of students met or exceeded proficiency standards in English language arts this year, compared with about 40% the previous year. The number of students who met or exceeded math standards also rose, from just over 31% to nearly 35% this year.\u00a0\n\u201cCompton Unified School District has shown steady and remarkable progress in both math and English language arts, with our CAASPP scores far exceeding the state average for school districts with an unduplicated pupil count exceeding 90%,\u201d Compton Unified School District Superintendent Darin Brawley said in a statement to EdSource.\u00a0\nAlong with Compton and Los Angeles, the California Department of Education singled out Benicia Unified, Fallbrook Union Elementary and Santa Maria Joint Union High School districts for sharp gains in scores.\nBenecia\u2019s 8 point gain in math scores, to 53% proficiency, was led by two years of growth by Hispanic students. At 40.7% proficiency, they are the first student group in the district to exceed its pre-pandemic 2018-19 rate. Superintendent Damon Wright credited the funding of\u00a0districtwide professional learning and instructional coaches as factors. \u00a0\nFallbrook\u2019s one-year 5.2 point gain in English language arts and 5.9 pont gain in math bring the district almost back to pre-pandemic levels. Superintendent Monika Hazel also credits additional district-level\u00a0math teaching specialists, leadership coaches\u00a0and school-level instructional coaches for contributing to the improvement. The state\u2019s $6 billion Learning Recovery Emergency Block Grant, which will continue after federal Covid relief runs dry this fall, paid for some of the positions.\nBay Area schools\u2019 results vary\nIn the Bay Area, some districts had big test score gains, while others stayed stagnant. Benicia Unified had a 4-point gain in its overall English test score, and an 8-point gain in math. San Francisco and Oakland test scores were mostly stagnant.\nWest Contra Costa Unified is laboring to bring its scores back to pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0Since the 2021-22 school year, slightly more West Contra Costa students have tested proficient or higher in math \u2014 up 2 points to 23% this year. Students who meet or exceed state proficiency standards in English language arts have been flat since 2021 at 32%, compared with 34.9% pre-pandemic.\nTo help improve reading scores, the district created a 13-member literacy task force about a year ago to create a literacy plan and improve literacy instruction in the district. District officials did not respond to requests for an update on the task force\u2019s progress.\nBig gains for Central Valley migrant students\nTulare Joint Union High School District in the Central Valley region had data points worth celebrating and data pointing to areas that need improvement, said Kevin Covert, assistant superintendent for curriculum, technology and assessment of the test results.\u00a0\nBased on the 2024 tests, 53.5% of\u00a0the 1,300 11th graders who took the exam met or exceeded English proficiency standards, a 2.2 point gain from the previous year. In math, 18.3% of students met or exceeded standards \u2014 an improvement of less than 1 point.\u00a0\n\u201cSome people want to hang their hat on an overall test score,\u201d Covert said. \u201cWe\u2019re also looking at how our subgroups are doing.\u201d\nThe percentage of Tulare Joint Union students with disabilities meeting or exceeding standards was 12.7% in English, a jump of more than 5 points, and 3.5% in math, an improvement of more than 2 points. Though scores have fluctuated for students with disabilities, the 5.5-point gain in English is the largest percentage growth the group has made within the last decade. \nThough migrant students are a small population of the district\u2019s students, 63.6% met or exceeded English standards, representing a double-digit gain. Only 18.2% met or exceeded math standards, although the increase of 1.5% was higher than the overall district increase. \n\u201cOur success on this test can only be as good, partly, as the instruction that\u2019s going on in the classroom,\u201d Covert said. But educators must also know where students are academically, which is harder to track in Tulare Joint Union.\nFresno Unified, the state\u2019s third-largest district, is struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels of achievement of 38% proficiency and above in English language arts and 29% proficiency and advanced in math. Superintendent Misty Her expressed confidence in the districtwide strategy known as \u201cdata chats.\u201d At Data Chats, principals and staff evaluate data and set goals, including the need for intervention, for students to progress.\nYou can make a difference\nWe're kicking off our end-of-year campaign.

      "Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World\nRead our research on:\nFull Topic List\nRead Our Research On:\n|\nMost Americans think U.S. K-12 STEM education isn\u2019t above average, but test results paint a mixed picture\nMost Americans believe K-12 STEM education in the United States is either average or below average compared with other wealthy nations, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.\nRecent global standardized test scores show that students in the U.S. are, in fact, lagging behind their peers in other wealthy nations when it comes to math. But America\u2019s students are doing better than average in science compared with pupils in these other countries.\nPew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans\u2019 ratings of K-12 STEM education in the United States. For this analysis, we surveyed 10,133 U.S. adults from Feb. 7 to 11, 2024.\nEveryone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology.\nHere are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\nWe also analyzed the latest data from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which tests 15-year-old students in math, reading and science in member and partner countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This analysis only includes scores from students in the 37 OECD countries that took the 2022 PISA.\nJust 28% of U.S. adults say America is the best in the world or above average in K-12 science, technology, engineering and math education compared with other wealthy nations. A third say the U.S. is average, while another 32% think the U.S. is below average or the worst in K-12 STEM education.\nSome demographic groups are more pessimistic than others about the state of U.S. STEM education. White Americans (24%) are less likely than Black (31%), Hispanic (37%) or English-speaking Asian (43%) Americans to say U.S. K-12 STEM education is the best in the world or above average. And fewer women (25%) than men (32%) say K-12 STEM education is at least above average.\nRepublicans and Democrats give similar ratings to K-12 STEM education: 31% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say it is at least above average, as do 27% of Republicans and GOP leaners.\nAmericans\u2019 views today are similar to those in a 2019 telephone survey by the Center, which was conducted before the coronavirus pandemic caused major disruptions in the country\u2019s schools. In that survey, 31% of Americans said U.S. K-12 STEM education is the best in the world or above average compared with other nations.\nThe latest figures from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) show a mixed picture in U.S. math and science scores.\nAs of 2022, the U.S. was below average in math but above average in science compared with other member countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of mostly highly developed, democratic nations:\nPISA is taken by 15-year-old students about every three years. Students in 37 OECD countries took the 2022 PISA.\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\nTopics\nBrian Kennedy is a senior researcher\nfocusing on science and society research at Pew Research Center.\nRelated\nA quarter of U.S. teachers say AI tools do more harm than good in K-12 education\nAbout 1 in 4 U.S. teachers say their school went into a gun-related lockdown in the last school year\nAbout half of Americans say public K-12 education is going in the wrong direction\nWhat Public K-12 Teachers Want Americans To Know About Teaching\nWhat\u2019s It Like To Be a Teacher in America Today?\nTOPICS\nMost Popular\n1615 L St. NW, Suite 800Washington,\u00a0DC\u00a020036USA(+1) 202-419-4300\u00a0|\u00a0Main(+1) 202-857-8562\u00a0|\u00a0Fax(+1) 202-419-4372\u00a0|\u00a0Media Inquiries\nABOUT PEW RESEARCH CENTER\u00a0Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

      "Science\nQuestion:\r\n\t\t\tHow are American students performing in science?\r\n\t\t\t\nResponse:\nIn 2019, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) science assessment was administered to representative samples of fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grade students across the nation. NAEP science was administered as a digitally based assessment on tablet and as a paper-based assessment in 2019. Students were randomly assigned to take either the digitally based or paper-based assessment and reported results are based on the combined student performance on both versions of the assessment. The assessment measured students\u0092 science knowledge as well as their ability to engage in scientific inquiry and to conduct scientific investigations in real-world contexts. Students also answered survey questions asking about their opportunities to learn about and engage in science inside and outside of school.\nAverage Scores\nIn 2019, the average science score for the nation was lower by 2 points at grade 4 compared to 2015. Average scores at grades 8 and 12 were not significantly different compared to the scores in 2015. At grades 4 and 8, average scores were higher compared to 2009, while the average score at grade 12 was not significantly different.\n\nAverage scores in NAEP science, by grade: Various years, 2009\u20132019 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Significantly different (p < .05) from 2019.\n\nScores by Percentile\nNAEP scores are reported at five selected percentiles to show the progress made by lower-performing (10th and 25th percentiles), middle-performing (50th percentile), and higher-performing (75th and 90th percentiles) students.\nScores are reported on the NAEP science scale at grade 4 that ranges from 0 to 300 (although student performance typically ranges from 103 to 196, representing the 10th and 90th percentiles, respectively). In 2009, the mean of the science scale was set at 150 and the standard deviation at 35. In comparison to 2015, the 2019 science scores were lower for fourth-graders performing at the 10th, 25th, and 50th percentiles. For lower-performing students at the 10th and 25th percentiles, the 2019 scores were lower by 5 points and 4 points, respectively, compared to 2015. In 2019, the score for middle-performing students at the 50th percentile was 2 points lower in comparison to 2015. In comparison to 2009, science scores in 2019 were higher for higher-performing students at the 75th and 90th percentiles by 2 points and 3 points, respectively. There were no significant changes in the scores for lower- and middle-performing students in 2019 compared to 2009.\nScores are reported on the NAEP science scale at grade 8 that ranges from 0 to 300 (although student performance typically ranges from 103 to 196, representing the 10th and 90th percentiles, respectively). In 2009, the mean of the science scale was set at 150 and the standard deviation at 35. In 2019, scores were lower by 2 points for the lowest-performing students at the 10th percentile compared to 2015. In comparison to 2009, scores were higher at all five selected percentiles in 2019.\nScores are reported on the NAEP science scale at grade 12 that ranges from 0 to 300 (although student performance typically ranges from 100 to 197, representing the 10th and 90th percentiles, respectively). In 2009, the mean of the science scale was set at 150 and the standard deviation at 35. In 2019, the science score for twelfth-graders at each of the five selected percentiles was not significantly different compared to 2015. In comparison to 2009, the score in 2019 was 4 points lower for the lowest-performing twelfth-graders at the 10th percentile, while there were no significant changes in the scores for students at the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles.\n\nIn 2019, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) science assessment was administered to representative samples of fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grade students across the nation.
