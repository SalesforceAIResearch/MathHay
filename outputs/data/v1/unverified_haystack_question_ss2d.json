This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4.

Source: Kansas Applied Remote Sensing (KARS), available at: https://greenreport-kars.ku.edu/.\u00a0 \n\nPossible consequences to the wheat crop\nThe effect of the high soil temperatures during February on the wheat crop will depend on several factors, particularly on temperatures during early March.\nWhere temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F and with little fluctuation during the recent period, such as in many areas throughout the southeast quarter of the state, the high temperatures should cause a gradual loss of cold hardiness. The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4.

Source: Kansas Applied Remote Sensing (KARS), available at: https://greenreport-kars.ku.edu/.\u00a0 \n\nPossible consequences to the wheat crop\nThe effect of the high soil temperatures during February on the wheat crop will depend on several factors, particularly on temperatures during early March.\nWhere temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F and with little fluctuation during the recent period, such as in many areas throughout the southeast quarter of the state, the high temperatures should cause a gradual loss of cold hardiness. The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",

The month began colder than normal across the UK, with temperatures across the UK cooler than average and southern areas recording notably low daily minimum temperatures (for instance, Benson in Oxfordshire recorded -4.6\u00b0C on the 3rd). Snow fell on the 2nd across parts of south west England, causing some travel disruption. However, the cool weather was replaced with milder weather for much of the rest of the month, with temperatures widely into the mid to high teens at times (for instance, a maximum of 18.8\u00b0C was recorded at Charlwood, Surrey on the 20th). Temperatures dipped again towards the end of the month, and on the 27th/28th, some areas around Plymouth and Dartmoor experienced snowy conditions overnight. Overall the weather was unsettled, with a succession of frontal systems bringing rain and wind. By mid-month, several counties including London and Kent had already provisionally experienced their whole-month average rainfall, and continued to be soaked throughout the rest of the month. The month ended on an unsettled note, with widespread showers and strong winds across the UK. Overall, the provisional mean temperature for the UK was 6.7\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above average. Southern England was much milder than areas further north, with a provisional mean temperature of 8.2\u00b0C (anomaly of 1.4\u00b0C) for southern England and 5.0\u00b0C (anomaly of 0.6\u00b0C) for Scotland. England provisionally recorded the seventh-warmest March on record in a series from 1884. The UK overall recorded provisionally 127% of the long term average rainfall for March, with much of this concentrated in the south. England and Wales both recorded more than 150% of their long term average monthly rainfall, while Scotland recorded just 90% of the average March rainfall. County Down in Northern Ireland provisionally experienced its third wettest March on record (145.9mm) in a series from 1836. As well as wet, the month was also dull, with the UK provisionally recording just 95.2 hours of sunshine (87% of the long term average). Reference climatology used for calculating anomalies is the period 1991-2020 unless otherwise stated. Weather impacts \u2022 Snow across Ireland, southwest Midlands and the Bristol area caused traffic disruption and road closures \u2022 Persistent rain across the country throughout the month, particularly in southern England, caused groundwater and surface water flooding March started with heavy snow across southern and western parts of Northern Ireland, with the Enniskillen area reporting numerous traffic incidents and several fallen trees as a result of the snow. Parts of the Peak District and south Pennines also experienced snow, with several roads reported closed for a period. Further south, a heavy hail storm in Sussex on the 1st may have contributed to a major road traffic collision on the M23. Further snow on the 2nd hit the south-western Midlands and Bristol area, with reports of several snow-related traffic incidents and the use of snow ploughs to clear a section of the M4. The rest of the month saw unsettled weather with regular bouts of rain. Ongoing groundwater flooding in Suffolk that began in February continued well into March, bringing significant traffic disruption. However, there was otherwise relatively little in the way of impactful rain up until the final week of the month. The last week of March brought rain, snow, and strong winds. Heavy rain in Cornwall on the 25th/26th as a result of a stalling weather front led to flooding; the Cornwall Fire and Rescue service reported rescuing six people from flooding incidents on the roads which included rescues from flooded cars. On the 27th, the rain turned to snow across southwest England, leading to travel disruption including reports of abandoned vehicles around Dartmoor and further road disruption in mid-Wales as the area of precipitation moved north. Strong winds and locally intense rainfall on the 28th affected southern areas of Wales and England, resulting in several incidents of surface water flooding that led to the closure of several roads in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire to allow the floodwater to drain. The month closed with scattered heavy showers on the 29th, before the weather settled a little over the Easter weekend.

The wind anomaly map shows shaded (scalar) wind speed anomalies with arrows as (vector) wind anomalies. Text not available. Weather diary \u2022 Low pressure dominating, wet and windy The weather pattern for March was characterized by a series of Atlantic low pressure systems crossing the country through the month with just a brief settled spell during the 2nd week and the occasional transient ridge of high pressure. Wet and windy was the order of the day on the 1st with a deep low crossing central England, producing significant rainfall across all regions, and some very strong winds for the south coast, gusts to 80mph being reported in places. Low pressure continued to dominate through to the 6th. By the 7th, high pressure had become established over Scandinavia and the UK fell under the influence of a continental easterly until the 11th. The consequence of that was northern parts of England and all of Scotland remained mostly dry but cold, and any weather systems were pushed south, bringing more wind and rain to southern and southwestern counties. However, by the 13th, the high pressure had all but vanished, allowing a mobile westerly airstream to resume over the UK with the latest system bringing heavy and persistent rain particularly to Northern Ireland, north Wales and northwest England. Parts of Snowdonia saw nearly 100mm of rain over a 24 hour period. From the 13th to the 25th, the UK was hit by a series of depressions, with their attendant fronts bringing more wind and rain across all regions. After the 20th, the trajectory of the lows changed to approach the UK from a more southerly direction. The resulting southwesterly winds finally brought some milder conditions, with maximum temperatures widely into the mid-teens Celsius, slightly higher over southern England. After the 25th and to the end of the month, a north-south split was evident with Scotland subject to a cold and showery northeasterly airstream, with the rest of the UK milder but very wet at times. Notes The Met Office National Meteorological Library and Archive holds a near-continuous record of monthly weather reports from 1884, and this report forms a continuation of that series. The purpose of each report is to provide an overview of the weather conditions across the UK for that month. The emphasis is mainly based on observations from the surface network of weather stations. Climate series based on from data from these stations are used to provide long term context. This summary was produced on 03/04/2024 14:28. The statistics are a provisional assessment of the observational data available at the time of production. Ongoing data receipt and quality assurance processes may result in subsequent updates to the statistics presented. If you have any questions or feedback about this product, spot any data errors or omissions, or wish to obtain further data, please contact the Met Office. For historical monthly weather reports please visit the Library and Archive. o The land-surface observations presented in this report are from the Met Office official weather station network which includes both automatic weather stations and manual climate stations operated by volunteer observers. Rainfall data are from the official registered rain-gauge network which includes rain-gauges operated by a number of key partners including the Environment Agency, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and Northern Ireland Water. o The observations are carefully managed such that they conform to current best-practice observational standards as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The observations also pass through a range of quality assurance procedures at the Met Office before application for climate monitoring. o Daily and monthly maps, monthly statistics and monthly time-series are primarily based on the HadUK-Grid dataset of 1km resolution UK gridded climate data (Hollis et al, 2019). Monthly statistics from the monthly Central England temperature series 1659 (Manley, 1974) and England and Wales precipitation series from 1766 (Wigley et al, 1984) provide long term context. o The monthly lightning activity map is based on data from the Met Office ATDnet (Arrival Time Difference Network) system. This is an automatic lightning location network comprising around ten lightning outstation sensors located across Europe. o The monthly maps of mean sea level pressure and 250hPa wind speed and direction are based on the ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al, 2019). ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades.

    "Document2": "Brazil \u2013 Extreme Rainfall Days in Metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo Have Risen Four-Fold\nStudy by researchers at Brazil\u2019s National Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN) reveals that etreme rainfall days in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo have risen four-fold in seven decades. The research also shows a rise in the number of consecutive dry days, suggesting that extreme rainfall events are concentrated in shorter, more widely spaced periods.\nExtreme rainfall has become increasingly common in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The capital of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest city in the southern hemisphere. The metropolitan area suffered from flooding due to heavy rain in February. Early in the month, no less than 114 millimeters (mm) fell in a single 24-hour period. This was the second highest 24-hour amount for the month since 1943, according to Brazil\u2019s National Meteorological Institute (INMET).\nAccording to a study by researchers at the Natural Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN), an agency of the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC), both the total rainfall and the frequency of extreme rainfall events in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo have increased significantly in the last seven decades.\nWhile there were practically no days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) in the 1950s, such days have occurred between twice and five times per year in the last ten years in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo, according to the authors.\nThe study was supported by S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation \u2013 FAPESP under the aegis of its Research Program on Global Climate Change (RPGCC). The findings are reported in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.\nResearchers affiliated with INMET, the National Space Research Institute (INPE) and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG-USP) also took part in the study.\n\u201cIntense rainstorms lasting a few hours with huge amounts of water, as much as 80 mm or 100 mm, are no longer sporadic events. They\u2019re happening more and more frequently,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Antonio Marengo, a senior researcher at CEMADEN and principal investigator for the study, told.\nThe researchers analyzed data collected by INMET\u2019s weather stations at IAG-USP and Santana Lookout in the northern part of the city. The analysis showed an increase in the number of days with heavy rain and in the frequency of rainfall extremes, especially during the rainy season (spring-summer).\nThe dry season used to occur between April and September in most of the state but has lasted until October in recent decades. The number of consecutive days without any rain at all has also gradually increased, suggesting that heavy rainfall events are concentrated in fewer days, interrupted by longer periods of hot dry weather.\nWith fewer cold nights and more hot days, convective rainfall is more likely to occur, increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall, the authors note.\nIn convective rainfall, the ground heats up, boosting evaporation and causing warm moist air to rise (convection). As the air ascends, it cools and forms convective clouds, which precipitate upon reaching saturation.\n\u201cWe observed a long-term trend in this kind of weather event, with very strong signs that climate change is in progress,\u201d Marengo said.\nRecords from the IAG-USP and Santana Lookout weather stations showed a four-fold increase in the number of days with rainfall exceeding 100 mm between 2000 and 2018 compared with those from the 1940s or 1960s.\nRecords from IAG-USP also showed an increase in total rainfall, in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, and in the frequency of consecutive dry days in the period 1931-2017.\n\u201cThis suggests that the increase in total rainfall in S\u00e3o Paulo in recent decades was due to an increase in \u2018heavy\u2019 precipitation, concentrated in fewer days and with longer dry spells in between,\u201d Marengo said.\nCauses\nAccording to the researchers, the changing rainfall regime in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo may be due to natural climate variability but may also be related to global warming and growing urbanization that has occurred especially in the last 40 years, which has exacerbated the occurrence of urban heat islands.\nThe growth of urbanization has transformed the region\u2019s previously exposed soil and Atlantic Rainforest remnants into sealed concrete, cement and asphalt surfaces that absorb heat while retaining no moisture. The temperature rises during the day, and as the sun goes down, the accumulated heat rises into the atmosphere, the relative humidity falls, and water evaporates rapidly from the ground to form towering cumulonimbus clouds, Marengo explained.\nIn his view, heat islands and similar effects help explain the increase in extreme rainfall events that occurred in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo between 1933 and 2010.\nIn the last 20 years, these changes in the rainfall regime, in conjunction with the high-risk construction of buildings on hillsides and riverbanks, have led to an increase in hydrometeorological hazards, triggering disasters such as flash floods, river flooding and landslides, the authors note.\n\u201cAn extreme rainfall event isn\u2019t itself a natural disaster. So-called natural disasters actually result from a combination of factors ranging from climate and weather to urban, economic and social phenomena. In other words, they\u2019re also anthropogenic disasters that result from human action, not just climate,\u201d Marengo said.\nMost Brazilian states suffer from flooding, but it is worst in S\u00e3o Paulo, which accounts for 33.36% of cases, followed by Santa Catarina (11.25%), Rio Grande do Sul (9.06%), Paran\u00e1 (8.33%), Rio de Janeiro (7.28%) and Minas Gerais (5.96%).\nSome 170 river floods and flash floods occurred in the period 2014-18. Flash floods produced the most deaths and serious injuries, followed by landslides and mudslides.\n\u201cThe Southeast and South regions of Brazil are the worst affected by hydrometeorological disasters because of their population density,\u201d Marengo said.\n\u201cLandslides, for example, only kill people because they\u2019re forced to live in high-risk areas where no one should build a home. The streets only fill up with water because the rivers have been channelized and buried, and the city\u2019s surfaces are sealed with asphalt and concrete.\u201d\nSource: Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo\nRelated\nBrazil\nIndonesia \u2013 at Least 3 Dead, 2 Missing After Floods and Landslides in 3 Provinces\nUSA \u2013  Neptune Flood Insurance Now Available in 42 States\n\nECMWF\nLatest Articles\nFollow Us\nCategories\nFlood News in Americas by Country\nEditor's Picks\nDepave \u2013 the Community-Based Approach to Storm Water Management\nUsing Drones for Flood Disaster Risk Reduction, Assessment and Recovery\nFlood Protection Options for Airports\nReport \u2013 Flood Losses in Europe to Increase Fivefold by 2050\nUN \u2013 1995 to 2015, Flood Disasters Affected 2.3 Billion and Killed 157,000\nDrowning World \u2013 Photographer Gideon Mendel\u2019s 8 Year Project\nFlood and High Water Marks\nG-Cans Project, Tokyo \u2013 Japan\u2019s $2.6 Billion Flood Tunnel\nCookies | Privacy |  Contacts\nNorth America\nSouth America\nEurope\nAsia\nAfrica\nOceania\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 FloodList \n",
    "Summarized_Document1": "March 2024 Monthly Weather Report\n\nUK Overview\nMarch was unsettled, wet, and dull. The month began colder than normal, with notable low temperatures in southern areas (e.g., -4.6\u00b0C in Benson, Oxfordshire on the 3rd). Snow fell on the 2nd in southwest England, causing travel disruptions. Milder weather followed, with temperatures reaching up to 18.8\u00b0C in Charlwood, Surrey on the 20th. The month ended with unsettled weather, including rain and wind. The provisional mean temperature for the UK was 6.7\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above average. Southern England was milder with a mean temperature of 8.2\u00b0C, while Scotland had 5.0\u00b0C. The UK recorded 127% of the long-term average rainfall for March, with England and Wales exceeding 150% of their averages. County Down in Northern Ireland had its third wettest March on record with 145.9mm of rain. The UK recorded just 95.2 hours of sunshine, 87% of the long-term average.\n\nWeather Impacts\nSnow in Ireland, southwest Midlands, and Bristol caused traffic disruptions. Persistent rain, especially in southern England, led to groundwater and surface water flooding. Heavy snow on the 1st and 2nd caused traffic incidents and road closures. The rest of the month saw regular rain, with significant flooding in Cornwall on the 25th/26th. The month ended with heavy showers and some settled weather over Easter.\n\nMonthly Extremes\n- Highest Maximum: 18.8\u00b0C on 20th at Charlwood, Surrey\n- Lowest Maximum: 1.2\u00b0C on 2nd at Pennerley, Shropshire\n- Highest Minimum: 11.6\u00b0C on 14th at Prestatyn, Clwyd\n- Lowest Minimum: -6.9\u00b0C on 26th at Altnaharra No 2, Sutherland\n- Most Rainfall: 94.4mm on 13th at Capel Curig No 3, Gwynedd\n- Most Sunshine: 11.5 hours on 30th at Kirkwall, Orkney and 31st at Bewcastle, Cumbria\n- Highest Gust: 70Kt (81mph) on 1st and 28th at Wight: Needles Old Battery, Isle of Wight\n- Greatest Snow Depth: 12cm on 1st at Lough Navar Forest, Fermanagh\n\nMonthly Climate Statistics\n- Mean Maximum Temperature: UK 10.0\u00b0C, England 11.1\u00b0C, Wales 10.0\u00b0C, Scotland 8.1\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 9.7\u00b0C\n- Mean Minimum Temperature: UK 3.5\u00b0C, England 4.4\u00b0C, Wales 4.0\u00b0C, Scotland 1.9\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 3.5\u00b0C\n- Mean Temperature: UK 6.7\u00b0C, England 7.8\u00b0C, Wales 7.0\u00b0C, Scotland 5.0\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 6.6\u00b0C\n- Rainfall: UK 107.8mm (127% of average), England 94.3mm (162%), Wales 158.2mm (153%), Scotland 112.7mm (90%), Northern Ireland 129.2mm (149%)\n- Sunshine: UK 95.2 hours (87% of average), England 93.4 hours (80%), Wales 86.8 hours (79%), Scotland 101.4 hours (104%), Northern Ireland 88.9 hours (88%)\n- Windspeed: UK 9.9 knots, England 8.9 knots, Wales 10.7 knots, Scotland 11.4 knots, Northern Ireland 9.9 knots\n\nMonthly Time-Series\n- Mean Temperature: 6.7\u00b0C (2024), 6.0\u00b0C (2015-2024), 5.7\u00b0C (1991-2020), 4.7\u00b0C (1961-1990)\n- Rainfall: 107.8mm (2024), 96.5mm (2015-2024), 85.1mm (1991-2020), 91.0mm (1961-1990)\n- Sunshine: 95.2 hours (2024), 113.6 hours (2015-2024), 109.2 hours (1991-2020), 100.0 hours (1961-1990)\n\nWeather Diary\nMarch was dominated by Atlantic low-pressure systems, with brief settled spells. The month started wet and windy, with significant rainfall and strong winds. High pressure over Scandinavia brought dry but cold conditions to northern England and Scotland from the 7th to the 11th. From the 13th to the 25th, a series of depressions brought more wind and rain. After the 25th, a north-south split was evident, with Scotland experiencing cold and showery weather, while the rest of the UK was milder but wet.\n\nNotes\nThe Met Office National Meteorological Library and Archive holds a near-continuous record of monthly weather reports from 1884. This report provides an overview of the weather conditions across the UK for March 2024, based on observations from the surface network of weather stations.

    "Summarized_Document2": "A study by Brazil\u2019s National Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN) reveals that extreme rainfall days in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo have increased four-fold over seven decades. The research indicates a rise in consecutive dry days, suggesting that extreme rainfall events are now concentrated in shorter, more widely spaced periods. In February, S\u00e3o Paulo experienced significant flooding, with 114 millimeters (mm) of rain falling in a single 24-hour period, the second highest for the month since 1943. The study, supported by S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) and reported in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, shows that days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) have increased from practically none in the 1950s to between two and five times per year in the last decade. Researchers from INMET, INPE, and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo also contributed to the study. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Marengo, a senior researcher at CEMADEN, noted that intense rainstorms with 80 mm to 100 mm of rain are becoming more frequent. Data from INMET\u2019s weather stations at IAG-USP and Santana Lookout showed a four-fold increase in days with rainfall exceeding 100 mm between 2000 and 2018 compared to the 1940s or 1960s. The study also found an increase in total rainfall, the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, and consecutive dry days from 1931 to 2017. The researchers suggest that these changes may be due to natural climate variability, global warming, and urbanization, which has created urban heat islands. These changes, combined with high-risk construction on hillsides and riverbanks, have increased hydrometeorological hazards, leading to more flash floods, river flooding, and landslides. S\u00e3o Paulo accounts for 33.36% of flooding cases in Brazil, followed by Santa Catarina (11.25%), Rio Grande do Sul (9.06%), Paran\u00e1 (8.33%), Rio de Janeiro (7.28%), and Minas Gerais (5.96%). Between 2014 and 2018, 170 river floods and flash floods occurred, with flash floods causing the most deaths and injuries. The Southeast and South regions of Brazil are the worst affected by hydrometeorological disasters due to their population density.",

    "Document2": "The Maldives is racing to create new land. Why are so many people concerned?\nBy Jesse Chase-Lubitz\nPhotography by Neeta Satam for Nature\n24 April 2024\nThis article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.\nThis article is also available as a pdf version.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSun, sand and sea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Those are the three ingredients for tourism in the Maldives, Mohamed Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father told him. For more than a decade, Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family owned a successful local hotel in Addu, the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 southernmost atoll. But nearly 9\u00a0months ago, the government took away the sea.\nA state-sponsored project had pulled up sediment from offshore areas and used it to extend the beach in front of the hotel by 130\u00a0metres\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 too far to walk for most tourists who want easy access to the ocean. Now all Shaiz sees from his hotel is a human-made desert and a slew of cancelled reservations.\nThe view in front of Mohamed Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel on Addu Atoll.\nThe Maldives is an 820-kilometre-long chain of nearly 1,200 islands dotting the Indian Ocean. The nation has become one of the most popular luxury tourism destinations in the world because of its Instagrammable beaches and its advertising slogan: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe sunny side of life\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But the Maldives is also one of the countries most vulnerable to sea-level rise. With 80% of its land less than one metre above sea level, some scientists predict that the islands could be completely submerged by 2100.\nIn an effort to keep the country above water and thriving, the government is adopting a strategy used by many nations around the globe: land reclamation. The sandy stretch in front of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel is some of the newest land on the planet, dug up from the bottom of the ocean, sucked through pipes and piled along the coast to make more space.\nMaldivian government officials say that the land is necessary to make room for economic development, especially as sea levels rise.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will be a doorstep, a job destination and an income-generating destination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said President Mohamed Muizzu at the inauguration of a new land-reclamation project last December.\nCritics are unconvinced, and say that the country has enough space to thrive. One swathe of land on a neighbouring island near Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel was reclaimed in 2016. It remains undeveloped today. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCall me in five years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shaiz says, gesturing to the newly created desert in front of his hotel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis land will be the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMohamed Shaiz and his family own a hotel on Addu Atoll.\nMohamed Shaiz and his family own a hotel on Addu Atoll.\nIn addition to the disputed economics, there is serious concern about the environmental damage that land reclamation can cause. Studies in the Maldives and at other sites around the world have shown that it can harm corals and seagrass, damage natural barriers, such as sand bars, mangroves and estuaries, and destroy marine habitats. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAtolls are extremely vulnerable ecosystems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Bregje van Wesenbeeck, the scientific director of Deltares, a Dutch research institute for water management in Delft. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce you start to interfere with them, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sort of failing them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll.\nThe island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll.\nDutch planners are often considered the founders of land reclamation, with a history of water engineering going back some 800\u00a0years. Over the centuries, land-forming projects have shaped some of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major cities, including Singapore, London, New York and Miami. In recent decades, most of the reclaimed land has been in East Asia. In China, Shanghai has reclaimed 350\u00a0square kilometres \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than three times the size of Paris\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 over the past few decades. Colombo has added 100\u00a0km2 in just 4\u00a0years, and 65\u00a0km2 of Mumbai is reclaimed. A study on twenty-first-century coastal-land reclamation found that of 135 large coastal cities with populations of more than one\u00a0million people, 75%\u00a0had reclaimed land1.\nWith projects stretching back to 1997, the Maldives is a veteran of large-scale land reclamation. Then-minister of state for environment Abdulla Naseer said in 2018 that there are an estimated 50\u00a0islands with reclaimed land in the country, although many specialists say that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a conservative estimate.\nSource: Maldives Land and Survey Authority\nSource: Maldives Land and Survey Authority\nLand scarcity is a key factor driving reclamation projects. Although the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s territory covers 90,000\u00a0km2, more than 99% of it is ocean. Around half a million people live on a total land area of just 300\u00a0km2, and the country welcomes around 1.3\u00a0million tourists each year, who contribute 80% of its gross domestic product. The capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9, is one of the most densely populated parts of the planet.

When the government decides to reclaim land, it takes sand from the lagoons using boats outfitted with suction pipes, which collect sand and coral debris from the ocean floor like giant vacuum cleaners. The boat then deposits the material in a different spot, either inside or outside the atoll, to form new land. Sometimes reclamation projects fill in the entire lagoon.\nHeaps of sand and debris are piled up next to Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel and behind the new patch of reclaimed land.\nHeaps of sand and debris are piled up next to Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel and behind the new patch of reclaimed land.\nAddu Atoll, the site of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel, is about two hours south of Mal\u00c3\u00a9 by aeroplane. Its rich coral reefs support more than 1,200\u00a0species of fish\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of the factors that led the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO to include the atoll in its World Network of Biosphere Reserves in 2020.\nSome of the islands are so narrow that you can almost always see water on both sides while standing in the centre. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a largely quiet and rural place that feels forgotten. Yet construction marches on.\nThe Ministry of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure announced the Addu Development Project in 2021, aiming to reclaim parts of the atoll and develop a road connection between existing islands. One of the ministry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s justifications is that it will provide extra housing. In the Maldives, land for houses is given away to eligible individuals and families. Addu City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor, Ali Nizar, says that there have been more than 5,000\u00a0requests for housing since he entered office in 2021. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no other way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nA reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts.\nA reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts.\nBecause Addu has one of the few international airports in the country, the hope is also that the extra land will attract international investment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this huge expansion project, the transformational development of Addu City has commenced,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said former president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih after inaugurating the project in June 2023.\nThe project has been controversial from the start. When it was announced, Ibrahim Mohamed was sitting at his desk at the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Mal\u00c3\u00a9. He instantly had concerns about how the project would affect Addu. Mohamed grew up in Addu in the 1970s, taking walks through the massive seagrass beds near his home. He remembers watching stingrays surf the waves, and marvelling at fiddler crabs along the shore.\nMohamed led the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process for land-reclamation projects. When the Addu proposal landed on his desk, he contracted an environmental consulting group called Water Solutions, headquarted in Mal\u00c3\u00a9, to do the review.\nThe environmental impact report, published in February 2022, found that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe proposed reclamation is well received by the community\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh interest to implement the project based on the potential economic benefits\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But it also concluded that \u00e2\u0080\u009clong-term irreversible negative impacts will be generated from the project\u00e2\u0080\u009d for both the environment and the community, including by destroying coral reefs and seagrass meadows and harming the fishing and tourism industries.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was sufficient enough for the EPA to reject the project,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mohamed says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In May 2022, he quit his job after 10\u00a0years at the agency.\nAfter the report came out, the EPA pushed for changes, such as a smaller area from which the project would source sand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe tried to change the scope because we are here to protect the environment and at the same time, help development,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s director-general, Ibrahim Naeem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDevelopment has to go hand in hand with environment. It should not destroy the environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.\nOnce the changes were made to the proposed project, Water Solutions produced a second report to assess the environmental impacts at the end of September 2022. It found that the altered project, with increased mitigation and monitoring in place, would still have irreversible negative impacts\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 ranging from moderate to major\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 on marine plants and animals, protected and sensitive areas, tourism, fisheries and recreational activities.\nThe assessment calculated that the cost of the damage to coral reefs alone would be between US$340\u00a0million and $851\u00a0million.\nThe September 2022 report does not offer explicit recommendations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur role is to share the information. We just wanted to present the facts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Ahmed Jameel, managing director of Water Solutions and one of the authors of the report. However, he adds, the assessment was not vague in its conclusions. The findings showed clearly that the project \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould have an overall negative impact\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he says.\nWhen asked about the concerns raised in the second report, Naeem says that the findings, combined with insights he received from EPA staff members who conducted anonymous reviews of the EIA, indicated that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cenough justification in the report to approve it in terms of social benefit\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAny development projects in this type of environment, especially in the marine area, will have an impact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says, adding that \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you do reclamation properly, and if you do it wisely, I think impacts can be minimized\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nIbrahim Mohamed previously worked for the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency.\nIbrahim Mohamed previously worked for the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe construction company Van Oord is performing the reclamation work for the Addu Atoll project.\nThe construction company Van Oord is performing the reclamation work for the Addu Atoll project.\nThe Dutch company responsible for doing the construction on the project, Van Oord, told Nature that environmental management for the project is overseen by the EPA and that it is working with the agency and local specialists to minimize the environmental impacts. Van Oord said it prepared a comprehensive environmental management plan \u00e2\u0080\u009cbased on the mitigation measures mandated in the EIA and in compliance with international guidelines\u00e2\u0080\u009d. As part of its efforts, the company relocated coral and seagrass, and added silt screens to limit how much sediment would flow beyond the reclamation zone and affect other areas.\nVan Oord, which is based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told Nature that \u00e2\u0080\u009call the predicted impacts have been effectively managed by implementing a series of mitigation measures\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nA new house on Hulhumeedhoo island, to the northeast of Addu City, remains unfinished and unoccupied.\nA new house on Hulhumeedhoo island, to the northeast of Addu City, remains unfinished and unoccupied.\nIn October 2022, the EPA approved the project. But critics say the environmental costs of the reclamation are too high.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think their efforts are not worth the amount of destruction and the irreversible damage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Mohamed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can never be compensated properly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nToday, the land in front of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel is the result of that decision. Yet if you speak to people on Addu, many say that land is not what they need right now; they need jobs. Much of Addu is filled with empty, unfinished homes because individuals don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the income or resources to build houses on their free land.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFifty per cent [of our land] is abandoned or empty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Addu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former deputy mayor, Abdullah Thoyyib, who served the city before this reclamation project took place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need economic benefits and job opportunities, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not happening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nReefs at risk\nReclamation projects in the Maldives can fill the water with sediment, threatening coral reefs.\nReclamation projects in the Maldives can fill the water with sediment, threatening coral reefs.\nSitting in a resort in Addu City, Nisal Musthag places a map of Addu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main diving spots on the table. Musthag leads diving trips for one of the two active resorts in the atoll, and he has seen some of the damage that follows reclamation projects. He points at one of the four channels between the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lagoon and the ocean. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is like a cemetery now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.\nMusthag does three to four dives a day, six days a week. Since the most-recent reclamation, there are at least five sites he no longer takes guests to. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are people who come back every year to dive, and this year they were like, hey, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNisal Musthag leads diving trips in Addu, but has stopped taking tourists to spots where coral was damaged by reclamation projects.\nThe impacts of reclamation on coral health are one of researchers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 main concerns. Some reefs die when sediment is dumped on them to create new land. But even corals that escape direct damage can be harmed because the construction work creates clouds of sediment that spread out and settle on more distant reefs. Robbed of light and nutrients, these corals can struggle to survive. The damage to reefs not only harms the ecosystem but can also leave the islands vulnerable to storms and sea-level rise, say scientists.\nTo reduce damage to corals during the work at Addu, the EIA required that at least 10% of existing corals be relocated outside the reclamation footprints. Van Oord says it has moved 73,000\u00a0corals to 9\u00a0recipient sites identified in conjunction with the EPA. The firm says that it \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertainly surpassed the EIA requirement\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nSaleem Rasheed is one of several local divers who helped to relocate the corals. He has been monitoring them for the past year. One species, blue coral (Heliopora coerulea), which was moved from the outside of the atoll to the inside, died completely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe moved 80\u00a0colonies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Rasheed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey survived one week and died entirely after six months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAli Nizar, Addu City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor, supports the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reclamation projects.\nFathimath Saaira, social-justice advocate in Addu. \nFathimath Saaira, social-justice advocate in Addu. \nFathimath Saaira is a social-justice advocate in Addu who opposes the reclamation there.\nBut the rest of the species have shown resilience. Three months after relocation, they were struggling, but now, Rasheed says, they are alive and well.\nResearchers have found that coral relocation can work if colonies are moved to areas with similar conditions that are protected from waves. A 2017 study in Hawaii, for example, showed that relocated corals were thriving a decade after they were moved2. One study on coral restoration and relocation in the Maldives measured the survival rate of 242\u00a0coral fragments 12\u00a0months after they had been moved3. The authors found a 70% survival rate, which they concluded was a promising result. \nA solitary mangrove tree grows near newly reclaimed land in northeast Addu.\nA grey heron joins others on a new sea wall built in Addu.\nBut coral health is only one concern for researchers studying the effects of reclamation. Mangroves, seagrass beds and coastal ecosystems can also be in harm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way, say scientists.\nWater Solutions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 second report about the Addu project, for example, projected that the reclamation process would bury about 98\u00a0hectares of seagrass meadow in the atoll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lagoon, at an estimated economic cost of more than $3.7\u00a0million a year.\nCoral debris makes up much of the reclaimed land.\nCoral debris makes up much of the reclaimed land.\nNot far from Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel, a sea wall stretches towards the horizon, protecting a new swathe of land made of sand and coral debris. Coastal protection efforts such as the sea wall\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the changes wrought by reclamation\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 could have long-lasting effects on the processes that keep the islands from eroding, say researchers.\nLike other atolls, the Maldivian islands evolve with the seasons, with monsoons moving sand around them. Between December and February, the winds transport sand from the northeast to the southwest. Between June and August, the pattern reverses.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a natural island, you will see seasonally the sand shifting with the waves and the currents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Mohamed. But reclamation can impede this process, he adds, by taking sand and coral debris from some locations through dredging\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 leaving a deficit in its wake\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and depositing it where natural flows wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Some projects add another complication by building hard barriers, such as sea walls, to protect the land, because they can stop the natural flow of sediments.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEcosystems can adapt if we allow them to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says van Wesenbeeck at Deltares. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy interfering, you will kill the whole system in the end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNot only does this change how the island naturally maintains itself, but it can also draw development to places that are at a high risk of a storm surge or erosion, say some researchers.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIslands can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t occur anywhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Virginie Duvat, a coastal geographer at La Rochelle University in France, who has studied the effects of land reclamation in the Maldives. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you put an island where there was naturally no island, you create vulnerable land and you will necessarily have to build strong engineered structures, breakwaters and sea walls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says.\nA reclamation projection near Mal\u00c3\u00a9.\nThilafushi is an industrial island near Mal\u00c3\u00a9 that hosts one of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large rubbish dumps. New land is extending the island westward.\nIn a 2019 study4, Duvat and Alexandre Magnan, a geographer at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Sciences Po in Paris, assessed the scale of coastal changes that humans had made to 107 inhabited islands in the Maldives between 2004\u00e2\u0080\u009306 and 2014\u00e2\u0080\u009316. On almost half the islands, the researchers found significant degradation in the reefs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 abilities to weaken waves and provide natural sources of sediments. One-fifth of the islands had almost entirely or entirely \u00e2\u0080\u009clost their natural capacity to respond and adjust to ocean climate-related pressures\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the researchers say.\nSource: Ref. 4\nSource: Ref. 4\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt means that a decision you have taken one day to rely on reclaimed land will necessarily cause you to invest more money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Duvat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are locked into the engineered path for decades and decades and potentially the rest of the century.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you build a levee, people will think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re safe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says van Wesenbeeck. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut is it wise to destroy environmental assets to create investment in an area that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the most vulnerable in the world for climate change?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe city of hope\nA new housing development in Hulhumal\u00c3\u00a9. \nA new housing development in Hulhumal\u00c3\u00a9. \nSome 550\u00a0km to the north of Addu, the capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9, sits like an overpopulated postage stamp in the middle of the ocean.\nMal\u00c3\u00a9 is tiny\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 less than 2\u00a0km across at its widest point\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 but more than 200,000\u00a0people live on the island.

    "Summarized_Document2": "\u201cSun, sand and sea.\u201d Those are the three ingredients for tourism in the Maldives, Mohamed Shaiz\u2019s father told him. For more than a decade, Shaiz\u2019s family owned a successful local hotel in Addu, the Maldives\u2019 southernmost atoll. But nearly 9 months ago, the government took away the sea. A state-sponsored project had pulled up sediment from offshore areas and used it to extend the beach in front of the hotel by 130 metres \u2014 too far to walk for most tourists who want easy access to the ocean. Now all Shaiz sees from his hotel is a human-made desert and a slew of cancelled reservations. The Maldives is an 820-kilometre-long chain of nearly 1,200 islands dotting the Indian Ocean. The nation has become one of the most popular luxury tourism destinations in the world because of its Instagrammable beaches and its advertising slogan: \u201cthe sunny side of life\u201d. But the Maldives is also one of the countries most vulnerable to sea-level rise. With 80% of its land less than one metre above sea level, some scientists predict that the islands could be completely submerged by 2100. In an effort to keep the country above water and thriving, the government is adopting a strategy used by many nations around the globe: land reclamation. The sandy stretch in front of Shaiz\u2019s hotel is some of the newest land on the planet, dug up from the bottom of the ocean, sucked through pipes and piled along the coast to make more space. Maldivian government officials say that the land is necessary to make room for economic development, especially as sea levels rise. Critics are unconvinced, and say that the country has enough space to thrive. One swathe of land on a neighbouring island near Shaiz\u2019s hotel was reclaimed in 2016. It remains undeveloped today. In addition to the disputed economics, there is serious concern about the environmental damage that land reclamation can cause. Studies in the Maldives and at other sites around the world have shown that it can harm corals and seagrass, damage natural barriers, such as sand bars, mangroves and estuaries, and destroy marine habitats. The island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00e9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll. Dutch planners are often considered the founders of land reclamation, with a history of water engineering going back some 800 years. Over the centuries, land-forming projects have shaped some of the world\u2019s major cities, including Singapore, London, New York and Miami. In recent decades, most of the reclaimed land has been in East Asia. In China, Shanghai has reclaimed 350 square kilometres \u2014 more than three times the size of Paris \u2014 over the past few decades. Colombo has added 100 km2 in just 4 years, and 65 km2 of Mumbai is reclaimed. A study on twenty-first-century coastal-land reclamation found that of 135 large coastal cities with populations of more than one million people, 75% had reclaimed land. With projects stretching back to 1997, the Maldives is a veteran of large-scale land reclamation. Then-minister of state for environment Abdulla Naseer said in 2018 that there are an estimated 50 islands with reclaimed land in the country, although many specialists say that\u2019s a conservative estimate. Land scarcity is a key factor driving reclamation projects. Although the nation\u2019s territory covers 90,000 km2, more than 99% of it is ocean. Around half a million people live on a total land area of just 300 km2, and the country welcomes around 1.3 million tourists each year, who contribute 80% of its gross domestic product. The capital, Mal\u00e9, is one of the most densely populated parts of the planet. It\u2019s possible to walk across the entire island in 20 minutes. The Maldives\u2019 1,200 islands are all atolls \u2014 rings of coral reef that surround lagoons. When the government decides to reclaim land, it takes sand from the lagoons using boats outfitted with suction pipes, which collect sand and coral debris from the ocean floor like giant vacuum cleaners. The boat then deposits the material in a different spot, either inside or outside the atoll, to form new land. Sometimes reclamation projects fill in the entire lagoon. Addu Atoll, the site of Shaiz\u2019s hotel, is about two hours south of Mal\u00e9 by aeroplane. Its rich coral reefs support more than 1,200 species of fish \u2014 one of the factors that led the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO to include the atoll in its World Network of Biosphere Reserves in 2020. Some of the islands are so narrow that you can almost always see water on both sides while standing in the centre. It\u2019s a largely quiet and rural place that feels forgotten. Yet construction marches on. The Ministry of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure announced the Addu Development Project in 2021, aiming to reclaim parts of the atoll and develop a road connection between existing islands. One of the ministry\u2019s justifications is that it will provide extra housing. In the Maldives, land for houses is given away to eligible individuals and families. Addu City\u2019s mayor, Ali Nizar, says that there have been more than 5,000 requests for housing since he entered office in 2021. A reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts. Because Addu has one of the few international airports in the country, the hope is also that the extra land will attract international investment. The project has been controversial from the start. When it was announced, Ibrahim Mohamed was sitting at his desk at the Maldives\u2019 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Mal\u00e9. He instantly had concerns about how the project would affect Addu. Mohamed grew up in Addu in the 1970s, taking walks through the massive seagrass beds near his home. He remembers watching stingrays surf the waves, and marvelling at fiddler crabs along the shore. Mohamed led the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process for land-reclamation projects. When the Addu proposal landed on his desk, he contracted an environmental consulting group called Water Solutions, headquarted in Mal\u00e9, to do the review. The environmental impact report, published in February 2022, found that \u201cthe proposed reclamation is well received by the community\u201d and that there was \u201chigh interest to implement the project based on the potential economic benefits\u201d. But it also concluded that \u201clong-term irreversible negative impacts will be generated from the project\u201d for both the environment and the community, including by destroying coral reefs and seagrass meadows and harming the fishing and tourism industries. \u201cIt was sufficient enough for the EPA to reject the project,\u201d Mohamed says. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t.\u201d In May 2022, he quit his job after 10 years at the agency. After the report came out, the EPA pushed for changes, such as a smaller area from which the project would source sand. \u201cWe tried to change the scope because we are here to protect the environment and at the same time, help development,\u201d says the agency\u2019s director-general, Ibrahim Naeem. \u201cDevelopment has to go hand in hand with environment. It should not destroy the environment,\u201d he says. Once the changes were made to the proposed project, Water Solutions produced a second report to assess the environmental impacts at the end of September 2022. It found that the altered project, with increased mitigation and monitoring in place, would still have irreversible negative impacts \u2014 ranging from moderate to major \u2014 on marine plants and animals, protected and sensitive areas, tourism, fisheries and recreational activities. The assessment calculated that the cost of the damage to coral reefs alone would be between US$340 million and $851 million. The September 2022 report does not offer explicit recommendations. \u201cOur role is to share the information. We just wanted to present the facts,\u201d says Ahmed Jameel, managing director of Water Solutions and one of the authors of the report. However, he adds, the assessment was not vague in its conclusions. The findings showed clearly that the project \u201cwould have an overall negative impact\u201d, he says. When asked about the concerns raised in the second report, Naeem says that the findings, combined with insights he received from EPA staff members who conducted anonymous reviews of the EIA, indicated that there was \u201cenough justification in the report to approve it in terms of social benefit\u201d. \u201cAny development projects in this type of environment, especially in the marine area, will have an impact,\u201d he says, adding that \u201cif you do reclamation properly, and if you do it wisely, I think impacts can be minimized\u201d. The Dutch company responsible for doing the construction on the project, Van Oord, told Nature that environmental management for the project is overseen by the EPA and that it is working with the agency and local specialists to minimize the environmental impacts. Van Oord said it prepared a comprehensive environmental management plan \u201cbased on the mitigation measures mandated in the EIA and in compliance with international guidelines\u201d. As part of its efforts, the company relocated coral and seagrass, and added silt screens to limit how much sediment would flow beyond the reclamation zone and affect other areas. Van Oord, which is based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told Nature that \u201call the predicted impacts have been effectively managed by implementing a series of mitigation measures\u201d. In October 2022, the EPA approved the project. But critics say the environmental costs of the reclamation are too high. \u201cI think their efforts are not worth the amount of destruction and the irreversible damage,\u201d says Mohamed. \u201cIt can never be compensated properly.\u201d Today, the land in front of Shaiz\u2019s hotel is the result of that decision. Yet if you speak to people on Addu, many say that land is not what they need right now; they need jobs. Much of Addu is filled with empty, unfinished homes because individuals don\u2019t have the income or resources to build houses on their free land. \u201cFifty per cent [of our land] is abandoned or empty,\u201d says Addu\u2019s former deputy mayor, Abdullah Thoyyib, who served the city before this reclamation project took place. \u201cWe need economic benefits and job opportunities, but that\u2019s not happening.\u201d Sitting in a resort in Addu City, Nisal Musthag places a map of Addu\u2019s main diving spots on the table. Musthag leads diving trips for one of the two active resorts in the atoll, and he has seen some of the damage that follows reclamation projects. He points at one of the four channels between the island\u2019s lagoon and the ocean. \u201cThis is like a cemetery now,\u201d he says. Musthag does three to four dives a day, six days a week. Since the most-recent reclamation, there are at least five sites he no longer takes guests to. \u201cThere are people who come back every year to dive, and this year they were like, hey, what\u2019s happening?\u201d The impacts of reclamation on coral health are one of researchers\u2019 main concerns. Some reefs die when sediment is dumped on them to create new land. But even corals that escape direct damage can be harmed because the construction work creates clouds of sediment that spread out and settle on more distant reefs. Robbed of light and nutrients, these corals can struggle to survive. The damage to reefs not only harms the ecosystem but can also leave the islands vulnerable to storms and sea-level rise, say scientists. To reduce damage to corals during the work at Addu, the EIA required that at least 10% of existing corals be relocated outside the reclamation footprints. Van Oord says it has moved 73,000 corals to 9 recipient sites identified in conjunction with the EPA. The firm says that it \u201ccertainly surpassed the EIA requirement\u201d. Saleem Rasheed is one of several local divers who helped to relocate the corals. He has been monitoring them for the past year. One species, blue coral (Heliopora coerulea), which was moved from the outside of the atoll to the inside, died completely. \u201cWe moved 80 colonies,\u201d says Rasheed. \u201cThey survived one week and died entirely after six months.\u201d But the rest of the species have shown resilience. Three months after relocation, they were struggling, but now, Rasheed says, they are alive and well. Researchers have found that coral relocation can work if colonies are moved to areas with similar conditions that are protected from waves. A 2017 study in Hawaii, for example, showed that relocated corals were thriving a decade after they were moved. One study on coral restoration and relocation in the Maldives measured the survival rate of 242 coral fragments 12 months after they had been moved. The authors found a 70% survival rate, which they concluded was a promising result. But coral health is only one concern for researchers studying the effects of reclamation. Mangroves, seagrass beds and coastal ecosystems can also be in harm\u2019s way, say scientists. Water Solutions\u2019 second report about the Addu project, for example, projected that the reclamation process would bury about 98 hectares of seagrass meadow in the atoll\u2019s lagoon, at an estimated economic cost of more than $3.7 million a year. Not far from Shaiz\u2019s hotel, a sea wall stretches towards the horizon, protecting a new swathe of land made of sand and coral debris. Coastal protection efforts such as the sea wall \u2014 and the changes wrought by reclamation \u2014 could have long-lasting effects on the processes that keep the islands from eroding, say researchers. Like other atolls, the Maldivian islands evolve with the seasons, with monsoons moving sand around them. Between December and February, the winds transport sand from the northeast to the southwest. Between June and August, the pattern reverses. \u201cIn a natural island, you will see seasonally the sand shifting with the waves and the currents,\u201d says Mohamed. But reclamation can impede this process, he adds, by taking sand and coral debris from some locations through dredging \u2014 leaving a deficit in its wake \u2014 and depositing it where natural flows wouldn\u2019t. Some projects add another complication by building hard barriers, such as sea walls, to protect the land, because they can stop the natural flow of sediments. \u201cEcosystems can adapt if we allow them to,\u201d says van Wesenbeeck at Deltares. \u201cBy interfering, you will kill the whole system in the end.\u201d Not only does this change how the island naturally maintains itself, but it can also draw development to places that are at a high risk of a storm surge or erosion, say some researchers. \u201cIslands can\u2019t occur anywhere,\u201d says Virginie Duvat, a coastal geographer at La Rochelle University in France, who has studied the effects of land reclamation in the Maldives. \u201cIf you put an island where there was naturally no island, you create vulnerable land and you will necessarily have to build strong engineered structures, breakwaters and sea walls,\u201d she says. In a 2019 study, Duvat and Alexandre Magnan, a geographer at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations \u2014 Sciences Po in Paris, assessed the scale of coastal changes that humans had made to 107 inhabited islands in the Maldives between 2004\u201306 and 2014\u201316. On almost half the islands, the researchers found significant degradation in the reefs\u2019 abilities to weaken waves and provide natural sources of sediments. One-fifth of the islands had almost entirely or entirely \u201clost their natural capacity to respond and adjust to ocean climate-related pressures\u201d, the researchers say. \u201cIt means that a decision you have taken one day to rely on reclaimed land will necessarily cause you to invest more money,\u201d says Duvat. \u201cYou are locked into the engineered path for decades and decades and potentially the rest of the century.\u201d \u201cIf you build a levee, people will think they\u2019re safe,\u201d says van Wesenbeeck. \u201cBut is it wise to destroy environmental assets to create investment in an area that\u2019s one of the most vulnerable in the world for climate change?\u201d Some 550 km to the north of Addu, the capital, Mal\u00e9, sits like an overpopulated postage stamp in the middle of the ocean. Mal\u00e9 is tiny \u2014 less than 2 km across at its widest point \u2014 but more than 200,000 people live on the island. To relieve population pressures, the government decided in the late 1990s to start reclaiming a massive atoll next to Mal\u00e9, called Hulhumal\u00e9. Hulhumal\u00e9 has become known as \u2018the city of hope\u2019 \u2014 a place that not only has room but is also protected from sea-level rise. Architects designed it with sea-level-rise scenarios until 2100 in mind. The outer edges are 2 metres above sea level, more than twice the height of Mal\u00e9. Hulhulmal\u00e9 is regarded by specialists mainly as a worthwhile success for land reclamation, but critics have raised many questions about three newer projects on the western side of Mal\u00e9, all of which are being built using sand from the nearby lagoon. In 2021, Humay Abdulghafoor, a Mal\u00e9-based veteran fighter against land reclamation, sued three institutional bodies of the government on the grounds that they violated an environmental-protection law. She said that a new reclamation project risked causing serious environmental, economic and cultural damage to the local community by undermining \u201cthe economic and social benefits flowing from the natural environment and biodiversity richness of the Maldives\u201d, according to her legal case. The case has been ongoing for years, but on 14 February, it had its first breakthrough. The country\u2019s High Court decided to pause a dredging project near Mal\u00e9. However, the next day, the Supreme Court said that this pause would cause significant financial losses and overturned the decision. Mauroof Jameel, one of five architects chosen to build Hulhumal\u00e9, also has concerns about the latest projects. Jameel, who is based in Mal\u00e9, says that it made sense to reclaim land at Hulhumal\u00e9 to address congestion and help to build up the economy, but he is hesitant about how fast reclamation projects are now taking place. No one knows what the long-term impacts will be, he says. In many parts of the world, including the Maldives, land reclamation can be beneficial, say scientists. \u201cIn my opinion, it can be a positive thing around Mal\u00e9,\u201d says Duvat, because of population pressures there. But she doesn\u2019t see as much justification in more rural, distant atolls. \u201cIn this case, I cannot see the benefits.\u201d Officials with the Maldivian government acknowledge that land reclamation can cause harm. But there is no indication that the process is slowing down. Just 3 months after Muizzu was inaugurated as president last November, he announced the biggest reclamation project the nation has ever seen \u2014another endeavour to reclaim land near Mal\u00e9 on top of those already in the works. \u201cThe brand-new model city will revolutionize the country\u2019s urban landscape, addressing housing challenges in the greater Mal\u00e9 region by providing 65,000 housing units,\u201d he said in February at the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. But many former officials urge caution. \u201cHow we create land, and the extent to which we do it, is excessive,\u201d says Mohamed Aslam, the minister of planning, housing and infrastructure for the previous administration, the agency responsible for land-reclamation projects. He says that land is often reclaimed as an easy way to keep the public happy, to show them that the government is doing something. \u201cThe easy part is building the land,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly after that does the hard part begin.\u201d",

The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day. \n\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in March in Paris\n\n\nEastgate, Washington, United States (4,999 miles away) is the far-away foreign place with temperatures most similar to Paris (view comparison). \n\n\nCompare Paris to another city: \n\n\n\nClouds \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe month of March in Paris experiences gradually decreasing cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy decreasing from 62% to 56%. \n\n\nThe clearest day of the month is March 31, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 44% of the time. \n\n\nFor reference, on December 29, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 74%, while on July 21, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 62%. \n\n\nCloud Cover Categories in March in Paris\n\n\n\nPrecipitation \n\n \n\n\n\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Paris, the chance of a wet day over the course of March is increasing, starting the month at 20% and ending it at 26%. \n\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 30% on May 22, and its lowest chance is 20% on March 2. \n\n\nProbability of Precipitation in March in Paris\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day. \n\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during March in Paris is essentially constant, remaining about 1.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.6 inches or falling below 0.2 inches. \n\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.2 inches on March 3. \n\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSun \n\n \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of March in Paris, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 36 seconds, and weekly increase of 25 minutes, 13 seconds. \n\n\nThe shortest day of the month is March 1, with 11 hours, 3 minutes of daylight and the longest day is March 31, with 12 hours, 51 minutes of daylight. \n\n\nHours of Daylight and Twilight in March in Paris\n\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Paris is 7:31 AM on March 1 and the earliest sunrise is 1 hour, 0 minutes earlier at 6:31 AM on March 30. \n\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:34 PM on March 1 and the latest sunset is 1 hour, 46 minutes later at 8:20 PM on March 31. \n\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) ends at 3:00 AM on March 31, 2024, shifting sunrise and sunset to be an hour earlier. \n\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:46 AM and sets 16 hours, 11 minutes later, at 9:57 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:41 AM and sets 8 hours, 15 minutes later, at 4:56 PM. \n\n\nSunrise & Sunset with Twilight and Daylight Saving Time in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation. \n\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in March in Paris\n\n\n\nMoon \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for March 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon. \n\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in March in Paris\n\n\n\nHumidity \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night. \n\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining around 0% throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on July 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time. \n\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in March in Paris\n\n\n\nWind \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages. \n\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.7 miles per hour throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on January 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on August 7, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour. \n\n\nAverage Wind Speed in March in Paris\n\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Paris throughout March is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 33% on March 12. \n\n\nWind Direction in March in Paris\n\n\n\nGrowing Season \n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (\u2265 32\u00c2\u00b0F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere). \n\n\nThe growing season in Paris typically lasts for 8.0 months (243 days), from around March 21 to around November 19, rarely starting before February 16 or after April 19, and rarely ending before October 23 or after December 20. \n\n\nDuring March in Paris, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 64% over the course of the month. \n\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Paris\n\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50\u00c2\u00b0F and a cap of 86\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Paris are gradually increasing during March, increasing by 50\u00c2\u00b0F, from 21\u00c2\u00b0F to 71\u00c2\u00b0F, over the course of the month. \n\n\nGrowing Degree Days in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSolar Energy \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation. \n\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Paris is increasing during March, rising by 1.4 kWh, from 2.6 kWh to 4.0 kWh, over the course of the month. \n\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in March in Paris\n\n\n\nTopography \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Paris are 48.853 deg latitude, 2.349 deg longitude, and 138 ft elevation. \n\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Paris contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 233 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 159 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (633 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (883 feet). \n\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Paris is covered by artificial surfaces (97%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (91%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and trees (23%). \n\n\n\nData Sources \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Paris, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. \n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Paris. \n\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Paris according to the International Standard Atmosphere  , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis   between the two locations. \n\n\nThe estimated value at Paris is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Paris and a given station. \n\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are: \n\n\nV\u00c3\u00a9lizy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Villacoublay Air Base (LFPV, 23%, 9 mi, southwest, 446 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis Orly Airport (LFPO, 34%, 9 mi, south, 151 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0093Le Bourget Airport (LFPB, 35%, 9 mi, northeast, 79 ft elevation change)\n\n\nPontoise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Cormeilles Aerodrom (LFPT, 9%, 22 mi, northwest, 187 ft elevation change)\n\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Paris and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data. \n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition  , by Jean Meeus. \n\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis  . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid. \n\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database  , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \n\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)  , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database  . \n\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com  . \n\n\nMaps are \u00a9 OpenStreetMap   contributors. \n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose.

Additionally, the bulletin also includes highlights regarding the boreal summer (June-July-August). Most of the reported findings are based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, using billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.\u00a0\n\n          August 2024 \u2013 Surface air temperature and sea surface temperature highlights:\u00a0\n  \n\nGlobal Temperatures\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was the joint-warmest August globally (together with August 2023), with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 16.82\u00b0C, 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August.\u202f\u00a0\nAugust 2024 was 1.51\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level and is the 13th month in a 14-month period for which the global-average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. *\u00a0\nThe global-average temperature for the past 12 months (September 2023 \u2013 August 2024) is the highest on record for any 12-month period, at 0.76\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.64\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 pre-industrial average. These values are identical to those recorded for the previous two 12-month periods, ending in June and July 2024.\u00a0\nThe year-to-date (January\u2013August 2024) global-average temperature anomaly is 0.70\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.23\u00b0C warmer than the same period in 2023. The average anomaly for the remaining months of this year would need to drop by at least 0.30\u00b0C for 2024 not to be warmer than 2023. This has never happened in the entire ERA5 dataset, making it increasingly likely that 2024 is going to be the warmest year on record.\u00a0\n*Datasets other than ERA5 may not confirm the 13 months above 1.5\u00b0C highlighted here, due to the relatively small margins above 1.5\u00b0C of ERA5 global temperatures for July and August 2023 and May, June, and August 2024 and differences among the various datasets.\u00a0\nEurope and other regions\u00a0\nThe average temperature for European land for August 2024 was 1.57\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for August, making the month the second warmest August on record for Europe after August 2022, which was 1.73\u00b0C above average.\u00a0\u00a0\nEuropean temperatures were most above average over southern and eastern Europe, but below average over northwestern parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom, Iceland, the west coast of Portugal, and southern Norway.\u00a0\u00a0\nOutside Europe, temperatures were most above average over eastern Antarctica, Texas, Mexico, Canada, northeast Africa, Iran, China, Japan, and Australia.\u00a0\u00a0\nTemperatures were below average over far eastern Russia and Alaska, the eastern United States, parts of southern South America, Pakistan and the Sahel.\u00a0\nSea surface temperature\u00a0\nThe average sea surface temperature (SST) for August 2024 over 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N was 20.91\u00b0C, the second-highest value on record for the month, and only 0.07\u00b0C below August 2023.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe equatorial Pacific had below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs across the oceans remained unusually high over many regions.\u00a0\nAccording to Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S): \"During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record. This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest year on record. The temperature-related extreme events witnessed this summer will only become more intense, with more devastating consequences for people and the planet unless we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"\u00a0\nMonthly year-to-date global surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1991-2020 for the ten warmest years on record. 2024 is shown with a red line, 2023 with a yellow line, and all other years with grey lines. Each data point shows the average anomaly from January to the corresponding month. E.g. the value for August 2024 corresponds to the average anomaly from January to August 2024. Data source: ERA5.

The Indian subcontinent was hit by monsoon rains and Cyclone Asna. Heavy rainfall led to flooding in Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Japan was hit by Typhoon Shanshan.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt was drier than average in Mexico and southern North America, regions of Russia, across China, and most of South America and Southern Africa, with wildfires in Canada, Siberia and Brazil.\u00a0\n\n          August 2024 \u2013 Sea Ice highlights \n  \n\n\n          2024 Boreal Summer Seasonal Highlights \n  \n\n\nDOWNLOAD IMAGE\u00a0|\u00a0DOWNLOAD DATA\u00a0|\u00a0INTERACTIVE IMAGE\u00a0\nThe global-average temperature for boreal summer (June\u2013August) 2024 was the highest on record at 0.69\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average for these three months, surpassing the previous record from June\u2013August 2023 (0.66\u00b0C).\u00a0\nThe average temperature for European land for summer (June-August) 2024 was the highest on record for the season at 1.54\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, exceeding the previous record from 2022 (1.34\u00b0C).\u00a0\u00a0\nSummer 2024 was predominantly wetter than average in western and northern Europe.\u00a0\u00a0\nMost of the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe saw drier-than-average conditions throughout the season, in some cases associated to drought.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n- End -\n\n          More Information\n  \n\nMore information about climate variables in May and climate updates of previous months as well as high-resolution graphics can be downloaded here.\u00a0\nAnswers to frequently asked questions regarding temperature monitoring can be found here.\u00a0\nTemperature monitoring FAQs\nFollow near-real-time data for the globe on Climate Pulse here.\u00a0\nMore on trends and projections on Climate Atlas here.\u00a0\nInformation about the C3S data set and how it is compiled:\u00a0\nTemperature and hydrological maps and data are from ECMWF Copernicus Climate Change Service\u2019s ERA5 and ERA5-Land (surface soil moisture) datasets.\u00a0\nThe findings about global sea surface temperatures (SSTs) presented here are based on SST data from ERA5 averaged over the 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N domain. Note that ERA5 SSTs are estimates of the ocean temperature at about 10m depth (known as foundation temperature). The results may differ from other SST products providing temperature estimates at different depths, such as 20cm depth for NOAA\u2019s OISST.\u00a0\nSea ice maps and data are from a combination of information from ERA5, as well as from the EUMETSAT OSI SAF Sea Ice Index v2.2.\u00a0\nRegional area averages quoted here are the following longitude/latitude bounds:\u00a0\nGlobe, 180W-180E, 90S-90N, over land and ocean surfaces.\u00a0\nEurope, 25W-40E, 34N-72N, over land surfaces only.\u00a0\u00a0\nAbout the Data and Analysis\nInformation on national records and impacts:\u00a0\nInformation on national records and impacts are based on national and regional reports. For details see the respective temperature and hydrological C3S climate bulletin for the month.\u00a0\nC3S has followed the recommendation of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to use the most recent 30-year period for calculating climatological averages and changed to the reference period of 1991-2020 for its C3S Climate Bulletins covering January 2021 onward. Figures and graphics for both the new and previous period (1981-2010) are provided for transparency.\u00a0\nMore information on the reference period\n\n          About Copernicus and ECMWF \n  \n\nCopernicus is a component of the European Union\u2019s space programme, with funding by the EU, and is its flagship Earth observation programme, which operates through six thematic services: Atmosphere, Marine, Land, Climate Change, Security and Emergency. It delivers freely accessible operational data and services providing users with reliable and up-to-date information related to our planet and its environment. The programme is coordinated and managed by the European Commission and implemented in partnership with the Member States, the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), EU Agencies and Mercator Oc\u00e9an, amongst others.\u202f\u00a0\nECMWF operates two services from the EU\u2019s Copernicus Earth observation programme: the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). They also contribute to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), which is implemented by the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC). The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is an independent intergovernmental organisation supported by 35 states. It is both a research institute and a 24/7 operational service, producing and disseminating numerical weather predictions to its Member States. This data is fully available to the national meteorological services in the Member States. The supercomputer facility (and associated data archive) at ECMWF is one of the largest of its type in Europe and Member States can use 25% of its capacity for their own purposes.\u202f\u00a0\nECMWF has expanded its location across its Member States for some activities.

The equatorial Pacific showed below-average temperatures, indicating a developing La Ni\u00f1a, but SSTs remained unusually high in many regions.Hydrologically, August 2024 was drier than average over most of continental Europe, including southern UK and Ireland, the Alps, the Balkans, northwest Russia, and eastern Fennoscandia, with droughts and wildfires in the south and east. Conversely, Iceland, northern UK and Ireland, much of Fennoscandia, the northern seaboard of continental Europe, and western Russia and T\u00fcrkiye experienced above-average precipitation, leading to floods and damage in some areas. Outside Europe, eastern North America, central Russia, eastern China, and eastern Australia were wetter than average, while Mexico, southern North America, regions of Russia, China, most of South America, and Southern Africa were drier than average, with wildfires in Canada, Siberia, and Brazil.The global-average temperature for boreal summer (June\u2013August) 2024 was the highest on record at 0.69\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average, surpassing the previous record from June\u2013August 2023 (0.66\u00b0C). The average temperature for European land for summer 2024 was the highest on record at 1.54\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average. Summer 2024 was predominantly wetter than average in western and northern Europe, while most of the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe experienced drier-than-average conditions, sometimes associated with drought.The Copernicus Climate Change Service provides detailed monthly climate bulletins based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft, and weather stations worldwide. The service is part of the EU's Copernicus Earth observation programme, which aims to provide reliable and up-to-date information about the planet and its environment.",

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth\u2019s Best Employer, and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Career Choice, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, Alexa, Just Walk Out technology, Amazon Studios, and The Climate Pledge are some of the things pioneered by Amazon.

Quarterly non-GAAP net income declined 11% year-over-year to RMB24.42 billion.\nAlibaba increased its capital expenditure on Alibaba Cloud infrastructure and its Chinese and cross-border e-commerce businesses, leading to double-digit growth across key metrics including gross merchandise value (GMV).\n\u201cThis quarter\u2019s results demonstrate that our strategies are working and we are returning to growth,\u201d said Eddie Wu, Chief Executive Officer of Alibaba Group.\nThe company also announced a $4.0 billion dividend distribution to continuously enhance shareholder return.\nAlibaba\u2019s e-commerce businesses recorded an uptick in purchasing frequency and customer retention over the quarter, even as retail growth slowed in China.\nAcross the country, total retail sales of consumer goods in March grew 3.1% year-over-year, trailing the 5.5% and 7.4% growth recorded in the January-February and December periods, respectively, according to China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics.\nDespite the broader slowdown, revenue during the latest quarter grew 4% year-on-year to RMB93.22 billion at Taobao and Tmall Group (TTG).\nTTG\u2019s adjusted EBITA shrank slightly to RMB38.5 billion compared to RMB39.04 billion in the same quarter of 2023, as the business increased strategic investment in areas including customer service, membership program benefits and technology.\n\u201cOur China and international commerce businesses realized double-digit year-over-year GMV growth through our focus on the customer experience,\u201d said Wu, who stepped into the role of Taobao and Tmall Group CEO last year.\nHe has emphasized that 2024 would be a year of strategic upgrades and significant investment into the core businesses, and it has started to bear fruit.\nOnline gross merchandise value \u2013 excluding unpaid orders \u2013 and order growth expanded by double-digits year-over-year, fueling a 5% increase in customer management revenue.\nMembership in TTG\u2019s 88VIP loyalty program increased by double digits year-over-year in the quarter to top 35 million members, as consumers were enticed by improving service and more benefits.\nTaobao has introduced more user-friendly measures including a simplified 6.18 sales structure and a website update. Likewise, Tmall announced plans to triple the scale of resources dedicated to new products.\nBetween January and March, the number of new merchants on Tmall rose 60% year-over-year, while the total transaction volume of new merchants over this time increased by 150% compared with last year.\nQuarterly revenue from the company\u2019s Cloud Intelligence Group rose 3% to RMB25.60 billion, driven by the double-digit growth of its public cloud business.\nAlibaba Cloud\u2019s public cloud offerings are available online for organizations and individuals alike, and include elastic compute, database and AI products and services. The company saw triple-digit growth in AI-related revenue in the fourth quarter.\nTo attract start-ups and small businesses that will support long-term growth, Alibaba recently slashed the price of over 100 core public cloud products in the Chinese market.\nIn April, the company also extended these cost reductions to international customers, with an average price reduction of 23%.\n\u201cWe are excited by the accelerated growth of customers and cloud computing revenues related to our AI products. We will remain focused on our strategic priorities and capture future growth opportunities,\u201d said Wu.\nOver 90,000 enterprises have adopted Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Qwen large language model (LLM) since it debuted a year ago, on top of more than 7 million downloads on open-source platforms like Github.\nAlibaba Cloud recently launched a service to help companies customize and scale generative AI models, from consolidating multiple models to optimizing underlying infrastructure resources.\nIn addition, Alibaba Cloud\u2019s AI-driven sustainability platform Energy Expert rolled out an open API service enabling developers to build customized sustainability applications.\nIts AI computing platform for high-performance computing tasks, PAI-Lingjun Intelligent Computing Service, became available in Singapore for the first time this year.\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) marketplaces notched a 20% increase in combined orders for the latest quarter as revenue grew 45% year-over-year to RMB27.45 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nCross-border retail platform AliExpress provides price-competitive products and efficient fulfillment under its Choice service, which accounted for around 70% of AliExpress\u2019s total orders in April 2024.\nIncreased synergies between AliExpress and Cainiao led five to ten-day delivery completion rates to double year-over-year for Choice orders over the quarter.\nCainiao, which withdrew its plan to make an initial public offering on Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange in March partly to focus on supporting cross-border fulfillment services within AIDC, has also gone from strength to strength.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, revenue from Cainiao grew 30% year-over-year to RMB24.56 billion. Cainiao\u2019s five to ten-day delivery service extended into four additional countries during the quarter, bringing the number of countries covered by the premium service to 14.\nInvestment in cross-border initiatives ramped up across the board in the fourth quarter.\nTurkish online retailer Trendyol expanded into the Gulf region and has become one of the region\u2019s most downloaded e-commerce apps. At the same time, AliExpress earmarked millions of euros for discounts and deals as part of an exclusive global sponsorship of the upcoming UEFA European Football Championship set for this summer.\nAs a result of increased investment in key markets to enhance customer experience and expand consumer base, AIDC posted a loss of RMB4.09 billion in the quarter for adjusted EBITA.\nAs part of management\u2019s commitment to delivering value to shareholders, Alibaba has announced a two-part dividend worth an aggregate $4.0 billion.\nThe Alibaba board approved an annual regular cash dividend for the most recent fiscal year and an extraordinary cash dividend comprised of proceeds from the disposition of certain financial investments.\nThe one-time extraordinary dividend will come to $0.0825 per ordinary share or $0.66 per ADS and will be paid in U.S. dollars to holders of ordinary shares and ADSs as of the close of business on June 13, 2024, Hong Kong Time and New York Time, respectively.\n\u201cWe are committed to continuing to return value to our shareholders,\u201d said Alibaba\u2019s Xu.\nEarlier this year, the group said it would begin voluntary updates on its share repurchase program to increase transparency for investors.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, Alibaba repurchased 1.25 billion ordinary shares for a total of $12.5 billion, including 524 million ordinary shares repurchased in its fourth fiscal quarter.\nAlibaba\u2019s total shareholder yield, in the form of dividends and share repurchases, led its large-cap peers by reaching 6.5% during the 2023 calendar year.\nThe holding company, which made its 2014 stock market debut in New York and completed a secondary listing in Hong Kong in 2019, is also in the midst of preparations for a dual-primary listing on the two bourses slated for the end of August 2024.",

Today, its influence stretches across continents, reaching millions of buyers and sellers alike. The statistics provided in this article are intended to give eBay sellers with insight into potential eBay selling opportunities.\nMake Money Selling on eBay!\neBay Statistic Overview\nOnline marketplaces have revolutionized the way we shop, offering a wide array of products at our fingertips. A recent study by Statista sheds light on the dominance and reach of these platforms in the U.S. market as of April 2023.\nAmazon is at the top of the list, with a whopping 58.03% share of online visits. Trailing behind, but still maintaining a strong presence, is eBay with a 13.11% share. The results demonstrate eBay\u2019s enduring relevance, even in a market increasingly dominated by Amazon.\nWalmart also maintains its lead in the online market with a 6.53% share, demonstrating its successful transition from a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to a significant online player. Etsy, known for unique and handmade items, accounted for 5.02% of visits.\nLastly, Target, another retail giant, holds a 2.64% share, underscoring its efforts to boost its online footprint. These eBay stats emphasize the competitive nature of online retail and highlight the importance of innovation and customer engagement in retaining and growing market share.\nMORE: How to increase sales on eBay\nWhat Does This Mean for eBay Sellers?\nFirst and foremost, despite the towering presence of Amazon, eBay still commands a respectable 13.11% share of online visits as of April 2023. This indicates that eBay remains a formidable platform with a vast and engaged customer base. Sellers can leverage this large audience to diversify their online presence and reach a different segment of buyers.\nHowever, the competition is fierce. With Amazon dominating the market, eCommerce sellers must bring their A-game when listing on eBay. This entails providing high-quality product images, crafting compelling product descriptions, offering competitive pricing, and ensuring top-notch customer service.\nMoreover, the rise of platforms such as Walmart and Etsy suggests that eCommerce is not a one-size-fits-all business. Different platforms cater to different demographics and offer unique selling propositions. For instance, while Etsy caters to a niche of handmade and unique products, Walmart and Target, being traditional retailers, might appeal to a demographic looking for established brands or specific product categories.\nAll in all, the data suggests that while eBay remains a relevant and viable platform for eCommerce sellers, it\u2019s crucial to approach it with a tailored strategy. Understanding the platform\u2019s audience, staying up-to-date on market trends, and differentiating oneself from competitors are essential steps to achieving success on eBay.\nMORE: How to sell on eBay and make money\neBay Seller Statistics\nThe eBay Seller Statistics reveal a transformative trajectory in the retail landscape, particularly in the U.S. The data depicts the growing importance and influence of eCommerce on total retail sales over the past decade. In 2013, eCommerce made up a modest 5.8% of total retail sales. However, according to Statista, by 2025, this figure is projected to rise to 21.9%.\nDiving deeper into the data, we notice a steady progression in the earlier years. By 2019, eCommerce accounted for 11.1% of total sales. Yet, a remarkable shift occurred in 2020, when the figure surged to 14.2% \u2014 a 3.1% leap from the previous year. This could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a radical change in consumer behavior. As brick-and-mortar stores faced restrictions or shutdowns, and consumers prioritized safety, online shopping became the preferred, if not the only, option for many.\nInterestingly, the eCommerce percentage remained stagnant at 14.2% in 2021, suggesting that the rapid adoption of online shopping in the previous year had reached a temporary plateau or that consumers returned to physical stores as restrictions eased. Nevertheless, the projection for 2023 shows another leap, with eCommerce constituting 17.9% of total sales. By 2025, almost 22% of all retail sales in the U.S. are expected to be online.\nFor eBay sellers and other eCommerce merchants, these figures underscore a clear trend: the digital marketplace is not just a supplementary channel but is increasingly becoming a dominant force in the retail sector. Sellers should prepare for this ongoing digital shift, optimizing their online presence, improving customer experience, and ensuring they are well-equipped to handle the increasing volume and demands of online consumers.\neCommerce\u2019s Share of Total Retail Sales in the US\nMORE: eBay vacation mode\neBay Advertising Statistics\nAnother important seller statistic showcases the change in digital retail media advertising spending in the US from 2020 to 2025.\nThe evolution of digital retail media advertising spending in the U.S. from 2020 to 2025 provides interesting insights into the evolution of digital marketing in the retail sector. In 2020, a significant 53.3% of advertising spending was channeled into digital retail media, reflecting the rise of eCommerce and the urgency for businesses to capture online audiences.\nHowever, the subsequent year, 2021, witnessed a decline to 49.3%. This reduction might suggest that many businesses, after heavily investing in digital advertising during the early pandemic months, decided to reevaluate or diversify their advertising strategies, or perhaps even faced budget constraints due to economic challenges.\nThe most striking transformation occurred in 2022, where the percentage plummeted to 21.5%. This sharp decline could be indicative of several factors, such as market saturation, the evolution of alternative advertising mediums, or a strategic shift in the retail sector\u2019s advertising focus.\nThe figures from 2023 to 2025 reveal a stabilization of the trend, hovering around the low twenties. The projection of 19.7% in 2023, followed by a slight rise to 22.5% in 2024, and then a modest increment to 23.2% in 2025 suggests that while digital retail media advertising remains vital, it might not be the primary focus as it once was in 2020.\nFor sellers, this trend underscores the importance of adopting a holistic advertising strategy. While digital retail media advertising is essential, it\u2019s equally critical to diversify marketing efforts, explore innovative channels, and ensure that the chosen mediums align with the brand\u2019s target audience and goals.\nThe statistics reflect a dynamic digital advertising landscape, emphasizing the need for adaptability and a strategic approach to remain competitive and effective.\nMORE: How to set up an eBay store\neBay Buyer Statistics\nDelving into eBay\u2019s active buyer statistics from the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2023 offers a revealing glimpse into the platform\u2019s journey, its peaks of popularity, and the challenges it faced amidst a rapidly changing digital marketplace. The increase in total active buyers on eBay from the 1st quarter of 2010 to the 2nd quarter of 2023 provides valuable insights into the platform\u2019s popularity and market penetration through time.\nMORE: How to issue partial refund on eBay\nHow Many People Use eBay\nStarting in Q1 2010, eBay boasted a healthy 89.5 million active buyers, a figure that saw consistent growth over the next several years. By Q1 2011, this number rose modestly to 95.9 million. However, it wasn\u2019t until Q3 2012 that the platform witnessed a more substantial increase, hitting the 108.3 million mark.\nThis upward trend continued to surge as 2013 rolled in, with 123.5 million active buyers in the first quarter, followed by a leap to 145.1 million by Q1 2014. This consistent rise is indicative of eBay\u2019s strong market position during these years and possibly its efforts to expand its services, improve user experience, and diversify its product listings.\nThe momentum slightly decelerated but remained positive, with the number climbing to 156 million by Q1 2015 and then experiencing slower growth over the subsequent years, touching 162 million in Q1 2016 and 165 million in Q1 2017. A more noticeable growth spurt occurred in 2018, peaking at 179 million active users by its end.\nNumber of eBay total active buyers from 1st Quarter 2010 to 2nd Quarter 2023 (in millions)\nA Shift After 2018\nHowever, post-2018, the trajectory began to shift. From a high of 179 million in Q4 2018, the numbers slightly decreased to 171 million in Q1 2019. The impact of the global pandemic in 2020 is evident, with numbers fluctuating between 174 million in Q1 and a drop to 161 million in Q2. Post-pandemic periods in 2021 and 2022 saw the figures retreat further, descending to 142 million by Q1 2022.\nBy the first quarter of 2023, the number further diminished to 133 million, indicating potential challenges in retaining or attracting new users or the possible rise of competitive platforms. For sellers, understanding this trend is crucial. While eBay remains a significant player in the e-Commerce space, it\u2019s vital to monitor such trends, evaluate buyer behaviors, and possibly diversify platforms to ensure sustained reach and sales.\nMORE: eBay seller help\nMORE: eBay refurbished\neBay Website Traffic Share\nIn July 2023, approximately 68 percent of visitors to ebay.com came from the United States. Of these U.S. eBay visitors, 54 percent favored using desktop devices to access the site. However, in other examined countries, most users showed a preference for mobile browsing.\nMORE: How to ship items on eBay\neBay\u2019s Second-Hand Purchase Trend\nAnother important buyer statistic is the share of eBay buyers purchasing second-hand goods in order to save money in 2022.\nThe appeal of online marketplaces like eBay is frequently based on the diverse range of products they offer, which varies from brand-new items to second-hand or used goods. An intriguing trend that emerged in 2022 is the growing propensity of buyers to opt for second-hand items on eBay with a specific intention to save money.\nA significant 56% of all eBay buyers leaned towards purchasing pre-owned goods for monetary savings. Even more compelling is the insight into the behavior of the Gen Z demographic, a group typically associated with trends and new purchases. Surprisingly, 54% of Gen Z respondents also exhibited this thrift-conscious approach on eBay.\nThis reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where the value and cost-effectiveness of a purchase may overweigh the allure of brand-new items, even among the younger consumers. These patterns highlight the ever-evolving dynamics of eCommerce and hint at the emergence of a more budget-conscious consumer base.\nFrom this data, sellers should recognize the increasing appeal of second-hand or pre-owned items on platforms like eBay, especially for the purpose of cost-saving. This trend is not limited to a particular demographic but spans across, including the younger Gen Z.\nMORE: eBay selling tips\nMORE: eBay selling limits\nMonthly Downloads of the eBay App Worldwide\nGlobally, eBay saw its mobile app achieve 2.3 million downloads in July 2023. During the observed time frame, the highest monthly downloads worldwide occurred in January 2021, reaching 3.4 million for that month.\nMORE: Shopify eBay integration\neBay Sales Statistics by Category\nIn February 2021, nearly a year after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, disposable face masks dominated eBay sales, averaging over 293 items sold for each listing every week. Mobile phones and smartphones also ranked high in sales, with listings selling an average of 76 units weekly.\nAlso see our\u00a0eBay Fee Calculator.\nKey Takeaways\nIn the rapidly shifting eCommerce landscape, sellers must remain agile and informed. Although Amazon continues its towering dominance in the online marketplace, eBay\u2019s 13.11% share in online visits as of April 2023 reveals its significant and enduring presence. However, the eCommerce environment is intensely competitive, making it essential for sellers to elevate their offerings on eBay through stellar product presentations, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service.\nFurthermore, the emergence of platforms like Walmart and Etsy indicates the diverse needs and preferences of the online shopper. Importantly, the rise in buyers\u2019 preference for second-hand items on eBay, spanning all age groups, including Gen Z, underscores a growing budget-conscious trend. Thus, sellers need a strategic, adaptive, and diversified approach to maximize their reach and sales in this ever-evolving market.\nMORE: Discover Amazon Statistics.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nHow popular is eBay now?\nWhat age group uses eBay the most?\nIs eBay getting less popular?\nWho is eBay's target audience?\nWho is the #1 seller on eBay?\nAuthor\nDominika Kaminska\nAmazing content you need, amazing content we deliver.

Learn about our fact-checking process.\n\nWhether you\u2019re already an eBay seller or only thinking about selling on eBay occasionally, statistics are a sure way to prove which direction is best to consider for your online store. Today, we will delve deep into eBay revenue throughout the years, eBay sales statistics by category, and much more.\n\nWhen Was eBay Established?\n\nEstablished in 1995 as a platform for auction-style sales, eBay swiftly expanded its horizons, becoming a global marketplace for both new and second-hand items. Today, its influence stretches across continents, reaching millions of buyers and sellers alike. The statistics provided in this article are intended to give eBay sellers insight into potential eBay selling opportunities.\n\nMake Money Selling on eBay!\n\neBay Statistic Overview\n\nOnline marketplaces have revolutionized the way we shop, offering a wide array of products at our fingertips. A recent study by Statista sheds light on the dominance and reach of these platforms in the U.S. market as of April 2023.\n\nAmazon is at the top of the list, with a whopping 58.03% share of online visits. Trailing behind, but still maintaining a strong presence, is eBay with a 13.11% share. The results demonstrate eBay\u2019s enduring relevance, even in a market increasingly dominated by Amazon.\n\nWalmart also maintains its lead in the online market with a 6.53% share, demonstrating its successful transition from a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to a significant online player. Etsy, known for unique and handmade items, accounted for 5.02% of visits. Lastly, Target, another retail giant, holds a 2.64% share, underscoring its efforts to boost its online footprint. These eBay stats emphasize the competitive nature of online retail and highlight the importance of innovation and customer engagement in retaining and growing market share.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for eBay Sellers?\n\nFirst and foremost, despite the towering presence of Amazon, eBay still commands a respectable 13.11% share of online visits as of April 2023. This indicates that eBay remains a formidable platform with a vast and engaged customer base. Sellers can leverage this large audience to diversify their online presence and reach a different segment of buyers.\n\nHowever, the competition is fierce. With Amazon dominating the market, eCommerce sellers must bring their A-game when listing on eBay. This entails providing high-quality product images, crafting compelling product descriptions, offering competitive pricing, and ensuring top-notch customer service.\n\nMoreover, the rise of platforms such as Walmart and Etsy suggests that eCommerce is not a one-size-fits-all business. Different platforms cater to different demographics and offer unique selling propositions. For instance, while Etsy caters to a niche of handmade and unique products, Walmart and Target, being traditional retailers, might appeal to a demographic looking for established brands or specific product categories.\n\nAll in all, the data suggests that while eBay remains a relevant and viable platform for eCommerce sellers, it\u2019s crucial to approach it with a tailored strategy. Understanding the platform\u2019s audience, staying up-to-date on market trends, and differentiating oneself from competitors are essential steps to achieving success on eBay.\n\neBay Seller Statistics\n\nThe eBay Seller Statistics reveal a transformative trajectory in the retail landscape, particularly in the U.S. The data depicts the growing importance and influence of eCommerce on total retail sales over the past decade. In 2013, eCommerce made up a modest 5.8% of total retail sales. However, according to Statista, by 2025, this figure is projected to rise to 21.9%.\n\nDiving deeper into the data, we notice a steady progression in the earlier years. By 2019, eCommerce accounted for 11.1% of total sales. Yet, a remarkable shift occurred in 2020, when the figure surged to 14.2% \u2014 a 3.1% leap from the previous year. This could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a radical change in consumer behavior. As brick-and-mortar stores faced restrictions or shutdowns, and consumers prioritized safety, online shopping became the preferred, if not the only, option for many.\n\nInterestingly, the eCommerce percentage remained stagnant at 14.2% in 2021, suggesting that the rapid adoption of online shopping in the previous year had reached a temporary plateau or that consumers returned to physical stores as restrictions eased. Nevertheless, the projection for 2023 shows another leap, with eCommerce constituting 17.9% of total sales. By 2025, almost 22% of all retail sales in the U.S. are expected to be online.\n\nFor eBay sellers and other eCommerce merchants, these figures underscore a clear trend: the digital marketplace is not just a supplementary channel but is increasingly becoming a dominant force in the retail sector. Sellers should prepare for this ongoing digital shift, optimizing their online presence, improving customer experience, and ensuring they are well-equipped to handle the increasing volume and demands of online consumers.\n\neBay Advertising Statistics\n\nAnother important seller statistic showcases the change in digital retail media advertising spending in the US from 2020 to 2025.\n\nThe evolution of digital retail media advertising spending in the U.S. from 2020 to 2025 provides interesting insights into the evolution of digital marketing in the retail sector. In 2020, a significant 53.3% of advertising spending was channeled into digital retail media, reflecting the rise of eCommerce and the urgency for businesses to capture online audiences.\n\nHowever, the subsequent year, 2021, witnessed a decline to 49.3%. This reduction might suggest that many businesses, after heavily investing in digital advertising during the early pandemic months, decided to reevaluate or diversify their advertising strategies, or perhaps even faced budget constraints due to economic challenges.\n\nThe most striking transformation occurred in 2022, where the percentage plummeted to 21.5%. This sharp decline could be indicative of several factors, such as market saturation, the evolution of alternative advertising mediums, or a strategic shift in the retail sector\u2019s advertising focus.\n\nThe figures from 2023 to 2025 reveal a stabilization of the trend, hovering around the low twenties. The projection of 19.7% in 2023, followed by a slight rise to 22.5% in 2024, and then a modest increment to 23.2% in 2025 suggests that while digital retail media advertising remains vital, it might not be the primary focus as it once was in 2020.\n\nFor sellers, this trend underscores the importance of adopting a holistic advertising strategy. While digital retail media advertising is essential, it\u2019s equally critical to diversify marketing efforts, explore innovative channels, and ensure that the chosen mediums align with the brand\u2019s target audience and goals.\n\nThe statistics reflect a dynamic digital advertising landscape, emphasizing the need for adaptability and a strategic approach to remain competitive and effective.\n\neBay Buyer Statistics\n\nDelving into eBay\u2019s active buyer statistics from the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2023 offers a revealing glimpse into the platform\u2019s journey, its peaks of popularity, and the challenges it faced amidst a rapidly changing digital marketplace. The increase in total active buyers on eBay from the 1st quarter of 2010 to the 2nd quarter of 2023 provides valuable insights into the platform\u2019s popularity and market penetration through time.\n\nHow Many People Use eBay\n\nStarting in Q1 2010, eBay boasted a healthy 89.5 million active buyers, a figure that saw consistent growth over the next several years. By Q1 2011, this number rose modestly to 95.9 million. However, it wasn\u2019t until Q3 2012 that the platform witnessed a more substantial increase, hitting the 108.3 million mark.\n\nThis upward trend continued to surge as 2013 rolled in, with 123.5 million active buyers in the first quarter, followed by a leap to 145.1 million by Q1 2014. This consistent rise is indicative of eBay\u2019s strong market position during these years and possibly its efforts to expand its services, improve user experience, and diversify its product listings.\n\nThe momentum slightly decelerated but remained positive, with the number climbing to 156 million by Q1 2015 and then experiencing slower growth over the subsequent years, touching 162 million in Q1 2016 and 165 million in Q1 2017. A more noticeable growth spurt occurred in 2018, peaking at 179 million active users by its end.\n\nA Shift After 2018\n\nHowever, post-2018, the trajectory began to shift. From a high of 179 million in Q4 2018, the numbers slightly decreased to 171 million in Q1 2019. The impact of the global pandemic in 2020 is evident, with numbers fluctuating between 174 million in Q1 and a drop to 161 million in Q2. Post-pandemic periods in 2021 and 2022 saw the figures retreat further, descending to 142 million by Q1 2022.\n\nBy the first quarter of 2023, the number further diminished to 133 million, indicating potential challenges in retaining or attracting new users or the possible rise of competitive platforms. For sellers, understanding this trend is crucial. While eBay remains a significant player in the e-Commerce space, it\u2019s vital to monitor such trends, evaluate buyer behaviors, and possibly diversify platforms to ensure sustained reach and sales.\n\neBay Website Traffic Share\n\nIn July 2023, approximately 68 percent of visitors to ebay.com came from the United States. Of these U.S. eBay visitors, 54 percent favored using desktop devices to access the site. However, in other examined countries, most users showed a preference for mobile browsing.\n\neBay\u2019s Second-Hand Purchase Trend\n\nAnother important buyer statistic is the share of eBay buyers purchasing second-hand goods in order to save money in 2022.\n\nThe appeal of online marketplaces like eBay is frequently based on the diverse range of products they offer, which varies from brand-new items to second-hand or used goods. An intriguing trend that emerged in 2022 is the growing propensity of buyers to opt for second-hand items on eBay with a specific intention to save money.\n\nA significant 56% of all eBay buyers leaned towards purchasing pre-owned goods for monetary savings. Even more compelling is the insight into the behavior of the Gen Z demographic, a group typically associated with trends and new purchases. Surprisingly, 54% of Gen Z respondents also exhibited this thrift-conscious approach on eBay.\n\nThis reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where the value and cost-effectiveness of a purchase may overweigh the allure of brand-new items, even among the younger consumers. These patterns highlight the ever-evolving dynamics of eCommerce and hint at the emergence of a more budget-conscious consumer base.\n\nFrom this data, sellers should recognize the increasing appeal of second-hand or pre-owned items on platforms like eBay, especially for the purpose of cost-saving. This trend is not limited to a particular demographic but spans across, including the younger Gen Z.\n\nMonthly Downloads of the eBay App Worldwide\n\nGlobally, eBay saw its mobile app achieve 2.3 million downloads in July 2023. During the observed time frame, the highest monthly downloads worldwide occurred in January 2021, reaching 3.4 million for that month.\n\neBay Sales Statistics by Category\n\nIn February 2021, nearly a year after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, disposable face masks dominated eBay sales, averaging over 293 items sold for each listing every week. Mobile phones and smartphones also ranked high in sales, with listings selling an average of 76 units weekly.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIn the rapidly shifting eCommerce landscape, sellers must remain agile and informed. Although Amazon continues its towering dominance in the online marketplace, eBay\u2019s 13.11% share in online visits as of April 2023 reveals its significant and enduring presence. However, the eCommerce environment is intensely competitive, making it essential for sellers to elevate their offerings on eBay through stellar product presentations, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service.\n\nFurthermore, the emergence of platforms like Walmart and Etsy indicates the diverse needs and preferences of the online shopper. Importantly, the rise in buyers\u2019 preference for second-hand items on eBay, spanning all age groups, including Gen Z, underscores a growing budget-conscious trend. Thus, sellers need a strategic, adaptive, and diversified approach to maximize their reach and sales in this ever-evolving market.",

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The table below setting out the effect of foreign exchange rates on GMV and our consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

(NYSE, TSX: SHOP), announced today financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship,\" said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. \"More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify's unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations. We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin. We delivered across every metric,\" said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. \"Our results underscore our commitment to providing exceptional value to our merchants through focused operating execution and efficiency. As a high-growth global technology leader in commerce, we remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and investing in opportunities to achieve sustainable growth and long-term profitability.\"\nSecond-Quarter Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to the second quarter of 2023)\nGross Merchandise Volume1 (\"GMV\") increased 22% to $67.2 billion\nRevenue increased 21% to $2.0 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 25% after adjusting for the sale of our logistics businesses\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 19% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the growth of GMV and continued penetration of Shopify Payments\nGross Payments Volume2 (\"GPV\") grew to $41.1 billion, representing 61% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $31.7 billion, or 58%\nSubscription Solutions revenue increased 27% to $563 million, driven by growth in the number of merchants and pricing increases on our subscription plans\nMonthly Recurring Revenue3\u00a0(\"MRR\") as of June 30, 2024 increased 25% to $169 million, driven by growth in merchants. Shopify Plus contributed $52 million, or 31%, of MRR\nGross profit dollars grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.1% compared to 49.3%, driven primarily by the lack of the dilutive impact of the logistics businesses and changes in pricing plans partially offset by continued growth of payments\nFree cash flow4 was $333 million compared to free cash flow of $97 million\nFree cash flow margin4\u00a0for the quarter was 16% compared to free cash flow margin of 6%\nCash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and we had a net cash position of $4.1 billion after consideration of our outstanding convertible notes\n2024 Outlook\nThe outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control. Please see \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect:\nRevenue to grow at a low-to-mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;\nGross margin to be higher by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q2 2024;\nGAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;\nStock-based compensation to be $120 million; and\nFree cash flow margin to be similar to Q2 2024. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow margin for the rest of the year.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nShopify's management team will hold a conference call to discuss our second-quarter results today, August 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nSome other highlights since the company\u2019s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:\nFor additional highlights from the quarter, visit aboutamazon.com/q2-2024-earnings.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\u2019s expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

(NYSE, TSX: SHOP), announced today financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship,\" said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. \"More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify's unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations. We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin. We delivered across every metric,\" said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. \"Our results underscore our commitment to providing exceptional value to our merchants through focused operating execution and efficiency. As a high-growth global technology leader in commerce, we remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and investing in opportunities to achieve sustainable growth and long-term profitability.\"\nSecond-Quarter Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to the second quarter of 2023)\nGross Merchandise Volume1 (\"GMV\") increased 22% to $67.2 billion\nRevenue increased 21% to $2.0 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 25% after adjusting for the sale of our logistics businesses\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 19% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the growth of GMV and continued penetration of Shopify Payments\nGross Payments Volume2 (\"GPV\") grew to $41.1 billion, representing 61% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $31.7 billion, or 58%\nSubscription Solutions revenue increased 27% to $563 million, driven by growth in the number of merchants and pricing increases on our subscription plans\nMonthly Recurring Revenue3\u00a0(\"MRR\") as of June 30, 2024 increased 25% to $169 million, driven by growth in merchants. Shopify Plus contributed $52 million, or 31%, of MRR\nGross profit dollars grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.1% compared to 49.3%, driven primarily by the lack of the dilutive impact of the logistics businesses and changes in pricing plans partially offset by continued growth of payments\nFree cash flow4 was $333 million compared to free cash flow of $97 million\nFree cash flow margin4\u00a0for the quarter was 16% compared to free cash flow margin of 6%\nCash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and we had a net cash position of $4.1 billion after consideration of our outstanding convertible notes\n2024 Outlook\nThe outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control. Please see \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect:\nRevenue to grow at a low-to-mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;\nGross margin to be higher by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q2 2024;\nGAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;\nStock-based compensation to be $120 million; and\nFree cash flow margin to be similar to Q2 2024. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow margin for the rest of the year.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nShopify's management team will hold a conference call to discuss our second-quarter results today, August 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

(NYSE, TSX: SHOP), announced today financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship,\" said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. \"More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify's unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations. We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin. We delivered across every metric,\" said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. \"Our results underscore our commitment to providing exceptional value to our merchants through focused operating execution and efficiency. As a high-growth global technology leader in commerce, we remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and investing in opportunities to achieve sustainable growth and long-term profitability.\"\nSecond-Quarter Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to the second quarter of 2023)\nGross Merchandise Volume1 (\"GMV\") increased 22% to $67.2 billion\nRevenue increased 21% to $2.0 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 25% after adjusting for the sale of our logistics businesses\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 19% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the growth of GMV and continued penetration of Shopify Payments\nGross Payments Volume2 (\"GPV\") grew to $41.1 billion, representing 61% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $31.7 billion, or 58%\nSubscription Solutions revenue increased 27% to $563 million, driven by growth in the number of merchants and pricing increases on our subscription plans\nMonthly Recurring Revenue3\u00a0(\"MRR\") as of June 30, 2024 increased 25% to $169 million, driven by growth in merchants. Shopify Plus contributed $52 million, or 31%, of MRR\nGross profit dollars grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.1% compared to 49.3%, driven primarily by the lack of the dilutive impact of the logistics businesses and changes in pricing plans partially offset by continued growth of payments\nFree cash flow4 was $333 million compared to free cash flow of $97 million\nFree cash flow margin4\u00a0for the quarter was 16% compared to free cash flow margin of 6%\nCash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and we had a net cash position of $4.1 billion after consideration of our outstanding convertible notes\n2024 Outlook\nThe outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control. Please see \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect:\nRevenue to grow at a low-to-mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;\nGross margin to be higher by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q2 2024;\nGAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;\nStock-based compensation to be $120 million; and\nFree cash flow margin to be similar to Q2 2024. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow margin for the rest of the year.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nShopify's management team will hold a conference call to discuss our second-quarter results today, August 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

(NYSE, TSX: SHOP), announced today financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship,\" said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. \"More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify's unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations. We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin. We delivered across every metric,\" said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. \"Our results underscore our commitment to providing exceptional value to our merchants through focused operating execution and efficiency. As a high-growth global technology leader in commerce, we remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and investing in opportunities to achieve sustainable growth and long-term profitability.\"\nSecond-Quarter Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to the second quarter of 2023)\nGross Merchandise Volume1 (\"GMV\") increased 22% to $67.2 billion\nRevenue increased 21% to $2.0 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 25% after adjusting for the sale of our logistics businesses\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 19% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the growth of GMV and continued penetration of Shopify Payments\nGross Payments Volume2 (\"GPV\") grew to $41.1 billion, representing 61% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $31.7 billion, or 58%\nSubscription Solutions revenue increased 27% to $563 million, driven by growth in the number of merchants and pricing increases on our subscription plans\nMonthly Recurring Revenue3\u00a0(\"MRR\") as of June 30, 2024 increased 25% to $169 million, driven by growth in merchants. Shopify Plus contributed $52 million, or 31%, of MRR\nGross profit dollars grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.1% compared to 49.3%, driven primarily by the lack of the dilutive impact of the logistics businesses and changes in pricing plans partially offset by continued growth of payments\nFree cash flow4 was $333 million compared to free cash flow of $97 million\nFree cash flow margin4\u00a0for the quarter was 16% compared to free cash flow margin of 6%\nCash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and we had a net cash position of $4.1 billion after consideration of our outstanding convertible notes\n2024 Outlook\nThe outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control. Please see \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect:\nRevenue to grow at a low-to-mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;\nGross margin to be higher by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q2 2024;\nGAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;\nStock-based compensation to be $120 million; and\nFree cash flow margin to be similar to Q2 2024. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow margin for the rest of the year.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nShopify's management team will hold a conference call to discuss our second-quarter results today, August 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, security breaches, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nAdditional Information\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

(NYSE, TSX: SHOP), announced today financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship,\" said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. \"More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify's unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations. We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin. We delivered across every metric,\" said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. \"Our results underscore our commitment to providing exceptional value to our merchants through focused operating execution and efficiency. As a high-growth global technology leader in commerce, we remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and investing in opportunities to achieve sustainable growth and long-term profitability.\"\nSecond-Quarter Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to the second quarter of 2023)\nGross Merchandise Volume1 (\"GMV\") increased 22% to $67.2 billion\nRevenue increased 21% to $2.0 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 25% after adjusting for the sale of our logistics businesses\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 19% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the growth of GMV and continued penetration of Shopify Payments\nGross Payments Volume2 (\"GPV\") grew to $41.1 billion, representing 61% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $31.7 billion, or 58%\nSubscription Solutions revenue increased 27% to $563 million, driven by growth in the number of merchants and pricing increases on our subscription plans\nMonthly Recurring Revenue3\u00a0(\"MRR\") as of June 30, 2024 increased 25% to $169 million, driven by growth in merchants. Shopify Plus contributed $52 million, or 31%, of MRR\nGross profit dollars grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.1% compared to 49.3%, driven primarily by the lack of the dilutive impact of the logistics businesses and changes in pricing plans partially offset by continued growth of payments\nFree cash flow4 was $333 million compared to free cash flow of $97 million\nFree cash flow margin4\u00a0for the quarter was 16% compared to free cash flow margin of 6%\nCash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and we had a net cash position of $4.1 billion after consideration of our outstanding convertible notes\n2024 Outlook\nThe outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control. Please see \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect:\nRevenue to grow at a low-to-mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;\nGross margin to be higher by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q2 2024;\nGAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;\nStock-based compensation to be $120 million; and\nFree cash flow margin to be similar to Q2 2024. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow margin for the rest of the year.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nShopify's management team will hold a conference call to discuss our second-quarter results today, August 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the financial tables below for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures.\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nFree Cash Flow Reconciliation\nThe following table illustrates how free cash flow is calculated in this press release:\n\u00a0\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Analysis\nThe following table converts our GMV, revenues, gross profit and (loss) income from operations using the comparative period's monthly average exchange rates.

This website provides an impartial, fact-based overview of K-12 education in the Buckeye State. We hope these data will help to inform conversations about improving education throughout the state. If you have ideas on how this could be improved and made more useful to you, write to us at ohiogadfly@fordhaminstitute.org. For more information about the Institute and its work, please visit www.fordhaminstitute.org/ohio\nView the Report\nStudentEnrollment\n\nOhio Public School Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has 1.6 million public school students of varying backgrounds and characteristics.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23). Note: Public school enrollment statistics include traditional district, public charter, and independent STEM school students, but do not include students attending joint-vocational districts and educational service centers, pupils attending non-public schools, or home schooled students. More information about those enrollments are found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSchool Options\u00e2\u0080\u009d section.\nPublic School Enrollment by Grade\u00a0Level\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has roughly 100,000 to 130,000 public school students per grade level.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23).\nPublic School Enrollment Trends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, overall public school enrollment has declined by nearly 10 percent. Enrollment for Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest race/ethnic student groups, white and African American students, has also declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent change from 2006 to 2023. The chart displays the spring part of the school year, a convention often used in this guide.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, public school enrollment has increased significantly among Hispanic, multiracial, and Asian/Pacific Islander students.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends by Selected Characteristics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, English learner enrollment has more than doubled, while the number of students with disabilities has slightly increased. The number of students identified as gifted has declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nLow Income Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe percentage of students identified as economically disadvantaged has increased since 2005-06. However, the percentage of Ohio children living in poverty has remained mostly static.\nSource: Economically disadvantaged data are from Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23); childhood poverty data are from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Kids Count Data Center and based on U.S. Census poverty estimates (data were not reported for 2020 and are not yet available for 2023). Notes: Ohio identifies students as \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomically disadvantaged\u00e2\u0080\u009d via federal meal programs, open to pupils from households with incomes at or below 185% of federal poverty. However, in 2010, Congress passed the Community Eligibility Provision which allows certain schools to deem all students as disadvantaged (even higher-income children) for the purposes of meals eligibility. In contrast, children in poverty are from households at or below 100% federal poverty.\nOhio School Districts and Typologies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor analytic purposes, the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce categorizes districts into eight typologies based on their geographic and socio-economic characteristics. This publication displays various statistics by typology to illustrate patterns of enrollment and achievement across the state.\nSource: Ohio DEW, School District Typology. Note: This map displays the border of each district and its corresponding typology.\nPublic School Students by Typology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28 percent of Ohio students reside in urban areas and 35 percent are from suburban communities; 21 percent live in small towns while 15 percent are from rural areas.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: Public charter and STEM schools are assigned to the typology of the district in which the school is located, as reported in DEW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s community school directory. Online charters\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as e-schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094are not included in a typology, since they can enroll students statewide.\nPublic School Students in Urban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents living in urban areas come from various racial and ethnic backgrounds, and almost nine in ten are identified as economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the urban typologies (i.e., urban: very high poverty and urban: high poverty).\nPublic School Students in Suburban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents from suburban areas are majority white, with modest racial and ethnic diversity. About one in five suburban students are economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the suburban typologies (i.e., suburban: very low poverty and suburban: low poverty).\nPublic School Students in Small Town Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe large majority of students from small towns are white and more than two in five are economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the small town typologies (i.e., small town: high poverty and small town: low poverty).\nPublic School Students in Rural Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents from rural areas are overwhelmingly white and just under half are identified as economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the rural typologies (i.e., rural: average poverty and rural: high poverty).\nOhio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twenty-Five Largest Districts by Enrollment (2022-23)\nNote: Ohio Virtual Academy, a statewide e-school, is considered equivalent to a school district. This table does not include charter or STEM students as part of the district\u00e2\u0080\u0099s student population. Enrollment changes of less than +/- 1 percent are considered to have had no substantive change (marked as \u00e2\u0080\u009c--\u00e2\u0080\u009c).\nSchoolOptions\n\nEnrollment by Educational Model\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoughly 80 percent of Ohio students attend traditional public school districts, while more than 110,000 students attend charter schools and more than 200,000 students attend non-public schools or homeschool.\nSources: All data are for 2022-23 and drawn from various sources from Ohio DEW.\nPublic Charter Schools\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has 334 charter schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as community schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094serving more than 110,000 students.\nSources: Ohio DEW downloadable file titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuilding Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d was used to calculate enrollments for 2022-23 and the community school directory was used to identify the type of charter school. Historical enrollment data were drawn from DEW, Community School Annual Report: 2021-2022.\nCharacteristics of Charter School Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoughly 80 percent of charter school students are economically disadvantaged, and a majority are Black or Hispanic. Nearly 70 percent of charter school students attend brick-and-mortar charters located in urban communities.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23). Note: All statistics in this table include online charter schools; they are not assigned to district typologies, however, because they can draw students from all areas of the state.\nInterdistrict Open Enrollment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFour in five Ohio districts participate in interdistrict open enrollment. Approximately 80,000 students open enroll, with participation generally, until recently, increasing over time.\nSources: Two sources were used for this chart, based on the availability of data. For 2002-03 to 2011-12, data from the Ohio Auditor of State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 report, Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Open Enrollment were used. For 2012-13 to 2022-23, enrollments are calculated based on school districts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 funding reports; see Ohio DEW, Traditional Public Schools Funding.\nPrivate School Scholarships\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore than 80,000 students used state-funded scholarships (often referred to as vouchers) to attend private schools in 2022-23.\nSource: Historical Historical data through 2020-21 are from American Federation for Children, School Choice Yearbook (2021). Ohio DEW began recently reporting more detailed voucher data and beginning with 2021-22, numbers are from Advanced Reports. Note: The chart displays the total number of students in the various scholarship programs. For more information on each program, see Ohio DEW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s webpage, Scholarships.\nHomeschooling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNearly 50,000 students participate in homeschooling; the number of homeschoolers significantly increased in 2020-21 and has decreased slightly since then.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Homeschool Student Data. Note: Students attending online charter schools are not considered homeschool students.\nStudent Achievement:National Exams\n\nNational Exams: NAEP 2022\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApproximately 30 to 40 percent of Ohio students reach the national standard for proficiency, just above the national average.\nSource: National Assessment of Educational Progress, Data Explorer (2022). Note: The figure displays proficiency rates\u00e2\u0080\u0094the percentage of students achieving NAEP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rigorous proficiency benchmark. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), considered the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Report Card,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is administered to a representative sample of fourth and eighth grade students in each state every two years in reading and math.\nOhio Compared to Other States\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNationally, Ohio ranks between 11th and 20th in fourth and eighth grade math and reading.

Today, most college and university students in the U.S. take at least some classes online.\nOnline degrees have a broad reach, encompassing new higher education concepts like microcredentials and massive open online courses (MOOCs), along with traditional college degrees.\nDistance learners, too, are a diverse group. As a remote student, your peers may include traditional college-age students, working parents, military service members, established professionals and lifelong learners.\nThis fast-growing field clearly holds wide appeal, but how big is online learning, exactly?\nThis article examines the popularity of online learning, charting how fast the field has grown in recent years and exploring the motivations behind distance learning. If you\u2019re a prospective or current online student, a parent or an educator\u2014or if you\u2019re just curious about the online learning phenomenon\u2014these are the key statistics to know.\nKey Takeaways\nOnline Learning by the Numbers\nAll types of colleges and universities offer classes online. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), public colleges enrolled about 8.5 million online students in 2021. Another 2.7 million remote learners attended private schools, including 1.9 million at nonprofit institutions and nearly 800,000 at for-profit schools.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the availability of online learning in higher education starting in 2020. NCES reports that 75% of all postsecondary students in the U.S.\u2014over 14 million learners\u2014took online classes in fall 2020 as the pandemic restricted in-person learning, whereas only 36% had enrolled in distance education in fall 2019.\nWith many schools opening classrooms for in-person learning again in 2021, the percentage of students enrolled in distance learning courses dropped to about 60%\u2014still much higher than in pre-pandemic years.\nOnline enrollment levels vary depending on where students live. Alaska, Hawai\u2019i and New Hampshire boast the highest percentages of online students in the United States.\nOnline Schools vs. Traditional College\nMany online degree seekers attend traditional schools, but as of 2020, about 15% of all U.S. college students attended primarily online institutions. NCES defines primarily online schools as those enrolling 90% or more of their student body in distance education. About 11% of U.S. colleges and universities\u2014422 institutions in total\u2014fit this profile.\nOften catering to working students, some online schools have always offered fully remote programs. Others began as traditional campus-based institutions, later establishing online divisions that grew to dwarf their brick-and-mortar counterparts.\nIn 2020, primarily online schools enrolled over 1.5 million full-time degree seekers. Another 1.2 million learners took classes part time. Female students outnumbered male students among both full-time and part-time enrollees, making up about 62% of all learners.\nOnline Learning Through the Years\nIn 2020, the onset of Covid-19 disrupted traditional education, abruptly forcing students, instructors and administrators to adapt to remote learning models.\nEven before the pandemic, however, remote learning had been growing steadily for almost a decade as daily life became more digitized and remote learning technology and infrastructure improved.\nIn 2012\u2014a watershed year in online education that saw the founding of MOOC giants edX and Coursera\u2014over 25% of U.S. college and university students took at least one distance learning course, NCES reports. By 2019, that number had risen to 36%, about half of whom attended exclusively online.\nIn 2020, the number of online students at traditional higher education institutions exploded as schools shifted courses online amid lockdown restrictions. During that year, about 46% of U.S. learners studied entirely online, and another 28% took at least some courses remotely. As of 2021, remote learning numbers remained high, with about 60% of college students taking some or all of their classes online.\nMany traditional degree-seeking students returned to in-person learning when schools reopened in 2021, but online education as a whole continued to grow.\nThe World Economic Forum reports that in 2016, Coursera had 21 million registered users. By 2019, 44 million learners used the MOOC platform. This number leaped to 71 million in 2020, but unlike online college enrollment numbers, Coursera\u2019s enrollment did not drop in 2021. Instead, the platform gained even more users, totaling 92 million in 2022.\nOnline Degrees\nRemote learning programs serve this growing body of online students with degree programs at all levels. NCES reports that in the 2019-20 academic year, primarily online colleges conferred:\nMale-identifying students earned 37% to 39% of these degrees, with female-identifying students earning 61% to 63%.\nStudents at primarily online schools make up 14.7% of all college and university enrollees. They earn:\nOnline doctoral programs are relatively uncommon; remote learners earn only 7.6% of all doctorates.\nOnline Learning by Race\nOnline schools serve a racially diverse student body, with more than half of all learners identifying as nonwhite. These institutions enroll minority learners at higher rates than conventional schools across most reported categories, as shown in the chart below.\nIlana Hamilton is a writer and editor specializing in education and career topics.

Fordham Institute presents the seventh edition of Ohio Education By The Numbers, offering a fact-based overview of K-12 education in Ohio. For more information, visit www.fordhaminstitute.org/ohio. Student Enrollment Ohio has 1.6 million public school students. Enrollment statistics include traditional district, public charter, and independent STEM school students but exclude joint-vocational districts, educational service centers, non-public schools, and homeschooled students. Public School Enrollment by Grade Level Ohio has roughly 100,000 to 130,000 public school students per grade level. Public School Enrollment Trends Since 2005-06, overall public school enrollment has declined by nearly 10 percent.

English learner enrollment has more than doubled, and the number of students with disabilities has slightly increased. The percentage of economically disadvantaged students has increased since 2005-06. Ohio School Districts and Typologies Ohio DEW categorizes districts into eight typologies based on geographic and socio-economic characteristics. 28 percent of Ohio students reside in urban areas, 35 percent in suburban communities, 21 percent in small towns, and 15 percent in rural areas. Public School Students in Urban Areas Almost nine in ten urban students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Suburban Areas About one in five suburban students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Small Town Areas More than two in five small town students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Rural Areas Just under half of rural students are economically disadvantaged. Ohio\u2019s Twenty-Five Largest Districts by Enrollment (2022-23) Ohio Virtual Academy is considered equivalent to a school district.

Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nLow Income Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe percentage of students identified as economically disadvantaged has increased since 2005-06. However, the percentage of Ohio children living in poverty has remained mostly static.\nSource: Economically disadvantaged data are from Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23); childhood poverty data are from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Kids Count Data Center and based on U.S. Census poverty estimates (data were not reported for 2020 and are not yet available for 2023). Notes: Ohio identifies students as \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomically disadvantaged\u00e2\u0080\u009d via federal meal programs, open to pupils from households with incomes at or below 185% of federal poverty. However, in 2010, Congress passed the Community Eligibility Provision which allows certain schools to deem all students as disadvantaged (even higher-income children) for the purposes of meals eligibility. In contrast, children in poverty are from households at or below 100% federal poverty.\nOhio School Districts and Typologies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor analytic purposes, the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce categorizes districts into eight typologies based on their geographic and socio-economic characteristics.

Today, most college and university students in the U.S. take at least some classes online.\nOnline degrees have a broad reach, encompassing new higher education concepts like microcredentials and massive open online courses (MOOCs), along with traditional college degrees.\nDistance learners, too, are a diverse group. As a remote student, your peers may include traditional college-age students, working parents, military service members, established professionals and lifelong learners.\nThis fast-growing field clearly holds wide appeal, but how big is online learning, exactly?\nThis article examines the popularity of online learning, charting how fast the field has grown in recent years and exploring the motivations behind distance learning. If you\u2019re a prospective or current online student, a parent or an educator\u2014or if you\u2019re just curious about the online learning phenomenon\u2014these are the key statistics to know.\nKey Takeaways\nOnline Learning by the Numbers\nAll types of colleges and universities offer classes online. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), public colleges enrolled about 8.5 million online students in 2021. Another 2.7 million remote learners attended private schools, including 1.9 million at nonprofit institutions and nearly 800,000 at for-profit schools.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the availability of online learning in higher education starting in 2020. NCES reports that 75% of all postsecondary students in the U.S.\u2014over 14 million learners\u2014took online classes in fall 2020 as the pandemic restricted in-person learning, whereas only 36% had enrolled in distance education in fall 2019.\nWith many schools opening classrooms for in-person learning again in 2021, the percentage of students enrolled in distance learning courses dropped to about 60%\u2014still much higher than in pre-pandemic years.\nOnline enrollment levels vary depending on where students live. Alaska, Hawai\u2019i and New Hampshire boast the highest percentages of online students in the United States.\nOnline Schools vs. Traditional College\nMany online degree seekers attend traditional schools, but as of 2020, about 15% of all U.S. college students attended primarily online institutions. NCES defines primarily online schools as those enrolling 90% or more of their student body in distance education. About 11% of U.S. colleges and universities\u2014422 institutions in total\u2014fit this profile.\nOften catering to working students, some online schools have always offered fully remote programs. Others began as traditional campus-based institutions, later establishing online divisions that grew to dwarf their brick-and-mortar counterparts.\nIn 2020, primarily online schools enrolled over 1.5 million full-time degree seekers. Another 1.2 million learners took classes part time. Female students outnumbered male students among both full-time and part-time enrollees, making up about 62% of all learners.\nOnline Learning Through the Years\nIn 2020, the onset of Covid-19 disrupted traditional education, abruptly forcing students, instructors and administrators to adapt to remote learning models.\nEven before the pandemic, however, remote learning had been growing steadily for almost a decade as daily life became more digitized and remote learning technology and infrastructure improved.\nIn 2012\u2014a watershed year in online education that saw the founding of MOOC giants edX and Coursera\u2014over 25% of U.S. college and university students took at least one distance learning course, NCES reports. By 2019, that number had risen to 36%, about half of whom attended exclusively online.\nIn 2020, the number of online students at traditional higher education institutions exploded as schools shifted courses online amid lockdown restrictions. During that year, about 46% of U.S. learners studied entirely online, and another 28% took at least some courses remotely. As of 2021, remote learning numbers remained high, with about 60% of college students taking some or all of their classes online.\nMany traditional degree-seeking students returned to in-person learning when schools reopened in 2021, but online education as a whole continued to grow.\nThe World Economic Forum reports that in 2016, Coursera had 21 million registered users. By 2019, 44 million learners used the MOOC platform. This number leaped to 71 million in 2020, but unlike online college enrollment numbers, Coursera\u2019s enrollment did not drop in 2021. Instead, the platform gained even more users, totaling 92 million in 2022.\nOnline Degrees\nRemote learning programs serve this growing body of online students with degree programs at all levels. NCES reports that in the 2019-20 academic year, primarily online colleges conferred:\nMale-identifying students earned 37% to 39% of these degrees, with female-identifying students earning 61% to 63%.\nStudents at primarily online schools make up 14.7% of all college and university enrollees. They earn:\nOnline doctoral programs are relatively uncommon; remote learners earn only 7.6% of all doctorates.\nOnline Learning by Race\nOnline schools serve a racially diverse student body, with more than half of all learners identifying as nonwhite. These institutions enroll minority learners at higher rates than conventional schools across most reported categories, as shown in the chart below.\nIlana Hamilton is a writer and editor specializing in education and career topics.

Alari\ufb011\u2709& Steve Song2 This study is a comparative analysis of online distance learning and traditional in-person education at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on understanding how different educational modalities affect student achievement. The justi\ufb01cation for this study lies in the rapid shift towards online learning, especially highlighted by the educational changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the \ufb01nal test scores of freshman students in \ufb01ve core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years, the research provides empirical insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of online versus traditional edu-cation. Initial observations suggested that students in online settings scored lower in most courses. However, after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores using multiple linear regression, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the crucial need for a nuanced, data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems. It brings to light the fact that the success of educational methodologies is highly contingent on speci\ufb01c contextual factors. This \ufb01nding advocates for educational administrators and policymakers to exercise careful and informed judgment when adopting online learning modalities. It encourages them to thoroughly evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes. This approach ensures that decisions about implementing online edu-cation are made with a comprehensive understanding of its diverse and context-speci\ufb01c impacts, aiming to optimize educational effectiveness and student success.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 OPEN 1 Department of Sports and Recreation Management, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Division of Research and Doctoral Studies, Concordia University Chicago, 7400 Augusta Street, River Forest, IL 60305, USA. \u2709email: balari\ufb01@ksu.edu.sa HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he year 2020 marked an extraordinary period, character-ized by the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and institutions worldwide had to adapt to unforeseen challenges across various domains, including health, economy, and education. In response, many educational institutions quickly transitioned to distance teaching (also known as e-learning, online learning, or virtual classrooms) to ensure continued access to education for their students. However, despite this rapid and widespread shift to online learning, a compre-hensive examination of its effects on student achievement in comparison to traditional in-person instruction remains largely unexplored.\nIn research examining student outcomes in the context of online learning, the prevailing trend is the consistent observation that online learners often achieve less favorable results when compared to their peers in traditional classroom settings (e.g., Fischer et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017; Edvardsson and Oskarsson, 2008). However, it is important to note that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of research on online learning has primarily focused on its potential impact (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., 2020; Di Pietro et al., 2020) or explored various perspectives (Aucejo et al., 2020; Radha et al., 2020) concerning distance education. These studies have often omitted a comprehensive and nuanced examination of its concrete academic consequences, particularly in terms of test scores and grades.\nGiven the dearth of research on the academic impact of online learning, especially in light of Covid-19 in the educational arena, the present study aims to address that gap by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person teaching in \ufb01ve required freshmen-level courses at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. To accomplish this objective, the current study compared the \ufb01nal exam results of 8297 freshman students who were enrolled in the \ufb01ve courses in person in 2020 to their 8425 \ufb01rst-year counterparts who has taken the same courses at the same institution in 2021 but in an online format.\nThe \ufb01nal test results of the \ufb01ve courses (i.e., University Skills 101, Entrepreneurship 101, Computer Skills 101, Computer Skills 101, and Fitness and Health Culture 101) were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors such as gender, class size and admission scores, which have been cited in past research to be correlated with student achievement (e.g., Meinck and Brese, 2019; Jepsen, 2015) Additionally, as the preparatory year at King Saud University is divided into \ufb01ve tracks\u2014health, nursing, science, business, and humanity, the study classi\ufb01ed students based on their respective disciplines.\nMotivation for the study The rapid expansion of distance learning in higher education, particularly highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Volk et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017), underscores the need for alternative educational approaches during crises. Such disrup-tions can catalyze innovation and the adoption of distance learning as a contingency plan (Christensen et al., 2015). King Saud University, like many institutions worldwide, faced the challenge of transitioning abruptly to online learning in response to the pandemic.\nE-learning has gained prominence in higher education due to technological advancements, offering institutions a competitive edge (Valverde-Berrocoso et al., 2020). Especially during condi-tions like the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic communication was utilized across the globe as a feasible means to overcome barriers and enhance interactions (Bozkurt, 2019).\nDistance learning, characterized by \ufb02exibility, became crucial when traditional in-person classes are hindered by unforeseen circumstance such as the ones posed by COVID-19 (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015). Scholars argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, often referred to as self-directed learning (Hiemstra, 1994) or self-education (Gadamer, 2001). Additional advantages include accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and \ufb02exibility (Sadeghi, 2019).\nHowever, distance learning is not immune to its own set of challenges.\nTechnical impediments, encompassing network issues, device limitations, and communication hiccups, represent formidable hurdles (Sadeghi, 2019). Furthermore, concerns about potential distractions in the online learning environment, fueled by the ubiquity of the internet and social media, have surfaced (Hall et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017). The absence of traditional face-to-face interactions among students and between students and instructors is also viewed as a potential drawback (Sadeghi, 2019).\nGiven the evolving understanding of the pros and cons of distance learning, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning, speci\ufb01cally in terms of student achievement, as compared to in-person classroom learning at King Saud University, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest higher education institutions.\nAcademic achievement: in-person vs online learning The primary driving force behind the rapid integration of tech-nology in education has been its emphasis on student perfor-mance (Lai and Bower, 2019). Over the past decade, numerous studies have undertaken comparisons of student academic achievement in online and in-person settings (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021). This section offers a concise review of the disparities in academic achievement between college students engaged in in-person and online learning, as identi\ufb01ed in existing research.\nA number of studies point to the superiority of traditional in-person education over online learning in terms of academic outcomes. For example, Fischer et al. (2020) conducted a com-prehensive study involving 72,000 university students across 433 subjects, revealing that online students tend to achieve slightly lower academic results than their in-class counterparts.\nSimilarly, Bettinger et al. (2017) found that students at for-pro\ufb01t online universities generally underperformed when compared to their in-person peers. Supporting this trend, Figlio et al. (2013) indicated that in-person instruction consistently produced better results, particularly among speci\ufb01c subgroups like males, lower-performing students, and Hispanic learners.\nAdditionally, Kaupp\u2019s (2012) research in California community colleges demonstrated that online students faced lower completion and success rates compared to their traditional in-person counterparts (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, other studies present evidence of online students outperforming their in-person peers. For example, Iglesias-Pradas et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of 43 bachelor courses at Telecommunication Engineering College in Malaysia, revealing that online students achieved higher academic out-comes than their in-person counterparts. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gonzalez et al. (2020) found that students engaged in online learning performed better than those who had previously taken the same subjects in traditional in-class settings.\nExpanding on this topic, several studies have reported mixed results when comparing the academic performance of online and in-person students, with various student and instructor factors emerging as in\ufb02uential variables. Chesser et al. (2020) noted that student traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion play a substantial role in academic achievement, ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 regardless of the learning environment\u2014be it traditional in-person classrooms or online settings. Furthermore, Cacault et al.\n(2021) discovered that online students with higher academic pro\ufb01ciency tend to outperform those with lower academic cap-abilities, suggesting that differences in students\u2019 academic abilities may impact their performance. In contrast, Bergstrand and Savage (2013) found that online classes received lower overall ratings and exhibited a less respectful learning environment when compared to in-person instruction. Nevertheless, they also observed that the teaching ef\ufb01ciency of both in-class and online courses varied signi\ufb01cantly depending on the instructors\u2019 back-grounds and approaches. These \ufb01ndings underscore the multi-faceted nature of the online vs. in-person learning debate, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.\nTheoretical framework. Constructivism is a well-established learning theory that places learners at the forefront of their educational experience, emphasizing their active role in con-structing knowledge through interactions with their environment (Duffy and Jonassen, 2009). According to constructivist princi-ples, learners build their understanding by assimilating new information into their existing cognitive frameworks (Vygotsky, 1978). This theory highlights the importance of context, active engagement, and the social nature of learning (Dewey, 1938).\nConstructivist approaches often involve hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and opportunities for collaborative exploration (Brooks and Brooks, 1999).\nIn the realm of education, subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emerges as a vital perspective that acknowledges the distinctive nature of different academic disciplines (Shulman, 1986). It suggests that teaching methods should be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of each subject, recognizing that subjects like mathematics, literature, or science require different approaches to facilitate effective learning (Shulman, 1987). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emphasizes that the methods of instruction should mirror the ways experts in a particular \ufb01eld think, reason, and engage with their subject matter (Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005).\nWhen applying these principles to the design of instruction for online and in-person learning environments, the signi\ufb01cance of adapting methods becomes even more pronounced. Online learning often requires unique approaches due to its reliance on technology, asynchronous interactions, and potential for reduced social presence (Anderson, 2003). In-person learning, on the other hand, bene\ufb01ts from face-to-face interactions and immediate feedback (Allen and Seaman, 2016). Here, the interplay of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy becomes evident.\nOnline learning. In an online environment, constructivist principles can be upheld by creating interactive online activities that promote exploration, re\ufb02ection, and collaborative learning (Salmon, 2000). Discussion forums, virtual labs, and multimedia presentations can provide opportunities for students to actively engage with the subject matter (Harasim, 2017). By integrating subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy, educators can design online content that mirrors the discipline\u2019s methodologies while leveraging technology for authentic experiences (Koehler and Mishra, 2009).\nFor instance, an online history course might incorporate virtual museum tours, primary source analysis, and collaborative time-line projects.\nIn-person learning. In a traditional brick-and-mortar class-room setting, constructivist methods can be implemented through group activities, problem-solving tasks, and in-depth discussions that encourage active participation (Jonassen et al., 2003). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy complements this by shaping instructional methods to align with the inherent characteristics of the subject (Hattie, 2009). For instance, in a physics class, hands-on experiments and real-world applications can bring theoretical concepts to life (Hake, 1998).\nIn sum, the fusion of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy offers a versatile approach to instructional design that adapts to different learning environments (Garrison, 2011). By incorporating the principles of both theories, educators can tailor their methods to suit the unique demands of online and in-person learning, ultimately providing students with engaging and effective learning experiences that align with the nature of the subject matter and the mode of instruction.\nCourse description The Self-Development Skills Department at King Saud University (KSU) offers \ufb01ve mandatory freshman-level courses. These courses aim to foster advanced thinking skills and cultivate sci-enti\ufb01c research abilities in students. They do so by imparting essential skills, identifying higher-level thinking patterns, and facilitating hands-on experience in scienti\ufb01c research. The design of these classes is centered around aiding students\u2019 smooth transition into university life. Brief descriptions of these courses are as follows: University Skills 101 (CI 101) is a three-hour credit course designed to nurture essential academic, communication, and Fig. 1 Comparison of Final Exam Results for the Five Courses Mandatory Freshman Courses in King Saud University by Year (2020 and 2021). The \ufb01gure compared student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, using independent-samples t-tests; the results show a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 3 personal skills among all preparatory year students at King Saud University. The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the practical abilities they need to excel in their academic pursuits and navigate their university lives effectively. CI 101 comprises 12 sessions and is an integral part of the curriculum for all incoming freshmen, ensuring a standardized foundation for skill development.\nFitness and Health 101 (FAJB 101) is a one-hour credit course.\nFAJB 101 focuses on the aspects of self-development skills in terms of health and physical, and the skills related to personal health, nutrition, sports, preventive, psychological, reproductive, and \ufb01rst aid. This course aims to motivate students\u2019 learning process through entertainment, sports activities, and physical exercises to maintain their health. This course is required for all incoming freshmen students at King Saud University.\nEntrepreneurship 101 (ENT 101) is a one-hour- credit course.\nENT 101 aims to develop students\u2019 skills related to entrepre-neurship. The course provides students with knowledge and skills to generate and transform ideas and innovations into practical commercial projects in business settings. The entrepreneurship course consists of 14 sessions and is taught only to students in the business track.\nComputer Skills 101 (CT 101) is a three-hour credit course.\nThis provides students with the basic computer skills, e.g., com-ponents, operating systems, applications, and communication backup. The course explores data visualization, introductory level of modern programming with algorithms and information security. CT 101 course is taught for all tracks except those in the human track.\nComputer Skills 102 (CT 102) is a three-hour credit course. It provides IT skills to the students to utilize computers with high ef\ufb01ciency, develop students\u2019 research and scienti\ufb01c skills, and increase capability to design basic educational software. CT 102 course focuses on operating systems such as Microsoft Of\ufb01ce.\nThis course is only taught for students in the human track.\nStructure and activities. These courses ranged from one to three hours. A one-hour credit means that students must take an hour of the class each week during the academic semester. The same arrangement would apply to two and three credit-hour courses.\nThe types of activities in each course are shown in Table 1.\nAt King Saud University, each semester spans 15 weeks in duration. The total number of semester hours allocated to each course serves as an indicator of its signi\ufb01cance within the broader context of the academic program, including the diverse tracks available to students. Throughout the two years under study (i.e., 2020 and 2021), course placements (fall or spring), course content, and the organizational structure remained consistent and uniform.\nData Participants. The study\u2019s data comes from test scores of a cohort of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students enrolled at King Saud Uni-versity in Saudi Arabia over the span of two academic years: 2020 and 2021. Among these students, 8297 were engaged in tradi-tional, in-person learning in 2020, while 8425 had transitioned to online instruction for the same courses in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the student population consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. However, in 2021, there was a reversal in these proportions, with female students accounting for 48.5% and male students comprising 51.5% of the total participants.\nRegarding student enrollment in the \ufb01ve courses, Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown by average class size, admission scores, and the number of students enrolled in the courses during the two years covered by this study. While the total number of students in each course remained relatively consistent across the two years, there were noticeable \ufb02uctuations in average class sizes.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, four out of the \ufb01ve courses experienced substantial increases in class size, with some nearly doubling in size (e.g., ENT_101 and CT_102), while one course (CT_101) showed a reduction in its average class size.\nIn this study, it must be noted that while some students enrolled in up to three different courses within the same academic year, none repeated the same exam in both years. Speci\ufb01cally, students who failed to pass their courses in 2020 were required to complete them in summer sessions and were consequently not included in this study\u2019s dataset. To ensure clarity and precision in our analysis, the research focused exclusively on student test scores to evaluate and compare the academic effectiveness of online and traditional in-person learning methods. This approach was chosen to provide a clear, direct comparison of the educational impacts associated with each teaching format.\nMethods. Descriptive analysis of the \ufb01nal exam scores for the two years (2020 and 2021) were conducted. Additionally, comparison of student outcomes in in-person classes in 2020 to their online platform peers in 2021 were conducted using an independent-samples t-test. Subsequently, in order to address potential Table 1 Learning activities and total course hours per semester.\nLearning Activities Courses Lecture Laboratory Total Semester Hours CT_101 50% 50% 45 CT_102 50% 50% 45 ENT_101 100% 0% 15 FAJB_101 100% 0% 15 CI_101 100% 0% 45 CI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nTable 2 Class size, gender distribution, and admission scores by courses in 2020 and 2021.\nCourses Average Class Size Gender Distribution Admission Scores 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 FAJB 101 23.1 46.1 M = 53.8%, F = 46.2% M = 58.3%, F = 41.7% 89.58 87.95 CI 101 21.6 35.2 M = 54%, F = 46% M = 58%, F = 42% 89.57 87.96 ENT 101 33.7 66.7 M = 68.1%, F = 31.9% M = 69.7%, F = 30.3% 87.94 90.19 CT 101 42.7 22.3 M = 62.7%, F = 37.3% M = 64.2%, F = 35.8% 90.84 88.22 CT 102 21.1 46.5 M = 51.4%, F = 48% M = 57%, F = 43% 87.85 86.85 Source: Deanship of Admission and Registration Affairs at King Saud University.\nCI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 disparities between the two groups arising from variables such as gender, class size, and admission scores (which serve as an indicator of students\u2019 academic aptitude and pre-enrollment knowledge), multiple regression analyses were conducted. In these multivariate analyses, outcomes of both in-person and online cohorts were assessed within their respective tracks. By carefully considering essential aforementioned variables linked to student performance, the study aimed to ensure a comprehensive and equitable evaluation.\nStudy instrument. The study obtained students\u2019 \ufb01nal exam scores for the years 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) from the school\u2019s records of\ufb01ce through their examination management system. In the preparatory year at King Saud University, \ufb01nal exams for all courses are developed by committees composed of faculty members from each department. To ensure valid com-parisons, the \ufb01nal exam questions, crafted by departmental committees of professors, remained consistent and uniform for the two years under examination.\nTable 3 provides a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of all \ufb01ve tests included in our analysis. These tests exhibit a strong degree of internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coef\ufb01cients spanning a range from 0.77 to 0.86. This robust and consistent internal consistency measurement underscores the dependable nature of these tests, af\ufb01rming their reliability and suitability for the study\u2019s objectives.\nIn terms of assessing test validity, content validity was ensured through a thorough review by university subject matter experts, resulting in test items that align well with the content domain and learning objectives. Additionally, criterion-related validity was established by correlating students\u2019 admissions test scores with their \ufb01nal required freshman test scores in the \ufb01ve subject areas, showing a moderate and acceptable relationship (0.37 to 0.56) between the test scores and the external admissions test. Finally, construct validity was con\ufb01rmed through reviews by experienced subject instructors, leading to improvements in test content. With guidance from university subject experts, construct validity was established, af\ufb01rming the effectiveness of the \ufb01nal tests in assessing students\u2019 subject knowledge at the end of their coursework.\nCollectively, these validity and reliability measures af\ufb01rm the soundness and integrity of the \ufb01nal subject tests, establishing their suitability as effective assessment tools for evaluating students\u2019 knowledge in their \ufb01ve mandatory freshman courses at King Saud University.\nProcedure. After obtaining research approval from the Research Committee at King Saud University, the coordinators of the \ufb01ve courses (CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101) supplied the researchers with the \ufb01nal exam scores of all \ufb01rst-year preparatory year students at King Saud University for the initial semester of the academic years 2020 and 2021. The sample encompassed all students who had completed these \ufb01ve courses during both years, resulting in a total of 16,722 students forming the \ufb01nal group of participants.\nLimitations. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the research was conducted within a well-resourced major public university. As such, the experiences with online classes at other types of institutions (e.g., community colleges, private institutions) may vary signi\ufb01cantly. Additionally, the limited data pertaining to in-class teaching practices and the diversity of learning activities across different courses represents a gap that could have provided valuable insights for a more thor-ough interpretation and explanation of the study\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\nFindings To compare student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, independent-samples t-tests were conducted.\nTable 4 shows a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nThe biggest decline was with CT_102 with 3.58 points, and the smallest decline was with CI_101 with 0.18 points.\nHowever, such simple comparison of means between the two years (via t-tests) by subjects does not account for the differences in gender composition, class size, and admission scores between the two academic years, all of which have been associated with student outcomes (e.g., Ho and Kelman, 2014; De Paola et al., 2013). To account for such potential confounding variables, multiple regressions were conducted to compare the 2 years\u2019 results while controlling for these three factors associated with student achievement.\nTable 5 presents the regression results, illustrating the variation in \ufb01nal exam scores between 2020 and 2021, while controlling for gender, class size, and admission scores.

Conversely, in the case of ENT_101, online students in 2021 scored 0.69 points lower than their 2020 in-person counterparts. With CT_102, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences in \ufb01nal exam scores between the two cohorts of students.\nDiscussion The study sought to assess the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning in the higher education setting in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed the \ufb01nal exam scores of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students in King Saud University in \ufb01ve required subjects (i.e., CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101). The study initially performed a simple comparison of mean scores by tracks by year (via t-tests) and then a number of multiple regression analyses which controlled for class size, gender composition, and admission scores.\nOverall, the study\u2019s more in-depth \ufb01ndings using multiple regression painted a wholly different picture than the results obtained using t-tests. After controlling for class size, gender composition, and admissions scores, online students in 2021 performed better than their in-person instruction peers in 2020 in University Skills (CI_101), Fitness and Health (FAJB_101), and Computer Skills (CT_101), whereas in-person students out-performed their online peers in Entrepreneurship (ENT_101).\nThere was no meaningful difference in outcomes for students in the Computer Skills (CT_102) course for the two years.\nIn light of these \ufb01ndings, it raises the question: why do we observe minimal differences (less than a one-point gain or loss) in student outcomes in courses like University Skills, Fitness and Health, Entrepreneurship, and Advanced Computer Skills based on the mode of instruction? Is it possible that when subjects are primarily at a basic or introductory level, as is the case with these courses, the mode of instruction may have a limited impact as long as the concepts are effectively communicated in a manner familiar and accessible to students?\nIn today\u2019s digital age, one could argue that students in more developed countries, such as Saudi Arabia, generally possess the skills and capabilities to effectively engage with materials pre-sented in both in-person and online formats. However, there is a notable exception in the Basic Computer Skills course, where the online cohort outperformed their in-person counterparts by more than 5 points. Insights from interviews with the instructors of this course suggest that this result may be attributed to the course\u2019s basic and conceptual nature, coupled with the availability of instructional videos that students could revisit at their own pace.\nGiven that students enter this course with varying levels of computer skills, self-paced learning may have allowed them to cover course materials at their preferred speed, concentrating on less familiar topics while swiftly progressing through concepts they already understood. The advantages of such self-paced learning have been documented by scholars like Tullis and Ben-jamin (2011), who found that self-paced learners often outper-form those who spend the same amount of time studying identical materials. This approach allows learners to allocate their time more effectively according to their individual learning pace, providing greater ownership and control over their learning experience. As such, in courses like introductory computer skills, it can be argued that becoming familiar with fundamental and conceptual topics may not require extensive in-class Table 5 Regression Summary of Freshman Final Exam Results in 2020 (In Person) and 2021(Online) by Courses, Controlling for Gender Composition, Class Size, and Admission Scores in King Saud University.\nCI_101 FAJB_101 ENT_101 CT_101 CT_102 \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta Constant \u22121820.97*** --\u22121145.93*** --1382.01*** --\u221210709.12*** --\u22121360.93*** --Year 0.89*** 0.07 0.56** 0.05 \u22120.69*** \u22120.06 5.28*** 0.32 0.66 0.04 Gender 4.18*** 0.31 4.20*** 0.34 3.80*** 0.31 2.38*** 0.14 4.07*** 0.23 Class Size 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02*** 0.08 0.16*** 0.23 \u22120.13*** \u22120.20 Admission Scores 0.62*** 0.42 0.55*** 0.41 0.44*** 0.35 0.75*** 0.43 0.78*** 0.37 Adjusted-R2 0.32 0.35 0.30 0.28 0.24 Gender was represented with male = 0 and female = 1.

Instead, it may be more about exposure to and digestion of materials in a format and at a pace tailored to stu-dents with diverse backgrounds, knowledge levels, and skill sets.\nFurther investigation is needed to more fully understand why some classes bene\ufb01tted from online instruction while others did not, and vice versa. Perhaps, it could be posited that some content areas are more conducive to in-person (or online) format while others are not. Or it could be that the different results of the two modes of learning were driven by students of varying academic abilities and engagement, with low-achieving students being more vulnerable to the limitations of online learning (e.g., Kofoed et al., 2021). Whatever the reasons, the results of the current study can be enlightened by a more in-depth analysis of the various factors associated with such different forms of learning. Moreover, although not clear cut, what the current study does provide is additional evidence against any dire consequences to student learning (at least in the higher ed setting) as a result of sudden increase in online learning with possible bene\ufb01ts of its wider use being showcased.\nBased on the \ufb01ndings of this study, we recommend that edu-cational leaders adopt a measured approach to online learning\u2014a stance that neither fully embraces nor outright denounces it. The impact on students\u2019 experiences and engagement appears to vary depending on the subjects and methods of instruction, sometimes hindering, other times promoting effective learning, while some classes remain relatively unaffected.\nRather than taking a one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, educational leaders should be open to exploring the nuances behind these outcomes. This involves examining why certain courses thrived with online delivery, while others either experienced a decline in student achievement or remained largely unaffected. By exploring these differentiated outcomes associated with diverse instructional formats, leaders in higher education institutions and beyond can make informed decisions about resource allo-cation. For instance, resources could be channeled towards in-person learning for courses that bene\ufb01t from it, while simul-taneously expanding online access for courses that have demonstrated improved outcomes through its virtual format.\nThis strategic approach not only optimizes resource allocation but could also open up additional revenue streams for the institution.\nConsidering the enduring presence of online learning, both before the pandemic and its accelerated adoption due to Covid-19, there is an increasing need for institutions of learning and scholars in higher education, as well as other \ufb01elds, to prioritize the study of its effects and optimal utilization. This study, which compares student outcomes between two cohorts exposed to in-person and online instruction (before and during Covid-19) at the largest university in Saudi Arabia, represents a meaningful step in this direction.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.\nReceived: 7 June 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023; References Allen IE, Seaman J (2016) Online report card: Tracking online education in the United States.

    "Document2": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning. Accommodate learning styles8 Active learning strategies9 Collaborative learning10 Differentiated instruction11 Flipped classroom model12 Partner/group activities13 Peer-to-peer interaction14 Project based learning15 Short recorded lessons16 Video communication17 3 Hybrid Learning: Integrating the Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals in Distance Learning The school community18 includes a range of administrators and staff who support students\u2019 social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

    "Summarized_Document1": "This study compares online and in-person learning at King Saud University, focusing on the impact on student achievement. The research analyzed final test scores of 16,722 freshman students in five core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years. Initial observations indicated lower scores for online students, but after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the need for a data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems, considering the variable effects on learning outcomes.The study's motivation stems from the rapid shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for alternative educational approaches. Distance learning offers flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness but also faces challenges like technical issues and potential distractions. The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning at King Saud University.Theoretical frameworks of constructivism and subject-specific pedagogy were applied to understand the differences in learning environments. Constructivism emphasizes active learning and context, while subject-specific pedagogy tailors teaching methods to the characteristics of each subject. These principles were used to design instruction for both online and in-person learning environments.The study's data comes from test scores of 16,722 first-year students at King Saud University over two academic years: 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online). The final exam results of five courses were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors like gender, class size, and admission scores. Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare student outcomes.Findings showed a statistically significant drop in test scores from 2020 to 2021 for all courses except Computer Skills 101. However, after controlling for confounding variables, online students in 2021 performed better in University Skills 101, Fitness and Health 101, and Computer Skills 101, while in-person students outperformed online peers in Entrepreneurship 101. There was no significant difference in outcomes for Computer Skills 102.The study suggests that the mode of instruction may have limited impact on basic or introductory courses, as long as concepts are effectively communicated. The advantages of self-paced learning in online environments were highlighted, particularly for courses like introductory computer skills. The study recommends a measured approach to online learning, exploring the nuances behind different outcomes and optimizing resource allocation based on course-specific needs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence against any dire consequences to student learning due to the shift to online learning, with potential benefits for certain courses. Educational leaders should adopt a strategic approach, considering the specific needs of each course and the potential advantages of online learning.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for educators, transitioning many school districts from in-person instruction to distance learning models, including hybrid combinations of in-person and virtual learning. Educators must implement these new models to meet students' academic, physical, social, and emotional needs, often requiring collaboration with other professionals within their school or district. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, key features, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of professional support for student learning. Hyflex Learning Hyflex learning offers a flexible course structure allowing students to attend sessions in the classroom, participate online, or both. It is characterized by flexible attendance modes and lends itself more to synchronous learning. Students can participate face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning) or at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology is used for real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, learning activities, communication, and assignment management. Blended Learning Blended learning combines face-to-face instruction with online instruction, lending itself more to asynchronous learning. Students attend partial face-to-face classes (synchronous learning) and complete online learning at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology delivers additional content, facilitates learning activities, communicates with students, and manages resources and assignments. Terminology Cloud storage: Internet-based computing model for storing, managing, and sharing files online. Learning management system (LMS): Platform for deploying and tracking online training, accessible to both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette: Appropriate online social behavior. Student response tool: Tool for receiving real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning: Synchronous learning occurs in real-time with active participation, while asynchronous learning occurs on the student's schedule. Video conferencing: Technology for face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Practices for Hybrid Learning Hyflex and blended learning share many pedagogical practices, but key differences exist. Hyflex relies more on synchronous learning, using real-time student response tools, while blended learning's asynchronous nature does not. Practices include accommodating learning styles, active learning strategies, collaborative learning, differentiated instruction, flipped classroom model, partner/group activities, peer-to-peer interaction, project-based learning, short recorded lessons, and video communication. Hybrid Learning: Integrating Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals The school community includes administrators and staff supporting students' social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. Online instruction does not eliminate the need for socialization, physical activity, or access to services from social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Hyflex and blended learning models offer opportunities to support instruction and build community by connecting students with other professionals. Consider involving librarians/media specialists, physical education teachers, specialized instruction support personnel (SISP), education support professionals (ESPs), paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, and arts and music educators in supporting student learning. Resources: Various resources are provided, including tools for diverse learners, learning management systems, netiquette guidelines, formative assessment tools, synchronous and asynchronous learning strategies, video conferencing best practices, and more.",

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning.

The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

    "Summarized_Document2": "Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for educators, transitioning many school districts from in-person instruction to distance learning models, including hybrid combinations of in-person and virtual learning. Educators must implement these new models to meet students' academic, physical, social, and emotional needs, often requiring collaboration with other professionals within their school or district. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, key features, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of professional support for student learning. Hyflex Learning Hyflex learning offers a flexible course structure allowing students to attend sessions in the classroom, participate online, or both. It is characterized by flexible attendance modes and lends itself more to synchronous learning. Students can participate face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning) or at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology is used for real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, learning activities, communication, and assignment management. Blended Learning Blended learning combines face-to-face instruction with online instruction, lending itself more to asynchronous learning. Students attend partial face-to-face classes (synchronous learning) and complete online learning at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology delivers additional content, facilitates learning activities, communicates with students, and manages resources and assignments. Terminology Cloud storage: Internet-based computing model for storing, managing, and sharing files online. Learning management system (LMS): Platform for deploying and tracking online training, accessible to both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette: Appropriate online social behavior. Student response tool: Tool for receiving real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning: Synchronous learning occurs in real-time with active participation, while asynchronous learning occurs on the student's schedule. Video conferencing: Technology for face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Practices for Hybrid Learning Hyflex and blended learning share many pedagogical practices, but key differences exist. Hyflex relies more on synchronous learning, using real-time student response tools, while blended learning's asynchronous nature does not. Practices include accommodating learning styles, active learning strategies, collaborative learning, differentiated instruction, flipped classroom model, partner/group activities, peer-to-peer interaction, project-based learning, short recorded lessons, and video communication. Hybrid Learning: Integrating Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals The school community includes administrators and staff supporting students' social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. Online instruction does not eliminate the need for socialization, physical activity, or access to services from social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Hyflex and blended learning models offer opportunities to support instruction and build community by connecting students with other professionals. Consider involving librarians/media specialists, physical education teachers, specialized instruction support personnel (SISP), education support professionals (ESPs), paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, and arts and music educators in supporting student learning. Resources: Various resources are provided, including tools for diverse learners, learning management systems, netiquette guidelines, formative assessment tools, synchronous and asynchronous learning strategies, video conferencing best practices, and more.",

So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning. Accommodate learning styles8 Active learning strategies9 Collaborative learning10 Differentiated instruction11 Flipped classroom model12 Partner/group activities13 Peer-to-peer interaction14 Project based learning15 Short recorded lessons16 Video communication17 3 Hybrid Learning: Integrating the Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals in Distance Learning The school community18 includes a range of administrators and staff who support students\u2019 social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning. Accommodate learning styles8 Active learning strategies9 Collaborative learning10 Differentiated instruction11 Flipped classroom model12 Partner/group activities13 Peer-to-peer interaction14 Project based learning15 Short recorded lessons16 Video communication17 3 Hybrid Learning: Integrating the Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals in Distance Learning The school community18 includes a range of administrators and staff who support students\u2019 social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

Hyflex Learning Hyflex learning offers a flexible course structure allowing students to attend sessions in the classroom, participate online, or both. It is characterized by flexible attendance modes and lends itself more to synchronous learning. Students can participate face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning) or at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology is used for real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, learning activities, communication, and assignment management. Blended Learning Blended learning combines face-to-face instruction with online instruction, lending itself more to asynchronous learning. Students attend partial face-to-face classes (synchronous learning) and complete online learning at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology delivers additional content, facilitates learning activities, communicates with students, and manages resources and assignments. Terminology Cloud storage: Internet-based computing model for storing, managing, and sharing files online. Learning management system (LMS): Platform for deploying and tracking online training, accessible to both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette: Appropriate online social behavior. Student response tool: Tool for receiving real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning: Synchronous learning occurs in real-time with active participation, while asynchronous learning occurs on the student's schedule. Video conferencing: Technology for face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Practices for Hybrid Learning Hyflex and blended learning share many pedagogical practices, but key differences exist. Hyflex relies more on synchronous learning, using real-time student response tools, while blended learning's asynchronous nature does not. Practices include accommodating learning styles, active learning strategies, collaborative learning, differentiated instruction, flipped classroom model, partner/group activities, peer-to-peer interaction, project-based learning, short recorded lessons, and video communication. Hybrid Learning: Integrating Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals The school community includes administrators and staff supporting students' social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. Online instruction does not eliminate the need for socialization, physical activity, or access to services from social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Hyflex and blended learning models offer opportunities to support instruction and build community by connecting students with other professionals. Consider involving librarians/media specialists, physical education teachers, specialized instruction support personnel (SISP), education support professionals (ESPs), paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, and arts and music educators in supporting student learning. Resources: Various resources are provided, including tools for diverse learners, learning management systems, netiquette guidelines, formative assessment tools, synchronous and asynchronous learning strategies, video conferencing best practices, and more.",

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning. Accommodate learning styles8 Active learning strategies9 Collaborative learning10 Differentiated instruction11 Flipped classroom model12 Partner/group activities13 Peer-to-peer interaction14 Project based learning15 Short recorded lessons16 Video communication17 3 Hybrid Learning: Integrating the Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals in Distance Learning The school community18 includes a range of administrators and staff who support students\u2019 social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

    "Summarized_Document2": "Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for educators, transitioning many school districts from in-person instruction to distance learning models, including hybrid combinations of in-person and virtual learning. Educators must implement these new models to meet students' academic, physical, social, and emotional needs, often requiring collaboration with other professionals within their school or district. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, key features, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of professional support for student learning. Hyflex Learning Hyflex learning offers a flexible course structure allowing students to attend sessions in the classroom, participate online, or both. It is characterized by flexible attendance modes and lends itself more to synchronous learning. Students can participate face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning) or at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology is used for real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, learning activities, communication, and assignment management. Blended Learning Blended learning combines face-to-face instruction with online instruction, lending itself more to asynchronous learning. Students attend partial face-to-face classes (synchronous learning) and complete online learning at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology delivers additional content, facilitates learning activities, communicates with students, and manages resources and assignments. Terminology Cloud storage: Internet-based computing model for storing, managing, and sharing files online. Learning management system (LMS): Platform for deploying and tracking online training, accessible to both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette: Appropriate online social behavior. Student response tool: Tool for receiving real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning: Synchronous learning occurs in real-time with active participation, while asynchronous learning occurs on the student's schedule. Video conferencing: Technology for face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Practices for Hybrid Learning Hyflex and blended learning share many pedagogical practices, but key differences exist. Hyflex relies more on synchronous learning, using real-time student response tools, while blended learning's asynchronous nature does not. Practices include accommodating learning styles, active learning strategies, collaborative learning, differentiated instruction, flipped classroom model, partner/group activities, peer-to-peer interaction, project-based learning, short recorded lessons, and video communication. Hybrid Learning: Integrating Expertise of Specialized Educators and Education Support Professionals The school community includes administrators and staff supporting students' social, emotional, cognitive, and physical needs. Online instruction does not eliminate the need for socialization, physical activity, or access to services from social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Hyflex and blended learning models offer opportunities to support instruction and build community by connecting students with other professionals. Consider involving librarians/media specialists, physical education teachers, specialized instruction support personnel (SISP), education support professionals (ESPs), paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, and arts and music educators in supporting student learning. Resources: Various resources are provided, including tools for diverse learners, learning management systems, netiquette guidelines, formative assessment tools, synchronous and asynchronous learning strategies, video conferencing best practices, and more.",

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning. Hybrid flexible 1 or Hyflex What is hyflex learning? Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning.

The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document1": "2024 U.S. Electric Cars Listed From Lowest To Highest Energy Consumption\n The Hyundai Ioniq 6, Lucid Air and Lexus RZ are your energy consumption champions. \nOutstanding energy consumption numbers are one of the key features of electric vehicles. High efficiency is crucial to achieve a desirable driving range while using a limited amount of energy in batteries. Basically, you can make a fast EV or one with great range, but if it's bad at efficiency, you won't see the benefits you want.\u00a0\nIn today's post, we'll take a look at a list of EPA energy consumption results\u2014Combined, City and Highway\u2014for U.S.-market battery-electric vehicles. The EPA results are not perfect, but they remain the only common measure for all EVs on the market.\nThere are more than 300 individual EV configurations on sale, including different battery sizes, ranges, powertrain setups, and wheels\u2014all of which directly affect energy consumption. We collected numbers for about 200 configurations, for which data were available\u2014listed directly by EPA, or by the manufacturers. (There is an asterisk in such cases, just like when we applied numbers from the previous model year of an EV.)\nNo Tesla Models For 2024, Yet\nUpdate March 1, 2024: We should note that at the moment, this\u00a0chart is lacking some of the popular models\u2014including the Tesla lineup\u2014because they unfortunately are not yet listed on the EPA website. We will include them in the future.\nHistorically, Tesla models have been rated as highly efficient, boasting\u00a0276 Wh/mi (172 Wh/km) for the Model Y Long Range AWD. We expect them to be very competitive when the data comes in.\nWe've included models that are currently available for order or reservation, some upcoming models, and a few that have been discontinued but may still be found on dealer lots as reference points.\nThe Stats\nThe EPA provides fuel economy numbers in MPGe (miles per gallon equivalent), assuming that one gallon of gasoline is 33.7 kWh of energy. This unit was created to have a kind of comparison to the MPG rating, used for internal combustion engine cars. It basically measures the equivalent amount of energy consumed when compared to a gasoline vehicle.\nHowever, because EVs are using electricity, it's better to operate using Wh or kWh as a metric. That's simply because the battery stores a certain number of kWh of energy. (The MPGe metric has been criticized for not being easy to understand or very relevant.)\u00a0\nIn our charts, we used the EPA Combined energy consumption numbers in miles per kilowatt-hour (mi/kWh), as well as in watt-hours per mile (Wh/mi). Both have white color text. Additionally, we also have Wh/mi numbers for EPA City (green) and EPA Highway (yellow.)\nWhile the mi/kWh metric might be more intuitive for some reasons, the Wh/mi is also handy and allows to quickly calculate the amount of energy, the vehicle will use during a month or a year, when assuming a certain mileage. For example, a vehicle with 300 Wh/mi energy consumption needs 3,000 kWh per 10,000 miles.\nA very important thing to note is that all the EPA figures include the charging losses, usually at least several percent of the total amount.\nAccording to the data, the average energy consumption for the 200 EVs listed below is 2.6 mi/kWh (381 Wh/mi). The highway numbers are over 5% worse, while the city numbers are some 4.5% better. About half of all vehicle configurations sits between 2.5-3.3 mi/kWh (300-400 Wh/mi).\nBest Energy Consumption EVs\n2024 Hyundai Ioniq 6\n2024 Lucid Air Pure RWD\nThe Hyundai Ioniq 6 (SE trim) with rear-wheel drive, a 77.4-kilowatt-hour battery and 18-inch wheels has the best EPA Combined energy consumption number of 140 MPGe or 4.2 mi/kWh (241 Wh/mi), including charging losses. One of the key elements to achieve such a high result is outstanding aerodynamics and a high-voltage battery system (697 volts nominal).\nThe second best is the Lucid Air Pure, rear-wheel drive with 19-inch wheels. It has a rating of 137 MPGe or 4.1 mi/kWh (246 Wh/mi). It's worth noting that the Lucid Air is the most efficient car on the market in the EPA Highway category (251 Wh/mi compared to 265 Wh/mi in the case of the Hyundai Ioniq 6). This is also a tremendous achievement considering the size, weight, battery capacity, range and performance of Lucid Air cars.\nOne of the biggest surprises is that the third model on the list is the new entry-level Lexus RZ 300e. According to the manufacturer, it is good for 125 MPGe or 3.7 mi/kWh (270 Wh/mi).\nHigh in the ranking are also some versions of the BMW i4 (eDrive35), the discontinued Chevrolet Bolt EV/Bolt EUV duo, Toyota bZ4X, Kia EV6, Hyundai Kona Electric, Polestar 2 (Long Range Single Motor), Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia Niro EV, Volkswagen ID.4 and Tesla Model 3 (the latest version is not yet listed by the EPA).\nRoughly about 10% of the best EV configurations gets results better than 300 Wh/mi (more than 3.3 mi/kWh).\nWorst Energy Consumption EVs\nOn the other end of the spectrum, we usually can find large and heavy electric vehicles with multi-motor powertrains. They consume up to about three times more energy than the most efficient electric cars, according to EPA.\nThe worst result belongs to the Lordstown Endurance pickup, which was rated just before the company went bankrupt. With just 48 MPGe or 1.4 mi/kWh (702 Wh/mi), the vehicle sits at the bottom of the list.\nThe GMC Hummer EV Pickup and GMC Hummer EV SUV (20 battery module version) are also electron guzzlers with 50-53 MPGe, depending on the wheels/tires (Mud-Terrain MT or All-Terrain AT). The results are as low as 1.5 mi/kWh or 674 Wh/mi, and goes up to 749 Wh/mi to an absolute worst result in EPA Highway category. However, considering the size, weight and performance, this EV is still tremendously more efficient than an ICE counterpart.\nThere are GMC Hummer EV Pickups with 24 battery modules. As we understand, they are too heavy to qualify for EPA energy consumption tests (a heavy-duty pickup category). Their results potentially are even worse than the mentioned 20BM versions.\nAmong the EVs with the highest energy consumption, we can also see the quad-motor Rivians, some Chevrolet Silverado EV and Ford F-150 Lightning, and the sporty Audi SQ8 e-tron.\nLordstown Endurance\nGMC Hummer EV Pickup\nEV Energy Consumption Chart\nThe chart below helps us to better illustrate the difference between the models (according to EPA methodology), and the difference between the city and highway driving for a particular model.\nIt's just a general comparison and the only consistent one we have for the entire market. In some cases, the results might be different than real-world tests\u2014especially the Audi e-tron GT/Porsche Taycan family, which generally have better real-world results than their EPA tests indicate.\nThis chart was last updated Feb. 21, 2024. It will be updated as the year goes on.\u00a0\nClick here to see an expanded version of this chart.\n*Values according to the manufacturer or estimated (borrowed from the previous model year)\nInfo and exceptions:\nSee also\nTrending\nlatest articles\nlatest articles\nAbout this article\n",
    "Document2": "Menu\nCorporate Average Fuel Economy\n\u00a0\nNHTSA's Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards regulate how far our vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel. NHTSA sets CAFE standards for passenger cars and for light trucks (collectively, light-duty vehicles), and separately sets fuel consumption standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and engines. NHTSA also regulates the fuel-economy window stickers on new vehicles. This site contains information about many aspects of these programs, and we encourage you to check back as new information is posted.\nJune 7, 2024: NHTSA Announces Final Rule for CAFE and HDPUV Standards\nAfter reviewing the tens of thousands of public comments submitted on NHTSA\u2019s August 2023 proposal for MYs 2027-2031 Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards and MYs 2030-2035 Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans (HDPUV) Fuel Efficiency Standards and the accompanying Draft Environmental Impact Statement, NHTSA announced the final CAFE and HDPUV standards. The final rule establishes standards that would require an industry-wide fleet average of approximately 50.4 miles per gallon (mpg) in MY 2031 for passenger cars and light trucks, and an industry fleet-wide average for HDPUVs of roughly 2.851 gallons per 100 miles in MY 2035. \u00a0The final CAFE standards increase at a rate of 2 percent per year for passenger cars in MYs 2027-31 and 2 percent per year for light trucks in model years 2029-31. \u00a0The final HDPUV fuel efficiency standards increase at a rate of 10 percent per year in MYs 2030-2032 and 8 percent per year in MYs 2033-2035.\nThe agency projects the final standards will save consumers nearly $23 billion in fuel costs and avoid the consumption of about 70 billion gallons of gasoline (equivalent) through 2050. The agency also projects the standards will prevent more than 710 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, reduce air pollution, and reduce the country\u2019s dependence on oil. \u00a0The final standards provide critical savings at the gas pump for American consumers and set goals that are consistent with Congress' direction to conserve energy and provide flexibility to industry on how best to meet those goals from proven, available fuel-saving technologies.\nLight-Duty Vehicles\nStandards\nFinal Rule: CAFE Standards for MYs 2027-2031 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks and Fuel Efficiency Standards for MYs 2030-2035 Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans\u00a0\nNPRM: Proposed CAFE Standards for MYs 2027-2032 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks and Fuel Efficiency Standards for MYs 2030-2035 Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans\nDocuments Associated with Earlier Rulemakings\nCompliance and Enforcement\nNHTSA\u2019s Public Information Center (PIC) is a resource tool for the public and for automobile manufacturers to obtain information on the CAFE and Heavy-Duty Vehicle and Engine Fuel Consumption programs. PIC allows researchers, analysts, media, and the public to easily access dynamic data about how manufacturers are complying with NHTSA\u2019s fuel efficiency programs and provides self-service portals for easy access to the data. For manufacturers, PIC provides the most up-to-date resource tools for compliance. Public information is routinely updated on PIC to provide timely, reliable compliance data, which can be viewed in reports, and interactive table and graph formats. The interactive data can be easily sorted and filtered based on specific areas of interest to produce custom reports, which can also be downloaded as Excel or PDF files. NHTSA will add reports and additional resources for manufacturers to PIC sites as regulations and needs arise.\nFebruary 20, 2024: This final decision responds to petitions filed by several low-volume manufacturers requesting exemption from the generally applicable corporate average fuel economy standards for several model years.\u00a0\nDecember 13, 2022: A new compliance report for NHTSA\u2019s heavy-duty (HD) fuel consumption program covering MY 2013-2020 vehicles is available in CAFE's public information center.\nMarch 25, 2022: NHTSA final rule withdrawing the January 2021 interim final rule and reverting to the December 2016 final rule, restoring the application of the increased CAFE civil penalty rate as mandated by Congress beginning with Model Year 2019, instead of Model Year 2022.\nAugust 17, 2021: NHTSA supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking requesting comment on whether NHTSA should proceed to a final rule that withdraws the January 2021 interim final rule and reverts to the December 2016 final rule, restoring the application of the increased CAFE civil penalty rate beginning with model year 2019, instead of model year 2022.\nJanuary 14, 2021: NHTSA interim final rule adjusts the CAFE civil penalty rate to $14 beginning in model year 2022; if the August 31, 2020, decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Case No. 19-2395 is vacated, however, the rate will remain at $5.50 instead.\nJuly 12, 2019: NHTSA final rule retains the\u00a0$5.50 penalty rate applicable to automobile manufacturers that fail to meet CAFE standards.\nHeavy-Duty Vehicles\nNHTSA Announces Final Rule for HDPUV Standards\nJune 7, 2024:\u00a0NHTSA finalizes new fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans (commonly referred to as class 2b and class 3 vehicles) built in model years 2030-2035.\u00a0\nMarch 15, 2024: NHTSA finalizes technical amendments to the test procedures for heavy-duty engines and vehicles to improve accuracy and reduce testing burden.\nPhase 2\nThe compliance dates for NHTSA\u2019s fuel efficiency regulations, to the extent they apply to truck trailers, are currently stayed, pursuant to an order of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued on September 29, 2020 in case No. 16-1430.\nPhase 1\nTechnical Amendments\nFinal Rule\nNEPA Process\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking\nFuel Economy and Environment Label\nNHTSA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a joint final rule establishing new requirements for a fuel economy and environment label that will be posted on the window sticker of all new automobiles sold in the U.S.\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration\n\n1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE\n\nWashington, D.C. 20590\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Document1": "Sustainability and the Steel City: Modernization at Pittsburgh International Airport\nA rendering of the view future travelers will see when they approach the new terminal. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nFlying is essential for work, vacation or visiting loved ones. The industry also is necessary to ship goods overseas quickly. However, it\u2019s not known for being environmentally friendly. One airport is seeking to change that.\nAviation contributes 3.5 percent of effective radiative forcing (which measures energy imbalance), 2.5 percent of carbon emissions and 1.9 percent of all greenhouse gas output. So there\u2019s a strong push to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel, starting at the airport.\nPittsburgh\u2019s Terminal Modernization\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s Terminal Modernization Program is a $1.4 billion project to create a new consolidated terminal that modernizes outdated former hub facilities, better serves passengers, fuels the region\u2019s future development, stabilizes long-term costs for airlines and evokes the essence of Pittsburgh. The new multi-modal complex will feature a new garage that nearly triples the amount of covered parking.\nThe PIT Terminal Modernization Program (TMP) was built upon these five principles that represent fundamental purposes driving the transformation:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0Stabilize\u00a0airline costs\n2.\u00a0 Be\u00a0Pittsburgh\u2019s airport\n3.\u00a0 Be environmentally\u00a0sustainable\n4.\u00a0\u00a0Enhance the experience\u00a0for all customers\n5.\u00a0 Provide\u00a0value\u00a0to our\u00a0community\n\u00a0\nCranes install steel beams as part of the terminal modernization program.(triblive.com)\n1. Airport Modernization\nThe new terminal will be between the C and D airside gate concourses, eliminating the need for the people mover train. The new facility will cater to passengers flying directly to and from Pittsburgh (origin and destination traffic) as opposed to the existing facility which was largely built as a hub facility focused on connecting traffic.\n2. Improved Experience\nThe layout should make navigating the airport quicker and easier. It will slash passengers\u2019 time from curbside to airside in half. Aesthetic improvements will enhance everyone\u2019s experience, and new outdoor terraces (pre- and post-security) will make it easier for travelers to relax before boarding their flight.\n3. Increased Area Value\nAirports raise the value of the area around them by encouraging economic growth and adding convenience for potential new residents. The terminal modernization brings more than 14,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities to the region. Currently, about 550 construction workers are onsite daily, and that number will increase to 1,000 daily workers in summer 2023.\n4. Stabilized Airline Costs\nAirport efficiency can impact the costs of airlines. The expansion will allow airlines to better process and load luggage as well as welcome passengers. It also lowers long-term O&M costs.\n5. More Sustainable Terminal\nConstruction practices for the new terminal comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Environmental Program Declaration (EPD) credit for their materials while also working to reduce emissions, water, energy and waste. Officials are targeting a minimum of LEED Silver certification for the facility.\nVendors are strongly encouraged to present products and services that comply with verified third-party certification criteria or reporting standards. The airport also urges them to source their products or materials regionally to decrease the impact on the environment and human health compared to similar vendors in other locations.\nAdvantus Engineers is collaborating with other teams and implementing sustainable practices such as water and energy efficiency, using sustainable materials, managing waste, employing electric transportation methods, and promoting healthy indoor environments.\nAdditionally, the airport is recycling and reusing construction waste, including 86,000 tons of crushed concrete for new airport roads.\nThe 2030 Challenge\nPart of constructing the new terminal is moving the airport closer to achieving the 2030 Challenge, an environmental initiative to go carbon-neutral by that year.\nThe suggested plan by Architecture 2030 is to decrease 90 percent of carbon emissions by 2025 and be 100 percent carbon neutral by 2030. New buildings, renovations and additions throughout the new terminal will have energy-consumption performance standards.\nA Timeline for Construction 2021\nApril:\u00a0Officials added safe driving lanes and barricades between concourses C and D. Saw-cutting began on the ramp to remove slabs.\nMay:\u00a0To prepare for the new terminal\u2019s foundation, 300,000 square feet of material were removed.\nJune:\u00a0An impact roller broke up large concrete sections to crush into smaller aggregate for reuse in new roadways.\nJuly:\u00a0Construction teams modified an underground fuel line for future use.\nAugust and September:\u00a0Team members began installation of electrical lines, construction trailers and underground utility work. Geotechnical borings for probe holes and test piles began for terminal foundation work.\nOctober:\u00a0A groundbreaking ceremony began heavy construction.\nNovember and December:\u00a0Foundation support drilling started after test borings. Mass excavation began and utility line work continued. About 85,000 tons of concrete was removed and crushed for new roads.\n2022\nJanuary: Team members\u00a0almost complete the auger cast piles and finish about 25 percent of the structural caissons. Approximately 400 cubic yards of concrete were used for foundation pile caps.\nFebruary:\u00a0Drilling operations continued for more than half of the caissons, and auger piles were nearly completed. More than half the cubic yards of concrete for pile caps were placed, and more than 75 percent of structural steel came onto the fabrication site.\nMarch:\u00a0Installation of the first steel beams and girders. Members positioned and embedded plate girders while work was finished on terminal caissons.\nApril:\u00a0Pile cap and grade beam installation continued. Terminal bridge foundations laid, and road modifications began.\nMay:\u00a0Three-quarters of the pole caps installation was completed. Rebar for underground foundations and the front bridge terminal foundations were installed.\nJune:\u00a0Crews continued to install rebar and lifted steel beams over the train tunnel.\nJuly:\u00a0More than half of the grade beam content and 25 of the 27 embedded plate girders were installed.\nAugust and September:\u00a0Vertical construction began, and crews completed foundation roadwork. Critical construction activities continued, with foundation and concrete work progressing. Workers installed decking, steel and detailing.\nOctober:\u00a0Backfill and excavation continued, and corridor walls were demolished. Bridge piers for elevated highways were installed.\nNovember:\u00a0Completed all structural slabs, and rebar installation continued.\nDecember:\u00a0Team members placed geoform, and tub girders arrived. The first elevated deck slab concrete was installed.\n2023\nAll foundation work was completed on the site of the new terminal at the end of January. There were multiple concrete pours, and more than half of the mechanically stabilized earth walls now are in place.\nEmbracing Pittsburgh\u2019s History\nPittsburgh\u2019s industrial nickname comes from the rise of the steel industry after the Civil War. Increased demand for armament and iron boosted the local economy. Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie introduced the Bessemer steelmaking process, which brought him from obscurity to fame.\nCarnegie began producing steel in 1875. Meanwhile, Henry Clay Frick, the grandson of whiskey distillers, made his riches operating beehive cooking ovens that could turn coal into coke\u2014an essential steelmaking ingredient. Frick later partnered with Carnegie to form Carnegie Steel Co. and, in 1901, they merged multiple companies into the United States Steel Corp.\nBefore they reached their final success, however, a dispute between Carnegie Steel and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers put a dark cloud over the area\u2019s steel production. It led to the Battle of Homestead, an armed conflict that killed 12 people. This event paved the way for modern labor practices and worker-protection laws.\nThrough the mid-1950s, Pittsburgh thrived as America\u2019s eighth-largest city and produced half of the country\u2019s steel. European immigration through Ellis Island led to a population increase of more than 500,000 individuals. The city\u2019s diversity still exists in its various neighborhoods.\nThings changed for Pittsburgh in the 1970s and 1980s when steel production slowed to a stop, and the city had to reinvent itself to survive. It\u2019s now known for technology, energy, medicine, education, research, arts, sports and advanced manufacturing. Its National Football League team, the Steelers, pays tribute to its past in the steel industry. This new terminal aims to do the same. The new terminal at PIT invokes the essence of Pittsburgh through its design focused on Nature, Technology and Community\u2014dubbed NaTeCo by the design team.\nThe terminal modernization progam will pay tribute to the city\u2019s history through art and construction. Steel tree columns are a featured part of the new terminal, creating a nostalgic and stylistic design. Their brownish color is meant to invoke importance of nature in Western Pennsylvania. All of the steel in the new terminal, procured throughout the United States, is being fabricated just 10 miles away from the airport in Ambridge, Pa.\n\n\n(Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nThe Airport Authority also recruited artists Patrick Marold and Adam Kuby to create an exhibition honoring the steel industry through sculptures and other design elements. Other artisans contribute to the terminal through PIT\u2019s Art in the Airport initiative.\nSustainability in the Steel City\nThroughout the years, Pittsburgh made strides to create a healthier, more-sustainable city. From 2015-2020, the Department of City Planning released a yearly \u201cState of Sustainability\u201d report that examined ongoing efforts to reduce waste and minimize the use of nonrenewable resources.\nNonprofit organization Sustainable Pittsburgh advocates and educates individuals and groups through various initiatives such as recognizing corporations that make efforts toward decarbonization.\nUniversities in the city also are embracing measures to create a greener city. The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University and Point Park University each have their own sustainability programs to encourage research and on-campus responsibility.\nThe terminal modernization project is another major step toward creating a Pittsburgh that lives in harmony with its environment.\nTime for an Update\nAllegheny County Airport was the first airport in the region, opening in 1931, and at the time was one of the largest and most advanced terminals of its time. The Greater Pittsburgh Airport opened in 1952, becoming the region\u2019s primary commercial airport. (Allegheny County Airport continues to operate today as a robust general aviation airport with more than 60,000 operations annually.)\nThat terminal existed until 1992, when officials opened the more modern Pittsburgh International Airport, built and designed as a hub for US Airways. US Airways pulled its hub status in 2004, leaving Pittsburgh with a facility built for another time and a different purpose. The airport today offers nonstop service to more than 60 nonstop destinations on 16 airlines, including international service to London Heathrow on British Airways as well service to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.\nBoth Pittsburgh International Airport and Allegheny County Airport are operated under the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which has experienced several changes through the years, with the new terminal project being the largest.\nOfficials announced the new terminal in 2017, but construction was put on hold in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project resumed in 2021 and is now making consistent progress. The groundbreaking happened in October 2021, making it the first U.S. terminal built from the ground up after the pandemic.\nTravelers will get the opportunity to enjoy fresh air and greenery while they await their flights. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nManaging Construction\nACAA selected the architecture and engineering teams of Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects to lead work on the project. This collaboration ensures international best practices are met without sacrificing local characteristics.\nGensler is headquartered in San Francisco but has multiple Pennsylvania offices and designed the PNC tower downtown. The firm also has airport experience with Incheon Airport. HDR is headquartered in Omaha, Neb., but has an office in Pittsburgh. It replaced the Greenfield Bridge and renovated the Honolulu Airport.\nLuis Vidal completed terminal projects for Heathrow, Madrid-Barajas and other airports.\nBlue Sky News/Pittsburgh International Airport\nTaking in Local Concerns\nThe Allegheny County Airport Authority engaged the community and airlines to determine the best course of action for the terminal project. The terminal modernization has a program advisory group and a best practice group with experts in sustainability, accessibility, passenger experience, technology, health, culture and arts. These members represent constituencies, share their expertise and ensure the authority uses best practices in the new terminal design.\nFeedback was gathered through community and stakeholder meetings, interviews, surveys and the feedback section of the program\u2019s website,\u00a0PITtransformed.com.\nAlthough there are concerns with any project, Pittsburgh\u2019s local \u201cyinzers\u201d are known for being open to sustainable initiatives and creating socioeconomic changes that positively impact the environment, preserving it for future generations. These efforts are known internationally, with the United Nations Foundation recognizing the city as an example of America\u2019s growing sustainability movement.\nManaging the TPM Budget\nWith a high cost comes the need for strict budget management, and the program management team keeps spending under control. No local tax dollars are involved, and most of the construction is funded through long-term bonds, essentially borrowing money and then paying off that debt as part of its yearly operating budget. Paying for the project comes from airport revenues, including airline fees, parking and rental fees, passenger facility charges, terminal concessions revenues, and natural gas revenue.\nNatural Construction and Energy\nLarge windows will produce abundant natural light in the new terminal, minimizing the need for external lighting sources. Outside these windows are expansive outdoor terraces featuring local flora. Using local plants reduces the need for excess water and electricity.\nPlanting local trees, flowers and bushes enables visitors to learn and appreciate native plants, especially when the airport might be the only part of Pennsylvania some travelers see. They also cut carbon emissions by eliminating the need to transport outside flora.\nThe terrace will have chairs for passengers to relax as well as open spaces for kids and pets to run around before getting on their flights.\nOne of the largest changes to the terminal is the private microgrid with nearly 10,000 solar panels and five natural-gas generators. These energy sources will power the new terminal, cutting the airport\u2019s carbon footprint and creating a more-sustainable environment. The microgrid is already up and running, powering the existing facility since June 2021. This is significant for the 2030 goal, as construction and demolition projects generate approximately 569 million tons of waste annually.\nThis is advantageous for passengers and airlines, providing a power source when electricity goes out as well as decreasing flight delays. In addition to being more resilient, the microgrid saves PIT more than $1 million annually in utility costs and saves more than 6 million pounds of carbon emissions annually.\nLeading the Way for Sustainability\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s terminal modernization project is the first post-pandemic terminal built from the ground up and holds great promise. Sustainability has always been top of mind, but the ability to continue working toward the 2030 goal after a significant delay shows a commitment to creating a more eco-friendly airport. During the construction delay, PIT designers took that time to incorporate additional public health measures into the project.\nOfficials hope projects can look toward PIT as an example that sustainability, economic growth, customer satisfaction and local pride can exist in the same place.\u00a0\nAbout Rose Morrison\nRose Morrison is a freelance writer with a passion for sustainable building and innovative construction technologies; email: [email\u00a0protected].\nSubscribe\nSubscribe now to receive our FREE print publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nProject of the Week\n\nFort McHenry Tunnel\nClick here for details and to submit your project!\nCurrent Issue\n\n4th Annual Sustainable Engineering Issue 2024\nPopular Tags\nTwitter Feed\nLocation\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\nRequest More Information From Sponsor\n\n\u0394\n",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nEnergy Indicators\nMarch 13, 2024\nCoal power usage continues to decline in Texas. Solar power  will be roughly half of all new electric-generation additions in both Texas and  the U.S. in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Weatherization  over the last couple of years has significantly improved grid stability in  Texas. Global electric vehicle (EV) sales grew in 2023, with China accounting  for over half of those sales. In the U.S., the West Coast dominated EV  purchases last year. Finally, global CO2 emissions rose in 2023,  largely driven by coal use in China and India.\u00a0 \nElectrical demand\nCoal power down; wind power up \nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas\u2019 (ERCOT) net power  generation rose from 429 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2022 to 444 TWh in 2023 (Chart  1). Among lower-carbon  power sources, generation from nuclear plants has been hovering around 40  TWh since 2007, while wind and solar output rose by 99 TWh during the same time  frame. Utility-scale solar generation swelled to 32 TWh in 2023 from zero in  2015.\n\nNatural gas made up 47 percent of the 290 TWh of thermal  generation (coal, natural gas and nuclear) in 2007; coal was 39 percent. In  2023, natural gas provided 66 percent of the 303 TWh of thermal power, and coal  was 20 percent. \nSolar power capacity growth to outpace other sources\nAbout half of new U.S. planned grid additions will come from  solar power in 2024, according to the EIA (Chart 2). A total of 55.8 gigawatts  (GW) of name-plate generation capacity will be added in 2024, including 26.4 GW  of solar (47 percent), 13.4 GW of wind (24 percent) and 8.2 GW of battery  storage (15 percent). Solar will see more than half of its new capacity in  three states: Texas, California and Florida.\n\nNatural gas\u00ad will add 7.5 GW (13 percent of new generation  capacity) to the grid. This will be the lowest new natural gas capacity in 25  years. In addition, 4.7 GW of coal and natural gas capacity is expected to be  retired nationwide in 2024.\nHowever, due to the intermittent nature of renewables like  wind and solar and variations in demand for thermal power over the course of  the day and year, total output potential from these sources will be much less  than the total capacity. In 2023, installed utility-scale solar capacity was  690 TWh, while generation was only 162 TWh. The ratio of the two\u2014the capacity  factor\u2014was 23 percent in 2023 and 34 percent for wind. The average capacity  factor for natural gas was 41 percent.\nHalf of Texas\u2019 new generation capacity in 2024 will be  solar, matching that of the U.S.\u2019 Already a global leader in wind-power  production, wind will only make up 10 percent of the state\u2019s additions versus  24 percent nationally. Texas will also see the addition of 3.5 GW of natural-gas-fired  turbines, nearly half that of the nation. Most of these gas plants are peakers\u2014turbines  optimized to flex up and down when demand spikes or when output from other  sources like intermittent renewables or less reliable older coal and gas plants  (1.7 GW of which are slated for retirement this year) is unable to meet demand.\nFor the first time, Texas is also recruiting a material volume  of battery storage capacity to join peaker plants in balancing the Texas grid. Over  one-third of all U.S. utility-scale battery storage installations this year  will be in Texas, adding 3 GW of dispatchable power to the state. Combined with  new gas-fired units and other efforts to ensure sufficient capacity during severe  weather conditions, this should help mitigate some of the state\u2019s recent challenges  regarding grid stability.\nThermal outages less severe in recent winter blast\nDuring the most recent winter storm in Texas, Winter Storm  Heather, thermal outages were only 4.3 GW when temperatures hit their coldest  on Jan. 15, compared with 7.1 GW on Dec. 23, 2022, the previous Texas cold  front, Winter Storm Elliot (Chart 3). Thermal outages are forced  resource outages at gas, coal and nuclear power plants for unexpected  malfunctions or quick repairs and maintenance.\n\nThe lower outages were due in part to changes made by the state  legislature after the catastrophic Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. Measures  that helped included requiring weatherization of power generation facilities,  ensuring power was prioritized for critical energy infrastructure like oil and  natural gas field operations and pipelines, and enhanced communication between  different Texas agencies. \nBattery Electric Vehicles (BEV)\nElectric car sales growing\nOne increasing source of electrical demand is electric  vehicles. Global EV sales increased from 10.3 million in 2022 to 13.6 million  in 2023, a 32 percent increase (Chart 4). The U.S. saw the largest  percent increase (60 percent), increasing from 1 million to 1.6 million cars  sold. \n\nOn a monthly basis though, EV sales were down 70 percent  from January to December 2023, reflecting subsidy cuts in Germany and France  and lower demand in China. Germany announced the termination of its BEV subsidy  of up to $4,878 to help mitigate the nation\u2019s budget deficit. The French  government cut a subsidy for purchasing EV and hybrid vehicles for higher-income  buyers by 20 percent. \nMarket penetration has been more limited in the U.S. versus Europe and China. In 2023, 25 percent of all cars sold in China were EVs, 22 percent were in the European Union and 9 percent were in the U.S. In the first six months of 2023, the average retail EV price in China was $33,000, while in the U.S. it was $72,000. In Europe, the average price of an EV is similar to that in the U.S. at $71,000, but EV buyers in Europe enjoy many benefits such as lower registration taxes, exemptions from tolls and congestion charges, and subsidies for home-charging installation.\nWest Coast leads U.S. in EV sales \nDuring the first three quarters of 2023, 26 percent of all  vehicle sales in California were EVs, while only 1 percent of sales in North  Dakota were (Chart 5). Texas\u2019 sales came in at 6 percent of the market,  3 percent below the national average. Washington saw the greatest increase in  EV market share year over year, with a 7.6 percent increase in September 2023.  Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia increased their EV market share  by 2 percent or more from third quarter 2022 to third quarter 2023. \n\nGlobal emissions\nIn 2023, a net decline in global CO2 emissions  from combustion of 411 metric tons in the U.S. and European Union was offset by  an increase of 736 metric tons in China and India (Chart 6). In advanced  economies, emissions fell by 4.5 percent, driven by growth in renewables and  increases in energy-efficiency measures. \n\nQuestions can be addressed to Kenya Schott at kenya.schott@dal.frb.org.

The airport is also recycling and reusing construction waste, including 86,000 tons of crushed concrete for new airport roads.\n\nThe 2030 Challenge aims for the airport to be carbon-neutral by 2030, with a 90% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025. The new terminal will have energy-consumption performance standards. The construction timeline includes significant milestones from 2021 to 2023, with foundation work completed by January 2023.\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s history as a steel city is honored in the new terminal\u2019s design, featuring steel tree columns and other elements that evoke the city\u2019s industrial past. The steel used in the terminal is fabricated locally in Ambridge, PA. The airport also recruited artists to create an exhibition honoring the steel industry.\n\nPittsburgh has made strides in sustainability, with various initiatives and programs from the Department of City Planning, Sustainable Pittsburgh, and local universities. The terminal modernization project is another step toward a more sustainable city.\n\nThe new terminal will feature large windows for natural light, outdoor terraces with local flora, and a private microgrid with nearly 10,000 solar panels and five natural-gas generators. This microgrid, operational since June 2021, powers the existing facility and will power the new terminal, saving over $1 million annually in utility costs and reducing carbon emissions by over 6 million pounds annually.\n\nThe project is funded through long-term bonds, airport revenues, and other sources, with no local tax dollars involved. The architecture and engineering teams of Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects are leading the project, ensuring international best practices while maintaining local characteristics.\n\nThe Allegheny County Airport Authority engaged the community and airlines to determine the best course of action for the terminal project, incorporating feedback from various stakeholders. The project aims to be an example of how sustainability, economic growth, customer satisfaction, and local pride can coexist.\n\nRose Morrison is a freelance writer with a passion for sustainable building and innovative construction technologies.",

Logan Our people Transparency Speeches Connect with us Energy Indicators March 13, 2024 Coal power usage continues to decline in Texas. Solar power will be roughly half of all new electric-generation additions in both Texas and the U.S. in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Weatherization over the last couple of years has significantly improved grid stability in Texas. Global electric vehicle (EV) sales grew in 2023, with China accounting for over half of those sales. In the U.S., the West Coast dominated EV purchases last year. Finally, global CO2 emissions rose in 2023, largely driven by coal use in China and India. Electrical demand Coal power down; wind power up The Electric Reliability Council of Texas\u2019 (ERCOT) net power generation rose from 429 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2022 to 444 TWh in 2023 (Chart 1). Among lower-carbon power sources, generation from nuclear plants has been hovering around 40 TWh since 2007, while wind and solar output rose by 99 TWh during the same time frame. Utility-scale solar generation swelled to 32 TWh in 2023 from zero in 2015. Natural gas made up 47 percent of the 290 TWh of thermal generation (coal, natural gas and nuclear) in 2007; coal was 39 percent. In 2023, natural gas provided 66 percent of the 303 TWh of thermal power, and coal was 20 percent. Solar power capacity growth to outpace other sources About half of new U.S. planned grid additions will come from solar power in 2024, according to the EIA (Chart 2). A total of 55.8 gigawatts (GW) of name-plate generation capacity will be added in 2024, including 26.4 GW of solar (47 percent), 13.4 GW of wind (24 percent) and 8.2 GW of battery storage (15 percent). Solar will see more than half of its new capacity in three states: Texas, California and Florida. Natural gas\u00ad will add 7.5 GW (13 percent of new generation capacity) to the grid. This will be the lowest new natural gas capacity in 25 years. In addition, 4.7 GW of coal and natural gas capacity is expected to be retired nationwide in 2024. However, due to the intermittent nature of renewables like wind and solar and variations in demand for thermal power over the course of the day and year, total output potential from these sources will be much less than the total capacity. In 2023, installed utility-scale solar capacity was 690 TWh, while generation was only 162 TWh. The ratio of the two\u2014the capacity factor\u2014was 23 percent in 2023 and 34 percent for wind. The average capacity factor for natural gas was 41 percent. Half of Texas\u2019 new generation capacity in 2024 will be solar, matching that of the U.S.\u2019 Already a global leader in wind-power production, wind will only make up 10 percent of the state\u2019s additions versus 24 percent nationally. Texas will also see the addition of 3.5 GW of natural-gas-fired turbines, nearly half that of the nation. Most of these gas plants are peakers\u2014turbines optimized to flex up and down when demand spikes or when output from other sources like intermittent renewables or less reliable older coal and gas plants (1.7 GW of which are slated for retirement this year) is unable to meet demand. For the first time, Texas is also recruiting a material volume of battery storage capacity to join peaker plants in balancing the Texas grid. Over one-third of all U.S. utility-scale battery storage installations this year will be in Texas, adding 3 GW of dispatchable power to the state. Combined with new gas-fired units and other efforts to ensure sufficient capacity during severe weather conditions, this should help mitigate some of the state\u2019s recent challenges regarding grid stability. Thermal outages less severe in recent winter blast During the most recent winter storm in Texas, Winter Storm Heather, thermal outages were only 4.3 GW when temperatures hit their coldest on Jan. 15, compared with 7.1 GW on Dec. 23, 2022, the previous Texas cold front, Winter Storm Elliot (Chart 3). Thermal outages are forced resource outages at gas, coal and nuclear power plants for unexpected malfunctions or quick repairs and maintenance. The lower outages were due in part to changes made by the state legislature after the catastrophic Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. Measures that helped included requiring weatherization of power generation facilities, ensuring power was prioritized for critical energy infrastructure like oil and natural gas field operations and pipelines, and enhanced communication between different Texas agencies. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) Electric car sales growing One increasing source of electrical demand is electric vehicles. Global EV sales increased from 10.3 million in 2022 to 13.6 million in 2023, a 32 percent increase (Chart 4). The U.S. saw the largest percent increase (60 percent), increasing from 1 million to 1.6 million cars sold. On a monthly basis though, EV sales were down 70 percent from January to December 2023, reflecting subsidy cuts in Germany and France and lower demand in China. Germany announced the termination of its BEV subsidy of up to $4,878 to help mitigate the nation\u2019s budget deficit. The French government cut a subsidy for purchasing EV and hybrid vehicles for higher-income buyers by 20 percent. Market penetration has been more limited in the U.S. versus Europe and China. In 2023, 25 percent of all cars sold in China were EVs, 22 percent were in the European Union and 9 percent were in the U.S. In the first six months of 2023, the average retail EV price in China was $33,000, while in the U.S. it was $72,000. In Europe, the average price of an EV is similar to that in the U.S. at $71,000, but EV buyers in Europe enjoy many benefits such as lower registration taxes, exemptions from tolls and congestion charges, and subsidies for home-charging installation. West Coast leads U.S. in EV sales During the first three quarters of 2023, 26 percent of all vehicle sales in California were EVs, while only 1 percent of sales in North Dakota were (Chart 5). Texas\u2019 sales came in at 6 percent of the market, 3 percent below the national average. Washington saw the greatest increase in EV market share year over year, with a 7.6 percent increase in September 2023. Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia increased their EV market share by 2 percent or more from third quarter 2022 to third quarter 2023. Global emissions In 2023, a net decline in global CO2 emissions from combustion of 411 metric tons in the U.S. and European Union was offset by an increase of 736 metric tons in China and India (Chart 6). In advanced economies, emissions fell by 4.5 percent, driven by growth in renewables and increases in energy-efficiency measures.

For decades, the industry has been an important contributor to Europe\u2019s economic growth, innovation, and prosperity, accounting for almost 7 percent of the region\u2019s GDP and being directly or indirectly responsible for employing almost 14 million people.1\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, European Commission, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d ACEA, September 1, 2022; 25 actions for a successful restart of the EU\u2019s automotive sector, CLEPA, May 2020. The industry also carries significant symbolic weight; taglines such as \u201cMade in Germany,\u201d \u201cItalian car design,\u201d \u201cEuro NCAP for Saver Cars,\u201d and \u201cBritish racing\u201d have come to stand for European innovation and craftsmanship.\nHowever, the status quo is being challenged and the industry faces massive ongoing transformations, such as the shift from internal combustion engines to electrified powertrains and a shift in focus from hardware to differentiation through software. This dynamic has allowed new entrants in Europe and abroad\u2014especially in China, the largest automotive market in the world2\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d China - Country Commercial Guide, International Trade Administration, updated April 7, 2023.\u2014to disrupt the market and win market share. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports for the first time, with exports of about 3.0 million vehicles, in contrast to Germany\u2019s 2.6 million.3\u201cWhat if Germany stopped making cars?,\u201d Economist, July 31, 2023. These transformative forces overlap with a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, including rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. All of these factors have greatly affected the European auto industry and make navigating the sector\u2019s transformation challenging. A prosperous future for the European automotive industry will therefore depend on how well and quickly it responds and how European stakeholders can shape the necessary conditions for future success. The need for action is urgent.\nTo that end, we have sketched a road map that covers seven areas. Executing on this plan will require action from a variety of industry stakeholders. Speedy action from automotive companies will be important, but the regional ecosystem, including the public sector and multiple adjacent sectors, will need to participate in shaping a level playing field and a fertile environment for the future of the European automotive industry.\nA multidecade success story\nThe European automotive industry has been an engine powering prosperity and growth, employment, and innovation and has contributed to Europe\u2019s image and perception on the global stage (Exhibit 1).\nAn economic powerhouse for the region, the automotive industry contributed about 10 percent of Europe\u2019s exports in 2022.425 actions for a successful restart, May 2020; \u201cEuropean Union exports by category,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023. The sector\u2019s more than 17,300 companies form a network of OEMs and suppliers of all tiers.5\u201cImpact of electromobility on the European automotive industry,\u201d HitHorizons, February 21, 2022. Significantly, the industry directly or indirectly employs more than 6 percent of the region\u2019s workforce,6\u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d September 1, 2022. creating positive spillover effects outside the sector.\nThe automotive industry has also been a nexus of innovation. Technical champions and small and medium-size businesses within the ecosystem have continuously innovated, especially in the areas of combustion engine powertrain, chassis, safety systems, and exterior and interior design. Indeed, about 30 percent of global automotive patents originated from European countries, the most of any region.7McKinsey analysis based on data about automotive industry global patents from IPlytics and Innography by Clarivate, accessed June 12, 2023. Significant investments into research and development have helped European automakers introduce new technologies that have contributed to major advances in sustainability and safety by improving fuel economies and reducing emissions, noise, and accidents.\nProgress and investment in the European auto industry over the past several decades have contributed to Europe\u2019s global image. German engineering is widely touted,8Dave Taylor, \u201cWho owns the idea of German engineering among German car brands?,\u201d Taylor Brand Group, April 8, 2013. and our research suggests many European automakers are considered front-runners in sustainability, with some of the most ambitious targets around electric vehicles (EVs), decarbonization, and safety.\nThanks in part to this work, the brand value of the ten largest European auto companies is conservatively estimated at a combined \u20ac200 billion; five of the ten most valuable car brands worldwide are European.9\u201cLargest automakers by market capitalization,\u201d CompaniesMarketcap.com, accessed August 15, 2023; brand value analysis based on 2023 data on European automotive companies from Brand Finance, accessed June 20, 2023; Alex Haigh, \u201c2022 Automotive industry trends: Doubling down on electric and connected cars,\u201d Brand Finance, February 22, 2022. The grand challenge now is to maintain and build on these assets in the face of profound and accelerating change.\nDisruption and transformation\nThe historic strengths and recently reported record margins of European OEMs may create a false sense of safety for the industry. Accelerated disruptions around electrification, software, and new competitive pressures loom.\nSubstantial market disruptions have been observed in other industries, with serious outcomes. For instance, European manufacturers lost more than 90 percent of their share of the smartphone market in just six years.10\u201cGlobal market share held by Nokia smartphones from 1st quarter 2007 to 2nd quarter 2013,\u201d Statista Research Department, July 25, 2013. McKinsey analysis shows that leading players in the film camera industry lost similar market share over nine years.\nMarket share data suggest that European OEMs\u2019 leadership position is being challenged as new entrants, especially from China, gain traction. Our analysis also suggests that European market conditions for local development and production are becoming less competitive. Analysis from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility shows that since 2019, European incumbents have lost six percentage points of market share in their home market and five percentage points in China. Meanwhile, Chinese OEMs are gaining ground in both China and Europe, reaching 45 percent market share in their home market in 2022 and octupling their market share in Europe between 2020 and 2022.11McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. This dynamic is even more apparent in battery electric vehicles (BEVs): new EV-focused entrants hold 51 percent of the global BEV market (Exhibit 2).12McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. Besides market share, European OEMs also face the challenge of running profitable BEV businesses.\nA more detailed look at different segments offers a more nuanced picture of the industry. In the premium segment\u2014home turf for many European OEMs\u2014European OEMs still hold 71 percent of global sales. But this segment is also becoming more challenging to hold: newcomers claimed 18 percent of the premium market in 2022.13McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023.\nThis shake-up stems from the fast pace of change in the industry. The transition from internal-combustion-engine (ICE) to zero-emissions vehicles is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80 percent per year since 2020. McKinsey analysis suggests that many global mobility markets will reach near-total EV penetration by the mid-2030s. In response, European OEMs have announced ambitious electrification plans to launch more than 150 EV models through 2030, according to McKinsey analysis.\nThe EV transition drives the industry\u2019s emphasis away from hardware toward software and digital. According to our analysis, EV consumers are more than twice as likely to switch brands for better in-vehicle technology, such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) features and connectivity services. Our research shows that successful automakers are developing cars defined by software, resulting in a tripling of software content per vehicle since 2015.\nWith electrified, software-defined cars becoming the norm, semiconductors and batteries are the new industry control points. In fact, more than a third of the value of a BEV is associated with the battery. Consequently, the European supplier landscape is changing rapidly, and new capabilities are needed in development and manufacturing.\nRecently, software development and hardware development are increasingly decoupling. We\u2019ve observed that European suppliers have become proficient at the interaction between software and hardware in the context of specific control units that oversee specific components of a car, such as the engine or transmission. Modern vehicles may have as many as 150 control units in a distributed software architecture. Hardware and software will increasingly decouple as software becomes more centralized into domains such as the powertrain and in-vehicle connectivity\u2014and, eventually, into computers that oversee zones of the vehicle rather than components.\nAs a result of this shift toward more centralized computing, portions of vehicles may become commoditized, and scale and incremental improvements may become the main drivers of competitiveness. As a result, several component markets increasingly resemble the smartphone industry, in which the core differentiator is software innovation\u2014in addition to economies of scale, industrial excellence, and quality in hardware. McKinsey analysis suggests that the number of build-to-print suppliers (which manufacture products and components to customers\u2019 detailed engineering instructions) in the automotive industry that provide components such as power electronics will increase. We\u2019ve found that about a third of OEMs\u2019 requests for quotes in some powertrain components and systems are already build-to-print requests.\nNew entrants are moving to supply the automotive market with critical future technologies such as batteries, semiconductors, and software. Traditional suppliers find themselves sandwiched between \u201chigh-tech commodity\u201d companies that provide semiconductors and batteries upstream and cost-pressured incumbent OEMs downstream. This dynamic threatens European supply chains. Consider that the current battery value chain is largely controlled by Chinese companies (Exhibit 3).\nTo counteract these developments and form a strong supply network like the one Europe created during the ICE era, major industry participants are announcing strategic partnerships to secure access to resources and manufacturing capacity, especially for batteries and semiconductors. For example, some incumbents plan to strengthen their control over critical portions of the value chain by partnering with mine operators or even acquiring stakes in mines.14\u201cFactbox: Automakers accelerate drive to secure battery raw materials,\u201d Reuters, April 3, 2023; Victoria Waldersee, \u201cVolkswagen to invest in mines in bid to become global battery supplier,\u201d Reuters, March 17, 2023. While these actions are steps in the right direction, the projected supply and capacity are not yet enough to meet the region\u2019s forecast demand by 2030. Accelerated efforts are necessary.\nMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\nIn a perfect storm for the European auto industry, the current macroeconomic climate is turbulent, with multiple ongoing crises. Compared with other regions, Europe is particularly exposed and affected, and the automotive sector is at a disadvantage compared with other important industries. These challenges fall into five major areas:\nEnergy and resources. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe have surged to twice the costs in the United States and triple costs in China.1McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cChina electricity prices,\u201d GlobalPetrolPrices.com, December 2022; \u201cMidwest Information Office: Average energy prices for the United States, regions, census divisions, and selected metropolitan areas,\u201d US Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed August 17, 2023; and \u201cElectricity price statistics,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. This creates challenges for the auto industry, in which a significant portion of production costs come from energy requirements.\nGeopolitical tensions. The European auto industry generates a significant\u2014and higher compared with other regions\u2014share of its revenues through exports,2McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cInternational trade in cars,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. which means current geopolitical pressures have an outsize impact on European automakers.\nSupply chain challenges. Compared with other industries, the auto industry relies more heavily on timely deliveries of parts and components from international markets. The European auto industry is therefore at considerable risk when finely tuned international supply chains are disrupted.\nInflation. Inflation has hit Europe much more severely than the United States or China, with labor costs for European automakers disproportionately affected compared with other industries.3\u201cConsumer prices up 4.9 percent from April 2022 to April 2023,\u201d\u00a0TED: The Economics Daily, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, May 15, 2023.\nProductivity crisis. Europe\u2019s productivity and economic growth lag behind those of its peers, particularly in areas such as software engineering in which the auto industry needs significant additional capacity.4\u201cUnited States full year GDP growth,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cPriority reforms key for sustaining growth and achieving China\u2019s long-term goals - World Bank report,\u201d World Bank, June 14, 2023.\nFinally, these transformative forces overlap with a European macroeconomic environment that has a particularly acute impact on the region\u2019s auto industry (see sidebar \u201cMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\u201d).\nRoad map for the European automotive industry\nThe European auto industry is in the midst of the greatest change in its history. In service of helping the industry remain globally competitive we outline a road map of seven pillars for stakeholders to act on (Exhibit 4). The time to act is now: according to our analysis, European automotive OEMs and suppliers earn about three times the revenue of their Chinese counterparts and five times the EBIT, which means the European industry can act from a position of strength.\nA rapid response from OEMs and suppliers in the European auto industry will be important. But other stakeholders\u2014including adjacent industries such as the energy, research, and public sectors\u2014would also need to act collaboratively to provide an environment that enables success for the European automotive industry (and mobility ecosystem) of the future. In short, the ecosystem approach that made Europe strong in the ICE era has to be translated to serve the era of software-defined, electrified cars.\nRevive strengths in customer understanding, product design, and brand\nThe European automotive industry will need to extend its legacy of cutting-edge product design and superior brand value and transfer it into the new context of software-defined electric vehicles.\nOf the 25 global brands with the highest brand value, all but three are European.15\u201cLuxury & premium 2023 ranking,\u201d Brandirectory, Brand Finance, accessed August 15, 2023. Our data show that brand remains among the top five purchase criteria for European, American, and Chinese auto consumers. However, in the age of electrification and software-defined cars, purchase criteria will change and brand rankings might get reshuffled.\nTo maintain superior brand value, European incumbent OEMs would need to analyze and understand customer needs and preferences to build desirable products. Traditional consumer segmentation would need to be adapted for the era of software-defined electric vehicles, with more-detailed consumer profiles and more-granular user profiles. Owning and analyzing consumer data will enable OEMs to offer tailored mobility solutions and seamlessly engage consumers across the life cycle. They can also build their product development organizations to reflect customer journeys and experiences, which would bring operational roles closer to the customer. As consumers\u2019 desires change and technology advances, OEMs would need to continuously update their software remotely to bring the most up-to-date functionality to customers and meet their needs.\nFocus relentlessly on cost and speed\nMcKinsey research from 2022 shows that the vehicle purchase price is the most important buying factor for consumers across markets.16Annual MCFM Consumer Survey 2022, McKinsey Center for Future Mobility, global n = 27,869, December 2022. Particularly in EVs, Chinese OEMs can turn their cost advantage into a competitive edge: our analysis shows that their costs are 20 to 30 percent lower than those of European OEMs.\nTo catch up, European OEMs could drive down costs strategically. According to our analysis, European OEMs could close up to 20 percentage points of the cost gap by adopting structural product design, vertically integrating battery production, scaling EV production, and improving productivity. For example, battery insourcing could decrease European OEMs\u2019 costs by three percentage points, and cost-efficient battery cell chemistry alternatives could save five to six percentage points for some vehicles and segments. As for the remaining 5 to 10 percentage-point cost gap, European OEMs could identify differentiating features that consumers would be willing to pay a premium for, such as brand differentiation; environmental, social, and governance (ESG) leadership; and superior safety performance.\nSpeed is another consideration. McKinsey analysis shows that European OEMs have a long development cycle compared with competitors from other regions, with concept-to-pilot phases lasting up to four years. By contrast, we\u2019ve found that the fastest automakers in China need only 21 months to move from concept to pilot, allowing them to respond to market trends much more quickly.\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not necessarily appropriate to make direct comparisons between the Chinese and European automotive sectors or development cycles. However, European OEMs should take on the challenge and redesign their own processes to accelerate innovation, development, and industrialization. For instance, the product design process could be accelerated through iterative styling methods. Subsequent product development could be optimized by decoupling hardware and software development and by applying agile principles to software development. Across all processes, co-locating cross-domain teams and setting up task forces for products that are behind schedule or components with supply bottlenecks can further accelerate development.\nExecute a winning strategy for the Chinese market\nOur research shows China will remain the biggest automotive market in the future, which means winning in China will be important for European OEMs and suppliers that want to play a globally relevant role.\nEuropean incumbents have lost five percentage points of market share in China since 2019, a substantial decrease. Meanwhile, our analysis shows that Chinese automakers are outpacing their competitors and have gained more than ten percentage points of market share in China, driven by their hold on more than 80 percent of the EV market.17McKinsey analysis based on global passenger-car sales data from IHS Markit, 2002\u201322, accessed May 20, 2023.\nHow have they done it? Chinese OEMs offer significantly lower price points, and their products are more appealing and tailored to Chinese consumers\u2019 needs and preferences. They also bring targeted innovations to market rapidly; our research shows that more than 70 percent of new vehicles unveiled at the Shanghai auto show in April 2023 came from Chinese OEMs.\nLike their OEM counterparts, European automotive suppliers have a hard time gaining traction with Chinese EV players, especially for EV powertrain components and systems. While Western suppliers have held more than half of China\u2019s ICE powertrain market, they hold less than 5 percent of the EV powertrain market.18McKinsey analysis based on IHS Markit Production Forecast, number of model launches by powertrain for Aion, BMW, BYD, Mercedes-Benz, NIO, Tesla, Volkswagen and Xpeng, data as of 2022, accessed June 10, 2023.\nEuropean OEMs and suppliers would need a fundamental strategic overhaul to regain competitiveness in China and meet the preferences of Chinese customers. This starts with developing products specifically tailored for the Chinese market. According to our research, the average customer in China is 34 years old, compared with 58 in Europe. These consumers have significantly different purchasing criteria. For instance, Chinese consumers place higher value on cutting-edge technology, connectivity, advanced driver assistance systems, and on-board multimedia screens than European and American consumers do. Chinese car buyers also favor simplified vehicle choices with preconfigured options.19Thomas Fang, Mingyu Guan, Bill Peng, and Tony Zhou, \u201cMcKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2023,\u201d July 14, 2023.\nTo implement a \u201clocal for local\u201d strategy\u2014in which R&D, production, and distribution are in close proximity to where products will be bought and used\u2014European players would need to adjust their operating models for the Chinese market. For example, OEMs could localize research and development capabilities and transfer decision rights to local management. Entering local partnerships across the portfolio and supply chain will also be essential to develop a strong foothold in China and to benefit from the know-how and reputations of local partners.\nCreate resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains\nTo reduce bottlenecks and dependencies, the industry will need resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains centered on batteries, semiconductors, and green materials. In 2021, the chip crisis led to a loss of ten million vehicles in global production,20\u201cS&P Global Mobility on short- & long-term impact from chip shortage,\u201d Auto Remarketing, July 14, 2023. highlighting a need to increase supply chain resilience.\nTo create resilient supply, localization is vital. We project that the European supply\u2013demand gap for batteries will reach almost 40 percent, or 500 gigawatt-hours (GWh), by 2030. To cover European battery demand locally, an additional 20 gigafactories, a \u20ac35 billion investment, would be needed.21McKinsey Battery Insights analysis assumes a 500-GWh supply\u2013demand gap and average capital expenditures of \u20ac70 million per gigawatt hour in Europe. This leads to a \u20ac35 million investment need, in addition to the already announced \u20ac70 million for planned and existing factories in Europe. The continent would also need 37 new semiconductor fabs to cover local demand, requiring a \u20ac190 billion investment.22Annual report 2020: The automotive industry in facts and figures, Verband der Automobilindustrie, 2020. As a first step, the European Chips Act will provide \u20ac43 billion in subsidies. Next steps could involve expanding the ecosystem along the value chain while safeguarding crucial supplies, with tactics such as increasing safety stock and implementing dual-sourcing strategies.\nAt least in the midterm, improving the circularity of supply chains will further decrease Europe\u2019s dependence on raw materials and components from other regions while increasing sustainability. It could also increase the share of local added value in critical EV components and create additional jobs and economic growth. Our analysis shows that reusing materials from scrapped batteries can also save up to 10 percent of costs and avoid 20 percent of the CO2 required in production. To implement a circular value chain, industry stakeholders would need to commit to the use of recycled content and material efficiency and establish reverse operations at end of life.\nEnd-to-end transparency on ESG criteria such as digital traceability is an important way to make critical supply chains more sustainable. As sustainability standards in key industries begin to develop\u2014consider the launch of the battery passport, which contains ESG data for batteries23\u201cAction partnerships: Battery passport,\u201d Global Battery Alliance, accessed August 15, 2023.\u2014the European auto industry should stay at the forefront of ESG performance to gain and maintain competitive advantage in the future.\nHyperscale competitive European battery and semiconductor players\nWe\u2019ve observed that European players are underrepresented in battery manufacturing and high-end compute and semiconductors that power artificial intelligence. According to our analysis, only one European manufacturer is among the top ten in terms of market capitalization for battery manufacturing, while in semiconductors, Europe needs to close the capability gap for the next wave of computing to deliver functionalities such as ADAS.\nA path to creating an ecosystem of technology champions consists of three elements. First, Europe should consider developing a pan-European regulatory rule book to scale high-growth firms, aligning tax standards, regulations, labor rules, and bureaucratic processes. Second, to stay at the forefront of technology, the region would need to build specialized knowledge and product innovation capabilities. Suppliers could tap into niche specialties, such as more-sustainable battery refining. Finally, the European industry would need a battery and semiconductor network, similar to the one that serves the aerospace industry. European incumbents could form strategic partnerships with emerging entrants and research institutions.\nDesign a way forward for ADAS with policy support\nAdvanced driver assistance systems features are increasingly important. They are becoming a key differentiator for vehicle buyers: According to our research, 51 percent of consumers worldwide would consider switching to some form of ADAS car in the future. Competitive pressures around ADAS are also intensifying. In 2022, Mercedes-Benz was the first automotive player to introduce and certify Level 3 autonomy, the threshold at which drivers can take their hands off the wheel.24Andrew J. Hawkins, \u201cMercedes-Benz is the first to bring Level 3 automated driving to the US,\u201d Verge, January 27, 2023. Other participants in the global industry are catching up using a variety of technology approaches.\nTo remain competitive, the European industry may need to form a cross-industry alliance. Players could collaborate in two main areas. The first area is where differentiation is negligible and where there are opportunities for savings. This would include standardizing sensor communication protocols, which would simplify the integration of new sensors. Standardizing middleware (which sits between front- and back-end technologies) and layers of the operating system are other approaches.\nThe second area of collaboration is where scale and large databases could enable a faster, more robust development process for efforts including the continuous updates of software layers in maps\u2014updates such as creating high-definition map- and location-based services. A shared pool of data could also be used for AI training and validation.\nThe right regulatory environment could be critical to enable this kind of cross-industry collaboration. Public-sector stakeholders could consider adapting existing guidelines to the context of autonomous driving. These updates could encourage collaborative precompetitive research and innovation that advance and accelerate technological progress and drive standardization.\nClose the software skill gap to win the automotive digital transition\nSoftware is essential to the future of the automotive industry. But according to our analysis, only 15 to 20 percent of current R&D workers at European incumbents have software skills, compared with almost 45 percent at new entrants.\nTo shrink the gap, industry stakeholders would need to find holistic solutions. For example, European incumbents could create shared\u2014or at least interoperable\u2014software platforms across OEMs in Europe (and possibly other regions where the industry has strong partnerships) to complement individual participants\u2019 capabilities and to avoid costly solo efforts.\nEarly hiring, reskilling, and foreign talent can also help close the gap. Players can intensify early hiring directly from universities and boost STEM and software talent education through partnerships with universities and schools. Our research shows that reskilling is already in progress: 37 percent of European suppliers have ongoing reskilling efforts, and another 41 percent have plans to implement them. To draw skilled software talent from other regions, European employers would need accelerate processes around work permits and accommodate foreign talent\u2019s requirements on salary, benefits, and working conditions.\nCreating an environment that enables accelerated progress\nAbout the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility\nThese insights were developed by the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM). Since 2011, the MCFM has worked with stakeholders across the mobility ecosystem by providing independent and integrated evidence about possible future-mobility scenarios. With our unique, bottom-up modeling approach, our insights enable an end-to-end analytics journey through the future of mobility\u2014from consumer needs to modal mix across urban/rural areas, sales, value pools, and life cycle sustainability. Contact us if you are interested in getting full access to our market insights via the McKinsey Mobility Insights Portal.\nEuropean automotive players are moving in the right direction but should consider scaling and accelerating their efforts. To accomplish this, a wide variety of stakeholders in the region would need to create an environment that breeds progress and future wins for the region\u2019s automotive industry. The formula requires a road map, catalysts, and platforms for cooperation.\nA clear road map such as the one we outline is needed to help accelerate the European automotive industry\u2019s progress. Its seven pillars would need to be converted into actionable measures and quantifiable targets for industry stakeholders\u2014suppliers, OEMs, players from adjacent industries, and regulatory bodies. Associations could take on a coordinating role.\nCatalysts play a significant role in implementing the road map. One is a competitive regulatory environment. Clearly defining and communicating common standards and codifying interoperability across all elements of the road map is likely to be critical.\nAnother critical catalyst of the European industry\u2019s transition is EV infrastructure. According to our analysis, the industry will need a cumulative \u20ac300 billion worth of infrastructure investments in electricity generation, the electricity grid, EV chargers, and hydrogen refueling systems through 2030.25European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. European stakeholders have begun to install public chargers at a pace of 2,000 charging points per week.26European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. But to meet demand, decision makers would need to build out charging infrastructure to the tune of 6,000 to 14,000 charging points per week.27European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. We found that the wind and solar assets required to fulfill the corresponding demand for energy with renewable sources would require four times as many workers in Europe by 2030 than are currently available.\nFinally, the industry would need platforms for collaboration. As industry boundaries are redefined, three kinds of partnership will become more important: horizontal partnerships between entities in the same parts of the value chain (such as multiple car companies) for efforts such as software development or to gain a solid footing in the Chinese market; vertical partnerships between entities in different parts of the value chain (such as car companies with tech companies) to secure access to technology and talent; and cross-industry partnerships, such as collaborations between automotive players and utilities to facilitate structural goals such as seamless sector coupling.\nOur road map shows a way forward for a globally competitive European auto industry. The work will require action from an expansive array of regional stakeholders and a supportive administrative environment. Time is of the essence.\nAndreas Cornet and Andreas Tschiesner are senior partners in McKinsey\u2019s Munich office, where Patrick Schaufuss is a partner; Ruth Heuss is a senior partner in the Berlin office.\nThe authors wish to thank Ondrej Burkacky, Julian Conzade, Johannes Deichmann, Lauritz Fischer, Maximilian Geirhos, Marco Groth, Volker Gr\u00fcntges, Antonia Gutzler, Martin Hattrup-Silberberg, Martin Kellner, Martin Linder, Nicoline L\u00fchrs, Lukas Michor, Jan Paulitschek, and Kirsten Weerda for their contributions to this report.",

    "Summarized_Document1": "The European automotive industry is a significant contributor to the region's economy, accounting for nearly 7% of GDP and employing around 14 million people. However, it faces challenges such as the shift to electrified powertrains, software differentiation, and competition from new entrants, particularly from China. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports, with 3.0 million vehicles compared to Germany's 2.6 million. Rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions further complicate the industry's landscape.The industry has historically been a hub of innovation, with 30% of global automotive patents originating from Europe. Investments in R&D have led to advancements in sustainability and safety. The brand value of the top ten European auto companies is estimated at \u20ac200 billion, with five of the ten most valuable car brands being European.Despite these strengths, the industry is undergoing significant disruptions. European OEMs have lost market share to Chinese competitors, particularly in battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The transition to EVs is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80% annually since 2020. European OEMs have announced plans to launch over 150 EV models by 2030.The shift to software-defined vehicles is also crucial, with semiconductors and batteries becoming key components. European suppliers need to adapt to this change, as modern vehicles may have up to 150 control units. The industry must also address supply chain challenges, particularly in batteries and semiconductors, to remain competitive.Macroeconomic challenges such as high energy costs, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and a productivity crisis further impact the industry. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe are twice those in the U.S. and triple those in China, affecting production costs.To navigate these challenges, a road map with seven pillars is proposed: understanding customer needs, focusing on cost and speed, executing a winning strategy for the Chinese market, creating resilient supply chains, developing competitive battery and semiconductor players, advancing ADAS with policy support, and closing the software skill gap.European OEMs need to localize R&D and production in China, develop products tailored to Chinese consumers, and form strategic partnerships. Resilient supply chains require localization, circularity, and sustainability. The industry needs significant investments in battery and semiconductor manufacturing to meet future demand.Collaboration across the industry and with adjacent sectors is essential. A competitive regulatory environment and substantial investments in EV infrastructure are critical. The industry must also focus on software skills, with only 15-20% of current R&D workers having software expertise compared to 45% at new entrants.In summary, the European automotive industry must act swiftly and collaboratively to maintain its global competitiveness in the face of profound changes and challenges.",

    "Document1": "Sustainability and the Steel City: Modernization at Pittsburgh International Airport\nA rendering of the view future travelers will see when they approach the new terminal. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nFlying is essential for work, vacation or visiting loved ones. The industry also is necessary to ship goods overseas quickly. However, it\u2019s not known for being environmentally friendly. One airport is seeking to change that.\nAviation contributes 3.5 percent of effective radiative forcing (which measures energy imbalance), 2.5 percent of carbon emissions and 1.9 percent of all greenhouse gas output. So there\u2019s a strong push to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel, starting at the airport.\nPittsburgh\u2019s Terminal Modernization\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s Terminal Modernization Program is a $1.4 billion project to create a new consolidated terminal that modernizes outdated former hub facilities, better serves passengers, fuels the region\u2019s future development, stabilizes long-term costs for airlines and evokes the essence of Pittsburgh. The new multi-modal complex will feature a new garage that nearly triples the amount of covered parking.\nThe PIT Terminal Modernization Program (TMP) was built upon these five principles that represent fundamental purposes driving the transformation:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0Stabilize\u00a0airline costs\n2.\u00a0 Be\u00a0Pittsburgh\u2019s airport\n3.\u00a0 Be environmentally\u00a0sustainable\n4.\u00a0\u00a0Enhance the experience\u00a0for all customers\n5.\u00a0 Provide\u00a0value\u00a0to our\u00a0community\n\u00a0\nCranes install steel beams as part of the terminal modernization program.(triblive.com)\n1. Airport Modernization\nThe new terminal will be between the C and D airside gate concourses, eliminating the need for the people mover train. The new facility will cater to passengers flying directly to and from Pittsburgh (origin and destination traffic) as opposed to the existing facility which was largely built as a hub facility focused on connecting traffic.\n2. Improved Experience\nThe layout should make navigating the airport quicker and easier. It will slash passengers\u2019 time from curbside to airside in half. Aesthetic improvements will enhance everyone\u2019s experience, and new outdoor terraces (pre- and post-security) will make it easier for travelers to relax before boarding their flight.\n3. Increased Area Value\nAirports raise the value of the area around them by encouraging economic growth and adding convenience for potential new residents. The terminal modernization brings more than 14,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities to the region. Currently, about 550 construction workers are onsite daily, and that number will increase to 1,000 daily workers in summer 2023.\n4. Stabilized Airline Costs\nAirport efficiency can impact the costs of airlines. The expansion will allow airlines to better process and load luggage as well as welcome passengers. It also lowers long-term O&M costs.\n5. More Sustainable Terminal\nConstruction practices for the new terminal comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Environmental Program Declaration (EPD) credit for their materials while also working to reduce emissions, water, energy and waste. Officials are targeting a minimum of LEED Silver certification for the facility.\nVendors are strongly encouraged to present products and services that comply with verified third-party certification criteria or reporting standards. The airport also urges them to source their products or materials regionally to decrease the impact on the environment and human health compared to similar vendors in other locations.\nAdvantus Engineers is collaborating with other teams and implementing sustainable practices such as water and energy efficiency, using sustainable materials, managing waste, employing electric transportation methods, and promoting healthy indoor environments.\nAdditionally, the airport is recycling and reusing construction waste, including 86,000 tons of crushed concrete for new airport roads.\nThe 2030 Challenge\nPart of constructing the new terminal is moving the airport closer to achieving the 2030 Challenge, an environmental initiative to go carbon-neutral by that year.\nThe suggested plan by Architecture 2030 is to decrease 90 percent of carbon emissions by 2025 and be 100 percent carbon neutral by 2030. New buildings, renovations and additions throughout the new terminal will have energy-consumption performance standards.\nA Timeline for Construction 2021\nApril:\u00a0Officials added safe driving lanes and barricades between concourses C and D. Saw-cutting began on the ramp to remove slabs.\nMay:\u00a0To prepare for the new terminal\u2019s foundation, 300,000 square feet of material were removed.\nJune:\u00a0An impact roller broke up large concrete sections to crush into smaller aggregate for reuse in new roadways.\nJuly:\u00a0Construction teams modified an underground fuel line for future use.\nAugust and September:\u00a0Team members began installation of electrical lines, construction trailers and underground utility work. Geotechnical borings for probe holes and test piles began for terminal foundation work.\nOctober:\u00a0A groundbreaking ceremony began heavy construction.\nNovember and December:\u00a0Foundation support drilling started after test borings. Mass excavation began and utility line work continued. About 85,000 tons of concrete was removed and crushed for new roads.\n2022\nJanuary: Team members\u00a0almost complete the auger cast piles and finish about 25 percent of the structural caissons. Approximately 400 cubic yards of concrete were used for foundation pile caps.\nFebruary:\u00a0Drilling operations continued for more than half of the caissons, and auger piles were nearly completed. More than half the cubic yards of concrete for pile caps were placed, and more than 75 percent of structural steel came onto the fabrication site.\nMarch:\u00a0Installation of the first steel beams and girders. Members positioned and embedded plate girders while work was finished on terminal caissons.\nApril:\u00a0Pile cap and grade beam installation continued. Terminal bridge foundations laid, and road modifications began.\nMay:\u00a0Three-quarters of the pole caps installation was completed. Rebar for underground foundations and the front bridge terminal foundations were installed.\nJune:\u00a0Crews continued to install rebar and lifted steel beams over the train tunnel.\nJuly:\u00a0More than half of the grade beam content and 25 of the 27 embedded plate girders were installed.\nAugust and September:\u00a0Vertical construction began, and crews completed foundation roadwork. Critical construction activities continued, with foundation and concrete work progressing. Workers installed decking, steel and detailing.\nOctober:\u00a0Backfill and excavation continued, and corridor walls were demolished. Bridge piers for elevated highways were installed.\nNovember:\u00a0Completed all structural slabs, and rebar installation continued.\nDecember:\u00a0Team members placed geoform, and tub girders arrived. The first elevated deck slab concrete was installed.\n2023\nAll foundation work was completed on the site of the new terminal at the end of January. There were multiple concrete pours, and more than half of the mechanically stabilized earth walls now are in place.\nEmbracing Pittsburgh\u2019s History\nPittsburgh\u2019s industrial nickname comes from the rise of the steel industry after the Civil War. Increased demand for armament and iron boosted the local economy. Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie introduced the Bessemer steelmaking process, which brought him from obscurity to fame.\nCarnegie began producing steel in 1875. Meanwhile, Henry Clay Frick, the grandson of whiskey distillers, made his riches operating beehive cooking ovens that could turn coal into coke\u2014an essential steelmaking ingredient. Frick later partnered with Carnegie to form Carnegie Steel Co. and, in 1901, they merged multiple companies into the United States Steel Corp.\nBefore they reached their final success, however, a dispute between Carnegie Steel and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers put a dark cloud over the area\u2019s steel production. It led to the Battle of Homestead, an armed conflict that killed 12 people. This event paved the way for modern labor practices and worker-protection laws.\nThrough the mid-1950s, Pittsburgh thrived as America\u2019s eighth-largest city and produced half of the country\u2019s steel. European immigration through Ellis Island led to a population increase of more than 500,000 individuals. The city\u2019s diversity still exists in its various neighborhoods.\nThings changed for Pittsburgh in the 1970s and 1980s when steel production slowed to a stop, and the city had to reinvent itself to survive. It\u2019s now known for technology, energy, medicine, education, research, arts, sports and advanced manufacturing. Its National Football League team, the Steelers, pays tribute to its past in the steel industry. This new terminal aims to do the same. The new terminal at PIT invokes the essence of Pittsburgh through its design focused on Nature, Technology and Community\u2014dubbed NaTeCo by the design team.\nThe terminal modernization progam will pay tribute to the city\u2019s history through art and construction. Steel tree columns are a featured part of the new terminal, creating a nostalgic and stylistic design. Their brownish color is meant to invoke importance of nature in Western Pennsylvania. All of the steel in the new terminal, procured throughout the United States, is being fabricated just 10 miles away from the airport in Ambridge, Pa.\n\n\n(Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nThe Airport Authority also recruited artists Patrick Marold and Adam Kuby to create an exhibition honoring the steel industry through sculptures and other design elements. Other artisans contribute to the terminal through PIT\u2019s Art in the Airport initiative.\nSustainability in the Steel City\nThroughout the years, Pittsburgh made strides to create a healthier, more-sustainable city. From 2015-2020, the Department of City Planning released a yearly \u201cState of Sustainability\u201d report that examined ongoing efforts to reduce waste and minimize the use of nonrenewable resources.\nNonprofit organization Sustainable Pittsburgh advocates and educates individuals and groups through various initiatives such as recognizing corporations that make efforts toward decarbonization.\nUniversities in the city also are embracing measures to create a greener city. The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University and Point Park University each have their own sustainability programs to encourage research and on-campus responsibility.\nThe terminal modernization project is another major step toward creating a Pittsburgh that lives in harmony with its environment.\nTime for an Update\nAllegheny County Airport was the first airport in the region, opening in 1931, and at the time was one of the largest and most advanced terminals of its time. The Greater Pittsburgh Airport opened in 1952, becoming the region\u2019s primary commercial airport. (Allegheny County Airport continues to operate today as a robust general aviation airport with more than 60,000 operations annually.)\nThat terminal existed until 1992, when officials opened the more modern Pittsburgh International Airport, built and designed as a hub for US Airways. US Airways pulled its hub status in 2004, leaving Pittsburgh with a facility built for another time and a different purpose. The airport today offers nonstop service to more than 60 nonstop destinations on 16 airlines, including international service to London Heathrow on British Airways as well service to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.\nBoth Pittsburgh International Airport and Allegheny County Airport are operated under the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which has experienced several changes through the years, with the new terminal project being the largest.\nOfficials announced the new terminal in 2017, but construction was put on hold in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project resumed in 2021 and is now making consistent progress. The groundbreaking happened in October 2021, making it the first U.S. terminal built from the ground up after the pandemic.\nTravelers will get the opportunity to enjoy fresh air and greenery while they await their flights. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nManaging Construction\nACAA selected the architecture and engineering teams of Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects to lead work on the project. This collaboration ensures international best practices are met without sacrificing local characteristics.\nGensler is headquartered in San Francisco but has multiple Pennsylvania offices and designed the PNC tower downtown. The firm also has airport experience with Incheon Airport. HDR is headquartered in Omaha, Neb., but has an office in Pittsburgh. It replaced the Greenfield Bridge and renovated the Honolulu Airport.\nLuis Vidal completed terminal projects for Heathrow, Madrid-Barajas and other airports.\nBlue Sky News/Pittsburgh International Airport\nTaking in Local Concerns\nThe Allegheny County Airport Authority engaged the community and airlines to determine the best course of action for the terminal project. The terminal modernization has a program advisory group and a best practice group with experts in sustainability, accessibility, passenger experience, technology, health, culture and arts. These members represent constituencies, share their expertise and ensure the authority uses best practices in the new terminal design.\nFeedback was gathered through community and stakeholder meetings, interviews, surveys and the feedback section of the program\u2019s website,\u00a0PITtransformed.com.\nAlthough there are concerns with any project, Pittsburgh\u2019s local \u201cyinzers\u201d are known for being open to sustainable initiatives and creating socioeconomic changes that positively impact the environment, preserving it for future generations. These efforts are known internationally, with the United Nations Foundation recognizing the city as an example of America\u2019s growing sustainability movement.\nManaging the TPM Budget\nWith a high cost comes the need for strict budget management, and the program management team keeps spending under control. No local tax dollars are involved, and most of the construction is funded through long-term bonds, essentially borrowing money and then paying off that debt as part of its yearly operating budget. Paying for the project comes from airport revenues, including airline fees, parking and rental fees, passenger facility charges, terminal concessions revenues, and natural gas revenue.\nNatural Construction and Energy\nLarge windows will produce abundant natural light in the new terminal, minimizing the need for external lighting sources. Outside these windows are expansive outdoor terraces featuring local flora. Using local plants reduces the need for excess water and electricity.\nPlanting local trees, flowers and bushes enables visitors to learn and appreciate native plants, especially when the airport might be the only part of Pennsylvania some travelers see. They also cut carbon emissions by eliminating the need to transport outside flora.\nThe terrace will have chairs for passengers to relax as well as open spaces for kids and pets to run around before getting on their flights.\nOne of the largest changes to the terminal is the private microgrid with nearly 10,000 solar panels and five natural-gas generators. These energy sources will power the new terminal, cutting the airport\u2019s carbon footprint and creating a more-sustainable environment. The microgrid is already up and running, powering the existing facility since June 2021. This is significant for the 2030 goal, as construction and demolition projects generate approximately 569 million tons of waste annually.\nThis is advantageous for passengers and airlines, providing a power source when electricity goes out as well as decreasing flight delays. In addition to being more resilient, the microgrid saves PIT more than $1 million annually in utility costs and saves more than 6 million pounds of carbon emissions annually.\nLeading the Way for Sustainability\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s terminal modernization project is the first post-pandemic terminal built from the ground up and holds great promise. Sustainability has always been top of mind, but the ability to continue working toward the 2030 goal after a significant delay shows a commitment to creating a more eco-friendly airport. During the construction delay, PIT designers took that time to incorporate additional public health measures into the project.\nOfficials hope projects can look toward PIT as an example that sustainability, economic growth, customer satisfaction and local pride can exist in the same place.\u00a0\nAbout Rose Morrison\nRose Morrison is a freelance writer with a passion for sustainable building and innovative construction technologies; email: [email\u00a0protected].\nSubscribe\nSubscribe now to receive our FREE print publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nProject of the Week\n\nFort McHenry Tunnel\nClick here for details and to submit your project!\nCurrent Issue\n\n4th Annual Sustainable Engineering Issue 2024\nPopular Tags\nTwitter Feed\nLocation\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\nRequest More Information From Sponsor\n\n\u0394\n",

Climate change will probably affect the value of rooftop solar through impacts on rooftop solar generation and cooling demand, but no studies have quantified this effect. In this study, we quantified household-level effects of climate change on rooftop solar value and techno-economically optimal capacity by integrating empirical demand data for over 2,000 US households across 17 cities, household-level simulation and optimization models, and downscaled weather data for historic and future climates. We found that climate change will increase the value of rooftop solar to households by up to 19% and increase techno-economically optimal household capacity by up to 25% by the end of the century under a Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario. This increased value is robust across cities, households, future warming scenarios and retail tariff structures. Researchers, installers and policymakers should capture this increasing value to maximize household and system value of rooftop solar.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n$29.99 /\u00c2\u00a030\u00c2\u00a0days\ncancel any time\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nThe economic commitment of climate change\nSystematic review and meta-analysis of ex-post evaluations on the effectiveness of carbon pricing\nThe refinery of the future\nData availability\nThe individual hourly cooling behaviour data can be obtained from Ecobee upon request38.

Data is from the second half of 2023.\nCosts and trends in Arizona\nAccording to EnergySage, the average home solar power system size in Arizona at the end of 2023 was 12.4kW. A greater reliance on air conditioning results in higher average household electricity use in Arizona than in some parts of the country, requiring slightly larger solar systems than the national average of 11.6kW. \nHowever, the low cost per watt of Arizona solar makes systems there cost-effective. The federal solar tax credit can reduce the upfront cost for solar by as much as 30%, bringing the typical cost down to $19,898. State incentives can further lower the cost.\nThe average payback period for a solar system in Arizona is 11 years, according to June 2024 data from EnergySage, with 20-year savings on an average system estimated at $19,628. Solar costs in Arizona, already the lowest in the nation per watt, have been trending down, dropping by 2% between the first and second half of 2023, according to EnergySage. [0]EnergySage. Solar & Storage Marketplace Report 2023.View all sources \n\u00bb MORE: Best solar companies\nState incentives and policy in Arizona\nAs in many states, the biggest solar incentive for Arizona homeowners is the federal solar tax credit, or residential clean energy credit, which provides a credit of up to 30% of the cost of your solar power system. \nState incentives\nOn the state level, Arizona encouraged solar installations with policies like the 2006 Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, which required Arizona utilities to source 15% of their energy from renewable sources. Of that amount, 30% was required to come from distributed sources like rooftop solar. \nOver time, many of these incentives have been phased out as rooftop solar adoption has increased in the state, and new fees have been imposed on solar customers. But Arizonans can still benefit from certain incentives and protections:\nIn addition to the federal solar tax credit, the Arizona Solar Energy Credit provides a credit of 25% of the cost of a solar system on your state income tax bill, up to a $1,000 maximum.

[0]Arizona State Legislature.  Solar Energy Devices.View all sources \nYou can find more local benefits on the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE), a project maintained by the North Carolina State University.\nNet metering\nAs part of a trend across the nation, Arizona\u2019s net metering (NEM) program, which gave solar customers credit on their electric bill for any unused electricity their system sent back to the power grid, has been phased out. In 2016 the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC), which regulates many of the utilities in the state, replaced Arizona\u2019s NEM program with a net billing program known as the Resource Comparison Proxy (RCP). \nThe RCP compensates solar customers at a lower rate than NEM did for excess power they send to the grid, under a tiered step-down that can go down up to 10% per year, eventually arriving at the \u201cavoided cost\u201d rate, according to Autumn T. Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association (AriSEIA). The avoided cost rate is much lower than the retail rate of electricity, representing the cost a utility avoids by using solar customers\u2019 excess solar instead of producing that electricity themselves or purchasing it elsewhere. \nEach utility does its own avoided cost calculation, so your RCP export rate will depend on your utility. As of September 2023, the export rates for Arizona Public Service and Tucson Electric Power were 7.619 cents/kWh and 6.33 cents/kWh, respectively. But Salt River Project, a large utility that is not regulated by the ACC, was able to drop the export rate dramatically to 2.81 cents/kWh. \n\u201cGiven the current RCP structure, it\u2019s better to go solar sooner rather than later, because the longer you wait, the lower the export rate is,\u201d says Johnson. \nEnergy storage in Arizona\nHome solar batteries cost an average of $8,526 in Arizona after the federal tax credit, according to EnergySage. [0]EnergySage. Solar battery cost: Why they're not always worth it.View all sources But they can be well worth the cost, especially in Arizona:\nBatteries improve the economics of home solar under net billing because instead of sending excess energy back to the grid at a lower credit, you can store the energy to use later.\nMost Arizona solar customers are required to be on a time-of-use (TOU) electricity rate, under which electricity rates are lower at times of low demand and higher at times of high demand. You may use more electricity in your home when you return home from work, demand is high, and the sun is going down so your panels are generating less electricity. A battery can lower your costs by storing the electricity your panels generate during the day for your use in the evening.\nSome of the TOU rate plans in Arizona include demand charges, which are based on spikes in your energy demand. Your home could be using a relatively small amount of energy, but spikes during these times can increase your electricity bill dramatically. As with TOU rates, batteries can lower demand charges significantly by storing electricity that you can use during peak use times.\nWith more heat waves straining the power grid, batteries provide reliable energy backup. Solar alone won\u2019t keep your home powered during an outage, because systems are designed to shut off if there\u2019s an outage to ensure the safety of utility workers.\nLike solar costs, battery costs are expected to keep falling, and technologies are constantly improving. Arizona is beginning to offer residential customers demand response programs, which help avoid strain on the power grid by incentivizing customers to shift their energy use to times when demand is lower. With a home solar battery, you can get the most out of these programs. \nRead more about solar panel costs, incentives and policies in these states:\nCalifornia\nTexas\nFlorida\nColorado\nNorth Carolina\nLouisiana\nCan I get financing for a solar panel system?\nIn addition to tax incentives and rebates, there are options available. Many solar installers offer financing, but you may also be able to finance your solar investment through a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC). These options may have lower interest rates than financing with an installer, future opportunities for refinancing and possible tax benefits.\nHome equity loans and HELOCs are ways to borrow against the value of your home, converting equity into cash. With a home equity loan, you receive a lump-sum payment and then pay it back at a fixed interest rate over an agreed period of time, typically from five to 30 years. HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You\u2019ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you're using your home as collateral.\nFigure: NMLS#1717824\nBetter: NMLS#330511\nQuicken Loans: NMLS#3030\n85%\n90%\n90%\n640\n680\n680\nNational\nNational\nNational\n\u00bb COMPARE: Pros and cons of home equity loans and HELOCs\nAnother option is a solar loan. Many banks, credit unions and online lenders offer these to fund solar panels and installation, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000, and annual percentage rates ranging from 6% to 36%. They function like a personal loan: you receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. And unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral required for a solar loan. This means your home or solar panels aren\u2019t at risk if you miss payments, but you may have to pay late fees.\nSo, yes, you likely can get financing. If you go this route, compare interest rates, terms and fees with any financing package that a solar provider may offer you to ensure you get the best deal.\nTo get cost estimates for solar for your home, you can contact local solar installers and get free quotes; it\u2019s a good idea to get a few quotes to compare, and Solar United Neighbors can help you do the comparison. Installers will start by looking at your electric bill and an online view of your house to get you an initial quote, before making a site visit to check things like the condition of your roof.\nUnder net metering, or NEM, the solar-generated electricity you send back to the grid is compensated at a retail rate. Under net billing, referred to in Arizona as RCP, the electricity you send back to the grid is compensated at a lower rate \u2014 in some cases the avoided cost rate, or the value of that electricity to the grid at the time when it goes back to the grid. Your system will usually send the most electricity to the grid during the middle of the day, when demand is lower. That means that under the avoided cost rate, it will be considered lower-value and credited at a much lower rate than it would have been under NEM.\nYes. If energy storage isn\u2019t right for you at the moment, you can still go solar now and add a battery later when costs come down. Unlike solar, energy storage will not be affected by future cuts to Arizona\u2019s RCP net billing export rate.\nTo get cost estimates for solar for your home, you can contact local solar installers and get free quotes; it\u2019s a good idea to get a few quotes to compare, and Solar United Neighbors can help you do the comparison.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Climate change will impact the value and optimal adoption of residential rooftop solar. Rooftop solar adoption is critical for residential decarbonization and hinges on its value to households. Climate change will probably affect the value of rooftop solar through impacts on rooftop solar generation and cooling demand, but no studies have quantified this effect. In this study, we quantified household-level effects of climate change on rooftop solar value and techno-economically optimal capacity by integrating empirical demand data for over 2,000 US households across 17 cities, household-level simulation and optimization models, and downscaled weather data for historic and future climates. We found that climate change will increase the value of rooftop solar to households by up to 19% and increase techno-economically optimal household capacity by up to 25% by the end of the century under a Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario. This increased value is robust across cities, households, future warming scenarios and retail tariff structures. Researchers, installers and policymakers should capture this increasing value to maximize household and system value of rooftop solar.",

Solar and wind account for more of our nation\u2019s energy mix than ever before.\nTo study America\u2019s growing renewable electricity capacity and generation, Climate Central analyzed historical data on solar and wind energy over a 10-year period (2014 to 2023).\nThe analysis shows that the amount of electricity produced from solar and wind power increased across the U.S. Our nation generated 238,121 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from solar in 2023 \u2014 more than eight times the amount generated a decade earlier in 2014. Wind power has more than doubled this decade, with 425,325 GWh coming from wind installations across the country in 2023. Together, these two renewable energy sources generated enough electricity in 2023 to power the equivalent of more than 61 million average American homes.\nThe most solar power generation came from California (68,816 GWh) and Texas (31,739 GWh) in 2023. Texas also led the country in power generated from wind (119,836 GWh).\nThese data \u2014 combined with federal capacity forecasts \u2014 show how renewable energy growth is driving America\u2019s progress toward net-zero carbon emissions targets in the U.S.\nThis report and supplementary data show:\nHow much solar and wind power increased from 2022 to 2023\nGrowth trends in solar and wind power over the past decade (2014-2023)\nWhich states are the biggest producers of solar and wind energy\nDownload the dataSee the full report\nRelated Climate Matters briefs including state-level graphics:\nA Decade of Solar Growth\nIndex\nIntroductionSolarSolar-powered States in 2023A Decade of Solar Growth Across the U.S., 2014-2023WindWind-powered States in 2023A Decade of Wind Growth Across the U.S., 2014-2023Clean Energy Growth Relative to U.S. Climate TargetsMethodology\nIntroduction #\nRenewable energy from solar panels and wind turbines is increasingly important in the United States, as costs for these technologies continue to rapidly decline. As the power grid grows to meet increasing electricity demand in the coming decades, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that most of the nation\u2019s new energy capacity will come from renewables like solar and wind \u2013 shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.\nLow-carbon renewable energy sources such as solar and wind provide electricity without producing heat-trapping gases or other air pollutants. Renewable energy projects create jobs, support local economies, and help meet U.S. commitments to reduce carbon pollution.\nSolar and wind are the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the U.S. In 2019, wind generation surpassed the amount of electricity generated from hydropower \u2014 a longtime leader in renewable energy. In 2022, solar overtook hydropower for the first time. Solar and wind energy will lead the growth in U.S. power generation for at least the next two years, according to EIA estimates.\nThis report uses data from the EIA to analyze solar and wind capacity and generation over the past decade (2014 to 2023) in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Recent data are compared across states and against historical figures to show which states have led growth in solar and wind energy.\nThe key terms in this report \u2014 capacity and generation \u2014 gauge renewable energy in the U.S.\nCapacity reflects the number and size of operational solar and wind installations. Renewable energy in the U.S. comes from both large utility-scale power plants and small-scale installations (which have less than 1 megawatt of capacity).\nGeneration reflects how much electricity is produced by those installations, which depends on the weather and number of daily sunlight hours.See Box 1. Key Terms for more details.\nTogether, capacity and generation data provide insight into renewable energy growth, by showing the new capacity that comes online each year as well as the amount of electricity generated with new installations.\nDownload datasets with all variables included in this report.\nCapacity: measure of the maximum rate at which electricity can be generated by equipment on the ground, reported here in megawatts (MW) for state totals and gigawatts (GW) (equal to 1,000 MW) for national totals.\nGeneration: the amount of electricity produced over a period of time, reported here in gigawatt-hours (GWh) (equal to 1,000 megawatt-hours). For reference, the average American household consumed 10.8 MWh of electricity in 2022.\nSmall-scale installations: power operations with less than 1 MW of capacity, usually located onsite or near where the electricity is used (e.g., residential rooftop solar panels or community solar projects). Note: The only small-scale installations discussed in this report are for solar power.\nUtility-scale installations: power plants with at least 1 MW of capacity.\nLearn more about U.S. electricity capacity and generation from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n01 / 01\nSOLAR #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 gigawatts from utility- and small-scale solar installations \u2014 an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 238,121 GWh of electricity from utility- and small-scale solar installations combined. This is an increase of 33,042 GWh or 16% compared to 2022.\nFigure 1: National solar electricity generation (GWh) in 2023 by state\nThe EIA considers a solar installation to be \u201csmall-scale\u201d if it has less than 1 MW of capacity. Most residential or commercial rooftop solar installations are small-scale, along with most community solar projects (those that provide electricity to multiple residents or businesses in an area).\nSmall-scale solar installations account for an estimated 48 GW (around 34%) of all solar capacity in the U.S. at the end of 2023. Nearly 8 GW of new small-scale solar capacity was brought online in 2023, representing a record 20% increase compared to 2022.\nDuring the past decade, small-scale solar capacity and generation have grown steadily, but at a slower pace than utility-scale. Small-scale capacity in 2023 was more than six times the amount compared to 2014; utility-scale saw an eight-fold increase. The EIA estimates that small-scale solar capacity could grow to 55 GW by the end of 2024.\nSmall-scale solar produced an estimated 73,619 GWh or about 31% of all solar generation in 2023 \u2014 compared to 164,502 GWh generated by utility-scale installations.\nCalifornia generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023, which accounts for around 41% of the state's total solar electricity generation for the year. On the East Coast, New York generated the most electricity from small-scale solar in 2023 (3,973 GWh) \u2014 accounting for nearly 62% of electricity generated from solar that year in the state. In the middle of the country, wind is typically a bigger source of electricity than solar; however, Illinois was the 10th highest small-scale solar generating state in 2023, with 1,536 GWh of electricity from small-scale operations \u2014 accounting for 44% of the state\u2019s solar electricity.\nUtility-scale solar accounts for around 8% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources (including renewables, nuclear, [1] and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas). In 2023, nearly4% of electricity in the U.S. was produced by utility-scale solar. A decade earlier in 2014, it accounted for less than 0.5% of the total electricity generated.\nCalifornia and Nevada are among the states for which utility-scale solar comprises a significant portion of the current electricity mix. In 2023, utility-scale solar contributed 19% (40,714 GWh) of electricity in California and 23% (9,733 GWh) of the electricity in Nevada.\nNevada\u2019s capacity for solar power is projected to increase during 2024, as the Gemini solar facility is scheduled to come online. The facility will add a planned 690 MW of solar capacity and 380 MW of battery storage \u2013 which is one way solar power facilities can capture and store some energy to meet evening electricity demand. It\u2019s expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational.\nNote: These data reflect total utility-scale energy sources only and exclude small-scale solar.\nSolar energy projects are bringing jobs and skills training to Nevada.

Texas added 4,996 MW of capacity (37% annual increase) and generated 6,302 GWh more than the previous year (25% annual increase).\nCalifornia followed with an addition of 4,714 MW of solar capacity \u2014 a 15% increase from 2022. The state produced 5,906 GWh more (9% increase) than the year before.\nState\nSolar Capacity (MW) 2023\nSolar Capacity Growth\n2022 to 2023\nSolar Generation (GWh) 2023\nSolar Generation Growth\n2022 to 2023\nCalifornia\n36,461\n15%\n68,816\n9%\nTexas\n18,476\n37%\n31,739\n25%\nFlorida\n10,352\n33%\n17,809\n28%\nNorth Carolina\n7,150\n11%\n12,085\n2%\nArizona\n5,848\n14%\n11,778\n6%\nUnited States total\n139,012\n23%\n238,121\n16%\nA Decade of Solar Growth Across the US 2014-2023 #\nThe U.S. added more than 121 GW of utility- and small-scale solar capacity in total during the last decade \u2014 an increase of around 688% (Figure 2). This means there was nearly eight times more solar capacity in 2023 than in 2014.\nThe amount of electricity produced from solar increased at a similar rate. In 2023, the U.S. generated over eight times more electricity from solar energy than in 2014 \u2014 an increase of more than 209,197 GWh or 723%.\nThe states with the most significant growth in solar capacity over the last 10 years include: California, which added 27,864 MW from 2014 to 2023; Texas (18,179 MW); Florida (10,203 MW); North Carolina (6,416 MW); and Nevada (4,313 MW).\nThese five states saw the most growth in generation, too (Table 2).

Seasonal weather plays an important role. The amount of electricity generated is influenced, in part, by when the sun shines or the wind blows.\nSolar generation in the U.S. peaks in the summer, when days are long and the sun\u2019s rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly. In 2023, solar electricity produced from utility- and small-scale installations (combined) peaked (Figure 3) in July (26,626 GWh) and August (25,372 GWh).\nWind energy generation is typically highest during the spring. In 2023, the most wind energy was produced across the U.S. in March (44,580 GWh) and April (43,072 GWh) (Figure 4).\n01 / 01\nFigure 3: Monthly solar generation (GWh) in the U.S. in 2023.

This represents a slight drop of 9,062 GWh or 2% compared to 2022 due to lower average wind speeds, mostly in the Midwest.\nMost wind energy in the U.S. is produced onshore, in the middle of the country. However coastal states can take advantage of offshore winds to generate electricity. Offshore wind currently makes up a small portion of the national electricity mix, but it has the potential to grow substantially in the coming decades.\nIn 2023, only two states (Rhode Island and Virginia) had operational offshore wind facilities, which contributed 42 MW to the total national wind capacity (148 GW). Offshore wind capacity has already grown early in 2024. Vineyard Wind, a wind installation off the coast of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, began operating in February 2024 with 68 MW of capacity. This facility will have 800 MW of capacity when fully operational, which could happen as soon as late 2024. In March 2024, South Fork Wind Farm off the coasts of New York and Rhode Island began operating with around 130 MW of capacity \u2014 making it the country\u2019s largest operational offshore wind installation.\nRising costs have challenged the economic viability of offshore wind installations, delaying some projects. Financial incentives such as those in the Inflation Reduction Act could ease some of the economic burden. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, state policies are poised to support development of nearly 43 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040.

As part of its commitment, the U.S. has set the following goals:\nBy 2030: reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels\nBy 2035: reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity\nBy 2050: achieving a net-zero emissions economy\nRecent landmark laws are fostering renewable energy growth and moving the U.S. toward its climate goals. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) contains hundreds of billions of dollars to boost clean energy and cut emissions. The IRA includes provisions such as tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives for renewable energy projects from the utility-scale to individual households.\nThe Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT), a project led by Princeton University scientists, estimates the potential impact of these policies, and tracks progress towards U.S. climate targets.By 2030, REPEAT estimates U.S. net annual emissions could be as low as 4.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2e), compared to 6.6 Gt CO2e in 2005: a reduction of around 40% compared to 2005 levels. Although this represents significant progress, the U.S. would still fall short of its 2030 target (50% below 2005 levels) (Figure 7).Solar and wind energy are key to reducing emissions and reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. If current policies are taken advantage of, a boom in solar and wind energy capacity is expected based on REPEAT analysis. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority (more than 50%) of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (Figure 8).In 12 states, wind and solar could make up over 80% of electricity capacity by 2035 by utilizing current policies. And New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming could have over 90% of their electricity capacity from wind and solar by 2035.\nExplore more data: State Solar and Wind Boom to Bring U.S. Toward Climate Targets\nMethodology #\nAll national and state-level data come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values for 2014-2022 are as reported in EIA\u2019s Historical State Data for each year. For 2023, utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values are for December 2023 as reported in EIA\u2019s Electric Power Monthly. Small-scale solar capacity for 2014-2022 are for December of each year, as reported in form EIA-861M. All generation values (wind, utility- and small-scale solar) for 2014-2022 come from EIA\u2019s electricity data browser.\nTo calculate the portion of total capacity and electricity generation contributed by solar and wind (as a percentage), we compared electricity capacity/generation for utility-scale solar and wind to all fuel sources and all energy sectors at the utility-scale level, which includes: renewable sources; nuclear; and fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar and wind 10-year growth is a direct comparison between capacity/generation in 2014 and 2023.\nClimate Central is an independent group of scientists and communicators who research and report the facts about our changing climate and how it affects people\u2019s lives.\nClimate Central is a policy-neutral 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\nNewsletter signup\nLooking for Climate Matters?

Data is from the second half of 2023.\nCosts and trends in Arizona\nAccording to EnergySage, the average home solar power system size in Arizona at the end of 2023 was 12.4kW. A greater reliance on air conditioning results in higher average household electricity use in Arizona than in some parts of the country, requiring slightly larger solar systems than the national average of 11.6kW. \nHowever, the low cost per watt of Arizona solar makes systems there cost-effective. The federal solar tax credit can reduce the upfront cost for solar by as much as 30%, bringing the typical cost down to $19,898. State incentives can further lower the cost.\nThe average payback period for a solar system in Arizona is 11 years, according to June 2024 data from EnergySage, with 20-year savings on an average system estimated at $19,628. Solar costs in Arizona, already the lowest in the nation per watt, have been trending down, dropping by 2% between the first and second half of 2023, according to EnergySage. [0]EnergySage. Solar & Storage Marketplace Report 2023.View all sources \n\u00bb MORE: Best solar companies\nState incentives and policy in Arizona\nAs in many states, the biggest solar incentive for Arizona homeowners is the federal solar tax credit, or residential clean energy credit, which provides a credit of up to 30% of the cost of your solar power system. \nState incentives\nOn the state level, Arizona encouraged solar installations with policies like the 2006 Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, which required Arizona utilities to source 15% of their energy from renewable sources. Of that amount, 30% was required to come from distributed sources like rooftop solar. \nOver time, many of these incentives have been phased out as rooftop solar adoption has increased in the state, and new fees have been imposed on solar customers. But Arizonans can still benefit from certain incentives and protections:\nIn addition to the federal solar tax credit, the Arizona Solar Energy Credit provides a credit of 25% of the cost of a solar system on your state income tax bill, up to a $1,000 maximum.

Solar Energy Devices.View all sources \nYou can find more local benefits on the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE), a project maintained by the North Carolina State University.\nNet metering\nAs part of a trend across the nation, Arizona\u2019s net metering (NEM) program, which gave solar customers credit on their electric bill for any unused electricity their system sent back to the power grid, has been phased out. In 2016 the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC), which regulates many of the utilities in the state, replaced Arizona\u2019s NEM program with a net billing program known as the Resource Comparison Proxy (RCP). \nThe RCP compensates solar customers at a lower rate than NEM did for excess power they send to the grid, under a tiered step-down that can go down up to 10% per year, eventually arriving at the \u201cavoided cost\u201d rate, according to Autumn T. Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association (AriSEIA). The avoided cost rate is much lower than the retail rate of electricity, representing the cost a utility avoids by using solar customers\u2019 excess solar instead of producing that electricity themselves or purchasing it elsewhere. \nEach utility does its own avoided cost calculation, so your RCP export rate will depend on your utility. As of September 2023, the export rates for Arizona Public Service and Tucson Electric Power were 7.619 cents/kWh and 6.33 cents/kWh, respectively. But Salt River Project, a large utility that is not regulated by the ACC, was able to drop the export rate dramatically to 2.81 cents/kWh. \n\u201cGiven the current RCP structure, it\u2019s better to go solar sooner rather than later, because the longer you wait, the lower the export rate is,\u201d says Johnson. \nEnergy storage in Arizona\nHome solar batteries cost an average of $8,526 in Arizona after the federal tax credit, according to EnergySage. [0]EnergySage. Solar battery cost: Why they're not always worth it.View all sources But they can be well worth the cost, especially in Arizona:\nBatteries improve the economics of home solar under net billing because instead of sending excess energy back to the grid at a lower credit, you can store the energy to use later.\nMost Arizona solar customers are required to be on a time-of-use (TOU) electricity rate, under which electricity rates are lower at times of low demand and higher at times of high demand. You may use more electricity in your home when you return home from work, demand is high, and the sun is going down so your panels are generating less electricity. A battery can lower your costs by storing the electricity your panels generate during the day for your use in the evening.\nSome of the TOU rate plans in Arizona include demand charges, which are based on spikes in your energy demand. Your home could be using a relatively small amount of energy, but spikes during these times can increase your electricity bill dramatically. As with TOU rates, batteries can lower demand charges significantly by storing electricity that you can use during peak use times.\nWith more heat waves straining the power grid, batteries provide reliable energy backup. Solar alone won\u2019t keep your home powered during an outage, because systems are designed to shut off if there\u2019s an outage to ensure the safety of utility workers.\nLike solar costs, battery costs are expected to keep falling, and technologies are constantly improving. Arizona is beginning to offer residential customers demand response programs, which help avoid strain on the power grid by incentivizing customers to shift their energy use to times when demand is lower. With a home solar battery, you can get the most out of these programs. \nRead more about solar panel costs, incentives and policies in these states:\nCalifornia\nTexas\nFlorida\nColorado\nNorth Carolina\nLouisiana\nCan I get financing for a solar panel system?\nIn addition to tax incentives and rebates, there are options available. Many solar installers offer financing, but you may also be able to finance your solar investment through a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC). These options may have lower interest rates than financing with an installer, future opportunities for refinancing and possible tax benefits.\nHome equity loans and HELOCs are ways to borrow against the value of your home, converting equity into cash. With a home equity loan, you receive a lump-sum payment and then pay it back at a fixed interest rate over an agreed period of time, typically from five to 30 years. HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You\u2019ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you're using your home as collateral.\nFigure: NMLS#1717824\nBetter: NMLS#330511\nQuicken Loans: NMLS#3030\n85%\n90%\n90%\n640\n680\n680\nNational\nNational\nNational\n\u00bb COMPARE: Pros and cons of home equity loans and HELOCs\nAnother option is a solar loan. Many banks, credit unions and online lenders offer these to fund solar panels and installation, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000, and annual percentage rates ranging from 6% to 36%. They function like a personal loan: you receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. And unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral required for a solar loan. This means your home or solar panels aren\u2019t at risk if you miss payments, but you may have to pay late fees.\nSo, yes, you likely can get financing. If you go this route, compare interest rates, terms and fees with any financing package that a solar provider may offer you to ensure you get the best deal.\nTo get cost estimates for solar for your home, you can contact local solar installers and get free quotes; it\u2019s a good idea to get a few quotes to compare, and Solar United Neighbors can help you do the comparison.

Climate Matters helps meteorologists and journalists report on climate impacts and solutions. The Partnership Journalism program collaborates with local newsrooms nationwide. The report 'A Decade of Growth in Solar and Wind Power: Trends Across the U.S.' shows that America's capacity to generate carbon-free electricity grew during 2023, with solar and wind accounting for more of the energy mix than ever before. In 2023, the U.S. generated 238,121 GWh of electricity from solar, more than eight times the amount in 2014. Wind power more than doubled, with 425,325 GWh generated in 2023. California and Texas were the top producers of solar power, with 68,816 GWh and 31,739 GWh respectively. Texas also led in wind power with 119,836 GWh. The report includes data on solar and wind power increases from 2022 to 2023, growth trends over the past decade, and the biggest producers of solar and wind energy. By the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 GW from solar installations, a 23% increase from 2022. Small-scale solar installations accounted for 48 GW of this capacity. California generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023. Utility-scale solar contributed 19% of California's electricity in 2023. The Gemini solar facility in Nevada is expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational. Wind energy generation in the U.S. peaked in March 2023 with 44,580 GWh. By the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 148 GW from wind installations. Offshore wind capacity grew early in 2024 with the Vineyard Wind and South Fork Wind Farm projects. Wind accounted for around 12% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources in 2023. Texas led in wind capacity and generation growth from 2022 to 2023. The U.S. added more than 83 GW of wind capacity during the last decade, an increase of around 130%. The U.S. aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035.

Solar and wind account for more of our nation\u2019s energy mix than ever before.\nTo study America\u2019s growing renewable electricity capacity and generation, Climate Central analyzed historical data on solar and wind energy over a 10-year period (2014 to 2023).\nThe analysis shows that the amount of electricity produced from solar and wind power increased across the U.S. Our nation generated 238,121 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from solar in 2023 \u2014 more than eight times the amount generated a decade earlier in 2014. Wind power has more than doubled this decade, with 425,325 GWh coming from wind installations across the country in 2023. Together, these two renewable energy sources generated enough electricity in 2023 to power the equivalent of more than 61 million average American homes.\nThe most solar power generation came from California (68,816 GWh) and Texas (31,739 GWh) in 2023. Texas also led the country in power generated from wind (119,836 GWh).\nThese data \u2014 combined with federal capacity forecasts \u2014 show how renewable energy growth is driving America\u2019s progress toward net-zero carbon emissions targets in the U.S.\nThis report and supplementary data show:\nHow much solar and wind power increased from 2022 to 2023\nGrowth trends in solar and wind power over the past decade (2014-2023)\nWhich states are the biggest producers of solar and wind energy\nDownload the dataSee the full report\nRelated Climate Matters briefs including state-level graphics:\nA Decade of Solar Growth\nIndex\nIntroductionSolarSolar-powered States in 2023A Decade of Solar Growth Across the U.S., 2014-2023WindWind-powered States in 2023A Decade of Wind Growth Across the U.S., 2014-2023Clean Energy Growth Relative to U.S. Climate TargetsMethodology\nIntroduction #\nRenewable energy from solar panels and wind turbines is increasingly important in the United States, as costs for these technologies continue to rapidly decline. As the power grid grows to meet increasing electricity demand in the coming decades, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that most of the nation\u2019s new energy capacity will come from renewables like solar and wind \u2013 shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.\nLow-carbon renewable energy sources such as solar and wind provide electricity without producing heat-trapping gases or other air pollutants. Renewable energy projects create jobs, support local economies, and help meet U.S. commitments to reduce carbon pollution.\nSolar and wind are the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the U.S. In 2019, wind generation surpassed the amount of electricity generated from hydropower \u2014 a longtime leader in renewable energy. In 2022, solar overtook hydropower for the first time. Solar and wind energy will lead the growth in U.S. power generation for at least the next two years, according to EIA estimates.\nThis report uses data from the EIA to analyze solar and wind capacity and generation over the past decade (2014 to 2023) in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Recent data are compared across states and against historical figures to show which states have led growth in solar and wind energy.\nThe key terms in this report \u2014 capacity and generation \u2014 gauge renewable energy in the U.S.\nCapacity reflects the number and size of operational solar and wind installations. Renewable energy in the U.S. comes from both large utility-scale power plants and small-scale installations (which have less than 1 megawatt of capacity).\nGeneration reflects how much electricity is produced by those installations, which depends on the weather and number of daily sunlight hours.See Box 1. Key Terms for more details.\nTogether, capacity and generation data provide insight into renewable energy growth, by showing the new capacity that comes online each year as well as the amount of electricity generated with new installations.\nDownload datasets with all variables included in this report.\nCapacity: measure of the maximum rate at which electricity can be generated by equipment on the ground, reported here in megawatts (MW) for state totals and gigawatts (GW) (equal to 1,000 MW) for national totals.\nGeneration: the amount of electricity produced over a period of time, reported here in gigawatt-hours (GWh) (equal to 1,000 megawatt-hours). For reference, the average American household consumed 10.8 MWh of electricity in 2022.\nSmall-scale installations: power operations with less than 1 MW of capacity, usually located onsite or near where the electricity is used (e.g., residential rooftop solar panels or community solar projects). Note: The only small-scale installations discussed in this report are for solar power.\nUtility-scale installations: power plants with at least 1 MW of capacity.\nLearn more about U.S. electricity capacity and generation from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n01 / 01\nSOLAR #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 gigawatts from utility- and small-scale solar installations \u2014 an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 238,121 GWh of electricity from utility- and small-scale solar installations combined. This is an increase of 33,042 GWh or 16% compared to 2022.\nFigure 1: National solar electricity generation (GWh) in 2023 by state\nThe EIA considers a solar installation to be \u201csmall-scale\u201d if it has less than 1 MW of capacity. Most residential or commercial rooftop solar installations are small-scale, along with most community solar projects (those that provide electricity to multiple residents or businesses in an area).\nSmall-scale solar installations account for an estimated 48 GW (around 34%) of all solar capacity in the U.S. at the end of 2023. Nearly 8 GW of new small-scale solar capacity was brought online in 2023, representing a record 20% increase compared to 2022.\nDuring the past decade, small-scale solar capacity and generation have grown steadily, but at a slower pace than utility-scale. Small-scale capacity in 2023 was more than six times the amount compared to 2014; utility-scale saw an eight-fold increase. The EIA estimates that small-scale solar capacity could grow to 55 GW by the end of 2024.\nSmall-scale solar produced an estimated 73,619 GWh or about 31% of all solar generation in 2023 \u2014 compared to 164,502 GWh generated by utility-scale installations.\nCalifornia generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023, which accounts for around 41% of the state's total solar electricity generation for the year. On the East Coast, New York generated the most electricity from small-scale solar in 2023 (3,973 GWh) \u2014 accounting for nearly 62% of electricity generated from solar that year in the state. In the middle of the country, wind is typically a bigger source of electricity than solar; however, Illinois was the 10th highest small-scale solar generating state in 2023, with 1,536 GWh of electricity from small-scale operations \u2014 accounting for 44% of the state\u2019s solar electricity.\nUtility-scale solar accounts for around 8% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources (including renewables, nuclear, [1] and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas). In 2023, nearly4% of electricity in the U.S. was produced by utility-scale solar. A decade earlier in 2014, it accounted for less than 0.5% of the total electricity generated.\nCalifornia and Nevada are among the states for which utility-scale solar comprises a significant portion of the current electricity mix. In 2023, utility-scale solar contributed 19% (40,714 GWh) of electricity in California and 23% (9,733 GWh) of the electricity in Nevada.\nNevada\u2019s capacity for solar power is projected to increase during 2024, as the Gemini solar facility is scheduled to come online. The facility will add a planned 690 MW of solar capacity and 380 MW of battery storage \u2013 which is one way solar power facilities can capture and store some energy to meet evening electricity demand. It\u2019s expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational.\nNote: These data reflect total utility-scale energy sources only and exclude small-scale solar.\nSolar energy projects are bringing jobs and skills training to Nevada. Climate Central's Partnership Journalism program collaborated with the Mountain West News Bureau to investigate how Nevada is leading the way for renewable energy workforce development.\nRead the full story.\nThe EIA considers a solar installation to be \u201csmall-scale\u201d if it has less than 1 MW of capacity.

Texas added 4,996 MW of capacity (37% annual increase) and generated 6,302 GWh more than the previous year (25% annual increase).\nCalifornia followed with an addition of 4,714 MW of solar capacity \u2014 a 15% increase from 2022. The state produced 5,906 GWh more (9% increase) than the year before.\nState\nSolar Capacity (MW) 2023\nSolar Capacity Growth\n2022 to 2023\nSolar Generation (GWh) 2023\nSolar Generation Growth\n2022 to 2023\nCalifornia\n36,461\n15%\n68,816\n9%\nTexas\n18,476\n37%\n31,739\n25%\nFlorida\n10,352\n33%\n17,809\n28%\nNorth Carolina\n7,150\n11%\n12,085\n2%\nArizona\n5,848\n14%\n11,778\n6%\nUnited States total\n139,012\n23%\n238,121\n16%\nA Decade of Solar Growth Across the US 2014-2023 #\nThe U.S. added more than 121 GW of utility- and small-scale solar capacity in total during the last decade \u2014 an increase of around 688% (Figure 2). This means there was nearly eight times more solar capacity in 2023 than in 2014.\nThe amount of electricity produced from solar increased at a similar rate. In 2023, the U.S. generated over eight times more electricity from solar energy than in 2014 \u2014 an increase of more than 209,197 GWh or 723%.\nThe states with the most significant growth in solar capacity over the last 10 years include: California, which added 27,864 MW from 2014 to 2023; Texas (18,179 MW); Florida (10,203 MW); North Carolina (6,416 MW); and Nevada (4,313 MW).\nThese five states saw the most growth in generation, too (Table 2).

Seasonal weather plays an important role. The amount of electricity generated is influenced, in part, by when the sun shines or the wind blows.\nSolar generation in the U.S. peaks in the summer, when days are long and the sun\u2019s rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly. In 2023, solar electricity produced from utility- and small-scale installations (combined) peaked (Figure 3) in July (26,626 GWh) and August (25,372 GWh).\nWind energy generation is typically highest during the spring. In 2023, the most wind energy was produced across the U.S. in March (44,580 GWh) and April (43,072 GWh) (Figure 4).\n01 / 01\nFigure 3: Monthly solar generation (GWh) in the U.S. in 2023.

It can be used to generate figures relevant to any state, media market, county, or congressional district in the continental U.S.\nThis WeatherPower graphic shows estimates and forecasts for solar generation in North Carolina in March 2024.\nWIND #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 148 GW from utility-scale onshore and offshore wind installations \u2014 an increase of 6 GW or 4% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 425,235 GWh of electricity from utility-scale wind installations. This represents a slight drop of 9,062 GWh or 2% compared to 2022 due to lower average wind speeds, mostly in the Midwest.\nMost wind energy in the U.S. is produced onshore, in the middle of the country. However coastal states can take advantage of offshore winds to generate electricity. Offshore wind currently makes up a small portion of the national electricity mix, but it has the potential to grow substantially in the coming decades.\nIn 2023, only two states (Rhode Island and Virginia) had operational offshore wind facilities, which contributed 42 MW to the total national wind capacity (148 GW). Offshore wind capacity has already grown early in 2024. Vineyard Wind, a wind installation off the coast of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, began operating in February 2024 with 68 MW of capacity. This facility will have 800 MW of capacity when fully operational, which could happen as soon as late 2024. In March 2024, South Fork Wind Farm off the coasts of New York and Rhode Island began operating with around 130 MW of capacity \u2014 making it the country\u2019s largest operational offshore wind installation.\nRising costs have challenged the economic viability of offshore wind installations, delaying some projects. Financial incentives such as those in the Inflation Reduction Act could ease some of the economic burden. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, state policies are poised to support development of nearly 43 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040.

Offshore wind projects across more than a dozen coastal states are in various stages of approval or construction.\nLearn more about offshore wind in the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Offshore Wind Market Report: 2023 Edition\n01 / 02\nWind-powered States in 2023 #\nThe states with the most wind capacity in 2023 were Texas, with 40,652 MW; Iowa (12,803 MW); Oklahoma (12,245 MW); Kansas (9,043 MW); and Illinois (7,874 MW).\nThese same five states also generated the most electricity from wind power in 2023: Texas (119,836 GWh); Iowa (41,869 GWh); Oklahoma (37,731 GWh); Kansas (27,462 GWh); and Illinois (22,054 GWh) (Figure 5).\nTexas led the nation in absolute growth from 2022 to 2023 for both wind capacity and generation (Table 3). Texas added 1,309 MW of capacity (3% annual increase) and generated 5,049 GWh more than the previous year (4% annual increase).\nArizona and New York standout for their relative growth in wind capacity from 2022 to 2023. Arizona\u2019s capacity increased by 39% (238 MW added), and New York\u2019s by 25% (557 MW added).\nState\nWind Capacity (MW) 2023\nChange in Wind Capacity\n2022 to 2023\nWind Generation (GWh) 2023\nChange in\nWind Generation\n2022 to 2023\nTexas\n40,652\n3%\n119,836\n4%\nIowa\n12,803\n3%\n41,869\n-9%\nOklahoma\n12,245\n6%\n37,731\n0%\nKansas\n9,043\n10%\n27,462\n-7%\nIllinois\n7,874\n12%\n22,054\n-6%\nUnited States total\n147,640\n4%\n425,235\n-2%\nA Decade of Wind Growth Across the US 2014-2023 #\nThe U.S. added more than 83 GW of wind capacity during the last decade \u2014 an increase of around 130%. This means that wind capacity more than doubled from 2014 to 2023 (Figure 6).\nThe amount of electricity produced from wind increased at a similar rate. In 2023, the U.S. generated more than twice as much electricity from wind energy than in 2014 \u2014 an increase of 243,580 GWh or 134%.\nThe states with the most significant growth in wind capacity during this decade include: Texas, which added 26,658 MW from 2014 to 2023; Oklahoma (8,466 MW); Iowa (7,241 MW); Kansas (6,074 MW); and Illinois (4,347 MW).\nFour out of these five states saw the most growth in generation, too (Table 4). Present-day wind generation reflects these strong historical growth trends, as there is overlap with the highest wind-generating states in 2023.\nFigure 6: National wind capacity (GW) by year (2014-2023)\nTable 4.

As part of its commitment, the U.S. has set the following goals:\nBy 2030: reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels\nBy 2035: reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity\nBy 2050: achieving a net-zero emissions economy\nRecent landmark laws are fostering renewable energy growth and moving the U.S. toward its climate goals. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) contains hundreds of billions of dollars to boost clean energy and cut emissions. The IRA includes provisions such as tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives for renewable energy projects from the utility-scale to individual households.\nThe Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT), a project led by Princeton University scientists, estimates the potential impact of these policies, and tracks progress towards U.S. climate targets.By 2030, REPEAT estimates U.S. net annual emissions could be as low as 4.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2e), compared to 6.6 Gt CO2e in 2005: a reduction of around 40% compared to 2005 levels. Although this represents significant progress, the U.S. would still fall short of its 2030 target (50% below 2005 levels) (Figure 7).Solar and wind energy are key to reducing emissions and reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. If current policies are taken advantage of, a boom in solar and wind energy capacity is expected based on REPEAT analysis. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority (more than 50%) of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (Figure 8).In 12 states, wind and solar could make up over 80% of electricity capacity by 2035 by utilizing current policies. And New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming could have over 90% of their electricity capacity from wind and solar by 2035.\nExplore more data: State Solar and Wind Boom to Bring U.S. Toward Climate Targets\nMethodology #\nAll national and state-level data come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values for 2014-2022 are as reported in EIA\u2019s Historical State Data for each year. For 2023, utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values are for December 2023 as reported in EIA\u2019s Electric Power Monthly. Small-scale solar capacity for 2014-2022 are for December of each year, as reported in form EIA-861M. All generation values (wind, utility- and small-scale solar) for 2014-2022 come from EIA\u2019s electricity data browser.\nTo calculate the portion of total capacity and electricity generation contributed by solar and wind (as a percentage), we compared electricity capacity/generation for utility-scale solar and wind to all fuel sources and all energy sectors at the utility-scale level, which includes: renewable sources; nuclear; and fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar and wind 10-year growth is a direct comparison between capacity/generation in 2014 and 2023.\nClimate Central is an independent group of scientists and communicators who research and report the facts about our changing climate and how it affects people\u2019s lives.\nClimate Central is a policy-neutral 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\nNewsletter signup\nLooking for Climate Matters?

Climate change will probably affect the value of rooftop solar through impacts on rooftop solar generation and cooling demand, but no studies have quantified this effect. In this study, we quantified household-level effects of climate change on rooftop solar value and techno-economically optimal capacity by integrating empirical demand data for over 2,000 US households across 17 cities, household-level simulation and optimization models, and downscaled weather data for historic and future climates. We found that climate change will increase the value of rooftop solar to households by up to 19% and increase techno-economically optimal household capacity by up to 25% by the end of the century under a Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario. This increased value is robust across cities, households, future warming scenarios and retail tariff structures. Researchers, installers and policymakers should capture this increasing value to maximize household and system value of rooftop solar.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n$29.99 /\u00c2\u00a030\u00c2\u00a0days\ncancel any time\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nThe economic commitment of climate change\nSystematic review and meta-analysis of ex-post evaluations on the effectiveness of carbon pricing\nThe refinery of the future\nData availability\nThe individual hourly cooling behaviour data can be obtained from Ecobee upon request38.

Climate Matters helps meteorologists and journalists report on climate impacts and solutions. The Partnership Journalism program collaborates with local newsrooms nationwide. A report from April 3, 2024, titled 'A Decade of Growth in Solar and Wind Power: Trends Across the U.S.' shows that America's capacity to generate carbon-free electricity grew during 2023. Solar and wind energy have seen significant growth over the past decade. In 2023, the U.S. generated 238,121 GWh from solar and 425,325 GWh from wind. Texas led the country in wind power generation with 119,836 GWh in 2023. The report also highlights the increase in solar and wind power from 2022 to 2023, growth trends over the past decade, and the states that are the biggest producers of solar and wind energy. The U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 GW from solar and 148 GW from wind by the end of 2023. Solar generation peaked in July and August 2023, while wind generation was highest in March and April 2023. Texas generated 119,836 GWh of wind energy in 2023, with the most wind energy produced in March (44,580 GWh) and April (43,072 GWh). The EIA forecasts that electricity generation from wind will grow by 6% in 2024. Offshore wind capacity is expected to grow substantially in the coming decades. The U.S. aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030, reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, and achieve a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Recent laws like the Inflation Reduction Act are fostering renewable energy growth. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Climate change will impact the value and optimal adoption of residential rooftop solar. Rooftop solar adoption is critical for residential decarbonization and hinges on its value to households. Climate change will probably affect the value of rooftop solar through impacts on rooftop solar generation and cooling demand, but no studies have quantified this effect. In this study, we quantified household-level effects of climate change on rooftop solar value and techno-economically optimal capacity by integrating empirical demand data for over 2,000 US households across 17 cities, household-level simulation and optimization models, and downscaled weather data for historic and future climates. We found that climate change will increase the value of rooftop solar to households by up to 19% and increase techno-economically optimal household capacity by up to 25% by the end of the century under a Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario. This increased value is robust across cities, households, future warming scenarios and retail tariff structures. Researchers, installers and policymakers should capture this increasing value to maximize household and system value of rooftop solar.",

As the power grid grows to meet increasing electricity demand in the coming decades, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that most of the nation\u2019s new energy capacity will come from renewables like solar and wind \u2013 shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.\nLow-carbon renewable energy sources such as solar and wind provide electricity without producing heat-trapping gases or other air pollutants. Renewable energy projects create jobs, support local economies, and help meet U.S. commitments to reduce carbon pollution.\nSolar and wind are the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the U.S. In 2019, wind generation surpassed the amount of electricity generated from hydropower \u2014 a longtime leader in renewable energy. In 2022, solar overtook hydropower for the first time. Solar and wind energy will lead the growth in U.S. power generation for at least the next two years, according to EIA estimates.\nThis report uses data from the EIA to analyze solar and wind capacity and generation over the past decade (2014 to 2023) in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Recent data are compared across states and against historical figures to show which states have led growth in solar and wind energy.\nThe key terms in this report \u2014 capacity and generation \u2014 gauge renewable energy in the U.S.\nCapacity reflects the number and size of operational solar and wind installations. Renewable energy in the U.S. comes from both large utility-scale power plants and small-scale installations (which have less than 1 megawatt of capacity).\nGeneration reflects how much electricity is produced by those installations, which depends on the weather and number of daily sunlight hours.See Box 1. Key Terms for more details.\nTogether, capacity and generation data provide insight into renewable energy growth, by showing the new capacity that comes online each year as well as the amount of electricity generated with new installations.\nDownload datasets with all variables included in this report.\nCapacity: measure of the maximum rate at which electricity can be generated by equipment on the ground, reported here in megawatts (MW) for state totals and gigawatts (GW) (equal to 1,000 MW) for national totals.\nGeneration: the amount of electricity produced over a period of time, reported here in gigawatt-hours (GWh) (equal to 1,000 megawatt-hours). For reference, the average American household consumed 10.8 MWh of electricity in 2022.\nSmall-scale installations: power operations with less than 1 MW of capacity, usually located onsite or near where the electricity is used (e.g., residential rooftop solar panels or community solar projects). Note: The only small-scale installations discussed in this report are for solar power.\nUtility-scale installations: power plants with at least 1 MW of capacity.\nLearn more about U.S. electricity capacity and generation from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n01 / 01\nSOLAR #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 gigawatts from utility- and small-scale solar installations \u2014 an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 238,121 GWh of electricity from utility- and small-scale solar installations combined. This is an increase of 33,042 GWh or 16% compared to 2022.\nFigure 1: National solar electricity generation (GWh) in 2023 by state\nThe EIA considers a solar installation to be \u201csmall-scale\u201d if it has less than 1 MW of capacity. Most residential or commercial rooftop solar installations are small-scale, along with most community solar projects (those that provide electricity to multiple residents or businesses in an area).\nSmall-scale solar installations account for an estimated 48 GW (around 34%) of all solar capacity in the U.S. at the end of 2023. Nearly 8 GW of new small-scale solar capacity was brought online in 2023, representing a record 20% increase compared to 2022.\nDuring the past decade, small-scale solar capacity and generation have grown steadily, but at a slower pace than utility-scale. Small-scale capacity in 2023 was more than six times the amount compared to 2014; utility-scale saw an eight-fold increase. The EIA estimates that small-scale solar capacity could grow to 55 GW by the end of 2024.\nSmall-scale solar produced an estimated 73,619 GWh or about 31% of all solar generation in 2023 \u2014 compared to 164,502 GWh generated by utility-scale installations.\nCalifornia generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023, which accounts for around 41% of the state's total solar electricity generation for the year. On the East Coast, New York generated the most electricity from small-scale solar in 2023 (3,973 GWh) \u2014 accounting for nearly 62% of electricity generated from solar that year in the state. In the middle of the country, wind is typically a bigger source of electricity than solar; however, Illinois was the 10th highest small-scale solar generating state in 2023, with 1,536 GWh of electricity from small-scale operations \u2014 accounting for 44% of the state\u2019s solar electricity.\nUtility-scale solar accounts for around 8% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources (including renewables, nuclear, [1] and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas). In 2023, nearly4% of electricity in the U.S. was produced by utility-scale solar. A decade earlier in 2014, it accounted for less than 0.5% of the total electricity generated.\nCalifornia and Nevada are among the states for which utility-scale solar comprises a significant portion of the current electricity mix. In 2023, utility-scale solar contributed 19% (40,714 GWh) of electricity in California and 23% (9,733 GWh) of the electricity in Nevada.\nNevada\u2019s capacity for solar power is projected to increase during 2024, as the Gemini solar facility is scheduled to come online. The facility will add a planned 690 MW of solar capacity and 380 MW of battery storage \u2013 which is one way solar power facilities can capture and store some energy to meet evening electricity demand. It\u2019s expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational.\nNote: These data reflect total utility-scale energy sources only and exclude small-scale solar.\nSolar energy projects are bringing jobs and skills training to Nevada.

Texas added 4,996 MW of capacity (37% annual increase) and generated 6,302 GWh more than the previous year (25% annual increase).\nCalifornia followed with an addition of 4,714 MW of solar capacity \u2014 a 15% increase from 2022. The state produced 5,906 GWh more (9% increase) than the year before.\nState\nSolar Capacity (MW) 2023\nSolar Capacity Growth\n2022 to 2023\nSolar Generation (GWh) 2023\nSolar Generation Growth\n2022 to 2023\nCalifornia\n36,461\n15%\n68,816\n9%\nTexas\n18,476\n37%\n31,739\n25%\nFlorida\n10,352\n33%\n17,809\n28%\nNorth Carolina\n7,150\n11%\n12,085\n2%\nArizona\n5,848\n14%\n11,778\n6%\nUnited States total\n139,012\n23%\n238,121\n16%\nA Decade of Solar Growth Across the US 2014-2023 #\nThe U.S. added more than 121 GW of utility- and small-scale solar capacity in total during the last decade \u2014 an increase of around 688% (Figure 2). This means there was nearly eight times more solar capacity in 2023 than in 2014.\nThe amount of electricity produced from solar increased at a similar rate. In 2023, the U.S. generated over eight times more electricity from solar energy than in 2014 \u2014 an increase of more than 209,197 GWh or 723%.\nThe states with the most significant growth in solar capacity over the last 10 years include: California, which added 27,864 MW from 2014 to 2023; Texas (18,179 MW); Florida (10,203 MW); North Carolina (6,416 MW); and Nevada (4,313 MW).\nThese five states saw the most growth in generation, too (Table 2). Present-day data on solar capacity and generation reflect these strong historical growth trends, as these states were among the highest solar-generating states in 2023.\nState\nSolar Capacity Growth (MW)\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Capacity Growth\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Generation Growth (GWh)\n2014 to 2023\nSolar Generation Growth\n2014 to 2023\nCalifornia\n27,864\n324%\n54,210\n371%\nTexas\n18,179\n6,124%\n31,293\n7,016%\nFlorida\n10,203\n6,858%\n17,448\n4,833%\nNorth Carolina\n6,416\n874%\n11,282\n1,405%\nNevada\n4,313\n647%\n10,305\n922%\nUnited States total\n121,363\n688%\n209,197\n723%\nSolar and wind installations produce energy daily, year-round. Seasonal weather plays an important role. The amount of electricity generated is influenced, in part, by when the sun shines or the wind blows.\nSolar generation in the U.S. peaks in the summer, when days are long and the sun\u2019s rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly. In 2023, solar electricity produced from utility- and small-scale installations (combined) peaked (Figure 3) in July (26,626 GWh) and August (25,372 GWh).\nWind energy generation is typically highest during the spring. In 2023, the most wind energy was produced across the U.S. in March (44,580 GWh) and April (43,072 GWh) (Figure 4).\n01 / 01\nFigure 3: Monthly solar generation (GWh) in the U.S. in 2023. During 2023, U.S. solar electricity generation peaked in July (26,626 GWh).\nClimate Central\u2019s WeatherPower\u2122 tool produces daily estimates and forecasts of local solar and wind generation across the continental U.S. Daily forecasts from WeatherPower reflect the influence of weather on local solar and wind generation. WeatherPower data provide a snapshot of solar and wind energy across the U.S., at local scales, on any given day. It can be used to generate figures relevant to any state, media market, county, or congressional district in the continental U.S.\nThis WeatherPower graphic shows estimates and forecasts for solar generation in North Carolina in March 2024.\nWIND #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 148 GW from utility-scale onshore and offshore wind installations \u2014 an increase of 6 GW or 4% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 425,235 GWh of electricity from utility-scale wind installations. This represents a slight drop of 9,062 GWh or 2% compared to 2022 due to lower average wind speeds, mostly in the Midwest.\nMost wind energy in the U.S. is produced onshore, in the middle of the country. However coastal states can take advantage of offshore winds to generate electricity. Offshore wind currently makes up a small portion of the national electricity mix, but it has the potential to grow substantially in the coming decades.\nIn 2023, only two states (Rhode Island and Virginia) had operational offshore wind facilities, which contributed 42 MW to the total national wind capacity (148 GW). Offshore wind capacity has already grown early in 2024. Vineyard Wind, a wind installation off the coast of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, began operating in February 2024 with 68 MW of capacity. This facility will have 800 MW of capacity when fully operational, which could happen as soon as late 2024. In March 2024, South Fork Wind Farm off the coasts of New York and Rhode Island began operating with around 130 MW of capacity \u2014 making it the country\u2019s largest operational offshore wind installation.\nRising costs have challenged the economic viability of offshore wind installations, delaying some projects. Financial incentives such as those in the Inflation Reduction Act could ease some of the economic burden. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, state policies are poised to support development of nearly 43 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040. Offshore wind projects across more than a dozen coastal states are in various stages of approval or construction.\nLearn more about offshore wind in the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Offshore Wind Market Report: 2023 Edition\nWind accounts for around 12% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources (including renewables and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas).\nIn 2023, around 10%of electricity in the U.S. was produced by wind. A decade earlier in 2014, wind accounted for 4% of the total electricity generated.\nThe EIA forecasts that electricity generation from wind will grow by 6% in 2024, while coal and natural gas will continue to decline.\nFor Iowa and South Dakota, wind comprises more than half of the current electricity mix. In 2023, wind generated almost 60% (41,869 GWh) of electricity in Iowa and about 55% (9,389 GWh) in South Dakota.\nAlthough Texas leads the way in wind power \u2014 generating almost three times more than the next biggest wind energy-producing state \u2014 electricity generated from wind made up a more modest 22% of the Texas\u2019 electricity mix in 2023.\nMost wind energy in the U.S. is produced onshore, in the middle of the country.

As part of its commitment, the U.S. has set the following goals:\nBy 2030: reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels\nBy 2035: reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity\nBy 2050: achieving a net-zero emissions economy\nRecent landmark laws are fostering renewable energy growth and moving the U.S. toward its climate goals. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) contains hundreds of billions of dollars to boost clean energy and cut emissions. The IRA includes provisions such as tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives for renewable energy projects from the utility-scale to individual households.\nThe Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT), a project led by Princeton University scientists, estimates the potential impact of these policies, and tracks progress towards U.S. climate targets.By 2030, REPEAT estimates U.S. net annual emissions could be as low as 4.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2e), compared to 6.6 Gt CO2e in 2005: a reduction of around 40% compared to 2005 levels. Although this represents significant progress, the U.S. would still fall short of its 2030 target (50% below 2005 levels) (Figure 7).Solar and wind energy are key to reducing emissions and reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. If current policies are taken advantage of, a boom in solar and wind energy capacity is expected based on REPEAT analysis. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority (more than 50%) of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (Figure 8).In 12 states, wind and solar could make up over 80% of electricity capacity by 2035 by utilizing current policies. And New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming could have over 90% of their electricity capacity from wind and solar by 2035.\nExplore more data: State Solar and Wind Boom to Bring U.S. Toward Climate Targets\nMethodology #\nAll national and state-level data come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values for 2014-2022 are as reported in EIA\u2019s Historical State Data for each year. For 2023, utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values are for December 2023 as reported in EIA\u2019s Electric Power Monthly. Small-scale solar capacity for 2014-2022 are for December of each year, as reported in form EIA-861M. All generation values (wind, utility- and small-scale solar) for 2014-2022 come from EIA\u2019s electricity data browser.\nTo calculate the portion of total capacity and electricity generation contributed by solar and wind (as a percentage), we compared electricity capacity/generation for utility-scale solar and wind to all fuel sources and all energy sectors at the utility-scale level, which includes: renewable sources; nuclear; and fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar and wind 10-year growth is a direct comparison between capacity/generation in 2014 and 2023.\nClimate Central is an independent group of scientists and communicators who research and report the facts about our changing climate and how it affects people\u2019s lives.\nClimate Central is a policy-neutral 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\nNewsletter signup\nLooking for Climate Matters?

Climate change will probably affect the value of rooftop solar through impacts on rooftop solar generation and cooling demand, but no studies have quantified this effect. In this study, we quantified household-level effects of climate change on rooftop solar value and techno-economically optimal capacity by integrating empirical demand data for over 2,000 US households across 17 cities, household-level simulation and optimization models, and downscaled weather data for historic and future climates. We found that climate change will increase the value of rooftop solar to households by up to 19% and increase techno-economically optimal household capacity by up to 25% by the end of the century under a Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario. This increased value is robust across cities, households, future warming scenarios and retail tariff structures. Researchers, installers and policymakers should capture this increasing value to maximize household and system value of rooftop solar.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n$29.99 /\u00c2\u00a030\u00c2\u00a0days\ncancel any time\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nThe economic commitment of climate change\nSystematic review and meta-analysis of ex-post evaluations on the effectiveness of carbon pricing\nThe refinery of the future\nData availability\nThe individual hourly cooling behaviour data can be obtained from Ecobee upon request38.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Climate Central\u2019s Program on Sea Level Rise provides information about sea level rise and coastal flood hazards. Climate Matters helps meteorologists and journalists report on climate impacts and solutions. The Partnership Journalism program collaborates with local newsrooms nationwide. The report 'A Decade of Growth in Solar and Wind Power: Trends Across the U.S.' shows that America's capacity to generate carbon-free electricity grew during 2023, with solar and wind accounting for more of the energy mix than ever before. In 2023, the U.S. generated 238,121 GWh of electricity from solar, more than eight times the amount in 2014. Wind power more than doubled, with 425,325 GWh generated in 2023. California and Texas were the top producers of solar power, with 68,816 GWh and 31,739 GWh respectively. Texas also led in wind power with 119,836 GWh. The report includes data on solar and wind power increases from 2022 to 2023, growth trends over the past decade, and the biggest producers of solar and wind energy. By the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 GW from solar installations, a 23% increase from 2022. Small-scale solar installations accounted for 48 GW of this capacity. California generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023. Utility-scale solar contributed 19% of California's electricity in 2023. The Gemini solar facility in Nevada is expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational. Wind energy generation in the U.S. peaked in March 2023 with 44,580 GWh. By the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 148 GW from wind installations. Offshore wind capacity grew early in 2024 with the Vineyard Wind and South Fork Wind Farm projects. Wind accounted for around 12% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources in 2023. Texas led in wind capacity and generation growth from 2022 to 2023. The U.S. added more than 83 GW of wind capacity during the last decade, an increase of around 130%. The U.S. aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. Recent laws like the Inflation Reduction Act are fostering renewable energy growth. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Climate change will impact the value and optimal adoption of residential rooftop solar. Rooftop solar adoption is critical for residential decarbonization and hinges on its value to households. Climate change will probably affect the value of rooftop solar through impacts on rooftop solar generation and cooling demand, but no studies have quantified this effect. In this study, we quantified household-level effects of climate change on rooftop solar value and techno-economically optimal capacity by integrating empirical demand data for over 2,000 US households across 17 cities, household-level simulation and optimization models, and downscaled weather data for historic and future climates. We found that climate change will increase the value of rooftop solar to households by up to 19% and increase techno-economically optimal household capacity by up to 25% by the end of the century under a Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario. This increased value is robust across cities, households, future warming scenarios and retail tariff structures. Researchers, installers and policymakers should capture this increasing value to maximize household and system value of rooftop solar.",

As the power grid grows to meet increasing electricity demand in the coming decades, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that most of the nation\u2019s new energy capacity will come from renewables like solar and wind \u2013 shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.\nLow-carbon renewable energy sources such as solar and wind provide electricity without producing heat-trapping gases or other air pollutants. Renewable energy projects create jobs, support local economies, and help meet U.S. commitments to reduce carbon pollution.\nSolar and wind are the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the U.S. In 2019, wind generation surpassed the amount of electricity generated from hydropower \u2014 a longtime leader in renewable energy. In 2022, solar overtook hydropower for the first time. Solar and wind energy will lead the growth in U.S. power generation for at least the next two years, according to EIA estimates.\nThis report uses data from the EIA to analyze solar and wind capacity and generation over the past decade (2014 to 2023) in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Recent data are compared across states and against historical figures to show which states have led growth in solar and wind energy.\nThe key terms in this report \u2014 capacity and generation \u2014 gauge renewable energy in the U.S.\nCapacity reflects the number and size of operational solar and wind installations. Renewable energy in the U.S. comes from both large utility-scale power plants and small-scale installations (which have less than 1 megawatt of capacity).\nGeneration reflects how much electricity is produced by those installations, which depends on the weather and number of daily sunlight hours.See Box 1. Key Terms for more details.\nTogether, capacity and generation data provide insight into renewable energy growth, by showing the new capacity that comes online each year as well as the amount of electricity generated with new installations.\nDownload datasets with all variables included in this report.\nCapacity: measure of the maximum rate at which electricity can be generated by equipment on the ground, reported here in megawatts (MW) for state totals and gigawatts (GW) (equal to 1,000 MW) for national totals.\nGeneration: the amount of electricity produced over a period of time, reported here in gigawatt-hours (GWh) (equal to 1,000 megawatt-hours). For reference, the average American household consumed 10.8 MWh of electricity in 2022.\nSmall-scale installations: power operations with less than 1 MW of capacity, usually located onsite or near where the electricity is used (e.g., residential rooftop solar panels or community solar projects). Note: The only small-scale installations discussed in this report are for solar power.\nUtility-scale installations: power plants with at least 1 MW of capacity.\nLearn more about U.S. electricity capacity and generation from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n01 / 01\nSOLAR #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 gigawatts from utility- and small-scale solar installations \u2014 an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 238,121 GWh of electricity from utility- and small-scale solar installations combined. This is an increase of 33,042 GWh or 16% compared to 2022.\nFigure 1: National solar electricity generation (GWh) in 2023 by state\nThe EIA considers a solar installation to be \u201csmall-scale\u201d if it has less than 1 MW of capacity. Most residential or commercial rooftop solar installations are small-scale, along with most community solar projects (those that provide electricity to multiple residents or businesses in an area).\nSmall-scale solar installations account for an estimated 48 GW (around 34%) of all solar capacity in the U.S. at the end of 2023. Nearly 8 GW of new small-scale solar capacity was brought online in 2023, representing a record 20% increase compared to 2022.\nDuring the past decade, small-scale solar capacity and generation have grown steadily, but at a slower pace than utility-scale. Small-scale capacity in 2023 was more than six times the amount compared to 2014; utility-scale saw an eight-fold increase. The EIA estimates that small-scale solar capacity could grow to 55 GW by the end of 2024.\nSmall-scale solar produced an estimated 73,619 GWh or about 31% of all solar generation in 2023 \u2014 compared to 164,502 GWh generated by utility-scale installations.\nCalifornia generated the most electricity from small-scale operations (28,102 GWh) in 2023, which accounts for around 41% of the state's total solar electricity generation for the year. On the East Coast, New York generated the most electricity from small-scale solar in 2023 (3,973 GWh) \u2014 accounting for nearly 62% of electricity generated from solar that year in the state. In the middle of the country, wind is typically a bigger source of electricity than solar; however, Illinois was the 10th highest small-scale solar generating state in 2023, with 1,536 GWh of electricity from small-scale operations \u2014 accounting for 44% of the state\u2019s solar electricity.\nUtility-scale solar accounts for around 8% of the nation\u2019s capacity from all utility-scale electricity sources (including renewables, nuclear, [1] and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas). In 2023, nearly4% of electricity in the U.S. was produced by utility-scale solar. A decade earlier in 2014, it accounted for less than 0.5% of the total electricity generated.\nCalifornia and Nevada are among the states for which utility-scale solar comprises a significant portion of the current electricity mix. In 2023, utility-scale solar contributed 19% (40,714 GWh) of electricity in California and 23% (9,733 GWh) of the electricity in Nevada.\nNevada\u2019s capacity for solar power is projected to increase during 2024, as the Gemini solar facility is scheduled to come online. The facility will add a planned 690 MW of solar capacity and 380 MW of battery storage \u2013 which is one way solar power facilities can capture and store some energy to meet evening electricity demand. It\u2019s expected to be the largest solar energy project in the U.S. once fully operational.\nNote: These data reflect total utility-scale energy sources only and exclude small-scale solar.\nSolar energy projects are bringing jobs and skills training to Nevada.

Texas added 4,996 MW of capacity (37% annual increase) and generated 6,302 GWh more than the previous year (25% annual increase).\nCalifornia followed with an addition of 4,714 MW of solar capacity \u2014 a 15% increase from 2022. The state produced 5,906 GWh more (9% increase) than the year before.\nState\nSolar Capacity (MW) 2023\nSolar Capacity Growth\n2022 to 2023\nSolar Generation (GWh) 2023\nSolar Generation Growth\n2022 to 2023\nCalifornia\n36,461\n15%\n68,816\n9%\nTexas\n18,476\n37%\n31,739\n25%\nFlorida\n10,352\n33%\n17,809\n28%\nNorth Carolina\n7,150\n11%\n12,085\n2%\nArizona\n5,848\n14%\n11,778\n6%\nUnited States total\n139,012\n23%\n238,121\n16%\nA Decade of Solar Growth Across the US 2014-2023 #\nThe U.S. added more than 121 GW of utility- and small-scale solar capacity in total during the last decade \u2014 an increase of around 688% (Figure 2). This means there was nearly eight times more solar capacity in 2023 than in 2014.\nThe amount of electricity produced from solar increased at a similar rate. In 2023, the U.S. generated over eight times more electricity from solar energy than in 2014 \u2014 an increase of more than 209,197 GWh or 723%.\nThe states with the most significant growth in solar capacity over the last 10 years include: California, which added 27,864 MW from 2014 to 2023; Texas (18,179 MW); Florida (10,203 MW); North Carolina (6,416 MW); and Nevada (4,313 MW).\nThese five states saw the most growth in generation, too (Table 2).

Seasonal weather plays an important role. The amount of electricity generated is influenced, in part, by when the sun shines or the wind blows.\nSolar generation in the U.S. peaks in the summer, when days are long and the sun\u2019s rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly. In 2023, solar electricity produced from utility- and small-scale installations (combined) peaked (Figure 3) in July (26,626 GWh) and August (25,372 GWh).\nWind energy generation is typically highest during the spring. In 2023, the most wind energy was produced across the U.S. in March (44,580 GWh) and April (43,072 GWh) (Figure 4).\n01 / 01\nFigure 3: Monthly solar generation (GWh) in the U.S. in 2023.

WeatherPower data provide a snapshot of solar and wind energy across the U.S., at local scales, on any given day. It can be used to generate figures relevant to any state, media market, county, or congressional district in the continental U.S.\nThis WeatherPower graphic shows estimates and forecasts for solar generation in North Carolina in March 2024.\nWIND #\nBy the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 148 GW from utility-scale onshore and offshore wind installations \u2014 an increase of 6 GW or 4% from 2022.\nDuring 2023, the U.S. produced an estimated 425,235 GWh of electricity from utility-scale wind installations. This represents a slight drop of 9,062 GWh or 2% compared to 2022 due to lower average wind speeds, mostly in the Midwest.\nMost wind energy in the U.S. is produced onshore, in the middle of the country. However coastal states can take advantage of offshore winds to generate electricity. Offshore wind currently makes up a small portion of the national electricity mix, but it has the potential to grow substantially in the coming decades.\nIn 2023, only two states (Rhode Island and Virginia) had operational offshore wind facilities, which contributed 42 MW to the total national wind capacity (148 GW). Offshore wind capacity has already grown early in 2024. Vineyard Wind, a wind installation off the coast of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, began operating in February 2024 with 68 MW of capacity. This facility will have 800 MW of capacity when fully operational, which could happen as soon as late 2024. In March 2024, South Fork Wind Farm off the coasts of New York and Rhode Island began operating with around 130 MW of capacity \u2014 making it the country\u2019s largest operational offshore wind installation.\nRising costs have challenged the economic viability of offshore wind installations, delaying some projects. Financial incentives such as those in the Inflation Reduction Act could ease some of the economic burden. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, state policies are poised to support development of nearly 43 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040.

As part of its commitment, the U.S. has set the following goals:\nBy 2030: reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels\nBy 2035: reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity\nBy 2050: achieving a net-zero emissions economy\nRecent landmark laws are fostering renewable energy growth and moving the U.S. toward its climate goals. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) contains hundreds of billions of dollars to boost clean energy and cut emissions. The IRA includes provisions such as tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives for renewable energy projects from the utility-scale to individual households.\nThe Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit (REPEAT), a project led by Princeton University scientists, estimates the potential impact of these policies, and tracks progress towards U.S. climate targets.By 2030, REPEAT estimates U.S. net annual emissions could be as low as 4.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2e), compared to 6.6 Gt CO2e in 2005: a reduction of around 40% compared to 2005 levels. Although this represents significant progress, the U.S. would still fall short of its 2030 target (50% below 2005 levels) (Figure 7).Solar and wind energy are key to reducing emissions and reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. If current policies are taken advantage of, a boom in solar and wind energy capacity is expected based on REPEAT analysis. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority (more than 50%) of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (Figure 8).In 12 states, wind and solar could make up over 80% of electricity capacity by 2035 by utilizing current policies. And New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming could have over 90% of their electricity capacity from wind and solar by 2035.\nExplore more data: State Solar and Wind Boom to Bring U.S. Toward Climate Targets\nMethodology #\nAll national and state-level data come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values for 2014-2022 are as reported in EIA\u2019s Historical State Data for each year. For 2023, utility-scale solar and wind summer capacity values are for December 2023 as reported in EIA\u2019s Electric Power Monthly. Small-scale solar capacity for 2014-2022 are for December of each year, as reported in form EIA-861M. All generation values (wind, utility- and small-scale solar) for 2014-2022 come from EIA\u2019s electricity data browser.\nTo calculate the portion of total capacity and electricity generation contributed by solar and wind (as a percentage), we compared electricity capacity/generation for utility-scale solar and wind to all fuel sources and all energy sectors at the utility-scale level, which includes: renewable sources; nuclear; and fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar and wind 10-year growth is a direct comparison between capacity/generation in 2014 and 2023.\nClimate Central is an independent group of scientists and communicators who research and report the facts about our changing climate and how it affects people\u2019s lives.\nClimate Central is a policy-neutral 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\nNewsletter signup\nLooking for Climate Matters?

Data is from the second half of 2023.\nCosts and trends in Arizona\nAccording to EnergySage, the average home solar power system size in Arizona at the end of 2023 was 12.4kW. A greater reliance on air conditioning results in higher average household electricity use in Arizona than in some parts of the country, requiring slightly larger solar systems than the national average of 11.6kW. \nHowever, the low cost per watt of Arizona solar makes systems there cost-effective. The federal solar tax credit can reduce the upfront cost for solar by as much as 30%, bringing the typical cost down to $19,898. State incentives can further lower the cost.\nThe average payback period for a solar system in Arizona is 11 years, according to June 2024 data from EnergySage, with 20-year savings on an average system estimated at $19,628. Solar costs in Arizona, already the lowest in the nation per watt, have been trending down, dropping by 2% between the first and second half of 2023, according to EnergySage. [0]EnergySage. Solar & Storage Marketplace Report 2023.View all sources \n\u00bb MORE: Best solar companies\nState incentives and policy in Arizona\nAs in many states, the biggest solar incentive for Arizona homeowners is the federal solar tax credit, or residential clean energy credit, which provides a credit of up to 30% of the cost of your solar power system. \nState incentives\nOn the state level, Arizona encouraged solar installations with policies like the 2006 Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, which required Arizona utilities to source 15% of their energy from renewable sources. Of that amount, 30% was required to come from distributed sources like rooftop solar. \nOver time, many of these incentives have been phased out as rooftop solar adoption has increased in the state, and new fees have been imposed on solar customers. But Arizonans can still benefit from certain incentives and protections:\nIn addition to the federal solar tax credit, the Arizona Solar Energy Credit provides a credit of 25% of the cost of a solar system on your state income tax bill, up to a $1,000 maximum.

Solar Energy Devices.View all sources \nYou can find more local benefits on the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE), a project maintained by the North Carolina State University.\nNet metering\nAs part of a trend across the nation, Arizona\u2019s net metering (NEM) program, which gave solar customers credit on their electric bill for any unused electricity their system sent back to the power grid, has been phased out. In 2016 the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC), which regulates many of the utilities in the state, replaced Arizona\u2019s NEM program with a net billing program known as the Resource Comparison Proxy (RCP). \nThe RCP compensates solar customers at a lower rate than NEM did for excess power they send to the grid, under a tiered step-down that can go down up to 10% per year, eventually arriving at the \u201cavoided cost\u201d rate, according to Autumn T. Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association (AriSEIA). The avoided cost rate is much lower than the retail rate of electricity, representing the cost a utility avoids by using solar customers\u2019 excess solar instead of producing that electricity themselves or purchasing it elsewhere. \nEach utility does its own avoided cost calculation, so your RCP export rate will depend on your utility. As of September 2023, the export rates for Arizona Public Service and Tucson Electric Power were 7.619 cents/kWh and 6.33 cents/kWh, respectively. But Salt River Project, a large utility that is not regulated by the ACC, was able to drop the export rate dramatically to 2.81 cents/kWh. \n\u201cGiven the current RCP structure, it\u2019s better to go solar sooner rather than later, because the longer you wait, the lower the export rate is,\u201d says Johnson. \nEnergy storage in Arizona\nHome solar batteries cost an average of $8,526 in Arizona after the federal tax credit, according to EnergySage. [0]EnergySage. Solar battery cost: Why they're not always worth it.View all sources But they can be well worth the cost, especially in Arizona:\nBatteries improve the economics of home solar under net billing because instead of sending excess energy back to the grid at a lower credit, you can store the energy to use later.\nMost Arizona solar customers are required to be on a time-of-use (TOU) electricity rate, under which electricity rates are lower at times of low demand and higher at times of high demand. You may use more electricity in your home when you return home from work, demand is high, and the sun is going down so your panels are generating less electricity. A battery can lower your costs by storing the electricity your panels generate during the day for your use in the evening.\nSome of the TOU rate plans in Arizona include demand charges, which are based on spikes in your energy demand. Your home could be using a relatively small amount of energy, but spikes during these times can increase your electricity bill dramatically. As with TOU rates, batteries can lower demand charges significantly by storing electricity that you can use during peak use times.\nWith more heat waves straining the power grid, batteries provide reliable energy backup. Solar alone won\u2019t keep your home powered during an outage, because systems are designed to shut off if there\u2019s an outage to ensure the safety of utility workers.\nLike solar costs, battery costs are expected to keep falling, and technologies are constantly improving. Arizona is beginning to offer residential customers demand response programs, which help avoid strain on the power grid by incentivizing customers to shift their energy use to times when demand is lower. With a home solar battery, you can get the most out of these programs. \nRead more about solar panel costs, incentives and policies in these states:\nCalifornia\nTexas\nFlorida\nColorado\nNorth Carolina\nLouisiana\nCan I get financing for a solar panel system?\nIn addition to tax incentives and rebates, there are options available. Many solar installers offer financing, but you may also be able to finance your solar investment through a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC). These options may have lower interest rates than financing with an installer, future opportunities for refinancing and possible tax benefits.\nHome equity loans and HELOCs are ways to borrow against the value of your home, converting equity into cash. With a home equity loan, you receive a lump-sum payment and then pay it back at a fixed interest rate over an agreed period of time, typically from five to 30 years. HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You\u2019ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you're using your home as collateral.\nFigure: NMLS#1717824\nBetter: NMLS#330511\nQuicken Loans: NMLS#3030\n85%\n90%\n90%\n640\n680\n680\nNational\nNational\nNational\n\u00bb COMPARE: Pros and cons of home equity loans and HELOCs\nAnother option is a solar loan. Many banks, credit unions and online lenders offer these to fund solar panels and installation, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000, and annual percentage rates ranging from 6% to 36%. They function like a personal loan: you receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. And unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral required for a solar loan. This means your home or solar panels aren\u2019t at risk if you miss payments, but you may have to pay late fees.\nSo, yes, you likely can get financing. If you go this route, compare interest rates, terms and fees with any financing package that a solar provider may offer you to ensure you get the best deal.\nTo get cost estimates for solar for your home, you can contact local solar installers and get free quotes; it\u2019s a good idea to get a few quotes to compare, and Solar United Neighbors can help you do the comparison.

Climate Matters helps meteorologists and journalists report on climate impacts and solutions. The Partnership Journalism program collaborates with local newsrooms nationwide. A report from April 3, 2024, titled 'A Decade of Growth in Solar and Wind Power: Trends Across the U.S.' shows that America's capacity to generate carbon-free electricity grew during 2023. Solar and wind energy have seen significant growth over the past decade. In 2023, the U.S. generated 238,121 GWh from solar and 425,325 GWh from wind. Texas led the country in wind power generation with 119,836 GWh in 2023. The report also highlights the increase in solar and wind power from 2022 to 2023, growth trends over the past decade, and the states that are the biggest producers of solar and wind energy. The U.S. had an estimated total capacity of 139 GW from solar and 148 GW from wind by the end of 2023. Solar generation peaked in July and August 2023, while wind generation was highest in March and April 2023. Texas generated 119,836 GWh of wind energy in 2023, with the most wind energy produced in March (44,580 GWh) and April (43,072 GWh). The EIA forecasts that electricity generation from wind will grow by 6% in 2024. Offshore wind capacity is expected to grow substantially in the coming decades. The U.S. aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030, reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, and achieve a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Recent laws like the Inflation Reduction Act are fostering renewable energy growth. By 2035, solar and wind could make up a majority of state energy capacity in 46 of the 48 contiguous states.",

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago.

    "Document2": "Watch CBS News\nGet Ready For Higher Electric Bills, Regulators Sign Off On FPL Rate Increases\n\nOctober 26, 2021 / 11:37 PM EDT\n          / CBS Miami\n        \nTALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami/NSF) - State utility regulators Tuesday approved a series of base-rate increases for Florida Power & Light that will result in higher monthly bills for customers in January.\nDespite opponents' arguments that residential and small business customers will end up subsidizing costs for some larger customers, the Public Service Commission unanimously supported a four-year rate settlement, which calls for a $692 million increase in base rates in January and another increase of $560 million in 2023. Additional increases are planned in 2024 and 2025 to pay for solar projects.\nCommission Chairman Gary Clark noted receiving more than 1,100 emails from consumers about the proposal and indicated he had concerns about ratepayers subsidizing FPL's solar expansion and a electric-vehicle charging station program. But, Clark said he understands the need for clean energy investments and pointed to other benefits of the settlement, such as predictability in rates.\n\"There are things within that predictability that I think give homeowners, give businesses some assurity going into the future, that they have a stable rate climate, they can do their budgeting accordingly,\" Clark said. \"I think that is a very positive, very positive thing.\"\nCommissioners also added a requirement for annual reports on the company's expansion of infrastructure for electric vehicles.\nFPL reached the rate settlement in August with the state Office of Public Counsel, which represents consumers; the Florida Retail Federation; the Florida Industrial Power Users Group; and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Three other parties later signed on.\nThe rate plan incorporates the merger of FPL and Northwest Florida's Gulf Power. That merger formally took effect Jan. 1, but it came with issues such as the utilities having widely different rates.\nIn a prepared statement, FPL President and CEO Eric Silagy said the deal benefits all customers by keeping \"bills low\" while \"accelerating investments in clean energy.\"\n\"Florida is a rapidly growing state on the front lines of climate change, and our customers deserve bold, decisive, long-term actions as we continue building a more resilient and sustainable energy future all of us can depend on, including future generations,\" Silagy said in the statement.\nFor customers outside of Northwest Florida who use 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month, bills are expected to go from the current $101.70 to $113.85 in January. Those bills would increase to $115.52 in 2023, $116.05 in 2024, and $117.02 in 2025. In addition to base rates, the totals include costs for such things as natural gas for power plants.\nThe plan uses what is described as a \"transition rider\" to take into account the substantially different rates that FPL and Gulf have charged. The result will leave Northwest Florida customers paying more than FPL customers in other areas.\nUnder the plan, Gulf residential customers who use 1,000 kilowatt hours a month will see their bills go from the current $129.24 to $137.49 in January. They then would see the bills decrease to $134.44 in 2023, $130.25 in 2024 and $126.47 in 2025.\nFPL filed a base-rate proposal in March and then negotiated the settlement, which trimmed the original proposal by about $428 million. The settlement, in part, reduced a targeted return on equity --- a closely watched measure of profitability --- from 11.5 percent to 10.6 percent.\n\"I believe that all of the parties are to be commended for the outstanding job that you did, negotiating on behalf of the folks that you represented,\" Clark said. \"It's pretty obvious some of you did a little better job than others.\"\nBut the settlement was opposed by Floridians Against Increased Rates, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising, which have members who are residential customers of FPL.\nThose groups argued, in part, that the plan will require residential and small business customers to subsidize the rates of large commercial and industrial customers.\n\"To put it succinctly, a settlement that includes so much wasteful spending to double down on fossil fuels, that transfers so much wealth from residential customers to commercial and industrial customers, and that literally leaves residential customers worse off than in FPL's original proposal, cannot be in the public interest,\" attorneys for the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising wrote in an Oct. 11 brief. \"This 'settlement' gives FPL everything they want --- and more.\"\nThe agreement addresses a series of solar-energy issues, which FPL said will support the development of 16 million solar panels at more than 50 sites across Florida. FPL has been operating under a base-rate settlement that took effect in January 2017 and will end in December.\n(\u00a92021 CBS Local Media. All rights reserved.

    "Document1": "Facebook (FB) Market Cap (2014-2024) History\nThis report examines the historical market capitalization of FACEBOOK INC. The analysis covers the period between 2014 and 2024. We have incorporated essential data alongside visual charts depicting quarterly and annual market capitalization figures.\nThe report is organized into three main sections, outlined below for convenient navigation.\nWhile market capitalization significantly differs from a company's book value, this metric holds significant importance. Despite being a theoretical value, market cap helps gauge investor willingness to invest in shares. It reflects investors' confidence in both present and future actions of the organization.\n 1 Chart: FACEBOOK INC Market Capitalization\nTo begin, let's explore a chart displaying the historical market capitalization values of FB. The chart encompasses 30 quarters, spanning from Q1-2015 to Q2-2022.\nPlease Note: The chart below, created using quarterly values, provides a more smoothed-out representation compared to a daily chart.\nTo construct the above graph, we computed the market capitalization using the following formula:\nMarket capitalization for a quarter is determined by multiplying the number of outstanding shares, as reported during the quarter or the preceding quarter (or as disclosed in filings), by the share price on the closing day of the corresponding period. This calculation gives you a snapshot of the company's total market value for that specific timeframe.\nConcerning outstanding shares, we utilized the diluted shares metric. This choice is motivated by the fact that diluted shares encompass not only common shares, but also various convertible instruments (such as bonds, preferred stocks, employee options, etc.) that could potentially be converted into shares in the future. The value for diluted shares can be found in an organization's quarterly and annual filings.\n 2 FB Yearly Market Capitalization\nIn this segment, you'll find a chart depicting the historical market capitalization values of FB plotted by year. The diagram below encompasses 9 years, ranging from 2014 to 2022.\nPlease note that companies usually disclose the weighted average number of diluted shares for each quarter and year. In this section, we've used the weighted number of shares reported in their annual filings (10-K). To calculate market capitalization, we've taken the straightforward approach of multiplying the number of shares by the closing share price for the relevant period.\nDisplayed below is a table presenting annual market capitalization data for FACEBOOK INC. Each row corresponds to a year, with the second column showing the market capitalization value and the third column indicating whether the value has increased or decreased compared to the previous year.\nMarket Capitalization Increase for FB over 9 Years:\nThe market capitalization of FACEBOOK INC has increased by $250.117 Billion (54.615 %) between 2014 and 2024.\nHere are the steps and formula we used to calculate the figure presented above:\nThe formula for calculating the increase/decrease in market capitalization is:\nChange Percentage = [(M2 - M1) / M2] X 100%\nWhere,\nM1 - Market Cap of FB in 2014 = $207.845 Billion\nM2 - Market Cap of FB in 2024 = $457.962 Billion\nSubstituting the values in the formula gives:\nChange in market capitalization of FACEBOOK INC as a percentage =\n(457.962 - 207.845) / 457.962 X 100% = 54.615 %Please Note: A positive sign before the result indicates an increase, and a negative sign indicates a decrease.Insight: Many individuals are keen to understand the growth of share prices (and returns) over the past several years. They believe that analyzing past growth can offer insights into future expected growth. While share price growth is valuable, market cap growth provides additional perspective. This is because market cap growth not only tracks share growth but also reflects the financial health of a company based on the number of issued shares.What Was the Peak Annual Market Capitalization for FACEBOOK INC?FACEBOOK INC achieved its highest market capitalization of $961.625 Billion during 2021.Insight: The market capitalization of a healthy company typically grows over time. Therefore, it's not uncommon for the highest cap value over a 10-year period to occur in recent quarters. However, if you find that the peak value was reached several years ago, it's worth investigating the reasons before making investment decisions.  3 FACEBOOK INC Quarterly Market CapitalizationIn the previous section, you explored a quarterly market cap chart for FACEBOOK INC.

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

    "Document2": "State of the Consumer 2024: What\u2019s now and what\u2019s next\nIf you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands.\nThese are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed.\nIn this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise\u00a0research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d\nNine trends defining the global consumer market\nTo forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth.\nWho is the future consumer?\nConsumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved.\n1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend.\nAmong this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies (Exhibit 1). This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies.\n2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age.1\u201cAgeing,\u201d United Nations, accessed May 29, 2024. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood.\nDespite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age.\nIn emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets2Forty-two percent of consumers in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.\nsaid they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe3Throughout this article, we will refer to \u201cEurope\u201d to indicate France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\nand 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk.\n3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers.\nThis intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers.\nWhat will consumers want?\nWhat consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies.\n4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers\u00a0switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups.\nIn advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts (Exhibit 2). Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior.\nThis weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers.\nOne beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality.\n5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims\u00a0outpaced sales of products without such claims.\nWhile young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023 (Exhibit 3).\nYounger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims.\n6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually.4\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\nIn advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets.\nIn emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States (Exhibit 4).\nIt\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so.\nWeight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years.\nBy 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective.5\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\n7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually\u00a0by 2040.6Kweilin Ellingrud, Lucy P\u00e9rez, Anouk Petersen, and Valentina Sartori, Closing the women\u2019s health gap: A $1 trillion opportunity to improve lives and economies, McKinsey Health Institute, January 17, 2024.\nA higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well.\nWhere will consumers shop?\nKnowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world.\n8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend.\nJust because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas.\nEmerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world.\n9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind (Exhibit 5). Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States.\nAttempts to grow the social-commerce market\u00a0in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today.7\u201cSocial commerce: The future of how consumers interact with brands,\u201d McKinsey, October 19, 2022. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months.\nFour imperatives to win the consumer of the future\nIn light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives:\nBuild microtargeting capabilities\nAbout QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey\nQuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe.\nRather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments\u00a0at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases.\nInvest in wellness\nA rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging).\nPropel the social\u2013digital experience\nCompanies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries)\u00a0become more important.\nWe see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers.\nOffer premium products where they matter\nOffering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures.\nIn this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.\nThe authors wish to thank Cait Pearson, Heather Gouinlock, and Keir Sullivan for their contributions to this article.\nThis article was edited by Alexandra Mondalek, an editor in the New York office.",
    "Summarized_Document1": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "If you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands. These are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed. In this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d Nine trends defining the global consumer market To forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth. Who is the future consumer? Consumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved. 1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend. Among this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies. This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies. 2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood. Despite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age. In emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets said they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe and 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk. 3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers. This intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers. What will consumers want? What consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies. 4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups. In advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts. Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior. This weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers. One beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality. 5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims outpaced sales of products without such claims. While young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023. Younger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims. 6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually. In advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets. In emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States. It\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so. Weight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years. By 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective. 7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually by 2040. A higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well. Where will consumers shop? Knowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world. 8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend. Just because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas. Emerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world. 9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind. Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States. Attempts to grow the social-commerce market in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months.

QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe. Rather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases. Invest in wellness A rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging). Propel the social\u2013digital experience Companies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries) become more important. We see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers. Offer premium products where they matter Offering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures. In this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.

    "Document1": "State of the Consumer 2024: What\u2019s now and what\u2019s next\nIf you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands.\nThese are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed.\nIn this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise\u00a0research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d\nNine trends defining the global consumer market\nTo forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth.\nWho is the future consumer?\nConsumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved.\n1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend.\nAmong this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies (Exhibit 1). This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies.\n2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age.1\u201cAgeing,\u201d United Nations, accessed May 29, 2024. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood.\nDespite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age.\nIn emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets2Forty-two percent of consumers in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.\nsaid they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe3Throughout this article, we will refer to \u201cEurope\u201d to indicate France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\nand 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk.\n3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers.\nThis intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers.\nWhat will consumers want?\nWhat consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies.\n4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers\u00a0switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups.\nIn advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts (Exhibit 2). Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior.\nThis weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers.\nOne beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality.\n5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims\u00a0outpaced sales of products without such claims.\nWhile young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023 (Exhibit 3).\nYounger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims.\n6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually.4\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\nIn advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets.\nIn emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States (Exhibit 4).\nIt\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so.\nWeight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years.\nBy 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective.5\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\n7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually\u00a0by 2040.6Kweilin Ellingrud, Lucy P\u00e9rez, Anouk Petersen, and Valentina Sartori, Closing the women\u2019s health gap: A $1 trillion opportunity to improve lives and economies, McKinsey Health Institute, January 17, 2024.\nA higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well.\nWhere will consumers shop?\nKnowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world.\n8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend.\nJust because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas.\nEmerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world.\n9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind (Exhibit 5). Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States.\nAttempts to grow the social-commerce market\u00a0in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today.7\u201cSocial commerce: The future of how consumers interact with brands,\u201d McKinsey, October 19, 2022. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months.\nFour imperatives to win the consumer of the future\nIn light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives:\nBuild microtargeting capabilities\nAbout QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey\nQuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document1": "If you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands. These are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed. In this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d Nine trends defining the global consumer market To forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth. Who is the future consumer? Consumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved. 1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend. Among this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies. This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies. 2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood. Despite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age. In emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets said they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe and 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk. 3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers. This intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers. What will consumers want? What consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies. 4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups. In advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts. Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior. This weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers. One beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality. 5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims outpaced sales of products without such claims. While young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023. Younger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims. 6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually. In advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets. In emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States. It\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so. Weight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years. By 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective. 7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually by 2040. A higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well. Where will consumers shop? Knowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world. 8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend. Just because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas. Emerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world. 9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind. Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States. Attempts to grow the social-commerce market in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months. Four imperatives to win the consumer of the future In light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives: Build microtargeting capabilities About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey QuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe. Rather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases. Invest in wellness A rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging). Propel the social\u2013digital experience Companies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries) become more important. We see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers. Offer premium products where they matter Offering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures. In this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.

    "Summarized_Document2": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

    "Document1": "More From Forbes\nHow Overvalued Is Tesla\u2019s Stock, Really?\nThe logo of the Tesla Inc is seen on a screen of a smartphone next to a screen with an illustration ... [+] ofthe stock market. Tesla is listed in Nasdaq. The Nasdaq is the second-largest stock exchange in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. (Photo by Alexander Pohl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nDespite Tesla\u2019s\nTSLA\nstock having lost more than 60% of its value since November 2021, recent analyst reports from JPMorgan indicate that the stock would have to drop by at least 35% more from its current level to reach fundamental value. However, a behavioral analysis of the report\u2019s methodology suggests that the number might be closer to 75% than 35%.\nTwo psychological elements underlie the behavioral analysis of the report. Both were emphasized by the late psychologist Daniel Kahneman. The first is downplaying base rates, and the second is representativeness. Base rates refer to the rates at which relevant events have occurred in the past. Representativeness is the misuse of stereotypic thinking.\nBack Of The Envelope Calculation\nWhile some investors like to dig into the details of analyst reports, many do not. For those who do not, this section presents a brief back of the envelope calculation to register the point about Tesla\u2019s potential overvaluation. Readers who just want a quick sense of the issue can read this section and skip to the conclusion.\nDuring April 2024, the JPMorgan reports on Tesla estimate that at the end of 2024, Tesla\u2019s enterprise value will be $331,483 million. A key input in arriving at this value is an estimate of the minimum level of future profitability Tesla\u2019s investors would find acceptable.\nHere acceptable profitability is measured by a rate of return, the cost of capital. Actual profitability is measured by the return on invested capital. When they are equal, the firm is said to exactly earn its cost of capital.\nBillionaire Mark Cuban Issues Post Halving Bitcoin Warning Amid\nUnprecedented\nCrypto Fee Price\nChaos\nAEW Dynasty 2024 Results\nWinners And Grades As Swerve Makes History\nWho Is David Pecker\nWhy He s Testifying Against Trump In Hush Money Trial\nThe base rate issue is that in the long run, most companies do not earn more than their cost of capital. That is, return on invested capital does not exceed the cost of capital.\nIf the JPMorgan analysts expect that Tesla will exactly earn its cost of capital going forward, then there is a straightforward calculation to estimate its fundamental value at the end of 2024: Simply divide the estimate of Tesla\u2019s 2025 value of EBIT after tax, or EBI, by Tesla\u2019s weighted average cost of capital. The report also estimates Tesla\u2019s EBIT during 2025 to be $12,792 million and its WACC to be 11.8%. The result is $108,406 million, which is roughly one third of the JPMorgan estimate.\nI suggest a reason why the JPMorgan estimate of enterprise value could be three times the estimate from the simple formula: The JPMorgan analysts assume that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital going forward. Is the assumption reasonable? The evidence presented below suggests not.\nTesla\u2019s Return On Invested Capital\nPrior to 2020, Tesla\u2019s return on invested capital was negative. In 2020, it barely turned positive. However, in 2021, it rose to 14%, then to 23% in 2022 and then dropped slightly to 20% in 2023. Therefore, in the last three years, Tesla did indeed earn more than its cost of capital.\nHowever, Tesla\u2019s situation has changed. The JPMorgan analysts gave Tesla\u2019s stock a recommendation of Underweight, indicating that Tesla\u2019s deteriorating fundamentals relate to decreased demand for its vehicles, not decreased supply. The New York Times\nNYT\ndescribes how Tesla is now facing stiff competition for electric vehicles from American, Korean, Chinese and European automobile manufacturers, such as Ford, BYD, and BMW. These firms all have big EV product lines and growing sales. Indeed, during the fourth quarter of 2023, BYD briefly became the world\u2019s largest seller of EVs.\nStandard textbooks in economics and finance clearly state that for a company to earn more than its cost of capital in the long run, it must have some sustainable competitive advantage. Companies that earn more than their costs of capital attract competitors, and competition puts downward pressure on prices and profit margins. Tesla is now cutting prices and profit margins to compete with its competitors. Going forward, this decision will place significant pressure on the company\u2019s ROIC.\nReturn On Capital, Base Rates, And Representativeness\nComputing enterprise value requires a focus on the long run. Consider this question: Over the long run, what percentage of publicly traded companies earn more than Treasury bills? This is a question about a base rate.\nFinancial economist Hank Bessembinder\u2019s work provides the answer, which is 4%. Think of 4% as the base rate. Put another way, over the long run, 96% of publicly traded stocks fail to outperform the Treasury bill rate.\nAmazon\nAMZN\nand Apple\nAAPL\nearn more than Treasury bills. In May 2017, analysts at Morgan Stanley\nMS\nmade the following statement: \u201cThe bull case on Tesla is that it can become the next Amazon or Apple.\u201d The title of the report is \u201cThe Price of Ambition: Downgrade to EW.\u201d Keep in mind that the simple valuation formula refers to companies earning their cost of capital, not earning the rate on Treasury bills. So, the question for valuing Tesla becomes whether it is reasonable to expect that going forward, the firm\u2019s ROIC will match its 11.8% cost of capital. Given the base rate, the odds are against it.\nIn respect to representativeness, Amazon and Apple serve as stereotypes. Analysts and investors rely on representativeness for their judgments when they do two things. First, they view Amazon and Apple as emblematic of companies with the highest performing stocks. Second they make valuation judgements about Tesla based on their perceptions of how representative is Tesla of the class of companies having the highest performing stocks.\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Analysis\nThe analysts at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley do not use the simple valuation EBI/WACC-formula which I described above. Instead, they use a free cash flow counterpart, which applies a multiple to an estimate of a future free cash flow. For example, the JPMorgan analysts apply a multiple of 83 to their 2025-free cash flow estimate of $2,571 million for Tesla.\nAs a general matter, applying a multiple is fine, as long as the multiple is reasonable. The thing about using 83 is that it implies an expectation that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital going forward. That is why, I suggest, the JPMorgan estimate of $100 per share for Tesla\u2019s fundamental enterprise value is too high.\nIt is straightforward to ascertain the value of the multiple corresponding to any firm exactly earning its cost of capital. First, estimate the long-term growth rate for the company\u2019s free cash flow. Call this g. Compute the ratio (1+g)/(WACC-g). Now tie g to the assumption that the firm will exactly earn its cost of capital. The textbook formula for g in this case is g = retention rate x WACC. The retention rate is the ratio of a company\u2019s capital expenditures net of depreciation to the sum of its unlevered free cash flow and capex net of depreciation.\nAnalysts routinely assume values for free cash flow growth rates that are higher than the textbook formula. Moreover, these assumptions are buried in the multiples they use. If you do the math, you will discover that JPMorgan\u2019s implicit value of g is 11% per year. The textbook formula indicates that if Tesla is expected to earn its costs of capital exactly, the corresponding value of g would be 8.4%. Using 11% for g when 8.4% is warranted is a bias known as growth opportunities bias.\nUsing 8.4% will produce an estimate of enterprise value for Tesla that is in the neighborhood of what you get using the simple EBI/WACC formula. Try it.\nTesla\u2019s free cash flows were negative until 2018. Once positive, they grew quickly through 2021. In 2020, they grew at 128.6% and in 2021 at 19.7%. However, in 2022 growth turned negative at -25.5%, and in 2023 it dropped further to -175.9%.\nSentiment\nThe upshot of the Tesla\u2019s fundamental value being so far below its market price is that Tesla\u2019s price mostly reflects optimistic sentiment. On this point, the JPMorgan report establishes a December 2024 target price for Tesla\u2019s stock of $115, not $100. In this respect, the report\u2019s methodology arrives at $115 by taking a 50-50 combination of its $100 estimate of DCF-based fundamental value and a $130 estimate based on multiples such as price-to-earnings and price-to-sales. The multiples approach captures market-wide sentiment, but not sentiment unique to Tesla.\nBehavioral asset pricing theory focuses on the decomposition of market prices into a fundamental component and a sentiment component. The target price approach I favor would place a lower weight on fundamental value computed using the EBI/WACC formula, a higher weight on the multiples approach, and the addition of a component to account for Tesla-specific sentiment.\nThe Tesla-specific component is important. For years, the JPMorgan analysts have assigned Tesla\u2019s stock a recommendation of Underweight. This was the case in July 2020 when Tesla\u2019s stock was trading at $1,592. At the time, the JPMorgan analysts\u2019 target price was $325, 80% below the market price. Its estimate of fundamental value per share was $295 and its multiple-based counterpart was $356. Remember, 2020 was a time when Tesla\u2019s free cash flow growth was high, and its ROIC had just turned positive. In July 2021, a year, later, Tesla\u2019s stock increased by 140%, vividly demonstrating the power of sentiment. It is a mistake to think that prices revert to fundamental value quickly, or even move in the right direction.\nGeneral Takeaways\nSentiment refers to biased reactions to changing fundamentals. The history of Tesla\u2019s stock illustrates just how important sentiment can be in the short-to-medium terms.\nAnalysts might serve the investing public better, for all stocks, not just Tesla, by structuring the valuation portions of their reports to decompose target prices into fundamental and sentiment components. In doing so, they could also be transparent about base rates for ROIC and free cash flow growth rates. Specifically, they can exercise caution about giving due weight to base rates and avoiding representativeness bias, in an effort to mitigate growth opportunity bias. Doing so just might lead market prices to more accurately reflect their corresponding fundamental values.\nI contacted Media Relations at JPMorgan to offer the firm an opportunity to respond to the points in this post. However, the firm\u2019s policy is not to comment on the methodology in analyst reports.",
    "Document2": "Javascript is disabled\nAMZN Stock vs. GOOG Stock: Which Is the Better Buy Today?\nAMZN stock and GOOG stock are two musts for any portfolio. But which tech behemoth is better positioned for future growth?\nAmazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) are two of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands and Wall Street\u2019s most coveted stocks, and the long-term trajectory of each blue-chip stock is still decidedly up. Plus, it\u2019s estimated that roughly 40% of all web traffic is hosted by those two companies combined. But which looks like the better buy today, AMZN stock or GOOG stock?\nBoth stocks were beaten down by the growth stock sell-off of 2022. GOOG has suffered less damage from all the selling, down 6% since the start of 2022 vs. AMZN\u2019s 13% loss. Going back a bit further, to just after the March 2020 Covid crash, the performance of both stocks has been far more palatable, with GOOG up 126% in since March 13, 2020, vs. a 63% gain for AMZN. Over the last five years, GOOG is up 156% vs. an 83% gain in AMZN.\nThose are strong returns for GOOG, especially when compared to the 64% return in the S&P 500 in the last five years. Amazon though? Not so much. Now the question is: Can AMZN and GOOG repeat or beat that performance over the next five years?\n[text_ad]\nIt would be foolish to doubt either company at this point. That said, no stock continues to grow at a breakneck pace forever. Just ask anyone who bought General Electric (GE) 10 or 15 years ago, when it ranked among the 10 largest companies in the world by market cap. So chances are, one or both of these blue-chip tech stocks will start to slow in the years ahead.\nGiven that backdrop, I thought it might be a fun exercise to examine which tech giant stock is better positioned for future growth.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at AMZN stock and GOOG stock, broken into a few key numbers:\nTrailing P/Es: AMZN 76, GOOG 26\nForward P/Es: AMZN 42, GOOG 20\nEstimated 2023 revenue growth: AMZN 11%, GOOG 8.2%\nEstimated 2023 EPS growth: AMZN 1,089%, GOOG 51.4%\nCash per share: AMZN $6.21, GOOG $9.58\nInstitutional ownership: AMZN 61%, GOOG 62%\nThat comparison tells us that AMZN is still the more overvalued stock. However, until recently it had been the faster-growing company on both the top and bottom lines; and it had been since 2016. That was also the year Amazon first turned consistently profitable.\nThat said, Google has way more cash than Amazon - nearly double in terms of total cash, with roughly a fifth as much debt. Considering that Amazon brings in nearly twice as much revenue as Google annually (though that gap is closing), that means that Amazon has been way more willing to spend its cash on things that will grow the company - the Amazon Prime Video streaming service that is rivaling Netflix these days; a new foray into live sports with NFL broadcasts; the Amazon Echo, Amazon Web Services, etc. Google looks more like a cash hoarder. The result is that Amazon stock has grown much faster than GOOG stock in the last decade, though that has certainly changed in the last two years.\nThe guess here is that Google will start loosening its purse strings in the coming years, devoting it to new, exciting products like the long-anticipated and recently released Google Pixel Watch intended to rival the Apple Watch, a new Pixel smartphone, or perhaps Google will join Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Disney in the big-money streaming video wars (YouTube did make a splash buying the NFL broadcast rights). Regardless of what it comes up with, bet on Google spending more of its $120 billion cash stockpile soon. If it does, that could capture investors\u2019 attention the way Amazon did up until the last few years.\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with either of these growth stocks. If you bought both of them five, 10 or even 15 years ago, you\u2019ve made a LOT of money. But AMZN has been the better performer, at least up until recently. I think that might change in the years to come. Between its cash stockpile, untapped potential revenue streams, and cheaper valuation, I like GOOG stock to outperform AMZN in the next five years. In fact, that shift already seems to be taking place, as the last few years have shown. It could be the start of a longer-term role reversal between two of the biggest, baddest tech stocks on the block.\nFurthermore, after such extreme selling last year, both these stocks are still trading below their 2021 levels despite a furious run-up to start this year. You could buy both (or either, although I prefer GOOG); either way, an investment in GOOG stock will likely turn out quite well five years from now.\nFor a list of the stocks that actually have momentum after a tough earnings season, consider taking a trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Trader.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Despite Tesla\u2019s stock having lost more than 60% of its value since November 2021, recent analyst reports from JPMorgan indicate that the stock would have to drop by at least 35% more from its current level to reach fundamental value. However, a behavioral analysis suggests that the number might be closer to 75% than 35%. Two psychological elements underlie this analysis: downplaying base rates and representativeness. Base rates refer to the rates at which relevant events have occurred in the past, while representativeness is the misuse of stereotypic thinking.\n\nDuring April 2024, JPMorgan reports estimated Tesla\u2019s enterprise value at the end of 2024 to be $331,483 million. A key input in this valuation is the minimum level of future profitability Tesla\u2019s investors would find acceptable, measured by the cost of capital. The report also estimates Tesla\u2019s EBIT during 2025 to be $12,792 million and its WACC to be 11.8%, resulting in a fundamental value of $108,406 million, roughly one-third of the JPMorgan estimate.\n\nTesla\u2019s return on invested capital (ROIC) was negative prior to 2020, barely positive in 2020, and rose to 14% in 2021, 23% in 2022, and slightly dropped to 20% in 2023. However, Tesla now faces stiff competition from other EV manufacturers, leading to price cuts and pressure on profit margins. This competition challenges the assumption that Tesla will continue to earn more than its cost of capital.\n\nFinancial economist Hank Bessembinder\u2019s work shows that only 4% of publicly traded companies earn more than Treasury bills in the long run. Given this base rate, it is unlikely that Tesla will continue to outperform. Analysts often use representativeness, comparing Tesla to high-performing companies like Amazon and Apple, which can lead to biased valuations.\n\nJPMorgan and Morgan Stanley analysts use a discounted free cash flow analysis, applying a multiple to future free cash flow estimates. JPMorgan\u2019s multiple of 83 implies an expectation that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital. However, using a more conservative growth rate of 8.4% instead of 11% would produce a lower enterprise value estimate.\n\nTesla\u2019s free cash flows were negative until 2018, grew quickly through 2021, but turned negative in 2022 and 2023. The JPMorgan report sets a December 2024 target price for Tesla\u2019s stock at $115, combining a $100 estimate of fundamental value and a $130 estimate based on market sentiment. Behavioral asset pricing theory suggests that Tesla\u2019s market price reflects optimistic sentiment rather than fundamental value.\n\nIn summary, sentiment plays a significant role in Tesla\u2019s stock price. Analysts should decompose target prices into fundamental and sentiment components, be transparent about base rates, and avoid representativeness bias to provide more accurate valuations.",

Contributing factors include growing healthcare costs, stricter payer reimbursement policies, and claims processing errors. Providers are seeing an uptick in nonpayment, plus an added burden on administrative staff, disrupted patient care, and hits to the bottom line.\nExperian Health surveyed over 200 healthcare professionals, primarily in executive or management roles, to better understand the current state of claims. The findings of the State of Claims 2024 report break down the latest health insurance claim denial statistics, reasons for denials, and providers\u2019 concerns about reimbursement.\nRising healthcare costs: who will foot the bill?\nThe U.S. healthcare system is the most expensive in the world, and costs continue to rise. In 2022, healthcare spending reached $4.5 trillion, a threefold increase from $1.4 trillion in 2000. In 2023, costs rose 7.5% to $4.8 trillion. Paying for healthcare is becoming more and more out of reach for patients and causing great concern. Over three-quarters (77%) of providers worry patients will skip out on their medical bills.\nPayer reimbursement challenges are also weighing heavily on healthcare leaders\u2019 minds. More than 75% are worried about nonpayment due to ever-evolving payer policy changes. They also have concerns about the pre-authorization struggles that have continued since 2022, as reported in the State of Claims 2022 survey. Hospitals are particularly feeling the financial pinch of operating within such an expensive environment and face uncertainties about meeting financial obligations on top of other major post-pandemic challenges like staff shortages.\nThe impact of claims denials\nProviders continue to see claims being denied in greater numbers. In 2022, 42% of respondents said denials are increasing. The number jumped to 77% in 2024. Similarly, the time it takes to be reimbursed is increasing, per 67% of respondents. That number was 51% in 2022.\nIn 2024, 84% of healthcare organizations\u00a0will make reducing denied claims a top priority. The Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy reports that the burden of denied claims totals around $260 billion\u00a0annually. The impact of claim denials is far-reaching, affecting the patient experience and revenue cycles. Struggles with claims also burden staff and drain resources, contributing to even more losses.\nThe growing challenge of data collection, verification and authorization\nSuccessful claims processing depends on accuracy. However, achieving accuracy in data collection, verification, and authorization processes remains a continued challenge for claims management teams. Nearly half of respondents (46%) in the State of Claims 2024 report identified missing or inaccurate information as the primary cause for denial. Inaccurate or missing data also creates extra steps in claims processing, resulting in the need for secondary checks and \u201cwasted\u201d healthcare dollars. Survey respondents reported using multiple solutions to collect all the necessary patient data for claims, with some using as many as four different products.\nLeveling the playing field in claims management with technology\nStaying on top of reimbursement requirements and processes is complex, resource-demanding and time-consuming. Inaccuracies commonplace with manual processing exacerbate issues and further extend processing and reimbursement times. However, automation and AI technology have proven effective at reducing claims denials and the burden of manual processing.\n\u201cAdding AI in claims processing cuts down denials significantly,\u201d Tom Bonner, Principal Product Manager at Experian Health, explains. AI automation quickly flags errors, allowing claims editing before payer submission. It\u2019s not science fiction\u2014AI is the tool hospitals need for better healthcare claims denial prevention and management.\u201d\nDuring the pandemic, providers embraced new technology to meet immediate needs; however, that momentum slowed in recent years. In 2022, survey data revealed that 62% of providers were using some form of automation and AI technology. Yet, in 2024, only 31% said they used\u00a0this type of technology.\nHere\u2019s how claims automation can help healthcare organizations improve claims success rates:\n\nManage the entire claims process: Using an automated, scalable claims management system, like ClaimSource\u00ae, helps reduce denials and increase revenue. Providers can manage their entire claims cycle in a single application and ensure claims are clean before submission.\nSubmit more accurate claims: An automated claims submission tool, like ClaimScrubber, helps identify errors that typically result in denials or underpayments before submission. This results in quicker payments, less time chasing aged accounts receivables, and improved cash flow.\nEliminate manual processes: Providers that use Denials Workflow Manager can target claims that need attention immediately, managing denials more effectively and increasing reimbursements significantly.\nImprove cash flow: Enhanced Claim Status helps providers take an early-and-often approach to monitoring claim status in the adjudication process. It eliminates manual follow-up tasks, allowing providers to respond early and accurately to pended, returned-to-provider, denied or zero-pay transactions.\nPrevent denials: Experian Health\u2019s AI Advantage\u2122, an AI-driven platform, uses an organization\u2019s own historical claims data, plus Experian Health\u2019s sophisticated knowledge of payer rules, to continuously learn and adapt to an ever-changing payer policy landscape. This technology helps providers better predict and prevent claims denials, focus on high-priority claims, and boost overall revenue.\n\nAdaptation of technology is likely on the rise with 45% of healthcare leaders planning to invest in automation in the next six months. Over the next year, these investments could pay off if claims denials start to decrease as a result, prompting more healthcare organizations to boost investments in claims management technology.\nDownload the State of Claims 2024 report to get the latest health insurance claim denial statistics, or contact us to learn how Experian Health can help with better claims management.\nGet the report Claims management solutions\n\nPrev\n\nRelated Posts\n\nWhat is revenue cycle management in healthcare?\nFeatured \nThis blog examines revenue cycle management (RCM) in healthcare process as a whole: what it is, how it works, and more.\nPublished: September 10, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\n\nWhat is denial management in healthcare?\nFeatured \nDiscover the importance of healthcare denial management and get strategies to minimize claim denials and improve your financial performance.\nPublished: September 6, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\n\nRevenue cycle management best practices: a guide f...\nFeatured \nDiscover revenue cycle management best practices healthcare leaders should follow to optimize workflows and promote financial stability.\nPublished: August 13, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\nSubscribe to our blog\nEnter your name and email for the latest updates.\nEmail * \nFirst Name * \nLast Name * \nCountry *\nSubscribe\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nTags\nai advantage ai advantage denial triage ai advantage predictive denials artificial intelligence automation claim denials claims Claim Scrubber claims management ClaimSource collections Collections Optimization Manager consumer data Coverage Discovery COVID-19 data Data and Analytics digital front door identity management Insurance Eligibility Verification online scheduling patient access patient access curator Patient Collections patient engagement patient estimates patient experience patient financial advisor patient financial clearance patient identity patient payment patient payment estimates patient portal patient registration patient satisfaction patient schedule patientsimple price transparency pymnts registration accelerator Revenue Cycle Management self-scheduling social determinants of health state of claims 2022 state of patient access\nSubscribe to the Experian Health blog\nGet the latest industry news and updates!\nSubscribe\nSubscribe to the Experian Health blog\nGet the latest industry news and updates!\nEmail * \nFirst Name * \nLast Name * \nCountry *\nSubscribe\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\n\n\nLegal Terms & Conditions\nPrivacy Center\nU.S. Data Privacy Policy\nAd Choices\nPress\nCareers\nInvestor Relations\nContact Us\n\nEXPERIAN'S DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION Learn more how Experian is committed\nDATA PRIVACY Your privacy choices\n\u00a9 2024 Experian Information Solutions, Inc.

A high Access Ranking\u00a0(1-13) indicates that a state provides relatively more access to insurance and mental health\u00a0treatment than those ranked 39-51.\nThe eight measures that make up the Access Ranking include:\n\n\n\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness.\nIn 2022, 64% of adults who were uninsured said that they did not have health insurance because they could not afford it.\nThe state prevalence of uninsured adults with mental illness ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\nAdults with SUD Who Needed But Did Not Receive Treatment\nOver three-quarters (76.9%) of all adults with a substance use disorder did not receive the treatment they needed.\nMost adults with SUD who sought or thought about receiving treatment reported they didn\u2019t because they thought they should have been able to handle their drug or alcohol use on their own (75.4%).\nThis was followed by: Not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop or cut back using alcohol or drugs (48.4%), thought it would cost too much (47.7%), and did not know how or where to get treatment (47.3%).\nThe state prevalence of adults with SUD with unmet treatment needs ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\n10.2% of adults who experienced a mental illness in the past year had private health insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems.\nThe state prevalence of adults with AMI whose private insurance did not cover mental or emotional problems ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs\n24.58% of adults who reported experiencing 14 or more mentally unhealthy days each month were not able to see a doctor due to costs. This was a 2% increase over last year\u2019s report.\nHigh costs of mental health care are a critical barrier to access. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading. Unfortunately, doing so hides the fact that the percentages are significantly lower.\nThe state rate of students identified as having an emotional disturbance for an IEP ranges from 28.01 per 1,000 students in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 students in Alabama.\n\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\nMental Health Workforce Availability\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. The term \u201cmental health provider\u201d includes psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care.\nAs of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, and only 27% of the mental health need in shortage areas was being met by mental health providers. Over the next 15 years, the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis has projected increasing shortages for several behavioral health providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health and addiction counselors.\nThe state rate of mental health workforce ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.\nThe State of Mental Health in America\n2024 STATISTICS\nAccess to Care\nAbout Us\nGet Help\nGet Active\nGet Information\n\n                500 Montgomery Street,\n                \n                Suite 820\n                \n                Alexandria, VA. 22314\n                \n\n                Phone (703) 684.7722\n                \n                Toll Free (800) 969.6642\n                \n                Fax (703) 684.5968\n              \nFooter menu\n",
    "Document2": "Health Spending\nHow much and why 2024 premiums are expected to grow in Affordable Care Act Marketplaces\nBy Jared Ortaliza,\u00a0Matthew McGough,\u00a0Meghan Salaga,\u00a0Krutika Amin Twitter, and\u00a0Cynthia Cox Twitter\nKFF\nAugust 4, 2023\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nHealth insurers submit rate filings annually to state regulators detailing expectations and rate changes for Affordable Care Act (ACA)-regulated health plans for the coming year. A relatively small share of the population is enrolled in these plans (compared to the number in employer plans), but these filings are generally more detailed and publicly available. These filings provide insight into what factors insurers expect will drive health costs for the coming year.\nFor 2024, across 320 insurers participating in the 50 states and DC, this analysis shows a median proposed premium increase of 6%. Based on a more detailed analysis of publicly available documents from 58 insurers, growth in health care prices stood out as a key factor driving costs in 2024. In addition to inflation, insurers also mention changes in pandemic-related costs and the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage, though the latter are having a small, if any, effect on premiums.\nMost proposed rate increases for 2024 ACA Marketplace plans fall between 2% and 10%, with a median increase of 6%\nAmong 320 ACA Marketplace participating insurers nationally, premium changes range from a drop of \u201315% to an increase of 100%, but most proposed premium changes for 2024 fall between about 2% and 10% (the 25th and 75th percentile, respectively). Of the 320 filings, 41 insurers proposed decreasing premiums. On the other end of the spectrum, 76 insurers requested premium increases greater than 10%. These filings are preliminary and may change during the rate review process. 2024 rates will be finalized in late summer. A table in the appendix shows proposed premium increases by state and insurer.\nThe rate increase for an insurer is a weighted average across all of its products within a state (i.e., bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans). These weighted average premium changes will differ from the percent change in the benchmark silver plan, which is the basis for federal subsidies. Most enrollees in this market receive a subsidy and are not expected to face these premium increases. However, premium increases could result in higher federal spending on subsidies.\nWhat\u2019s driving 2024 premium changes?\nThe chart above shows premium changes for 320 insurers across all 50 states and DC. For the subsequent sections, this analysis focuses on a subset of these rate filings (58 insurers across 11 states and DC) in more detail to understand the factors driving premium changes in 2024. These insurers and states were selected because they have earlier and more transparent (less redacted) public reporting of proposed rate justifications. For context, though, the 58 insurers reviewed in this section have somewhat higher proposed rate increases, with a median of 9%.\nHealth Spending\nHealth & Wellbeing\nInflation\nAs is the case in most years, medical trend \u2013 which includes growth in prices paid by insurers for medical services and medications, as well as growth in the utilization of health care \u2013 is a key driver of premium growth in 2024. Many insurers expect utilization to grow relative to 2022, but price growth is generally playing a larger role in medical trend than utilization is.\nOf the insurer rate filings reviewed in detail, and when an annualized trend was publicly available, the median medical trend was 8%, with most reporting trend in the 7-9% range.\n\u201cThe primary driver of the premium increase is the increases in the cost of healthcare.\u00a0 The increases are associated with increases in the \u201cunit\u201d cost of services primarily from hospitals, physicians, and pharmaceutical companies, coupled with increases in the consumption of services, or \u201cutilization\u201d, by members.\u201d \u2013 Anthem Health Plans, Kentucky\nWhile health sector prices typically outpace price growth in the rest of the economy, the last two years have been an exception. Recent medical price growth has been similar to past years, while growth in prices in the rest of the economy has grown at a faster than usual pace. As contracts between insurers and providers are typically negotiated for a year or more, medical inflation often lags that in the rest of the economy.\nLooking ahead to 2024, many insurers are expecting broader economic inflation to flow through to the health system and put upward pressure on premiums.\n\u201cSignificant inflation in the cost of goods and services in all sectors of the economy has had a profound impact on the cost of medical services, and BCBSRI expects to see substantial increases in provider unit costs for 2024.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island\n\u201cWe expect unit cost trends to be higher in 2023 and 2024 due to inflation, supply shortages and labor shortages. Inpatient hospital cost per day trends will be increasing as hospitals seek to recover from 2022 financial losses.\u201d \u2013 Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington\n\u201cHealth insurance premiums must correspond with the cost of our members\u2019 medical care, which continues to rise at an unparalleled rate year after year and is projected to increase significantly in 2024. Rising medical costs are the primary driver of our proposed individual rates and increase requested premiums by 19.1%.\u201d \u2013 Highmark, New York\nIn addition to driving up prices paid by insurers to providers, inflation is also putting upward pressure on insurers\u2019 administrative costs, such as their own staffing costs.\n\u201cBlue Cross VT is increasing base administrative costs (see section 3.8.7), which has the effect of increasing the premiums by 0.1 percent for individuals and 0.3 percent for small groups. This modest increase reflects current and expected inflationary levels.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont\nCOVID-19 and the end of the Public Health Emergency\nThis year, as they did in prior years, insurers acknowledge there is still uncertainty surrounding the future of the pandemic. With the end of the Public Health Emergency (PHE) this year, plans can now charge cost sharing for COVID-testing, which could have a downward effect on insurer costs and therefore a downward effect on premiums. Conversely, the COVID vaccine will be commercialized, meaning increased cost to insurers on a per-dose basis. The use of COVID-19 related prevention and treatment may diminish, though, if severe cases continue to be less common. On net, most insurers that publicly quantify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in their filings expect their pandemic-related costs to decrease in 2024, having a small downward effect on premiums.\n\u201cMVP is assuming a 10% reduction in Covid testing costs in the projection period due to a utilization decrease, resulting in the removal of $0.31 PMPM. We expect demand for testing to decrease once cost sharing is reinstituted.\u201d \u2013 MVP Health Care, VT\n\u201cCosts related to COVID-19 decreased significantly in 2022 compared to 2021, and have reached a relatively consistent month-to-month level since March 2022. We expect 2023 and 2024 COVID related costs will continue at this lower level and possibly trend slightly downward as population immunity continues to grow.\u201d \u2013 Molina Healthcare of Washington\nThe pandemic had a significant downward effect on utilization of health care generally early on, particularly in 2020, but insurers are expecting a continued return to more normal levels going forward.\n\u201cWhile 2022 trends are lower than 2021, we expect utilization trends to moderate and return to pre-COVID-19 levels over 2023 and 2024.\u201d \u2013 Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington\nFew insurers mention pent up demand for the non-COVID care that was missed in 2020, and most of those that do mention it say the level of use they are expecting in the remainder of 2023 and 2024 is consistent with pre-pandemic trends. Very few insurers expect pent up demand to drive up costs in 2024.\nUnwinding of Medicaid continuous enrollment\nOn April 1, 2023, states started unwinding the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, resulting in at least 3.8 million people being disenrolled from Medicaid as of August 1, 2023. As a result, some people who have been disenrolled and deemed no longer eligible for Medicaid may enroll in the ACA marketplaces, where they may be eligible for subsidies.\nAbout half of the insurer rate filings reviewed do not mention Medicaid disenrollments in their 2024 premium filings. Those that mention the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage often say the impact on costs is difficult to predict, so they are not adjusting premiums. Several insurers say there will be an increase in their ACA enrollment, but no effect on market morbidity (i.e., the average health of enrollees), meaning no net impact on premiums.\n\u201cOur assumption is that the new members formerly in Medicaid will select a Blue Cross VT plan comparable to the current market share, about 60 percent, resulting in the Blue Cross VT individual market growing by 1,609 members and the Blue Cross VT small group market growing by 1,711 members. We further project that the new Medicaid members will have the same risk score relationship between the carriers as the existing market; therefore, the risk score impact is 1.000 for both carriers.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont\nA relatively small number of insurers expect the Medicaid unwinding to lead to a sicker group of people signing up for ACA plans, which would then have an upward effect on premiums.\n\u201cMedicaid redetermination and an otherwise shrinking market would lead to an increase in market average morbidity as relatively sicker members will enter and healthier members will leave the market.\u201d \u2013 BridgeSpan Health Company of Oregon\nOther Potential Drivers of Costs\nSome other factors that insurers mentioned in their 2024 rate filings, though much less commonly than the factors described above include:\nDiabetes and Weight Loss Drugs. Diabetic drugs, such as Semaglutide, are increasingly being utilized for weight loss. Given the increasing cost and use of Semaglutide and related drugs, a handful of insurers mention these drugs as having an upward effect on their pharmaceutical spending.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA extends pandemic-era enhanced subsidies through 2025, bringing down premium costs for most consumers in this market. Few insurers mentioned the impact of the IRA subsidies on premiums as there has been no change in the amount of the subsidy from last year.\nOther federal policy changes do not appear to be driving premiums. Among insurer filings reviewed, only one mentioned the impact of new restrictions on surprise billing but reported that no adjustment was made for it.\u00a0 None of the insurers reviewed mentioned the impact of the administrative fix to the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d in their filings.\nDiscussion\nSimilar to last year, it appears that 2024 rates may rise moderately. The median proposed rate increase is 6% nationally, with most proposed increases falling between 2% and 10%. Most enrollees in this market are subsidized and do not pay the full premium. However, premium increases can affect federal spending and the driving factors behind these increases illustrate broader trends driving health costs in 2024.\nA key driver of the increase in premiums in 2024 appears to be rising health prices. While prices for health services tend to grow every year, it also appears that inflation in the rest of the economy may now be starting to flow into the health sector. Rising prices and utilization are not necessarily specific to the ACA individual market. Similar levels of medical trend were observed in small group market filings as well.\nMany insurers that publicly quantified the impacts of the pandemic are projecting a decrease in COVID-19 related costs in 2024. There are multiple factors considered when evaluating the total impact of COVID-19 on costs. Some insurers mentioned higher costs associated with vaccine costs shifting to insurers. Resumed member cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing, however, may have a downward effect on premiums as members seek out these services less due to their cost.\nRelative to inflation and the pandemic, fewer insurers mentioned the impact of the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, and there was variation in how insurers project its impact on costs. A very small number of insurers mentioned the upward effects of diabetic therapy and weight loss drugs on pharmaceutical trends, mostly pointing to increasing costs and utilization of said drugs. Federal policy changes, like the administrative fix to the Family Glitch and the No Surprises Act, were rarely mentioned by insurers, if at all, despite their potential impacts on enrollment and costs.\nMethods\nProposed rates were collected from RateReview.Healthcare.gov for 320 insurers across 50 states and Washington, DC. Additionally, 58 insurer actuarial memoranda were collected from state rate review websites and were comprehensively reviewed to understand the factors contributing to rate changes. These 58 insurers were from the following Marketplaces: District of Columbia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, and Washington. Insurer actuarial memoranda were systematically evaluated for key words related to, but not limited to, medical trend, COVID-19 and the end of the Public Health Emergency, Medicaid redeterminations, Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, family glitch, surprise billing, telehealth, price transparency, and diabetes or weight loss drugs. Recorded medical trend values reported here are annualized.\nAppendix\nThe Peterson Center on Healthcare and KFF\u00a0are partnering to monitor how well the U.S. healthcare system is performing in terms of quality and cost.\nLooking for more data?\nFind out more details about U.S. healthcare from our updated dashboard.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\n\u00a9 2024 PETERSON-KFF Health System Tracker \u00a0 All Rights Reserved",

Cancellation rates fell to 46% in May and 35% in June as states lifted bans on elective procedures.\nThe data reflected hospitals\u2019 recovery trend. Operating room minutes jumped by 92% in May compared with April, although the metric remained 29% lower than in May 2019, according to the latest data from Kaufman Hall, covering more than 800 hospitals.\nMore recent data examined by Fitch Ratings showed hospital admissions and surgery volumes returned to 89% of pre-COVID levels in states that opened back up following the first wave, Kevin Holloran, a senior director, said in a July 16 call with investors.\n\u201cIt was far more rapid than we expected,\u201d Holloran said.\nA similar volume recovery in elective surgeries was seen in some ambulatory surgery centers, Bill Prentice, CEO of the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association (ASCA), said in an interview.\nSurgimate interpreted its data to mean that after restrictions were lifted following the first COVID-19 wave, surgeons\u2019 volumes were not affected by new state requirements for extensive cleaning regimes before and between procedures.\nBut new infection-control measures are still limiting volumes at some ASCs, Prentice said.\n\u201cThe difference is procedures are taking longer because of more screening, more intense infection control,\u201d Prentice said. Some facilities have extended operating hours and added days to try to compensate.\nThe Surgimate data includes surgeons from recently hard-hit states, albeit fewer than in other states.\nState bans start to mount again\nSome southern and western states affected by the latest spike in COVID-19 cases have sought to reimpose elective surgery restrictions.\nOn July 9, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott banned elective procedures in hospitals in all counties located within 11 designated \u201ctrauma service areas.\u201d Abbott ordered hospitals within those areas to postpone \u201call surgeries and procedures that are not medically necessary to diagnose or correct a serious medical condition of, or to preserve the life of, a patient who without timely performance of the surgery or procedure would be at risk for serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient\u2019s physician,\u201d according to a preceding order on which the new ban was based.\nOn July 10, the Mississippi Department of Health issued an order that certain nonurgent surgeries and procedures be postponed.\nOn July 13, the New Mexico Department of Health issued a public health order that reimposed an April 30 public health order prohibiting nonessential healthcare services, procedures and surgeries.\nIndustry experts see reason for concern\n\u201cLike Texas is starting to pull the throttle back on elective procedures, it feels to me like it is almost inevitable that the other states are going to have to do the same thing,\u201d Holloran said, referring to areas with a resurgence of COVID-19 cases.\nAny effect on surgery volumes in those states could start to appear within the next few weeks.\n\u201cWhile the last 60 days have delivered sound surgical care, it is hard to forecast the future,\u201d Brygel said.\u00a0\nAt this point, August scheduling looks similar to August 2019, Brygel said, even as the number of daily infections reported nationwide has doubled over the last 30 days. Daily new U.S. infections increased from 32,349 on June 22 to 69,641, o n July 24, according to one tracking site.\nThe new state restrictions don\u2019t apply to ASCs, according to Prentice. But those facilities have been affected by shortages and increasing costs of personal protective equipment.\nHolloran said if hospitals\u2019 volumes drop again this year, those organizations will need to look at further cuts to expenses, especially personnel and supply costs.\n\u201cIf the volume hits become more than temporary, which has been the view up until now, and they become more permanent, you\u2019ll see further revenue reductions, you\u2019ll see further expense reductions, and some of those may turn permanent, versus [employee] furlough,\u201d Holloran said.\nRich Daly\nwas a senior editor in HFMA\u2019s Washington, D.C., Office.\nRelated Tags\nAdvertisements\n\n\t\t\t\tHospital finances are on the upswing, but the toll of the Change Healthcare outage is yet to be seen\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tLeveraging the supply chain for cost reduction\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tHow healthcare finance organizations are working to become more resilient\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFTC takes legal action against pharmacy benefit managers, citing a distorted drug-pricing structure\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tReports on healthcare labor trends indicate an improved outlook for hospitals\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMedPAC starts to scrutinize the costs of outpatient coinsurance at critical access hospitals \u00a0\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSign up for The Buzz\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHealthcare finance content, event info and membership offers delivered to your inbox.

There was a maximum 45.4% reduction in admissions in 2020, associated with a 27.7% reduction in hospital charges, with significant reductions in all examined diagnoses except for birth.\nMeaning\nIn this study, inpatient pediatric admissions in 2020 were reduced across a heterogeneous range of diagnoses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAbstract\nImportance\nIn early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear.\nObjective\nTo determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nNumber of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter.\nResults\nOf 5\u2009424\u2009688 inpatient encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2\u2009823\u2009748 [52.1%] boys; 3\u2009171\u2009224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213\u2009571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43\u2009550 [42\u2009110-43\u2009946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 [$5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$6\u2009324\u2009978\u2009456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020.\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States in January 2020.1 In response, the United States declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, expanded airport screenings, required quarantines for travelers, and undertook public information efforts.2,3 Case counts and fatalities increased slowly in January and February 2020 before achieving exponential growth in March 2020.4 Individual states began additional mitigation strategies in the spring, including stay-at-home orders, which took effect from early March through June 2020.5,6 These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality.6,7 Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for the use of face coverings on April 3, 2020, although enforcement varied by state.3,8 Although COVID-19 has resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations,1,9,10 early reports indicate that it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the United States11 and worldwide.12,13 A 2020 study from Brazil,14 in which regional differences contributed to peak bronchiolitis between February and August, showed a 78% to 85% reduction in hospitalization in infants younger than 1 year for acute bronchiolitis in 2020 compared with previous years.\nMany pediatric diagnoses warranting inpatient admission exhibit seasonal variation; prior work has characterized winter predominance in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 and Kawasaki syndrome18; autumn predominance in asthma16,19,20; and summer predominance in trauma.21 These fluctuations in disease pattern are likely influenced by population susceptibility and behavior as well as various environmental factors. However, to our knowledge, the seasonal patterns in other pediatric admissions remain unexplored. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database22 to determine the seasonal patterns of a variety of common pediatric admission diagnoses and compare data from the previous decade with 2020 admissions. Given the changes in population behavior in 2020,6,7 we hypothesized that pediatric admissions for a variety of diagnoses would be decreased in 2020 compared with prior years, except for admissions for birth.23,24\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 51 children\u2019s hospitals across the United States participating in PHIS, an online, quality-controlled, anonymized, administrative database maintained by the Children\u2019s Hospital Association.22,25 To ensure that changes in admission rates over time were reflective of changes in caseload, rather than expansion of the database by inclusion of new hospitals, the present study was limited to the 49 hospitals that have been providing data since 2010. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were no exclusion criteria. Patients were filtered according to their primary admission diagnoses based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 codes, depending on whether their admission was before or after October 1, 2015. Selected diagnoses were determined according to the percentage of total admissions in PHIS, disease pathophysiology, and seasonal distribution between 2010 and 2019. The full list of included ICD codes for each diagnosis group is included in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. This study was granted exemption by the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board; because the data were anonymous, informed consent could not be obtained. This manuscript follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies.26\nStatistical Analysis\nEncounter-level clinical and administrative data were extracted from PHIS (admission and discharge dates, age, sex, race, ethnicity, diagnostic codes, insurance status, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, complex chronic conditions,27 mechanical ventilation, abstracted charges, and cost). Admissions were described with summary statistics. Hospital charges were adjusted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index according to hospital zip code in PHIS.22 Charge-over-time analyses were adjusted for the quarterly gross domestic product, provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and expressed in quarter 1, 2010, dollars.28 Admission dates were grouped into month and year. Admission numbers were transformed into time series, databased on date of admission, and displayed graphically. Seasonality testing was performed with the Webel and Ollech method.29 Seasonal trends in admission rates between 2010 and 2019 were displayed with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. For visual comparison, the number of admissions in 2020 was displayed against the aforementioned models. For each diagnosis group, ensemble machine-learning forecasting models were created with autoregressive integrated moving average,30 neural network,31 and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms,32 each weighted on time-series cross-validation.33 Time-series data were arranged such that each model was trained on data from January 1, 2010, until June 30, 2019. Model forecasts were tested against actual admission numbers from July 1, 2019, until June 30, 2020. Model predictions were assessed with mean absolute percentage error,33 and the error rates for July 2019 to December 2019 were compared against those for January 2020 to June 2020. To quantify whether social distancing had a statistically significant association with pediatric admission rates, the actual admission rate in 2019 vs 2020 was compared against the ensemble algorithm\u2019s 95% CI.33 We conducted 2 exploratory analyses by repeating the aforementioned steps for patients with any diagnostic code for acute respiratory failure and for in-hospital mortality. All statistical analyses were performed with R Studio version 1.3.1073 and R versions 4.0.2 and 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing) with the following packages: Metrics, forecastHybrid, thief, forecast, cowplot, lubridate, forcats, stringr, dplyr, purrr, readr, tidyr, tibble, ggplot2, and tidyverse.34 An \u03b1 value of .05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance, and all tests were 2-tailed. The code used to create the manuscript is publicly available.35\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nThere were 49 hospitals with admission data in PHIS between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients beginning in 2010, of which 213\u2009571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. As shown in the Table, the cohort had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 5.1 (0.7-13.3) years and included 2\u2009823\u2009748 (52.1%) boys, 3\u2009171\u2009224 (58.5%) White individuals, 994\u2009915 (18.3%) Black individuals, and 1\u2009111\u2009025 (20.5%) Hispanic individuals. A total of 2\u2009977\u2009372 patients (54.9%) had government insurance, and 2\u2009481\u2009647 (45.7%) had a preexisting complex chronic condition. As shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement, the median (IQR) length of stay was 3 (2-5) days. A total of 186\u2009238 admissions (3.4%) had a length of stay of 30 days or more. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2% (5\u2009380\u2009125 encounters). There were 16 selected diagnoses, encompassing 1\u2009446\u2009376 encounters (26.7%). The number of encounters for each selected diagnosis is shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement; birth, bronchiolitis, and trauma were the most common diagnoses.\nTable. \nAbbreviations: CMS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; ECMO, extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; PHIS, Pediatric Health Information Systems.\nSeasonal Patterns in PHIS Admissions\nOverall admissions in PHIS between 2010 and 2019 are shown in Figure 1. There was an increase in the total number of admissions in winter months compared with summer months between 2010 and 2019. There were significantly fewer admissions in July vs January in 2010 to 2019 (median [IQR], 40\u2009726 [40\u2009063-41\u2009839] vs 47\u2009116 [45\u2009472-48\u2009298]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). As shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement, there was a significantly lower median (IQR) number of intensive care unit admissions and admissions requiring mechanical ventilation in July vs January 2010 to 2019 (7097 [6754-7483] vs 8002 [7222-8501]; P\u2009=\u2009.04 and 4140 [3962-4234] vs 4525 [4213-4776]; P\u2009=\u2009.02, respectively). There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23\u2009798 compared with a median (IQR) of 43\u2009550 (42\u2009110-43\u2009946) in April 2010 to 2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years, with 26\u2009089 in June 2020 compared with a median (IQR) of 40\u2009824 (40\u2009302-41\u2009583) in June 2010 to 2019.\nA, Number of monthly admissions in Pediatric Health Information Systems between January 2010 and June 2020, represented as a bar chart. B, Number of monthly admissions between January 2010 and June 2020 represented as a line chart. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nAdmissions by diagnoses are shown in Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. Several distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Because bronchiolitis coding changed in ICD-10 to include separate diagnostic codes for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, the seasonality of individual pathogens is shown in eFigure 4 in the Supplement for 2016 to 2019. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance, associated with the school-year calendar. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance, inversely associated with the school-year calendar in children aged 5 years and older, as shown in eFigure 5 in the Supplement. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. In the case of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, summer predominance was associated with admissions in children older than 1 year, as shown in eFigure 6 in the Supplement. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\nEach panel shows the number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (denoted in red). Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected. Changes in seasonal patterns identified with ensemble time-series forecasting models are shown in Figure 3 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement. Overall, models accurately predicted admission rates from July until December 2019 but not from January to June 2020 (mean absolute percentage error range, 3% to 21.2% vs 8.5% to 1111.7%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.06). A total of 70 of 72 monthly admission (97.2%) rates between July and December 2019 fell within the 95% CI of the models. The admission rates for atrial septal defect and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were below the 95% CI predicted by the models in August and December 2019, respectively. All other conditions remained within the model 95% CIs between July and December 2019. Admissions for birth remained within the model 95% CI between January and June 2020. Every other condition decreased below the model 95% CI between January and June 2020.\nEach panel shows the estimated number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020, according to ensemble forecasting models including autoregressive integrated moving average, neural network, and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms weighted on time-series cross-validation. All models were trained on data from January 2010 through June 2019, and the testing window for each model is shown. The blue line is the model estimate, and the dark and light blue shaded regions are the model 80% and 95% CIs, respectively. The red line is the actual number of admissions for each month. The vertical line represents January 2020. MAPE indicates mean absolute percentage error.\nHospital Charges\nOverall, 5\u2009377\u2009745 of 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters (99.1%) among 3\u2009356\u2009656 patients had hospital charge data available. The quarterly total hospital charges, adjusted for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index and quarterly gross domestic product, are shown in eFigure 8 in the Supplement. The per-admission charges with the same adjustments are shown in eFigure 9 in the Supplement. The total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6\u2009024\u2009735\u2009078 compared with a median (IQR) of $6\u2009229\u2009556\u2009859 ($5\u2009951\u2009083\u2009755-$6\u2009551\u2009134\u2009282) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 compared with a median (IQR) of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 ($5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$5\u2009991\u2009085\u2009056) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. However, the median (IQR) per-admission charge in 2020 was $24\u2009358 ($12\u2009631-$51\u2009740) compared with a median (IQR) of $20\u2009352 ($10\u2009781-$43\u2009604) in 2010 to 2019 (P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nExploratory Analyses\nDiagnoses including any cause of acute respiratory failure displayed significant winter predominance. In-hospital mortality did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation. Seasonal trends and machine-learning models for respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality are shown in eFigure 10 in the Supplement. There were annual increases in admissions for acute respiratory failure from 2010 through February 2020, with a decline in spring 2020. There were 3517 admissions for acute respiratory failure in December 2019 compared with 2143 admissions in December 2018, and 2894 in January 2020 compared with 2050 in January 2019. Acute respiratory failure decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in April 2020. There were no significant changes in admissions with in-hospital mortality between 2010 and 2019. Admissions with in-hospital mortality decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in March 2020.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to use a large database to model pediatric admission volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic for various diagnoses compared with prior years. Using this approach, we identified seasonal patterns in a diverse group of pediatric conditions. Before 2020, pediatric admissions overall displayed winter predominance, associated with an increase in infectious respiratory conditions, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Summer-predominant conditions included trauma and admissions for semielective surgical conditions (eg, atrial septal defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children aged >1 year). The present study is in agreement with several prior studies documenting seasonality in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 asthma,16,19,20 Kawasaki syndrome,18 and trauma.21 However, we additionally noted novel seasonality for diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health admissions and the absence of seasonality in admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta. The seasonality of diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with children aged 5 years or older and may be reflective of the efforts of the American Diabetes Association to incorporate school personnel in the diabetes medical management plans for these patients.36\nAlthough COVID-19 has resulted in few pediatric admissions and mortalities compared with those for adults,1,9,10 the present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 vs a median of 43\u2009550 in April 2010-2019). Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. There was a premature termination of winter-predominant conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia and a reduction in admissions for asthma in 2020 compared with previous years. In exploratory analyses, this was coupled with a decrease in all acute respiratory failure diagnoses. Given the infectious nature of these conditions and their spread by respiratory droplets,37,38,39 this may have been associated with the effects of social distancing and possibly was even fortunate, given evidence of a potentially severe respiratory virus season in 2019 to 2020, with the highest number of respiratory failure admissions recorded in the past decade. A recent Australian study corroborates our findings, with more than 95% reduction in respiratory syncytial virus and influenza detection in Western Australia through winter 2020.40 Taken together, these studies suggest that rates of infectious pediatric respiratory conditions are potentially modifiable by changes in human behavior. Similarly, pediatric trauma admissions are often sports related,41 and the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with decreased childhood physical activity; thus, reductions in trauma admissions were anticipated.42 However, reductions in mental health admissions are surprising, given limited literature suggesting that pandemic-related stressors may worsen mental health in both the general population and those with preexisting psychiatric conditions.43,44 This may represent an opportunity for changes in the delivery of mental health care.45\nThe present study cannot delineate which changes in admission rates represent decreases in incidence, hospital avoidance, or unmet care needs. One inpatient survey suggested that greater than one-third of parents delayed seeking medical care for their child because of fears surrounding COVID-19,46 and case series have reported delayed presentations leading to harm.47,48 Similarly, although admissions for repair of atrial septal defects or later-stage repairs of hypoplastic left heart syndrome may safely be deferred for a short period, it is unclear whether reductions in admission rates represent purely elective surgical delays or the possibility of decreased recognition of congenital heart disease because of decreased contact with health care; small case series of increases in sudden death in adults with congenital heart disease without contact with health care institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported.49 Taken together, these findings are worrisome, although not definitive, in that unmet health care needs may be accumulating in the pediatric population as a result of decreased health care interactions.\nReduced patient volumes during early 2020 have reportedly contributed to financial instability for many hospitals and health systems.50 The reduction in charges observed in the present study suggests a proportionate decline in operating income. Although children\u2019s hospitals generally maintain better operating margins compared with other nonprofit hospitals, the 45.4% reduction in inpatient admissions at children\u2019s hospitals observed during the first 6 months of 2020 and 27.7% reduction in charges observed in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years has an influence on financial security.50,51 Leaders of children\u2019s hospitals could face unique challenges in the coming months as patient volumes eventually recover and are potentially coupled with the destabilizing financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCharacterizing alterations in usual patient admission patterns aids in anticipating the potential ramifications of recent national policies and can also help in crafting responses in a variety of areas. The present study highlights the strengths of an ensemble machine-learning approach to model complex time-series data displaying a variety of seasonal relationships. As complexity in medical information has increased, there has been progressive interest in the application of machine learning to facilitate clinical decision-making. Such algorithms have been studied in a diverse array of applications, including sepsis prediction,52 COVID-19 prognosis,53 population health,54 and cyberbullying.55 In the present study, before the COVID-19 pandemic,6,7 ensemble time-series forecasting models accurately predicted 70 of 72 monthly pediatric admission rates (97.2%) between July 2019 and December 2019. Quantification of the seasonality of various admission types in pediatrics has applicability for hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator capacity planning as well as trainee education. According to the present study, pediatricians and trainees assigned to inpatient wards in the winter will experience higher-than-average case burden and gain greater experience in managing pneumonia and bronchiolitis, whereas those assigned to emergency departments in the summer will achieve greater experience in the management of pediatric trauma. Such knowledge can be harnessed in the development of training curricula that support experience across the spectrum of pediatric illness.\nLimitations\nThis study has important limitations. As with any retrospective database analysis, admission diagnoses are vulnerable to misclassification owing to coding error. Although including greater than 5\u2009000\u2009000 inpatient encounters, this study is limited to 49 hospitals that consistently provided data to PHIS between January 2010 and June 2020 and may not be representative of national pediatric admission trends. Because of data availability, data from some admissions from late June 2020 are not yet available. This may have resulted in undercounting of admissions from June. However, hospitalizations for birth did not decrease below the 95% CIs for the forecasting model. It is also possible that some hospitals have been delayed in reporting admissions to PHIS because of the pandemic, although this is not a known data quality issue. Owing to data availability, only admissions between January and June 2020 were analyzed regarding the effects of social distancing. Further study is warranted as additional data become available.\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. These trends were effectively modeled with ensemble time-series forecasting algorithms. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotes\neFigure 1.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Elective surgery volume near normal in late July, analysis finds\n\nElective procedures returned to their January volumes by late July, despite a recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases that led to some voluntary and involuntary suspensions of such procedures, according to a national analysis. By July 20, scheduled surgeries for about 1,500 surgeons reached about the same number that were scheduled in January, before the pandemic, according to data provided to HFMA by surgical scheduling company Surgimate.\n\n\u201cWhile we often hear that patients may be skeptical, keep in mind that there was a tremendous April and May backlog to work through,\u201d Rebecca Brygel, CEO of Surgimate, a scheduling company for physician-owned practices, said in a written statement. \u201cEither way, a good portion of patients who require surgical intervention are able to receive the care they need in most areas.\u201d\n\nSurgery cancellation and rescheduling rates fell from 88% in April to pre-COVID-type rates of about 28% in late July. Cancellation rates fell to 46% in May and 35% in June as states lifted bans on elective procedures.\n\nThe data reflected hospitals\u2019 recovery trend. Operating room minutes jumped by 92% in May compared with April, although the metric remained 29% lower than in May 2019, according to the latest data from Kaufman Hall, covering more than 800 hospitals.\n\nMore recent data examined by Fitch Ratings showed hospital admissions and surgery volumes returned to 89% of pre-COVID levels in states that opened back up following the first wave, Kevin Holloran, a senior director, said in a July 16 call with investors. \u201cIt was far more rapid than we expected,\u201d Holloran said.\n\nA similar volume recovery in elective surgeries was seen in some ambulatory surgery centers, Bill Prentice, CEO of the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association (ASCA), said in an interview. Surgimate interpreted its data to mean that after restrictions were lifted following the first COVID-19 wave, surgeons\u2019 volumes were not affected by new state requirements for extensive cleaning regimes before and between procedures. But new infection-control measures are still limiting volumes at some ASCs, Prentice said.\n\n\u201cThe difference is procedures are taking longer because of more screening, more intense infection control,\u201d Prentice said. Some facilities have extended operating hours and added days to try to compensate. The Surgimate data includes surgeons from recently hard-hit states, albeit fewer than in other states.\n\nState bans start to mount again\n\nSome southern and western states affected by the latest spike in COVID-19 cases have sought to reimpose elective surgery restrictions. On July 9, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott banned elective procedures in hospitals in all counties located within 11 designated \u201ctrauma service areas.\u201d Abbott ordered hospitals within those areas to postpone \u201call surgeries and procedures that are not medically necessary to diagnose or correct a serious medical condition of, or to preserve the life of, a patient who without timely performance of the surgery or procedure would be at risk for serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient\u2019s physician,\u201d according to a preceding order on which the new ban was based.\n\nOn July 10, the Mississippi Department of Health issued an order that certain nonurgent surgeries and procedures be postponed. On July 13, the New Mexico Department of Health issued a public health order that reimposed an April 30 public health order prohibiting nonessential healthcare services, procedures and surgeries.\n\nIndustry experts see reason for concern\n\n\u201cLike Texas is starting to pull the throttle back on elective procedures, it feels to me like it is almost inevitable that the other states are going to have to do the same thing,\u201d Holloran said, referring to areas with a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. Any effect on surgery volumes in those states could start to appear within the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cWhile the last 60 days have delivered sound surgical care, it is hard to forecast the future,\u201d Brygel said. At this point, August scheduling looks similar to August 2019, Brygel said, even as the number of daily infections reported nationwide has doubled over the last 30 days. Daily new U.S. infections increased from 32,349 on June 22 to 69,641 on July 24, according to one tracking site.\n\nThe new state restrictions don\u2019t apply to ASCs, according to Prentice. But those facilities have been affected by shortages and increasing costs of personal protective equipment. Holloran said if hospitals\u2019 volumes drop again this year, those organizations will need to look at further cuts to expenses, especially personnel and supply costs. \u201cIf the volume hits become more than temporary, which has been the view up until now, and they become more permanent, you\u2019ll see further revenue reductions, you\u2019ll see further expense reductions, and some of those may turn permanent, versus [employee] furlough,\u201d Holloran said.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Trends in US Pediatric Hospital Admissions in 2020 Compared With the Decade Before the COVID-19 Pandemic\nJonathan H. Pelletier, Jaskaran Rakkar, Alicia K. Au, Dana Fuhrman, Robert S. B. Clark, Christopher M. Horvat\nUPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nAccepted for Publication: December 21, 2020. Published: February 12, 2021. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37227\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\n\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the US in January 2020. In response, the US declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, and implemented various social distancing measures. These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality. Although COVID-19 resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations, early reports indicate it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the US and worldwide.\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 49 children\u2019s hospitals across the US participating in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database. Patients were eligible if discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. Statistical analyses were performed using R Studio and R Project for Statistical Computing.\n\nResults\nThere were 5,424,688 encounters among 3,372,839 patients, of which 213,571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The cohort had a median age of 5.1 years and included 52.1% boys, 58.5% White individuals, 18.3% Black individuals, and 20.5% Hispanic individuals. A total of 54.9% had government insurance, and 45.7% had a preexisting complex chronic condition. The median length of stay was 3 days. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2%. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23,798 compared with a median of 43,550 in April 2010-2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years.\n\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nSeveral distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\n\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020. Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected.\n\nHospital Charges\nThe total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6,024,735,078 compared with a median of $6,229,556,859 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4,327,580,511 compared with a median of $5,983,142,102 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. The median per-admission charge in 2020 was $24,358 compared with a median of $20,352 in 2010 to 2019.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years. Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These laboratories report the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza and other respiratory virus detections and isolations on a weekly basis. The overall percentage of influenza detections in clinical sentinel laboratories during Week 11 was 5.0% compared to 5.2% during Week 10 (Figure 1). Additional details, including influenza typing and subtyping information from public health laboratories can be found in Figures 1 and 2 and Tables 1 and 2. Figure 1.

Neuraminidase gene sequences are analyzed to detect the presence of well-known amino acid substitutions previously associated with reduced or inhibited activity to any of the three neuraminidase inhibitors. Susceptibility to baloxavir is assessed by identifying an amino acid substitution in the PA gene. Of the influenza specimens tested by the CDPH-VRDL to date this season, none have been found to be resistant to neuraminidase and PA endonuclease inhibitors (Table 3). Table 3.

ILI is defined as any illness with fever (\u2265100\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C) AND cough and/or sore throat. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. A total of 196 enrolled sentinel providers have reported data for Week 11. The percentage of visits for ILI during Week 11 was 4.0% compared to 4.0% during Week 10 and was below the baseline (Figure 3). Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Figure 3.

The 2023\u20132024 baseline is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the most recent three seasons, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, and adding two standard deviations. Additional information can be found on the CDC website. 7 of 20 Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities Inpatients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities with an admission diagnosis including the keywords \u201cflu,\u201d \u201cinfluenza,\u201d or variants of the keywords are defined as influenza-related admissions. The number of influenza admissions is divided by the total number of hospital admissions occurring in the same time period to estimate the percentage of influenza admissions. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are excluded from the denominator. Influenza admission data is not comparable to previous seasons reports which included pneumonia and influenza (P&I) admissions. The percentage of admissions for influenza in Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities during Week 11 was 0.2% compared to 0.4% during Week 10 (Figure 4). Figure 4.

Most influenza admissions occurred among persons \u226565 years (Figure 5). Please note that influenza admissions serve as a proxy for influenza activity, but do not necessarily represent laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. Figure 5. Age Group Distribution of Non-ICU, ICU, and Deaths Associated with Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities, 2023\u20132024 Season to Date Influenza Mortality Surveillance from Death Certificates Deaths occurring in California among residents who had influenza noted in any cause of death field on the death certificate (text or coded) are defined as \u201cinfluenza-coded deaths.\u201d The percentage of influenza-coded deaths is calculated by dividing the number of influenza-coded deaths by the total number of all-cause deaths during the same period. Influenza-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are an underestimate of all influenza-associated deaths. Please note that during the 2023\u20132024 season, an update to the methods used to identify influenza-coded deaths resulted in some changes to data from previous seasons. During Week 11, 11 influenza-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 570 influenza-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 6). The percentage of deaths coded as influenza during Week 11 was 0.0% compared to 0.1% during Week 10 (Figure 7).\n4 24 1 24 104 1 25 166 28 34 520 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Deaths ICU Non-ICU Percentage of Influenza Hospitalizations Severity of Hospitalization <18 years 18-49 years 50-64 years \u226565 years 9 of 20 Figure 6.

The weekly influenza report includes confirmed deaths formally reported to CDPH through March 16, 2024 (Week 11). Methods used to identify pediatric influenza-coded deaths on death certificates differ from those used to identify the influenza-associated pediatric deaths presented below, which require laboratory confirmation of influenza, and might not include the same individuals. One laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated death in a child <18 years of age was reported to CDPH during Week 11. To date, CDPH has received nine reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated deaths among children <18 years of age during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season. Influenza-associated Outbreaks Two laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks were reported during Week 11. To date, 100 laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks have been reported to CDPH during the 2023\u20132024 season.

Syndromic Surveillance Update A total of 14 border region sentinel providers reported data during Week 11. The total number of patients screened by all sentinel sites for ILI during Week 11 was 12,845. Outpatient ILI activity was 0.4% in Week 11 (Figure 10). All influenza syndromic data summarized for the border region represent a subset of CDC influenza sentinel providers in California. Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. Figure 10.

RSV-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are likely to be an underestimate of all RSV-associated deaths. During Week 11, ten RSV-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 295 RSV-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 15). The percentage of deaths coded as RSV during Week 11 was 0.11% compared to 0.19% during Week 10 (Figure 16). Figure 15.

There was a maximum 45.4% reduction in admissions in 2020, associated with a 27.7% reduction in hospital charges, with significant reductions in all examined diagnoses except for birth.\nMeaning\nIn this study, inpatient pediatric admissions in 2020 were reduced across a heterogeneous range of diagnoses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAbstract\nImportance\nIn early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear.\nObjective\nTo determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nNumber of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter.\nResults\nOf 5\u2009424\u2009688 inpatient encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2\u2009823\u2009748 [52.1%] boys; 3\u2009171\u2009224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213\u2009571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43\u2009550 [42\u2009110-43\u2009946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 [$5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$6\u2009324\u2009978\u2009456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020.\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States in January 2020.1 In response, the United States declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, expanded airport screenings, required quarantines for travelers, and undertook public information efforts.2,3 Case counts and fatalities increased slowly in January and February 2020 before achieving exponential growth in March 2020.4 Individual states began additional mitigation strategies in the spring, including stay-at-home orders, which took effect from early March through June 2020.5,6 These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality.6,7 Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for the use of face coverings on April 3, 2020, although enforcement varied by state.3,8 Although COVID-19 has resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations,1,9,10 early reports indicate that it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the United States11 and worldwide.12,13 A 2020 study from Brazil,14 in which regional differences contributed to peak bronchiolitis between February and August, showed a 78% to 85% reduction in hospitalization in infants younger than 1 year for acute bronchiolitis in 2020 compared with previous years.\nMany pediatric diagnoses warranting inpatient admission exhibit seasonal variation; prior work has characterized winter predominance in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 and Kawasaki syndrome18; autumn predominance in asthma16,19,20; and summer predominance in trauma.21 These fluctuations in disease pattern are likely influenced by population susceptibility and behavior as well as various environmental factors. However, to our knowledge, the seasonal patterns in other pediatric admissions remain unexplored. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database22 to determine the seasonal patterns of a variety of common pediatric admission diagnoses and compare data from the previous decade with 2020 admissions. Given the changes in population behavior in 2020,6,7 we hypothesized that pediatric admissions for a variety of diagnoses would be decreased in 2020 compared with prior years, except for admissions for birth.23,24\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 51 children\u2019s hospitals across the United States participating in PHIS, an online, quality-controlled, anonymized, administrative database maintained by the Children\u2019s Hospital Association.22,25 To ensure that changes in admission rates over time were reflective of changes in caseload, rather than expansion of the database by inclusion of new hospitals, the present study was limited to the 49 hospitals that have been providing data since 2010. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were no exclusion criteria. Patients were filtered according to their primary admission diagnoses based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 codes, depending on whether their admission was before or after October 1, 2015. Selected diagnoses were determined according to the percentage of total admissions in PHIS, disease pathophysiology, and seasonal distribution between 2010 and 2019. The full list of included ICD codes for each diagnosis group is included in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. This study was granted exemption by the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board; because the data were anonymous, informed consent could not be obtained. This manuscript follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies.26\nStatistical Analysis\nEncounter-level clinical and administrative data were extracted from PHIS (admission and discharge dates, age, sex, race, ethnicity, diagnostic codes, insurance status, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, complex chronic conditions,27 mechanical ventilation, abstracted charges, and cost). Admissions were described with summary statistics. Hospital charges were adjusted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index according to hospital zip code in PHIS.22 Charge-over-time analyses were adjusted for the quarterly gross domestic product, provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and expressed in quarter 1, 2010, dollars.28 Admission dates were grouped into month and year. Admission numbers were transformed into time series, databased on date of admission, and displayed graphically. Seasonality testing was performed with the Webel and Ollech method.29 Seasonal trends in admission rates between 2010 and 2019 were displayed with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. For visual comparison, the number of admissions in 2020 was displayed against the aforementioned models. For each diagnosis group, ensemble machine-learning forecasting models were created with autoregressive integrated moving average,30 neural network,31 and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms,32 each weighted on time-series cross-validation.33 Time-series data were arranged such that each model was trained on data from January 1, 2010, until June 30, 2019. Model forecasts were tested against actual admission numbers from July 1, 2019, until June 30, 2020. Model predictions were assessed with mean absolute percentage error,33 and the error rates for July 2019 to December 2019 were compared against those for January 2020 to June 2020. To quantify whether social distancing had a statistically significant association with pediatric admission rates, the actual admission rate in 2019 vs 2020 was compared against the ensemble algorithm\u2019s 95% CI.33 We conducted 2 exploratory analyses by repeating the aforementioned steps for patients with any diagnostic code for acute respiratory failure and for in-hospital mortality. All statistical analyses were performed with R Studio version 1.3.1073 and R versions 4.0.2 and 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing) with the following packages: Metrics, forecastHybrid, thief, forecast, cowplot, lubridate, forcats, stringr, dplyr, purrr, readr, tidyr, tibble, ggplot2, and tidyverse.34 An \u03b1 value of .05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance, and all tests were 2-tailed. The code used to create the manuscript is publicly available.35\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nThere were 49 hospitals with admission data in PHIS between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients beginning in 2010, of which 213\u2009571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. As shown in the Table, the cohort had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 5.1 (0.7-13.3) years and included 2\u2009823\u2009748 (52.1%) boys, 3\u2009171\u2009224 (58.5%) White individuals, 994\u2009915 (18.3%) Black individuals, and 1\u2009111\u2009025 (20.5%) Hispanic individuals. A total of 2\u2009977\u2009372 patients (54.9%) had government insurance, and 2\u2009481\u2009647 (45.7%) had a preexisting complex chronic condition. As shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement, the median (IQR) length of stay was 3 (2-5) days. A total of 186\u2009238 admissions (3.4%) had a length of stay of 30 days or more. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2% (5\u2009380\u2009125 encounters). There were 16 selected diagnoses, encompassing 1\u2009446\u2009376 encounters (26.7%). The number of encounters for each selected diagnosis is shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement; birth, bronchiolitis, and trauma were the most common diagnoses.\nTable. \nAbbreviations: CMS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; ECMO, extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; PHIS, Pediatric Health Information Systems.\nSeasonal Patterns in PHIS Admissions\nOverall admissions in PHIS between 2010 and 2019 are shown in Figure 1. There was an increase in the total number of admissions in winter months compared with summer months between 2010 and 2019. There were significantly fewer admissions in July vs January in 2010 to 2019 (median [IQR], 40\u2009726 [40\u2009063-41\u2009839] vs 47\u2009116 [45\u2009472-48\u2009298]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). As shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement, there was a significantly lower median (IQR) number of intensive care unit admissions and admissions requiring mechanical ventilation in July vs January 2010 to 2019 (7097 [6754-7483] vs 8002 [7222-8501]; P\u2009=\u2009.04 and 4140 [3962-4234] vs 4525 [4213-4776]; P\u2009=\u2009.02, respectively). There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23\u2009798 compared with a median (IQR) of 43\u2009550 (42\u2009110-43\u2009946) in April 2010 to 2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years, with 26\u2009089 in June 2020 compared with a median (IQR) of 40\u2009824 (40\u2009302-41\u2009583) in June 2010 to 2019.\nA, Number of monthly admissions in Pediatric Health Information Systems between January 2010 and June 2020, represented as a bar chart. B, Number of monthly admissions between January 2010 and June 2020 represented as a line chart. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nAdmissions by diagnoses are shown in Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. Several distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Because bronchiolitis coding changed in ICD-10 to include separate diagnostic codes for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, the seasonality of individual pathogens is shown in eFigure 4 in the Supplement for 2016 to 2019. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance, associated with the school-year calendar. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance, inversely associated with the school-year calendar in children aged 5 years and older, as shown in eFigure 5 in the Supplement. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. In the case of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, summer predominance was associated with admissions in children older than 1 year, as shown in eFigure 6 in the Supplement. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\nEach panel shows the number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (denoted in red). Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected. Changes in seasonal patterns identified with ensemble time-series forecasting models are shown in Figure 3 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement. Overall, models accurately predicted admission rates from July until December 2019 but not from January to June 2020 (mean absolute percentage error range, 3% to 21.2% vs 8.5% to 1111.7%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.06). A total of 70 of 72 monthly admission (97.2%) rates between July and December 2019 fell within the 95% CI of the models. The admission rates for atrial septal defect and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were below the 95% CI predicted by the models in August and December 2019, respectively. All other conditions remained within the model 95% CIs between July and December 2019. Admissions for birth remained within the model 95% CI between January and June 2020. Every other condition decreased below the model 95% CI between January and June 2020.\nEach panel shows the estimated number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020, according to ensemble forecasting models including autoregressive integrated moving average, neural network, and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms weighted on time-series cross-validation. All models were trained on data from January 2010 through June 2019, and the testing window for each model is shown. The blue line is the model estimate, and the dark and light blue shaded regions are the model 80% and 95% CIs, respectively. The red line is the actual number of admissions for each month. The vertical line represents January 2020. MAPE indicates mean absolute percentage error.\nHospital Charges\nOverall, 5\u2009377\u2009745 of 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters (99.1%) among 3\u2009356\u2009656 patients had hospital charge data available. The quarterly total hospital charges, adjusted for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index and quarterly gross domestic product, are shown in eFigure 8 in the Supplement. The per-admission charges with the same adjustments are shown in eFigure 9 in the Supplement. The total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6\u2009024\u2009735\u2009078 compared with a median (IQR) of $6\u2009229\u2009556\u2009859 ($5\u2009951\u2009083\u2009755-$6\u2009551\u2009134\u2009282) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 compared with a median (IQR) of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 ($5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$5\u2009991\u2009085\u2009056) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. However, the median (IQR) per-admission charge in 2020 was $24\u2009358 ($12\u2009631-$51\u2009740) compared with a median (IQR) of $20\u2009352 ($10\u2009781-$43\u2009604) in 2010 to 2019 (P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nExploratory Analyses\nDiagnoses including any cause of acute respiratory failure displayed significant winter predominance. In-hospital mortality did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation. Seasonal trends and machine-learning models for respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality are shown in eFigure 10 in the Supplement. There were annual increases in admissions for acute respiratory failure from 2010 through February 2020, with a decline in spring 2020. There were 3517 admissions for acute respiratory failure in December 2019 compared with 2143 admissions in December 2018, and 2894 in January 2020 compared with 2050 in January 2019. Acute respiratory failure decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in April 2020. There were no significant changes in admissions with in-hospital mortality between 2010 and 2019. Admissions with in-hospital mortality decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in March 2020.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to use a large database to model pediatric admission volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic for various diagnoses compared with prior years. Using this approach, we identified seasonal patterns in a diverse group of pediatric conditions. Before 2020, pediatric admissions overall displayed winter predominance, associated with an increase in infectious respiratory conditions, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Summer-predominant conditions included trauma and admissions for semielective surgical conditions (eg, atrial septal defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children aged >1 year). The present study is in agreement with several prior studies documenting seasonality in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 asthma,16,19,20 Kawasaki syndrome,18 and trauma.21 However, we additionally noted novel seasonality for diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health admissions and the absence of seasonality in admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta. The seasonality of diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with children aged 5 years or older and may be reflective of the efforts of the American Diabetes Association to incorporate school personnel in the diabetes medical management plans for these patients.36\nAlthough COVID-19 has resulted in few pediatric admissions and mortalities compared with those for adults,1,9,10 the present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 vs a median of 43\u2009550 in April 2010-2019). Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. There was a premature termination of winter-predominant conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia and a reduction in admissions for asthma in 2020 compared with previous years. In exploratory analyses, this was coupled with a decrease in all acute respiratory failure diagnoses. Given the infectious nature of these conditions and their spread by respiratory droplets,37,38,39 this may have been associated with the effects of social distancing and possibly was even fortunate, given evidence of a potentially severe respiratory virus season in 2019 to 2020, with the highest number of respiratory failure admissions recorded in the past decade. A recent Australian study corroborates our findings, with more than 95% reduction in respiratory syncytial virus and influenza detection in Western Australia through winter 2020.40 Taken together, these studies suggest that rates of infectious pediatric respiratory conditions are potentially modifiable by changes in human behavior. Similarly, pediatric trauma admissions are often sports related,41 and the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with decreased childhood physical activity; thus, reductions in trauma admissions were anticipated.42 However, reductions in mental health admissions are surprising, given limited literature suggesting that pandemic-related stressors may worsen mental health in both the general population and those with preexisting psychiatric conditions.43,44 This may represent an opportunity for changes in the delivery of mental health care.45\nThe present study cannot delineate which changes in admission rates represent decreases in incidence, hospital avoidance, or unmet care needs. One inpatient survey suggested that greater than one-third of parents delayed seeking medical care for their child because of fears surrounding COVID-19,46 and case series have reported delayed presentations leading to harm.47,48 Similarly, although admissions for repair of atrial septal defects or later-stage repairs of hypoplastic left heart syndrome may safely be deferred for a short period, it is unclear whether reductions in admission rates represent purely elective surgical delays or the possibility of decreased recognition of congenital heart disease because of decreased contact with health care; small case series of increases in sudden death in adults with congenital heart disease without contact with health care institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported.49 Taken together, these findings are worrisome, although not definitive, in that unmet health care needs may be accumulating in the pediatric population as a result of decreased health care interactions.\nReduced patient volumes during early 2020 have reportedly contributed to financial instability for many hospitals and health systems.50 The reduction in charges observed in the present study suggests a proportionate decline in operating income. Although children\u2019s hospitals generally maintain better operating margins compared with other nonprofit hospitals, the 45.4% reduction in inpatient admissions at children\u2019s hospitals observed during the first 6 months of 2020 and 27.7% reduction in charges observed in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years has an influence on financial security.50,51 Leaders of children\u2019s hospitals could face unique challenges in the coming months as patient volumes eventually recover and are potentially coupled with the destabilizing financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCharacterizing alterations in usual patient admission patterns aids in anticipating the potential ramifications of recent national policies and can also help in crafting responses in a variety of areas. The present study highlights the strengths of an ensemble machine-learning approach to model complex time-series data displaying a variety of seasonal relationships. As complexity in medical information has increased, there has been progressive interest in the application of machine learning to facilitate clinical decision-making. Such algorithms have been studied in a diverse array of applications, including sepsis prediction,52 COVID-19 prognosis,53 population health,54 and cyberbullying.55 In the present study, before the COVID-19 pandemic,6,7 ensemble time-series forecasting models accurately predicted 70 of 72 monthly pediatric admission rates (97.2%) between July 2019 and December 2019. Quantification of the seasonality of various admission types in pediatrics has applicability for hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator capacity planning as well as trainee education. According to the present study, pediatricians and trainees assigned to inpatient wards in the winter will experience higher-than-average case burden and gain greater experience in managing pneumonia and bronchiolitis, whereas those assigned to emergency departments in the summer will achieve greater experience in the management of pediatric trauma. Such knowledge can be harnessed in the development of training curricula that support experience across the spectrum of pediatric illness.\nLimitations\nThis study has important limitations. As with any retrospective database analysis, admission diagnoses are vulnerable to misclassification owing to coding error. Although including greater than 5\u2009000\u2009000 inpatient encounters, this study is limited to 49 hospitals that consistently provided data to PHIS between January 2010 and June 2020 and may not be representative of national pediatric admission trends. Because of data availability, data from some admissions from late June 2020 are not yet available. This may have resulted in undercounting of admissions from June. However, hospitalizations for birth did not decrease below the 95% CIs for the forecasting model. It is also possible that some hospitals have been delayed in reporting admissions to PHIS because of the pandemic, although this is not a known data quality issue. Owing to data availability, only admissions between January and June 2020 were analyzed regarding the effects of social distancing. Further study is warranted as additional data become available.\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. These trends were effectively modeled with ensemble time-series forecasting algorithms. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotes\neFigure 1.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Trends in US Pediatric Hospital Admissions in 2020 Compared With the Decade Before the COVID-19 Pandemic\nJonathan H. Pelletier, Jaskaran Rakkar, Alicia K. Au, Dana Fuhrman, Robert S. B. Clark, Christopher M. Horvat\nUPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nAccepted for Publication: December 21, 2020. Published: February 12, 2021. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37227\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\n\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the US in January 2020. In response, the US declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, and implemented various social distancing measures. These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality. Although COVID-19 resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations, early reports indicate it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the US and worldwide.\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 49 children\u2019s hospitals across the US participating in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database. Patients were eligible if discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. Statistical analyses were performed using R Studio and R Project for Statistical Computing.\n\nResults\nThere were 5,424,688 encounters among 3,372,839 patients, of which 213,571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The cohort had a median age of 5.1 years and included 52.1% boys, 58.5% White individuals, 18.3% Black individuals, and 20.5% Hispanic individuals. A total of 54.9% had government insurance, and 45.7% had a preexisting complex chronic condition. The median length of stay was 3 days. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2%. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23,798 compared with a median of 43,550 in April 2010-2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years.\n\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nSeveral distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\n\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020. Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected.\n\nHospital Charges\nThe total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6,024,735,078 compared with a median of $6,229,556,859 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4,327,580,511 compared with a median of $5,983,142,102 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. The median per-admission charge in 2020 was $24,358 compared with a median of $20,352 in 2010 to 2019.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years. Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This At-a-Glance document is based on the association\u2019s 2024 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update: A Report of US and Global Data From the AHA, which is compiled annually by the AHA, the National Institutes of Health, and other collaborators. The years of data cited were the most recent available for each topic at the time the Update was written. American Heart Association Research \u2022 The AHA uses donations to fund research projects. Research applications are carefully weighed and selected by teams of scientists and healthcare professionals who volunteer for the association. \u2022 Ten investigators received Nobel Prizes for research wholly or partially supported by the AHA. \u2022 The AHA is the largest non-profit, non-governmental funder of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular research in the United States. \u2022 The AHA has funded more than $5 billion in research since 1949. Heart Disease, Stroke, and other Cardiovascular Diseases \u2022 Cardiovascular disease (CVD), listed as the underlying cause of death, accounted for 931,578 deaths in the United States in 2021. \u2022 Heart disease and stroke claimed more lives in 2021 in the United States than all forms of cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined. \u2022 Between 2017 and 2020, 127.9 million US adults (48.6%) had some form of CVD. Between 2019 and 2020, direct and indirect costs of total CVD were $422.3 billion ($254.3 billion in direct costs and $168.0 billion in lost productivity/mortality). \u2022 In 2017 to 2020 in the United States, 59.0% of non-Hispanic Black females and 58.9% of non-Hispanic Black males had some form of CVD. This race category had the highest prevalence of CVD. \u2022 In 2021 in the United States, coronary heart disease (CHD) was the leading cause of deaths (40.3%) attributable to CVD in the United States, followed by stroke (17.5%), other CVD (17.1%), high blood pressure (13.4%), heart failure (9.1%), diseases of the arteries (2.6%). \u2022 CVD accounted for 12% of total US health expenditures in 2019 to 2020, more than any major diagnostic group. \u2022 CVD accounted for approximately 19.91 million global deaths in 2021. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States. Please refer to the complete Statistics Update for references and additional information for reported statistics. \u00a92024 American Heart Association, Inc. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use prohibited. Coronary Heart Disease \u2022 CHD caused 375,476 deaths in 2021. \u2022 According to data from 2005 to 2014, the estimated annual incidence of heart attack in the United States was 605,000 new attacks and 200,000 recurrent attacks. Average age at the first heart attack was 65.6 years for males and 72.0 years for females. \u2022 Approximately every 40 seconds, someone in the United States will have a myocardial infarction. \u2022 From 2011 to 2021 in the United States, the annual death rate attributable to CHD declined 15.0% and the actual number of deaths increased 0.05%. \u2022 The estimated direct and indirect cost of heart disease, in 2019 to 2020 (average annual) was $252.2 billion in the United States. This cost includes CHD, heart failure, part of hypertensive disease, cardiac dysrhythmias, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary heart disease, and other or ill-defined heart diseases. Stroke \u2022 In 2021, stroke accounted for approximately 1 of every 21 deaths in the United States. \u2022 On average in 2021, someone died of stroke every 3 minutes 14 seconds in the United States. \u2022 Stroke caused 162,890 deaths in the United States in 2021. \u2022 In 2021, the age-adjusted US stroke death rate as an underlying cause of death was 41.1 per 100,000, an increase of 8.4% from 2011, and the actual number of stroke deaths increased 26.3% during the same time period. \u2022 In 2021, there were 7.44 million deaths attributable to stroke worldwide (3.71 million deaths from ischemic stroke, 3.38 million deaths from intracerebral hemorrhage, and 0.36 million from subarachnoid hemorrhage). o Oceania and Southeast and Central Asia had the highest rates of overall stroke mortality. o Central Asia and Eastern Europe had the highest mortality rates attributable to ischemic stroke. o Intracerebral hemorrhage mortality was highest in Oceania, followed by Southeast Asia and central and eastern sub-Saharan Africa. o Mortality attributable to subarachnoid hemorrhage was highest in Oceania, followed by Andean Latin America, and Southeast and Central Asia. Sudden Cardiac Arrest \u2022 In 2021, underlying cause sudden cardiac arrest mortality in the United States was 20,114. \u2022 According to 2022 US data, the majority of adult Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrests (OHCA) occur at a home or residence (72.1%). Public settings (17.3%) and nursing homes (10.6%) were the second and third most common locations of adult OHCA. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States. Please refer to the complete Statistics Update for references and additional information for reported statistics. \u00a92024 American Heart Association, Inc. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use prohibited. \u2022 According to 2022 US data for adult OHCA only, survival to hospital discharge was 9.3% for all EMS-treated non-traumatic OHCA cardiac arrests. Bystander witnessed adult arrests had a 14.0% survival to hospital discharge and 9-1-1 responder witnessed arrests had a 17.0% survival to hospital discharge. Heart Disease, Stroke and CVD Risk Factors The AHA gauges the cardiovascular health of the nation by tracking eight key health factors and behaviors that increase risks for heart disease and stroke. These are called \u201cLife\u2019s Essential 8\u201d and the AHA measures them to track progress toward improving cardiovascular health for all Americans. Life\u2019s Essential 8 are: not-smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, healthy body weight, sleep health, and control of cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Here are some key facts related to these factors: Smoking \u2022 Worldwide, tobacco contributed to an estimated 7.43 million deaths in 2021. \u2022 In the United States, smoking was the leading risk factor for years of life lost to premature mortality and the third leading risk factor for years of life lived with disability or injury in 2019. \u2022 A meta-analysis of 23 prospective and 17 case-control studies of cardiovascular risks associated with secondhand smoke exposure demonstrated 18%, 23%, 23%, and 29% increased risks for total mortality, total CVD, CHD, and stroke, respectively, in those exposed to secondhand smoke. \u2022 According to the 2020 Surgeon General\u2019s report on smoking cessation, >480 000 Americans die as a result of cigarette smoking and >41 000 die of secondhand smoke exposure each year, \u22481 in 5 deaths annually. \u2022 In 2022, 16.5% of US high school students and 4.5% of middle school students reported current tobacco product use. Additionally, 2.0% of US high school students and 1.0% of middle school students smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days. In the past 30 days, 14.1% of US high school students and 3.3% of middle school students used e-cigarettes. \u2022 In 2022, 11.5% of US adults reported cigarette use every day or some days (13.1% of males and 10.1% of females). Physical Inactivity \u2022 In 2020, the overall prevalence of meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans for aerobic activity was 24.2% in US adults. \u2022 Among US high school students in 2019, 44.1% were physically active for 60 minutes or more on at least 5 days of the week. Nutrition \u2022 Using the AHA\u2019s Life\u2019s Essential 8 scoring metric, diet was among the 4 metrics with the lowest scores; the range for diet across demographic groups was 23.8 to 47.7 out of 100. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States. Please refer to the complete Statistics Update for references and additional information for reported statistics. \u00a92024 American Heart Association, Inc. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use prohibited. \u2022 Among children 2 to 5 years of age, a mean diet score of 61.1 out of 100 was observed. The score for children 12 to 19 years of age was 28.5 out of 100. \u2022 Using 2019 data, an estimated 7.9 million deaths and 188 million disability-adjusted life years were attributable to dietary risks. The leading dietary risk factors were high sodium intake, low whole grain intake, and low legume intake. Overweight/Obesity \u2022 In the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity among adults from 2017 to 2020 was 41.8% in males and 41.8% in females. \u2022 The age-adjusted prevalence of severe obesity in adults in the United States in 2017 to 2020 was 6.6% in males and 11.7% in females. \u2022 Worldwide, high body mass index was attributed to 3.69 million deaths in 2021, a change of 46.7% compared with 2010. \u2022 According to the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study, age-standardized mortality rates attributable to high body mass index were lowest in high-income Asia Pacific and highest in southern sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, and Oceania. Cholesterol \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 86.4 million, or 34.7% of US adults had total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL or higher. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020 about 24.7 million, or 10.0% of US adults had total cholesterol of 240 mg/dL or higher. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 63.1 million, or 25.5% of US adults had high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (130 mg/dL or higher). \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 41.3 million, or 16.9% of US adults had low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL). \u2022 Globally in 2021 there were 3.72 million deaths attributable to high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a 19.8% change from 2010. Sleep \u2022 Analysis of 2020 data indicates that the proportion of US adults reporting insufficient sleep (<7 hours) was 32.8% (females, 32.2%; males, 33.4%). Prevalence of reporting insufficient sleep was lowest among older adults (>65 years of age) with 27.3% of females and 24.7% of males in this older group reporting <7 hours of sleep per night. \u2022 Based on 2020 data, 43.7% of US adults self-report they wake up feeling well rested on some days or never (46.9% of females; 40.4% of males). \u2022 Based on 2020 data, during the last 30 days, 24.3% of US adults responded that they had trouble falling or staying asleep on most or all days (27.8% female; 20.6% male). 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States.

Diabetes \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, an estimated 29.3 million (10.6%) US adults had diagnosed diabetes. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, an estimated 9.7 million (3.5%) US adults had undiagnosed diabetes. Additionally, 115.9 million (46.4%) US adults had prediabetes. \u2022 In 2021, 103,294 US deaths were attributed to diabetes. \u2022 In 2021, an estimated 1.70 million deaths were attributed to diabetes globally. This represents an age-standardized mortality rate of 19.93 per 100,000. High Blood Pressure (HBP) \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 122.4 million (46.7%) US adults had hypertension. \u2022 In 2021, there were 124,508 US deaths primarily attributable to HBP. \u2022 In 2021, the age-adjusted US death rate primarily attributable to HBP was 31.3 per 100,000.

There was a maximum 45.4% reduction in admissions in 2020, associated with a 27.7% reduction in hospital charges, with significant reductions in all examined diagnoses except for birth.\nMeaning\nIn this study, inpatient pediatric admissions in 2020 were reduced across a heterogeneous range of diagnoses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAbstract\nImportance\nIn early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear.\nObjective\nTo determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nNumber of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter.\nResults\nOf 5\u2009424\u2009688 inpatient encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2\u2009823\u2009748 [52.1%] boys; 3\u2009171\u2009224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213\u2009571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43\u2009550 [42\u2009110-43\u2009946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 [$5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$6\u2009324\u2009978\u2009456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020.\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States in January 2020.1 In response, the United States declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, expanded airport screenings, required quarantines for travelers, and undertook public information efforts.2,3 Case counts and fatalities increased slowly in January and February 2020 before achieving exponential growth in March 2020.4 Individual states began additional mitigation strategies in the spring, including stay-at-home orders, which took effect from early March through June 2020.5,6 These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality.6,7 Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for the use of face coverings on April 3, 2020, although enforcement varied by state.3,8 Although COVID-19 has resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations,1,9,10 early reports indicate that it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the United States11 and worldwide.12,13 A 2020 study from Brazil,14 in which regional differences contributed to peak bronchiolitis between February and August, showed a 78% to 85% reduction in hospitalization in infants younger than 1 year for acute bronchiolitis in 2020 compared with previous years.\nMany pediatric diagnoses warranting inpatient admission exhibit seasonal variation; prior work has characterized winter predominance in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 and Kawasaki syndrome18; autumn predominance in asthma16,19,20; and summer predominance in trauma.21 These fluctuations in disease pattern are likely influenced by population susceptibility and behavior as well as various environmental factors. However, to our knowledge, the seasonal patterns in other pediatric admissions remain unexplored. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database22 to determine the seasonal patterns of a variety of common pediatric admission diagnoses and compare data from the previous decade with 2020 admissions. Given the changes in population behavior in 2020,6,7 we hypothesized that pediatric admissions for a variety of diagnoses would be decreased in 2020 compared with prior years, except for admissions for birth.23,24\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 51 children\u2019s hospitals across the United States participating in PHIS, an online, quality-controlled, anonymized, administrative database maintained by the Children\u2019s Hospital Association.22,25 To ensure that changes in admission rates over time were reflective of changes in caseload, rather than expansion of the database by inclusion of new hospitals, the present study was limited to the 49 hospitals that have been providing data since 2010. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were no exclusion criteria. Patients were filtered according to their primary admission diagnoses based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 codes, depending on whether their admission was before or after October 1, 2015. Selected diagnoses were determined according to the percentage of total admissions in PHIS, disease pathophysiology, and seasonal distribution between 2010 and 2019. The full list of included ICD codes for each diagnosis group is included in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. This study was granted exemption by the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board; because the data were anonymous, informed consent could not be obtained. This manuscript follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies.26\nStatistical Analysis\nEncounter-level clinical and administrative data were extracted from PHIS (admission and discharge dates, age, sex, race, ethnicity, diagnostic codes, insurance status, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, complex chronic conditions,27 mechanical ventilation, abstracted charges, and cost). Admissions were described with summary statistics. Hospital charges were adjusted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index according to hospital zip code in PHIS.22 Charge-over-time analyses were adjusted for the quarterly gross domestic product, provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and expressed in quarter 1, 2010, dollars.28 Admission dates were grouped into month and year. Admission numbers were transformed into time series, databased on date of admission, and displayed graphically. Seasonality testing was performed with the Webel and Ollech method.29 Seasonal trends in admission rates between 2010 and 2019 were displayed with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. For visual comparison, the number of admissions in 2020 was displayed against the aforementioned models. For each diagnosis group, ensemble machine-learning forecasting models were created with autoregressive integrated moving average,30 neural network,31 and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms,32 each weighted on time-series cross-validation.33 Time-series data were arranged such that each model was trained on data from January 1, 2010, until June 30, 2019. Model forecasts were tested against actual admission numbers from July 1, 2019, until June 30, 2020. Model predictions were assessed with mean absolute percentage error,33 and the error rates for July 2019 to December 2019 were compared against those for January 2020 to June 2020. To quantify whether social distancing had a statistically significant association with pediatric admission rates, the actual admission rate in 2019 vs 2020 was compared against the ensemble algorithm\u2019s 95% CI.33 We conducted 2 exploratory analyses by repeating the aforementioned steps for patients with any diagnostic code for acute respiratory failure and for in-hospital mortality. All statistical analyses were performed with R Studio version 1.3.1073 and R versions 4.0.2 and 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing) with the following packages: Metrics, forecastHybrid, thief, forecast, cowplot, lubridate, forcats, stringr, dplyr, purrr, readr, tidyr, tibble, ggplot2, and tidyverse.34 An \u03b1 value of .05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance, and all tests were 2-tailed. The code used to create the manuscript is publicly available.35\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nThere were 49 hospitals with admission data in PHIS between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients beginning in 2010, of which 213\u2009571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. As shown in the Table, the cohort had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 5.1 (0.7-13.3) years and included 2\u2009823\u2009748 (52.1%) boys, 3\u2009171\u2009224 (58.5%) White individuals, 994\u2009915 (18.3%) Black individuals, and 1\u2009111\u2009025 (20.5%) Hispanic individuals. A total of 2\u2009977\u2009372 patients (54.9%) had government insurance, and 2\u2009481\u2009647 (45.7%) had a preexisting complex chronic condition. As shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement, the median (IQR) length of stay was 3 (2-5) days. A total of 186\u2009238 admissions (3.4%) had a length of stay of 30 days or more. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2% (5\u2009380\u2009125 encounters). There were 16 selected diagnoses, encompassing 1\u2009446\u2009376 encounters (26.7%). The number of encounters for each selected diagnosis is shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement; birth, bronchiolitis, and trauma were the most common diagnoses.\nTable. \nAbbreviations: CMS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; ECMO, extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; PHIS, Pediatric Health Information Systems.\nSeasonal Patterns in PHIS Admissions\nOverall admissions in PHIS between 2010 and 2019 are shown in Figure 1. There was an increase in the total number of admissions in winter months compared with summer months between 2010 and 2019. There were significantly fewer admissions in July vs January in 2010 to 2019 (median [IQR], 40\u2009726 [40\u2009063-41\u2009839] vs 47\u2009116 [45\u2009472-48\u2009298]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). As shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement, there was a significantly lower median (IQR) number of intensive care unit admissions and admissions requiring mechanical ventilation in July vs January 2010 to 2019 (7097 [6754-7483] vs 8002 [7222-8501]; P\u2009=\u2009.04 and 4140 [3962-4234] vs 4525 [4213-4776]; P\u2009=\u2009.02, respectively). There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23\u2009798 compared with a median (IQR) of 43\u2009550 (42\u2009110-43\u2009946) in April 2010 to 2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years, with 26\u2009089 in June 2020 compared with a median (IQR) of 40\u2009824 (40\u2009302-41\u2009583) in June 2010 to 2019.\nA, Number of monthly admissions in Pediatric Health Information Systems between January 2010 and June 2020, represented as a bar chart. B, Number of monthly admissions between January 2010 and June 2020 represented as a line chart. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nAdmissions by diagnoses are shown in Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. Several distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Because bronchiolitis coding changed in ICD-10 to include separate diagnostic codes for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, the seasonality of individual pathogens is shown in eFigure 4 in the Supplement for 2016 to 2019. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance, associated with the school-year calendar. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance, inversely associated with the school-year calendar in children aged 5 years and older, as shown in eFigure 5 in the Supplement. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. In the case of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, summer predominance was associated with admissions in children older than 1 year, as shown in eFigure 6 in the Supplement. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\nEach panel shows the number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (denoted in red). Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected. Changes in seasonal patterns identified with ensemble time-series forecasting models are shown in Figure 3 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement. Overall, models accurately predicted admission rates from July until December 2019 but not from January to June 2020 (mean absolute percentage error range, 3% to 21.2% vs 8.5% to 1111.7%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.06). A total of 70 of 72 monthly admission (97.2%) rates between July and December 2019 fell within the 95% CI of the models. The admission rates for atrial septal defect and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were below the 95% CI predicted by the models in August and December 2019, respectively. All other conditions remained within the model 95% CIs between July and December 2019. Admissions for birth remained within the model 95% CI between January and June 2020. Every other condition decreased below the model 95% CI between January and June 2020.\nEach panel shows the estimated number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020, according to ensemble forecasting models including autoregressive integrated moving average, neural network, and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms weighted on time-series cross-validation. All models were trained on data from January 2010 through June 2019, and the testing window for each model is shown. The blue line is the model estimate, and the dark and light blue shaded regions are the model 80% and 95% CIs, respectively. The red line is the actual number of admissions for each month. The vertical line represents January 2020. MAPE indicates mean absolute percentage error.\nHospital Charges\nOverall, 5\u2009377\u2009745 of 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters (99.1%) among 3\u2009356\u2009656 patients had hospital charge data available. The quarterly total hospital charges, adjusted for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index and quarterly gross domestic product, are shown in eFigure 8 in the Supplement. The per-admission charges with the same adjustments are shown in eFigure 9 in the Supplement. The total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6\u2009024\u2009735\u2009078 compared with a median (IQR) of $6\u2009229\u2009556\u2009859 ($5\u2009951\u2009083\u2009755-$6\u2009551\u2009134\u2009282) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 compared with a median (IQR) of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 ($5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$5\u2009991\u2009085\u2009056) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. However, the median (IQR) per-admission charge in 2020 was $24\u2009358 ($12\u2009631-$51\u2009740) compared with a median (IQR) of $20\u2009352 ($10\u2009781-$43\u2009604) in 2010 to 2019 (P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nExploratory Analyses\nDiagnoses including any cause of acute respiratory failure displayed significant winter predominance. In-hospital mortality did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation. Seasonal trends and machine-learning models for respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality are shown in eFigure 10 in the Supplement. There were annual increases in admissions for acute respiratory failure from 2010 through February 2020, with a decline in spring 2020. There were 3517 admissions for acute respiratory failure in December 2019 compared with 2143 admissions in December 2018, and 2894 in January 2020 compared with 2050 in January 2019. Acute respiratory failure decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in April 2020. There were no significant changes in admissions with in-hospital mortality between 2010 and 2019. Admissions with in-hospital mortality decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in March 2020.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to use a large database to model pediatric admission volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic for various diagnoses compared with prior years. Using this approach, we identified seasonal patterns in a diverse group of pediatric conditions. Before 2020, pediatric admissions overall displayed winter predominance, associated with an increase in infectious respiratory conditions, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Summer-predominant conditions included trauma and admissions for semielective surgical conditions (eg, atrial septal defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children aged >1 year). The present study is in agreement with several prior studies documenting seasonality in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 asthma,16,19,20 Kawasaki syndrome,18 and trauma.21 However, we additionally noted novel seasonality for diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health admissions and the absence of seasonality in admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta. The seasonality of diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with children aged 5 years or older and may be reflective of the efforts of the American Diabetes Association to incorporate school personnel in the diabetes medical management plans for these patients.36\nAlthough COVID-19 has resulted in few pediatric admissions and mortalities compared with those for adults,1,9,10 the present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 vs a median of 43\u2009550 in April 2010-2019). Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. There was a premature termination of winter-predominant conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia and a reduction in admissions for asthma in 2020 compared with previous years. In exploratory analyses, this was coupled with a decrease in all acute respiratory failure diagnoses. Given the infectious nature of these conditions and their spread by respiratory droplets,37,38,39 this may have been associated with the effects of social distancing and possibly was even fortunate, given evidence of a potentially severe respiratory virus season in 2019 to 2020, with the highest number of respiratory failure admissions recorded in the past decade. A recent Australian study corroborates our findings, with more than 95% reduction in respiratory syncytial virus and influenza detection in Western Australia through winter 2020.40 Taken together, these studies suggest that rates of infectious pediatric respiratory conditions are potentially modifiable by changes in human behavior. Similarly, pediatric trauma admissions are often sports related,41 and the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with decreased childhood physical activity; thus, reductions in trauma admissions were anticipated.42 However, reductions in mental health admissions are surprising, given limited literature suggesting that pandemic-related stressors may worsen mental health in both the general population and those with preexisting psychiatric conditions.43,44 This may represent an opportunity for changes in the delivery of mental health care.45\nThe present study cannot delineate which changes in admission rates represent decreases in incidence, hospital avoidance, or unmet care needs. One inpatient survey suggested that greater than one-third of parents delayed seeking medical care for their child because of fears surrounding COVID-19,46 and case series have reported delayed presentations leading to harm.47,48 Similarly, although admissions for repair of atrial septal defects or later-stage repairs of hypoplastic left heart syndrome may safely be deferred for a short period, it is unclear whether reductions in admission rates represent purely elective surgical delays or the possibility of decreased recognition of congenital heart disease because of decreased contact with health care; small case series of increases in sudden death in adults with congenital heart disease without contact with health care institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported.49 Taken together, these findings are worrisome, although not definitive, in that unmet health care needs may be accumulating in the pediatric population as a result of decreased health care interactions.\nReduced patient volumes during early 2020 have reportedly contributed to financial instability for many hospitals and health systems.50 The reduction in charges observed in the present study suggests a proportionate decline in operating income. Although children\u2019s hospitals generally maintain better operating margins compared with other nonprofit hospitals, the 45.4% reduction in inpatient admissions at children\u2019s hospitals observed during the first 6 months of 2020 and 27.7% reduction in charges observed in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years has an influence on financial security.50,51 Leaders of children\u2019s hospitals could face unique challenges in the coming months as patient volumes eventually recover and are potentially coupled with the destabilizing financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCharacterizing alterations in usual patient admission patterns aids in anticipating the potential ramifications of recent national policies and can also help in crafting responses in a variety of areas. The present study highlights the strengths of an ensemble machine-learning approach to model complex time-series data displaying a variety of seasonal relationships. As complexity in medical information has increased, there has been progressive interest in the application of machine learning to facilitate clinical decision-making. Such algorithms have been studied in a diverse array of applications, including sepsis prediction,52 COVID-19 prognosis,53 population health,54 and cyberbullying.55 In the present study, before the COVID-19 pandemic,6,7 ensemble time-series forecasting models accurately predicted 70 of 72 monthly pediatric admission rates (97.2%) between July 2019 and December 2019. Quantification of the seasonality of various admission types in pediatrics has applicability for hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator capacity planning as well as trainee education. According to the present study, pediatricians and trainees assigned to inpatient wards in the winter will experience higher-than-average case burden and gain greater experience in managing pneumonia and bronchiolitis, whereas those assigned to emergency departments in the summer will achieve greater experience in the management of pediatric trauma. Such knowledge can be harnessed in the development of training curricula that support experience across the spectrum of pediatric illness.\nLimitations\nThis study has important limitations. As with any retrospective database analysis, admission diagnoses are vulnerable to misclassification owing to coding error. Although including greater than 5\u2009000\u2009000 inpatient encounters, this study is limited to 49 hospitals that consistently provided data to PHIS between January 2010 and June 2020 and may not be representative of national pediatric admission trends. Because of data availability, data from some admissions from late June 2020 are not yet available. This may have resulted in undercounting of admissions from June. However, hospitalizations for birth did not decrease below the 95% CIs for the forecasting model. It is also possible that some hospitals have been delayed in reporting admissions to PHIS because of the pandemic, although this is not a known data quality issue. Owing to data availability, only admissions between January and June 2020 were analyzed regarding the effects of social distancing. Further study is warranted as additional data become available.\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. These trends were effectively modeled with ensemble time-series forecasting algorithms. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotes\neFigure 1.

    "Summarized_Document1": "This document provides key statistics about heart disease, stroke, other cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and their risk factors, based on the 2024 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update by the American Heart Association (AHA). The AHA is the largest non-profit funder of cardiovascular research in the US, having funded over $5 billion in research since 1949. In 2021, CVD was the underlying cause of 931,578 deaths in the US, more than cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined. Between 2017 and 2020, 127.9 million US adults (48.6%) had some form of CVD. The direct and indirect costs of CVD in 2019-2020 were $422.3 billion. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was the leading cause of CVD deaths in 2021, accounting for 40.3% of CVD deaths. Stroke accounted for 17.5% of CVD deaths, with 162,890 deaths in 2021. Sudden cardiac arrest caused 20,114 deaths in 2021. The AHA tracks eight key health factors and behaviors, known as Life\u2019s Essential 8, to gauge cardiovascular health: not smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, healthy body weight, sleep health, and control of cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Smoking contributed to 7.43 million deaths worldwide in 2021. In the US, 16.5% of high school students and 4.5% of middle school students reported current tobacco use in 2022. Physical inactivity was prevalent, with only 24.2% of US adults meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines in 2020. Nutrition scores were low, with children aged 2-5 scoring 61.1 out of 100 and those aged 12-19 scoring 28.5 out of 100. Obesity affected 41.8% of US adults from 2017 to 2020. High cholesterol was prevalent, with 34.7% of US adults having total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL or higher. Insufficient sleep was reported by 32.8% of US adults in 2020. Diabetes affected 10.6% of US adults from 2017 to 2020, with 103,294 deaths attributed to diabetes in 2021.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Trends in US Pediatric Hospital Admissions in 2020 Compared With the Decade Before the COVID-19 Pandemic\nJonathan H. Pelletier, Jaskaran Rakkar, Alicia K. Au, Dana Fuhrman, Robert S. B. Clark, Christopher M. Horvat\nUPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nAccepted for Publication: December 21, 2020. Published: February 12, 2021. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37227\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\n\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the US in January 2020. In response, the US declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, and implemented various social distancing measures. These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality. Although COVID-19 resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations, early reports indicate it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the US and worldwide.\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 49 children\u2019s hospitals across the US participating in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database. Patients were eligible if discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. Statistical analyses were performed using R Studio and R Project for Statistical Computing.\n\nResults\nThere were 5,424,688 encounters among 3,372,839 patients, of which 213,571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The cohort had a median age of 5.1 years and included 52.1% boys, 58.5% White individuals, 18.3% Black individuals, and 20.5% Hispanic individuals. A total of 54.9% had government insurance, and 45.7% had a preexisting complex chronic condition. The median length of stay was 3 days. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2%. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23,798 compared with a median of 43,550 in April 2010-2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years.\n\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nSeveral distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\n\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020. Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected.\n\nHospital Charges\nThe total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6,024,735,078 compared with a median of $6,229,556,859 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4,327,580,511 compared with a median of $5,983,142,102 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. The median per-admission charge in 2020 was $24,358 compared with a median of $20,352 in 2010 to 2019.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years. Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Unfortunately, chemotherapy is associated with a number of potentially life-threatening side effects. There is a need to ameliorate chemotoxicity to improve therapeutic outcomes and quality of life. Chemotoxicity arises from systemic DNA damage and inflammation in healthy cells due to chemotherapy drugs. Traditionally, these processes are believed to be caused by the direct death of normal cells by chemotherapeutic drugs. However, new research has challenged this dogma by suggesting that chemotoxicity is a secondary effect associated with the release of cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) from cells subjected to drug-induced death. Released cfChPs can freely enter into bystander healthy cells to inflict double-strand (dsDNA) breaks and activate inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. The drug-induced cell death and cfChPs release have cascading effects that exaggerate and prolong chemotoxicity. Furthermore, evidence has emerged from laboratory and preclinical studies, and two phase II clinical trials, indicating that chemotoxicity can be minimised by deactivating cfChPs. Three cfChPs-deactivating agents have been identified, of which the nutraceutical combination resveratrol and copper (R\u2013Cu)\u2014easily administered orally and with little toxicity\u2014is the agent of choice for human therapeutic use. This article aims to provide practising medical oncologists with a perspective on this emerging research on chemotoxicity and its prevention and its potential implications for the future. Well-designed randomised clinical trials will be necessary to establish the true clinical value of these findings in day-to-day practice.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nThe thioredoxin system determines CHK1 inhibitor sensitivity via redox-mediated regulation of ribonucleotide reductase activity\n                                        \n\n\nThe dual role of ferroptosis in anthracycline-based chemotherapy includes reducing resistance and increasing toxicity\n                                        \n\n\nNatural products: potential treatments for cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity\n                                        \n\nIntroduction\nGlobally, over 19 million new cancer cases are detected annually [1]. Most individuals diagnosed with cancer receive some form of chemotherapy, with or without additional treatment, and experience varying degrees of toxic side effects. Indeed, the clinical spectrum of toxicities is vast, ranging from less severe toxicities, such as nausea, vomiting, dysgeusia, and hair loss, to those that are more serious and potentially life-threatening including myelosuppression, febrile neutropenia, severe oral mucositis, and sepsis [2, 3]. In addition to these acute toxicities, several late effects are associated with chemotherapy, involving the cardiac [4, 5], neurological [6], renal [7], pulmonary [8], and hepatic systems [9]. Estimates indicate that more than a quarter of patients receiving conventional chemotherapy experience severe (grade IV) potentially life-threatening toxicities [10]. Several therapies are prescribed to mitigate the toxic effects of chemotherapy, with variable success rates.\nChemotherapy-induced toxicity results from systemic DNA damage and inflammation in healthy cells [11], traditionally believed to be caused by the direct death of normal cells by chemotherapeutic drugs [12]. However, recent research has challenged this belief by suggesting a novel mechanism of chemotoxicity involving cfChPs that are released from cells subjected to drug-induced death [13,14,15], with evidence indicating that the toxicity of chemotherapy can be minimised by deactivating cfChPs [16]. This evidence has been sourced from laboratory studies at the cellular level, pre-clinical animal studies, and clinical trials in patients with cancer, each of which is discussed in detail below.\nLaboratory studies\nThe mechanism of the bystander effect, which is characterised by damage to non-targeted and often distant cells in association with chemotherapy (and radiotherapy) [16, 17], has perplexed scientists for decades. For example, when Adriamycin-killed lymphocytic leukaemia (Jurkat) cells were co-cultured with normal NIH3T3 cells, the bystander NIH3T3 cells showed upregulation of markers of DNA damage, DNA repair, and apoptosis in the form of increased expression of phosphorylated histone H2AX (\u03b3H2AX), phosphorylated ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein (p-ATM), and caspase-3, respectively; pro-inflammatory markers, including NF-\u03baB, TNF\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-6, also showed notable upregulation [14]. When experiments in the same study were performed using dead Jurkat cells that had been pre-labelled with the thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) prior to Adriamycin treatment, numerous BrdU-labelled fluorescent particles representing DNA were found to have accumulated in the nuclei of NIH3T3 cells. This indicated the involvement of cfChPs released from dying Jurkat cells in the aforementioned bystander effect. The phenomenon of chemotherapy-induced bystander effect is pictorially depicted in Fig.\u00a01. During experiments conducted in vivo, in which chemotherapy-induced dying cancer cells were intravenously injected into mice, activation of H2AX and NF-\u03baB was observed in the cells of the brain, liver, and lung in association with the integration of cfChPs released from the dying cells into the genomes of cells of these distant organs [14]. The bystander effects were eliminated following the concurrent use of three different cfChPs-deactivating agents: anti-histone antibody complexed nanoparticles (CNPs) [18], DNAse I, and a combination of the nutraceuticals R\u2013Cu [14]. The latter findings incriminated cfChPs in the pathophysiology of the bystander effect in vivo.\na MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were dually fluorescently labelled in their DNA with BrdU and in their histones with H2B-GFP according to a method described by us earlier [15] The dually labelled cells were treated with Adriamycin for 48\u2009h and the dead cells were mixed with healthy NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells at a ratio of 1:30 and plated on coverslips in a culture dish. After 24\u2009h of incubation, the cells were fixed and examined by fluorescent microscopy. The dead MDA-MB-231 cell is marked with an arrow. Dually labelled cfChPs are clearly detected in bystander NIH3T3 cells. b B16F10 mouse melanoma cells were pre-labelled in their DNA with BrdU and killed with Adriamycin. The dying cells were mixed with normal NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells at a ratio of 1:30 and plated on coverslips on a petri dish. After 24\u2009h of incubation, the cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against BrdU and \u03b3H2AX. BrdU-labelled DNA particles from the dying B16F10 melanoma cell (marked with arrow) are clearly seen in bystander NIH3T3 cells which co-localise with \u03b3H2AX signals indicating dsDNA breaks in them.\nCell-free chromatin particles are also involved in the radiation-induced bystander effect. When NIH3T3 cells were treated with conditioned media obtained from irradiated cells, the upregulation of \u03b3H2AX, NF-\u03baB, IL-6, and active caspase-3 were clearly observed [15]. There was also evidence of large-scale chromosomal aberrations including dicentric, acentric, fusion, and Robertsonian fusion chromosomes. The above bystander effects were abrogated when the conditioned medium was pre-treated with CNPs, DNase I, or R-Cu. In the same study, radiation treatment also led to systemic bystander effects; irradiation of the lower hemi-body of mice with \u03b3-rays (10\u2009Gy) led to the activation of H2AX, NF\u03baB, IL-6, and active caspase-3 in brain cells [15]. Activation of these bystander biomarkers was abrogated by concurrent treatment with CNPs, DNase I, and R-Cu, thereby directly implicating cfChPs in systemic bystander effects [15].\nActivity and bystander effects of cfChPs\nCell-free chromatin particles released from chemotherapy-induced dying cells are apparently phagocytosed by bystander healthy cells. This was revealed by the micro-array analysis performed following co-culture of dying cells with healthy cells, which showed upregulation of pathways related to phagocytosis at 6\u2009h [14]. The internalised cfChPs were found to integrate into the genomes of the host cells as confirmed by whole-genome sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis, and the identification of many human Alu elements in the recipient cells [13, 14]. Genomic integration led to dsDNA breaks and activation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways [13, 14] which are the critical elements of the bystander effect.\nPreclinical studies\nPreclinical animal studies using the abovementioned cfChPs-deactivating agents have shown great promise [16]. Mice (5 per group) injected with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (Adriamycin) demonstrated a surge in the release of cfChPs from dying cells into the bloodstream, accompanied by an upsurge of inflammatory cytokines C-reactive protein, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 [16]. All values were highly significant when compared with untreated controls with p values ranging between <0.01 and <0.0001. Although the timing of these effects can vary, the most significant upregulation of NF-\u03baB, IL-6, active caspase-3, and \u03b3-H2AX is typically seen 18\u2009h following chemotherapy. Blood collected following chemotherapy administration from mice treated with the three cfChPs-deactivating agents, viz. CNPs, DNAse I, and R-Cu led to significant downregulation of the inflammatory cytokines compared with untreated controls with p values ranging between >0.05 and >0.0001 [16]. When the Adriamycin-treated mice were dissected and their organs were examined for markers of DNA damage, apoptosis, and inflammation, a remarkable downregulation of the activated \u03b3H2AX, caspase-3, NF-\u03baB, and IL-6 was observed with values that were almost identical to those in controls not treated with doxorubicin (p values ranging between >0.01 and >0.0001) [16]. These effects were observed in multiple organs, including the lungs, liver, heart, brain, ovaries, skin, and small intestine (Fig.\u00a02). Identical results were observed in association with the administration of other chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, methotrexate, and paclitaxel, with a significant downregulation of \u03b3H2AX and NF-\u03baB in the brain and peripheral blood mononuclear cells following the use of cfChPs-deactivating agents. Furthermore, the occurrence of potentially life-threatening neutropenia was also significantly reduced with the concurrent use of neutralising agents [16]. Following the administration of a lethal dose of doxorubicin (20\u2009mg/kg), the overall survival of mice (10 in each group) was also significantly prolonged using cfChPs-deactivating agents, with some mice surviving the lethal dose of doxorubicin with p values ranging between >0.05 and >0.0001 [16].\nThe bars represent the mean values of five animals in each group. Statistical comparisons were carried out using unpaired Student\u2019s t-tests. Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM values of all groups were significantly lower than that of the doxorubicin group, with p values ranging between <0.01 and <0.0001 (reproduced with permission from [16] with modification).\nThe chemotoxicity enigma\nOne particularly puzzling aspect of chemotoxicity is its chronology. Although the half-life of most chemotherapy drugs is approximately 24\u2009h [19], their toxic side effects last for 2\u20133 weeks. For example, chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression reaches a nadir after 7\u201314 days, and the ensuing neutropenia often takes more than 3 weeks to recover. Similarly, chemotherapy-associated oral mucositis typically begins 5\u20137 days after initiating chemotherapy [20]. The results discussed above may help elucidate on the nature of this conundrum. Specifically, the aforementioned findings suggest that DNA damage, apoptosis, and inflammation directly resulting from the action of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) are minimal, and most toxic side effects are induced by cfChPs that are released from the initial round of drug-induced cell death. The latter mechanism sets in motion a cascading effect, whereby dying cells release more cfChPs, leading to a vicious cycle of further DNA damage, apoptosis, and inflammation in bystander cells, thereby amplifying and prolonging the toxic effects of chemotherapy. The vicious cycle of cascading bystander cell death resulting from chemotherapy treatment is illustrated in Fig.\u00a03.\nChemotherapy induced cell death sets in motion a vicious cycle of more cell death triggered by cfChPs released from dying cells. The vicious cycle can be broken by oxygen radicals generated by a combination of resveratrol with copper.\nResveratrol\u2013copper and its mechanism of action\nOf the three deactivating agents for cfChPs that have been previously utilised in preclinical studies, namely, CNPs, DNAse I, and R-Cu, the latter has been proven to be the agent of choice for therapeutic use in humans [21]. This is primarily because R-Cu can be easily administered orally and has demonstrated little toxicity in preclinical and clinical studies, even after prolonged administration [22]. Resveratrol (R) is a nutraceutical that has been extensively studied because of its antioxidant properties [23]. However, it acts as a prooxidant in the presence of copper (Cu), another widely researched nutraceutical [24]. R catalyses the reduction of Cu (II) to Cu (I), resulting in the generation of oxygen radicals via a Fenton-like reaction (Fig.\u00a04) [25]. The oxygen radicals thus generated have previously been shown to be capable of cleaving plasmid pBR322 DNA [26, 27]. It was subsequently demonstrated that a combination of R and Cu can degrade genomic DNA and RNA [28] and can also deactivate cfChPs by degrading their DNA components [15, 16, 29]. Paradoxically, it has also been found that the DNA-degrading activity of R-Cu increases with a reduction in the molar concentration of Cu [28]. This finding has led to the establishment of the concentrations of R and Cu used in the clinical studies described below, wherein the molar ratio of R to Cu is maintained at 1:10-4.\nResveratrol catalyses the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I); the latter reacts with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), leading to the formation of hydroxide ions (OH-), and a hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) and also regenerates Cu(II) in a cyclic manner.

Utilising R-Cu as an essential deactivator of cfChPs formed the foundation of two phase II clinical trials [30, 31]. The first study was a dose-escalation pilot study in which 25 patients with multiple myeloma receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were enrolled. Five patients formed the control group and the remaining 20 were administered one of two different doses of R-Cu (R\u2009=\u20095.6\u2009mg and Cu = 560\u2009ng, or R\u2009=\u200950\u2009mg and Cu = 5\u2009\u03bcg, both administered orally twice daily) 48\u2009h before melphalan chemotherapy, continuing a twice-daily dose of R-Cu until 21 days post-transplantation [30]. The primary objective was to evaluate the immediate post-BMT toxicities, namely mucositis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, the requirement of opioids, and the need for total parenteral nutrition. An objective evaluation of inflammation was performed by measuring the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum and saliva. The study found a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of grade 3 mucositis and the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. The incidence of grade III/IV oral mucositis was 100% in the control group versus 40% in the R-Cu groups (p\u2009=\u20090.039). Other adverse effects and cytokine levels showed non-significant reduction.\nAnother prospective open-label phase II single\u2011arm study was conducted to check for reduced haematological and non-haematological toxicities in 30 patients with advanced gastric cancer following docetaxel-based multi-agent chemotherapy [31]. Patients received R-Cu (dosage: R\u2009=\u20095.6\u2009mg and Cu = 560\u2009ng) orally thrice daily concurrently with chemotherapy for 6 months or until evidence of disease progression, whichever occurred sooner. Although the cumulative incidence of overall and haematological toxicity declined, this failed to reach statistical significance. However, the incidence of more troublesome non-haematological toxicities, such as hand-foot syndrome, diarrhoea, and vomiting, was dramatically reduced in the R-Cu group compared to a historical cohort.\nEffect of R-Cu on tumour cells\nIn addition to the role of R-Cu in minimising chemotoxicity, it may have potential therapeutic effects on tumour cells. The oxygen radicals that are generated by the R-Cu combination not only deactivate extracellular cfChPs to prevent the damaging bystander effects of chemotherapy, but they can also enter into the tumour to deactivate intratumoural cfChPs that are derived from dying cancer cells. A recent study in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (OSCC) detected the copious presence of cfChPs in the tumour microenvironment (TME) derived from dying cancer cells, which were eradicated following 2 weeks of twice-daily oral administration of R-Cu [32]. Eradication of cfChPs from TME was accompanied by marked downregulation of 23 biomarkers representing 10 hallmarks of cancer, including 5 immune checkpoints, defined by Hanahan and Weinberg [33] with p values ranging between >0.063 and >0.000. This study suggested that cfChPs from dying cancer cells are global instigators of cancer hallmarks in surviving cancer cells and raised the hypothesis that prolonged treatment with R-Cu may lead to the reversal of the malignant phenotype of cancer [32].\nConclusion\nOncological treatments can cause a range of adverse effects associated with morbidity and mortality independent of the underlying cancer. Advances in our knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chemotoxicity are essential to facilitate the development of effective treatments that improve the outcomes and quality of life of patients with cancer. Collectively, the laboratory, animal, and clinical studies described in this article corroborate the hypothesis implicating cfChPs in \u201cbystander effect\u201d chemotoxicity, as well as the role of R-Cu as a potent cfChPs-deactivating agent. Larger clinical studies with greater statistical power may further clarify the reduction in the incidence of various toxicities associated with the use of R-Cu and facilitate our understanding of additional pathophysiological mechanisms. In addition, a greater focus on studying the cellular response to cfChPs may reveal novel mechanisms of toxicity associated with oncological treatments and further our understanding of the management of the adverse effects of chemotherapy.\nData availability\nAll data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and the cited studies.\nReferences\nFerlay J, Colombet M, Soerjomataram I, Parkin DM, Pi\u00f1eros M, Znaor A, et al.

    "Document2": "Heart disease and stroke could affect at least 60% of adults in U.S. by 2050\nBy American Heart Association News\nAt least 6 in 10 adults in an older, more diverse U.S. population could be affected by cardiovascular disease within the next 30 years, according to two new science reports.\nThe projected rise in heart disease and stroke \u2013 along with several key risk factors, including high blood pressure and obesity \u2013 is likely to triple related costs to $1.8 trillion by 2050, according to two American Heart Association presidential advisories published Tuesday in the AHA journal Circulation. One report looks at the projected increase in cardiovascular disease rates in the decades ahead, while the other projects their total related costs.\n\"The landscape of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. is seeing the arrival of a near-perfect storm,\" Dr. Dhruv S. Kazi, vice chair of the advisory writing group, said in a news release. Kazi is head of health economics and associate director of the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology and director of the cardiac critical care unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\"The last decade has seen a surge of cardiovascular risk factors such as uncontrolled high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity, each of which raises the risks of developing heart disease and stroke,\" he said. \"It is not surprising that an enormous increase in cardiovascular risk factors and diseases will produce a substantial economic burden.\"\nCardiovascular disease refers to conditions such as coronary heart disease, including heart attacks; heart failure, which is when the heart doesn't pump as well as it should; heart arrhythmias, including a type of irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation; vascular disease, which affects the veins and arteries; congenital heart defects; stroke; and high blood pressure.\nBecause high blood pressure, also known as hypertension, contributes to nearly all types of heart disease and stroke, researchers made separate predictions for this condition. According to their projections, from 2020 to 2050, high blood pressure is expected to rise from 51.2% to 61% of the U.S. population.\nExcluding people with high blood pressure, researchers project 15% of the population will have developed cardiovascular disease by 2050, up from 11.3% in 2020. This includes a doubling of stroke rates.\nObesity rates are expected to climb from 43.1% to 60.6% of the population, with adults ages 20 to 64 expected to see the highest growth because of unhealthy diets.\nThe diabetes rate is expected to rise from 16.3% to 26.8% of the population.\nRisk factors are rising even among children and young adults.\nBy 2050, obesity is expected to affect a third of all children, up from 20% in 2020. The highest increases are expected among children 2 to 5 years old and 12 to 19. Contributing factors, such as insufficient physical activity and a poor diet, are expected to remain as high as 60% of all children over the next three decades.\nKazi said disease rates are climbing at a time of pivotal demographic shifts.\n\"The last of the Baby Boomers will hit 65 in 2030, so about 1 in 5 people in the U.S. will be over 65, outnumbering children for the first time in U.S. history,\" he said. \"Since cardiovascular risk increases with age, the aging population increases the total burden of cardiovascular disease in the country.\"\nResearchers anticipate the Hispanic, Asian and multiracial populations in the U.S. will more than double in the coming decades.\n\"By 2060, more than two-thirds of children will belong to underserved, disenfranchised populations, which traditionally have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and risk factors,\" Kazi said.\nAccording to the projections, the biggest rise in the total number of people with cardiovascular disease will be among Hispanic adults, with Asian adults also seeing a large increase. Black adults are projected to have the highest rates of high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity, as well as the highest rates of inadequate sleep and poor diets. Asian adults are projected to have the highest rates of inadequate physical activity, with rates also high among Asian and Hispanic children.\nHispanic children are projected to have the highest obesity rates, along with the greatest projected growth in obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. Black children are expected to have the highest overall rates of high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\"We found larger increases in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and risk factors, and in the number of people with these conditions, among people from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds,\" Dr. Karen E. Joynt Maddox, chair of the writing committee, said in the release. She is an associate professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. While some of the increase is due to U.S. demographic shifts, much of the inequity in cardiovascular disease and risk factors \"remains attributed to systemic racism, as well as socioeconomic factors and access to care,\" she said.\nThe researchers did find some positive trends. Overall, the percentage of people who don't get enough physical activity is expected to drop, from 33.5% to 24.2% of the population. And smoking rates are expected to drop by nearly half, from 15.8% to 8.4% of the population.\nThe writing committee noted that aggressive approaches to reducing cardiovascular risk factors could alter some of these predictions. Any reductions in disease could help lower costs, Kazi said.\n\"We can bend the cost curve on cardiovascular disease, but this will require strategic investments in cardiovascular prevention and treatment,\" he said. \"It will take all of us working together to make this happen.\"\nAmerican Heart Association News Stories\nCopyright is owned or held by the American Heart Association, Inc., and all rights are reserved.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Most patients with cancer receive chemotherapy, which is associated with potentially life-threatening side effects due to systemic DNA damage and inflammation in healthy cells. Recent research suggests that chemotoxicity is a secondary effect caused by cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) released from drug-induced cell death. These cfChPs can enter healthy cells, causing DNA breaks and activating inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. Deactivating cfChPs with agents like resveratrol and copper (R\u2013Cu) can minimize chemotoxicity. Laboratory and preclinical studies, as well as two phase II clinical trials, support this approach. In laboratory studies, cfChPs released from dying cells caused DNA damage and inflammation in bystander cells, which was mitigated by cfChPs-deactivating agents. Preclinical studies in mice showed that cfChPs-deactivating agents reduced inflammatory cytokines and markers of DNA damage and apoptosis in multiple organs. Clinical trials with R-Cu showed reduced incidence of severe oral mucositis and other toxicities in patients undergoing chemotherapy. The combination of resveratrol and copper generates oxygen radicals that degrade cfChPs, potentially reducing chemotoxicity and improving patient outcomes. Larger clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings and further understand the mechanisms of chemotoxicity.",

Depression is more than just a few days of moderate sadness. It's a severe clinical illness that is remarkably common and affects your overall mental health and state of mind. It may cause you to feel worn out, depressed, nervous, or terrified. It can alter the way you think, eat, and sleep. Some people may commit suicide due to depression. Antidepressants may be suggested by a medical professional for anxiety or sleeplessness in cases of chronic pain.\u00a0\r\nHealthcare professionals occasionally suggest antidepressants for various conditions. Antidepressants come in a variety of forms. Everyone operates in an unforeseen way. Doctors advise starting with the more modern antidepressants since they have fewer negative effects than the older ones. Different antidepressants may be more effective at alleviating different symptoms of depression. The way that antidepressant symptoms vary from person to person and from one medicine to the next.\nMarket Dynamics of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nKey Drivers\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nThe growing awareness of psychological health concerns and the initiatives to lessen the stigma associated with seeking treatment are major factors propelling the market for antidepressant medications. Public knowledge of psychological health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, has grown as a result of developing awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. The number of individuals who identify the signs of mental health disorders and seek professional treatment will rise, which will raise the need for antidepressant drugs. Educating the public about mental health illnesses, accessible treatments, and the need to get assistance is the aim of educational efforts and programs. Media campaigns that feature true tales, celebrity endorsements, and accurate portrayals of psychological health issues contribute to public awareness.\u00a0\nAs society's perceptions of mental health shift, there is a growing understanding of the prevalence and consequences of mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. This changing view has led more people to seek care for mental health difficulties, increasing the demand for effective therapy. Moreover, the reduced stigma has encouraged pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new, more potent antidepressants. To satisfy the needs of numerous patients, the industry has expanded to provide a greater range of treatment options.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, the data updated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in January 2022 shows depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the US, and an estimated 46.9% of adolescents with a major depressive episode and significant impairment received treatment in the previous year.\r\n(Source:https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness\u00a0)\nRestraints\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nPatients may be reluctant to begin or continue antidepressant medication due to worries about potential side effects and their general well-being. Reduced market development and poorer solution rates may result from patient resistance and non-compliance. Regulations and warning labels have the potential to negatively affect consumers' perceptions and reduce their belief in the safety of antidepressant drugs, which can hinder the growth of the market. Unfavorable events and health issues may lead to legal actions and lawsuits against medication companies. Legal disputes may be detrimental to a business's profits, the reputation of an antidepressant, and consumer trust.\nHow Did COVID-19 Impact the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nAntidepressant market growth has been positively influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic because of an increase in product sales related to the disaster. Furthermore, the market expansion has been helped by important tactics used by biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses, such as maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of their goods. Due to several causes, including financial and emotional strain, stress, worry, and dread, the pandemic has increased stress levels in the general population, which has increased the prevalence of depression. This has resulted in a greater proportion of patients receiving therapy, together with the expansion of telehealth and increased public knowledge of available treatment options.\nOpportunities\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nBy improving patient outcomes overall, increasing treatment adherence, and providing more advanced access to psychological wellness care, telemedicine, and digital mental health solutions create opportunities for the antidepressant medication industry. When more people have access to mental health services, more will be able to receive evaluations and prescriptions for antidepressants. Telemedicine platforms provide remote meetings between psychiatrists and other medical experts as well as patients. Prescriptions for antidepressants may now be filled remotely, which is more convenient for patients and may lead to a rise in prescription rates.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, In February 2021, Ginger, a company providing on-demand mental healthcare announced a partnership agreement with Capsule, a digital pharmacy. This partnership was aimed at providing Ginger members with mental health medications including anti-depressants at their homes.\u00a0\r\n(Source:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224005209/en/Ginger-Partners-with-Capsule-to-Seamlessly-Prescribe-and-Deliver-Mental-Health-Medications\u00a0)\nWe have various report editions of Antidepressant Drugs Market, hence please contact our sales team and author directly to obtain/purchase a desired Edition eg, Global Edition, Regional Edition, Country Specific Report Edition, Company Profiles, Forecast Edition, etc. Request for your Free Sample PDF/Online Access.\nCompetitive Landscape: Antidepressant Drugs Market\nMajor market participants who are essential in determining consumer preferences and market dynamics have a major impact on the antidepressant drugs market.

The Canadian healthcare system places a high priority on mental health, and a sizable portion of its budget is allocated to services and initiatives in this area.

The rising demand for antidepressant drugs affects market prices as well. Patients may find antidepressants to be more affordable because many of them are available in generic form.\u00a0\nWhich Region is Expanding at the Fastest CAGR?\nAsia-Pacific is expected to witness the fastest growth in the antidepressant drugs market during the forecast period. Changes in the financial system, societal norms, and lifestyle might increase the likelihood of mental health issues like depression, which in turn drives up the need for antidepressant drugs. The aging population raises the possibility of mental health issues like depression. This shift in the population might support the growth of the antidepressant industry. The market will grow if government initiatives are implemented to provide access to basic treatment for all mental health conditions. Additionally, the market is growing due to growing sales of CNS stimulants, an increase in the number of persons experiencing stress, and growing awareness about the illness state and necessary treatment needs.\r\n\u00a0\nThe current report Scope analyzes Antidepressant Drugs Market on 5 major region Split (In case you wish to acquire a specific region edition (more granular data) or any country Edition data then please write us on info@cognitivemarketresearch.com\n\nNorth America (United States, Canada, Mexico)\nEurope (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium)\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Rest of APAC)\nSouth America (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Rest of South America)\nMiddle East and Africa (Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Nigeria, UAE, Egypt, South Africa, GCC Countries, Rest of MEA)\n\n\n\nAntidepressant Drugs Market Share (%) by Region (2019-2031)\n\n\nThe above graph is for illustrative purposes only.

However, due to rising rates of mental illness, more public awareness of depression, rising healthcare costs, and an increase in clinical trials, North America is predicted to see the greatest CAGR of xx% between 2024 and 2031. Spending on mental health and healthcare are strongly related in Canada. The Canadian healthcare system places a high priority on mental health, and a sizable portion of its budget is allocated to services and initiatives in this area. This covers the cost of prescription drugs for mental health disorders as well as the cost of mental health treatments rendered in community-based settings, hospitals, and outpatient clinics. The rising demand for antidepressant drugs affects market prices as well. Patients may find antidepressants to be more affordable because many of them are available in generic form.\u00a0\nWhich Region is Expanding at the Fastest CAGR?\nAsia-Pacific is expected to witness the fastest growth in the antidepressant drugs market during the forecast period. Changes in the financial system, societal norms, and lifestyle might increase the likelihood of mental health issues like depression, which in turn drives up the need for antidepressant drugs. The aging population raises the possibility of mental health issues like depression. This shift in the population might support the growth of the antidepressant industry. The market will grow if government initiatives are implemented to provide access to basic treatment for all mental health conditions. Additionally, the market is growing due to growing sales of CNS stimulants, an increase in the number of persons experiencing stress, and growing awareness about the illness state and necessary treatment needs.\r\n\u00a0\nThe current report Scope analyzes Antidepressant Drugs Market on 5 major region Split (In case you wish to acquire a specific region edition (more granular data) or any country Edition data then please write us on info@cognitivemarketresearch.com\n\nNorth America (United States, Canada, Mexico)\nEurope (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium)\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Rest of APAC)\nSouth America (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Rest of South America)\nMiddle East and Africa (Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Nigeria, UAE, Egypt, South Africa, GCC Countries, Rest of MEA)\n\n\nThe above graph is for illustrative purposes only.

    "Document2": "New COVID vaccines are here. What to know about latest shots in wake of nation\u2019s biggest summer surge\nOn the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers.\nBack in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early.\nManufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use.\nIn considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants.\n\u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d\nWho can get a new COVID vaccine?\nThe CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children:\nAdults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults.\nPeople with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses.\nI recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine?\nYes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months.\nHowever, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area.\nI just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one?\nFor people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician.\nIf you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated.\nAre the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same?\nBoth use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them.\nComirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nSpikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nAll new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.\nWhat\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine?\nWhile the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift.\n\u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d\nTaking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2.\nI got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine?\nYes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter.\nIn the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d\nHopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity.\n\u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19.\n\u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d\nCan you get COVID from the vaccine?\nNo. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d\nBecause younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body.\nBen-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d\nCan I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time?\nYes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d\nCan I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated?\nYes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death.\nDoes insurance cover the new COVID vaccine?\nThe vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program.\nThe 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients.\n\u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d\nWhere can I get the new COVID vaccine?\nVisit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829.\nDo I still need a COVID vaccination card?\nIf you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones.\nThe CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination. You may request a paper or digital copy of your vaccine history from your state\u2019s Immunization Information System if you wish.\nFor more on COVID-19 and vaccines:\nSubscribe to Well Adjusted, our newsletter full of simple strategies to work smarter and live better, from the Fortune Well team.

    "Summarized_Document2": "On the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers. Back in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early. Manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use. In considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants. \u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d Who can get a new COVID vaccine? The CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

The Report Offers the Value (in USD) and Volume (in Units) for the Above Segments.\n\n\n\nInsulin Market Size\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\n\nSingle User License\n\nTeam License\n\nCorporate License\n\n\nInsulin Market Analysis\n\nThe Human Insulin Drugs Market size is estimated at USD 27.96 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 33.81 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 3.87% during the forecast period (2024-2029).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the Human Insulin Drugs Market. Type-1 diabetes patients are impacted more during Covid-19. People with diabetes are having a weak immune system so, with COVID-19, the immune system gets weaker very fast. People with diabetes will have more chances to get into serious complications rather than normal people.\nDiabetes is associated with many health complications. People with diabetes have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized compared to those without diabetes, and thus, they incur more healthcare expenses compared to non-diabetic people. Patients with Type 2 diabetes require many corrections throughout the day for maintaining nominal blood glucose levels, such as the administration of additional insulin or ingestion of additional carbohydrates. Furthermore, patients attempting to control their blood glucose levels, so as to prevent the long-term complications associated with fluctuations in blood glucose levels, are at greater risk for overcorrection and the resultant hypoglycemia.\nTherefore, owing to the aforementioned factors the studied market is anticipated to witness growth over the analysis period.\n\nInsulin Market Trends\n\n\nGrowing Diabetes Prevalence Driving the Market\n\nAll type-1 diabetes patients and a limited number of type-2 diabetes patients require daily insulin injections as part of their treatment. As per the ADA, around 67.3% of the cost of diabetes care in the United States is covered by government insurance (including Medicare, Medicaid, and the military). The rest is paid for by private insurance (30.7%) or by the uninsured (2%). In Canada, the total diabetic population in the country increased by approximately 33% between 2016 and 2022, and about 8% of the diabetic population has type-1 diabetes. Many developing countries in North America, including the Caribbean countries, are undergoing an epidemiologic transition and experiencing rapid increases in the prevalence of diabetes. As of 2022, the prevalence rates for diabetes ranged from 12% to 19% of the population in several countries in the region.\nThere was a glaring research gap in the absence of data for adult populations because only 1.52 million of the 8.75 million people with type-1 diabetes worldwide in 2022 were under the age of 20. If type-1 diabetes is not correctly diagnosed and promptly treated, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can quickly result in death. Type-1 diabetes and the use of insulin were reported by 1.4 million individuals aged 20 or older, or 5.2% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, while 10.9% of all US adults with diagnosed diabetes, or 2.9 million adults aged 20 or older, started taking insulin within a year after diagnosis. Regular insulin is used along with a healthy diet and exercise routine to help diabetics with high blood sugar levels. Keeping blood sugar levels under control helps prevent kidney damage, blindness, nerve damage, limb loss, and issues with sexual function. Your chance of having a heart attack or stroke may be reduced if your diabetes is well controlled. This synthetic insulin is identical to human insulin. It takes the place of the insulin that your body typically produces. This insulin has a short half-life. It functions by making it easier for blood sugar (glucose) to enter cells where your body can use it as fuel. Usually, this drug is used with either a medium-acting or long-acting insulin product. The use of this medication with other oral diabetic medications is also possible.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated.\n\nNorth America Dominates the Market\n\nNorth America dominates the global human insulin market, especially the United States, owing to the high prevalence of diabetes in the region because of a sedentary lifestyle. The cost factor is the major concern in the United States, where almost 50% of the insulin revenues for the manufacturers are from the country itself. The United States accounts for the highest sales of long-acting insulin, Lantus, across the world. Most diabetic drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. Lantus is the most commonly administered basal insulin across the world, accounting for a dominant share in the US market. The traditional North American human insulin drug market is expected to grow during the forecast period due to its affordability to patients. Humulin holds the highest market share, followed by Novolin. There are no generic competitors for the traditional North American human insulin drug market in the United States. The United States accounts for the highest sales of Humalog across the world, with over 56% of the market share. The majority of diabetes drug manufacturing companies consider the country a critical market for improving overall global sales. In the United States, Humalog is available in different varieties under names like Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog U-100, Humalog U-200, and Humalog Mix 50/50 for the treatment of diabetes.\nTherefore, owing to the aforesaid factors, the growth of the studied market is anticipated in the human insulin drug market.\n\nInsulin Industry Overview\n\nThe global human insulin market is highly consolidated, with three major manufacturers holding a global market presence and the remaining manufacturers confined to other local or region-specific manufacturers. Mergers and acquisitions that happened between the players in the recent past have helped the companies strengthen their market presence. Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim have an alliance to develop and commercialize Basaglar (Insulin Glargine). Biocon is developing Insulin Tregopil, an oral prandial insulin tablet, for the treatment of type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Fast-acting oral insulin could improve postprandial glucose control with reduced side effects and greater adherence, thus holding the promise to transform T1D management. Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc., a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral drug delivery systems, is working to bring the first oral insulin product to market, thus providing a more convenient, effective, and safer method for delivering insulin therapy.\n\nInsulin Market Leaders\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S\nEli Lilly and Company\nSanofi S.A.\nBiocon Limited\nPfizer Inc.\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\n\nInsulin Market News\n\nInsulin Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDS\n\nInsulin Industry Segmentation\n\nThe hormone class of drugs includes human insulin. In place of the insulin that the body ordinarily produces, human insulin is used. It functions by assisting in the movement of blood sugar into different bodily tissues, where it is used as an energy source. It also prevents the liver from generating additional sugar.

Depression is more than just a few days of moderate sadness. It's a severe clinical illness that is remarkably common and affects your overall mental health and state of mind. It may cause you to feel worn out, depressed, nervous, or terrified. It can alter the way you think, eat, and sleep. Some people may commit suicide due to depression. Antidepressants may be suggested by a medical professional for anxiety or sleeplessness in cases of chronic pain.\u00a0\r\nHealthcare professionals occasionally suggest antidepressants for various conditions. Antidepressants come in a variety of forms. Everyone operates in an unforeseen way. Doctors advise starting with the more modern antidepressants since they have fewer negative effects than the older ones. Different antidepressants may be more effective at alleviating different symptoms of depression. The way that antidepressant symptoms vary from person to person and from one medicine to the next.\nMarket Dynamics of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nKey Drivers\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nThe growing awareness of psychological health concerns and the initiatives to lessen the stigma associated with seeking treatment are major factors propelling the market for antidepressant medications. Public knowledge of psychological health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, has grown as a result of developing awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. The number of individuals who identify the signs of mental health disorders and seek professional treatment will rise, which will raise the need for antidepressant drugs. Educating the public about mental health illnesses, accessible treatments, and the need to get assistance is the aim of educational efforts and programs. Media campaigns that feature true tales, celebrity endorsements, and accurate portrayals of psychological health issues contribute to public awareness.\u00a0\nAs society's perceptions of mental health shift, there is a growing understanding of the prevalence and consequences of mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. This changing view has led more people to seek care for mental health difficulties, increasing the demand for effective therapy. Moreover, the reduced stigma has encouraged pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new, more potent antidepressants. To satisfy the needs of numerous patients, the industry has expanded to provide a greater range of treatment options.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, the data updated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in January 2022 shows depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the US, and an estimated 46.9% of adolescents with a major depressive episode and significant impairment received treatment in the previous year.\r\n(Source:https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness\u00a0)\nRestraints\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nPatients may be reluctant to begin or continue antidepressant medication due to worries about potential side effects and their general well-being. Reduced market development and poorer solution rates may result from patient resistance and non-compliance. Regulations and warning labels have the potential to negatively affect consumers' perceptions and reduce their belief in the safety of antidepressant drugs, which can hinder the growth of the market. Unfavorable events and health issues may lead to legal actions and lawsuits against medication companies. Legal disputes may be detrimental to a business's profits, the reputation of an antidepressant, and consumer trust.\nHow Did COVID-19 Impact the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nAntidepressant market growth has been positively influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic because of an increase in product sales related to the disaster. Furthermore, the market expansion has been helped by important tactics used by biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses, such as maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of their goods. Due to several causes, including financial and emotional strain, stress, worry, and dread, the pandemic has increased stress levels in the general population, which has increased the prevalence of depression. This has resulted in a greater proportion of patients receiving therapy, together with the expansion of telehealth and increased public knowledge of available treatment options.\nOpportunities\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nBy improving patient outcomes overall, increasing treatment adherence, and providing more advanced access to psychological wellness care, telemedicine, and digital mental health solutions create opportunities for the antidepressant medication industry. When more people have access to mental health services, more will be able to receive evaluations and prescriptions for antidepressants. Telemedicine platforms provide remote meetings between psychiatrists and other medical experts as well as patients. Prescriptions for antidepressants may now be filled remotely, which is more convenient for patients and may lead to a rise in prescription rates.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, In February 2021, Ginger, a company providing on-demand mental healthcare announced a partnership agreement with Capsule, a digital pharmacy. This partnership was aimed at providing Ginger members with mental health medications including anti-depressants at their homes.\u00a0\r\n(Source:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224005209/en/Ginger-Partners-with-Capsule-to-Seamlessly-Prescribe-and-Deliver-Mental-Health-Medications\u00a0)\nWe have various report editions of Antidepressant Drugs Market, hence please contact our sales team and author directly to obtain/purchase a desired Edition eg, Global Edition, Regional Edition, Country Specific Report Edition, Company Profiles, Forecast Edition, etc. Request for your Free Sample PDF/Online Access.\nCompetitive Landscape: Antidepressant Drugs Market\nMajor market participants who are essential in determining consumer preferences and market dynamics have a major impact on the antidepressant drugs market.

However, due to rising rates of mental illness, more public awareness of depression, rising healthcare costs, and an increase in clinical trials, North America is predicted to see the greatest CAGR of xx% between 2024 and 2031. Spending on mental health and healthcare are strongly related in Canada. The Canadian healthcare system places a high priority on mental health, and a sizable portion of its budget is allocated to services and initiatives in this area. This covers the cost of prescription drugs for mental health disorders as well as the cost of mental health treatments rendered in community-based settings, hospitals, and outpatient clinics.

The market will grow if government initiatives are implemented to provide access to basic treatment for all mental health conditions.

    "Document2": "New COVID vaccines are here. What to know about latest shots in wake of nation\u2019s biggest summer surge\nOn the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers.\nBack in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early.\nManufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use.\nIn considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants.\n\u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d\nWho can get a new COVID vaccine?\nThe CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children:\nAdults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults.\nPeople with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses.\nI recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine?\nYes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months.\nHowever, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area.\nI just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one?\nFor people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician.\nIf you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated.\nAre the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same?\nBoth use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them.\nComirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nSpikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nAll new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.\nWhat\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine?\nWhile the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift.\n\u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d\nTaking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2.\nI got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine?\nYes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter.\nIn the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d\nHopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity.\n\u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19.\n\u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d\nCan you get COVID from the vaccine?\nNo. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d\nBecause younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body.\nBen-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d\nCan I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time?\nYes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d\nCan I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated?\nYes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death.\nDoes insurance cover the new COVID vaccine?\nThe vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program.\nThe 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients.\n\u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d\nWhere can I get the new COVID vaccine?\nVisit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829.\nDo I still need a COVID vaccination card?\nIf you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones.\nThe CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination.

    "Summarized_Document2": "On the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers. Back in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early. Manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use. In considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants. \u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d Who can get a new COVID vaccine? The CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children: Adults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults. People with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses. I recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine? Yes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months. However, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area. I just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one? For people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician. If you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated. Are the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same? Both use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them. Comirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA. Spikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA. All new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. What\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine? While the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift. \u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d Taking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2. I got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine? Yes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter. In the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d Hopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity. \u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19. \u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d Can you get COVID from the vaccine? No. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains. \u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d Because younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body. Ben-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d Can I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time? Yes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d Can I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated? Yes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Does insurance cover the new COVID vaccine? The vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program. The 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients. \u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d Where can I get the new COVID vaccine? Visit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829. Do I still need a COVID vaccination card? If you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones. The CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination. You may request a paper or digital copy of your vaccine history from your state\u2019s Immunization Information System if you wish.

    "Document1": "Los Angeles Lakers 2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nWill LeBron and his son, Bronny, hoist the Larry O'Brien together?\nMassimo Marchiano\nWe've got the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25 to see how the game thinks the team will perform this year. Last year, the Lakers finished the season 47-35 and made the playoffs. However, they lost to the Denver Nuggets in the First Round in 5 games. Will they fare better this year? Let's find out.\nLos Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will go 48-34 in the regular season and make the playoffs. But before we show what happened in the postseason, let's see how they got there in the first place.\nOctober \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers' 2024-2025 season started on a rough note, with the team going 1-4 in October. The team performed well offensively, but the same couldn't be said about the defense. They managed to start the year 1-0 after beating Minnesota 111-103. But they instantly faced a fierce five-game losing streak that set them back.\nLeBron James and Anthony Davis led the team in minutes per game, points scored, and several other statistical categories. But as we can see, there'll need to be improvements from other players if they want to turn things around.\nNovember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe month of November was a bit better for the Lakers, but the team still struggled. As we mentioned, they suffered a loss to start the month, extending their losing streak to five. However, the Lakers went on to win seven of their next nine games to go 8-7. However, as soon as things were looking better, they lost four straight to end the month and end up being below .500 again.\nNothing was too different here than in October. While the team played well offensively, they allowed over 1,500 points (110 points per game) in a 14 game stretch. However, the season is still early and anything is possible.\nDecember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nBecause some games are still to be decided, a couple of games here do not reflect the actual 2024-2025 season. Instead of waiting for December to see the confirmed matchups, we just rocked with what NBA 2K25's MyNBA mode provided for us. The rest of the season does accurately reflect the real 2024-2024 schedule.\nAnyways, it was a better month for the Lakers who finally evened out their record. Additionally, the defense managed to buckle down and play better, though they still need to improve. However, thanks LeBron averaging over 27 points per game, the Lakers' offense is in good hands. We also got to see Bronny James play for the first time, though he only played for two minutes against the Kings near the end of the month.\nJanuary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers started off their New Year with a win to go above .500 for the first time this season. They went on to win two more games to extend their win streak to four games. Furthermore, this month saw the team win some important matchups, including a 1 point victory over the Celtics.\nIn fact, L.A. had three close games this month in which the winning team only won by 1 point. Another thing worth noting is the defensive improvement. This month they only allowed over 100 points in half of their matchups this month. It's not perfect, but the Lakers seemed to find a better rhythm in terms of defense.\nOverall, Davis and LeBron continue to be the superstars of this team. Fortunately, they've both been healthy and didn't get injured\u2026 yet.\nFebruary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers continued another win streak in the month of February, winning their first three games before losing to the Pacers. Overall, they went 16-11 in the first two months of the year as they continue to build their record. At this point into the season, it seems unlikely the Lakers will be able to catch up to the Mavericks, who are the #1 team in the league.\nThe Lakers still find themselves fighting for a playoff spot, but the slight improvements every month seem to help the team inch towards a postseason spot.\nA quick shoutout to Austin Reaves here, who put up 29 points in the team's 127-94 win over the Denver Nuggets. With Nikola Jokic missing the game due to injury the Lakers took advantage and got a little revenge on Denver.\nMarch \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nMarch started off ugly as the team suffered a 77-97 loss to the Clippers. However, they went on to win 12 games this month as they essentially clinched a playoff spot. They also faced a lot of adversity, as D'Angelo Russell missed time due to injury. Although not the star player of the team, it hurts to lose good depth guys.\nNevertheless, L.A. performed fine without him, as LeBron James continued to ball out. We also got to see Bronny play, but just barely. He made one basket and earned an assist in the team's 113-102 win over the Grizzlies. But the most important thing here for L.A. to do is win a few more games to reserve a playoff spot.\nApril \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nDespite an ugly three-game losing streak in the middle of the month, the Lakers did just enough to earn the fifth seed in the NBA Playoffs. They started the month with back-to-back wins, and ended the month with another two to edge out Sacramento for the 5 seed.\nLike last year, it wasn't the most prettiest season, but L.A. found a way to make the postseason and avoid the Play-In. However, they now host a San Antonio Spurs team which shocked the league this season. Can they defeat San Antonio, whose now led by second-year superstar Victor Wembanyama?\nNBA Playoffs First Round \u2013 vs. #4 San Antonio Spurs\nThe Lakers got off to a hot start in this series, but ultimately let the Spurs take a quick 2-1 lead in the series. However, LeBron buckled down, averaging a whopping 33 points per game to help the Lakers overcome the Spurs. However, there was one major problem the Lakers now had to deal with.\nAnthony Davis suffered an ankle injury which would cause him to miss at least the next round. Can the Lakers hold off the #1 Mavericks without him?\nNBA Playoffs QuarterFinals \u2013 vs. #1 Dallas Mavericks\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will lose to the Dallas Mavericks in the Quarterfinals of the NBA Playoffs. Due to Anthony Davis' injury, the team suffered a serious collapse, failing to score and rebound throughout the contest. LeBron also faltered, now averaging just 23 points per game in the series.\nAlthough they made it farther than they did last season, the Lakers were still hoping to reach the NBA Finals again. As long as LeBron is still playing at an All-Star level, the team can definitely make a big push this year. Unfortunately, NBA 2K25 doesn't think they'll go that far.\nOverall, that wraps up the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25. We hope you enjoyed reading. We also look forward to another exciting NBA Season, which begins in October.\nFor more gaming and NBA news, visit ClutchPoints.

Where does everyone else land?\nShare this story\n\nShare\nAll sharing options for:\nReport card: grading each member of the Celtics through 55 games\n\nThe All-Star break is an ideal time to take a step back, catch our collective breath and analyze what we\u2019ve seen to this point.\nIt\u2019s also a fun time to dish out some grades. The Celtics are 43-12, so naturally most of these grades are going to be favorable, but the minuses and pluses are sure to spark some debate. Here we go:\nJayson Tatum: A\nTatum is the best player on the best team. Forget the Most Valuable Player talk for a second. He probably won\u2019t win it, and that\u2019s OK; he\u2019s the head of the snake and has reached a new level as a leader this year with Marcus Smart gone. \nHe\u2019s taking even more accountability defensively, minimizing poor shooting nights and complaining about calls a little less (I said a little). If he\u2019s not careful, he might become the face of the league in June.\nJayson Tatum is confident he's the NBA's top player   pic.twitter.com/UBL5SyCaZu\nJaylen Brown: B+\nBrown has had some moments of brilliance and some head-scratchers along the way. He\u2019s capable of dropping 30-plus any night, but he\u2019s also capable of dropping 10 or fewer. The most important thing for him (now that he appears to possess a left hand) is consistency. \nHe\u2019s shooting a career-high 49.2 percent from the floor, but just 34.2 percent from 3-point range. His defense and passing have improved, but he\u2019s averaging his fewest rebounds (5.5) since 2018-19. When Brown is elite, the Celtics are essentially unbeatable.\nKristaps Porzingis: A\nIt\u2019s hard to remember a situation since Kevin Garnett where a player adjusted so seamlessly and immediately felt like the missing piece. Porzingis has been insanely efficient on post-ups, excelling in an area the Celtics dramatically needed him to.\nHe\u2019s also been a pleasant surprise defensively and is more capable of guarding shorter players than I realized. The only small critiques are that he should shoot a smidgen more 2s and a smidgen fewer 3s. I mean, the guy\u2019s 7\u20192 with the touch of an angel.\nMost points per possession on post-ups this season (min. 75 FGA): 1.42 - Kristaps Porzingis 1.17 - Joel Embiid 1.17 - Myles Turner 1.16 - Jayson Tatum1.15 - Jonas Valanciunas 1.14 - Nikola Jokic 1.12 - Anthony Davis 1.11 - Karl-Anthony TownsKP in a league of his own   pic.twitter.com/I58XI7K17E\nJrue Holiday: A-\nHoliday\u2019s 3-point shooting has exceeded expectations (career-high 44 percent), and he sets the tone defensively every night. He always finds clever ways to contribute, whether he takes 20 shots or five. \nHis maturity, consistency and poise set him apart. One area I\u2019d like to see a bit more is playmaking. He\u2019s averaging 4.8 assists \u2013 his lowest since 2011-12 \u2013 and I believe that number could be around 6. Obviously part of it is circumstantial, but I think putting the ball in his hands at the top of the key a bit more could be beneficial.\nDerrick White: A\nDon\u2019t worry, White gets an A. I\u2019m sure my colleagues would blast me if he didn\u2019t, but he truthfully does deserve one. He has career-highs in points (15.6), rebounds (3.9), blocks (1.2) and steals (1) and consistently plays his best in the fourth quarter.\nWhite is the consummate professional and has become a fan favorite. He can do no wrong in Celtics\u2019 fans eyes. Folks appreciate guys who hustle, make winning plays and exude charisma, and White embodies all those characteristics and then some.\nAl Horford: B+\nHorford is always ready, whether the Celtics need him to play 30 minutes or 15. At the moment, he gets a B+, but this grade is less relevant than some others. It\u2019s all about preserving him for the playoffs, and he\u2019s fully capable of upping his grade to an A then \u2013 particularly if Boston plays Philly.\nOne area Horford has really excelled this year is rebounding (6.7 a night). His 3-point shooting has naturally dipped a bit from last year, but it\u2019s still at 40.9 percent. I still want to see him attack the basket a bit more, but it\u2019s possible that\u2019s just not in his wheelhouse at this point.\nPayton Pritchard: A-\nThe Celtics were right to pay Pritchard, and overall, he\u2019s thrived in his expanded role. He\u2019s 15th in the league in assist-to-turnover ratio (4.81) and has excelled as a ball-handler and facilitator. \nHe\u2019s always locked in, whether he plays in the fourth quarter of a close game or garbage time (don\u2019t tell him it\u2019s garbage time). Pritchard fits in perfectly with this core.\nPayton Pritchard stats at the All-Star break:20.7 MPG8.1 PPG3.2 RPG2.8 APG44% FG38% 3FGHow are we feeling about the season so far @paytonpritch3?? pic.twitter.com/BC3DTIIaJo\nSam Hauser: A-\nHauser\u2019s shooting 41.2 percent from 3, which is great, but it\u2019s really his spacing that sets him apart. When Tatum, Brown and Porzingis have the ball, you really can\u2019t double. If you do, they\u2019ll find Hauser open for 3. He\u2019s solid with the bench unit, but he\u2019s even more lethal with the starters.\nHe\u2019s also been a pleasant surprise defensively, and his mid-range jumper\u2019s improved as well. It\u2019s easy to forget this is just his second season logging regular minutes.\nLuke Kornet: B+\nKornet\u2019s averages of 4.9 points and 4 rebounds aren\u2019t earth-shattering, but they\u2019re pretty solid when you consider that he plays 14.9 minutes per game. He\u2019s sneaky good in the pick-and-roll, an absolute goofball and excellent for team vibes. Rim protection is an area where he could improve.\nOshae Brissett: B\nIf Brissett can get that 3-point percentage up just a tick, from 29.3 to 33.3 or so, that would go a long way. He\u2019s long, athletic and has a good motor, but his shot makes him a bit of a liability at the moment.\nNeemias Queta: B+\nQueta is the definition of a \u201cfun project.\u201d You can sometimes see the lightbulb go off mid-game, which is pretty cool, and he\u2019s only getting better. The next steps are post moves, lateral quickness and defending without fouling.\n\n    More From\n    \n        CelticsBlog\n\n\n\n\n\n          Most Read\n        \n\n\n\nSign up for the\n          \n            newsletter\n          \n          Sign up for the Celtics Blog Daily Roundup newsletter!\n        \nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\nOops.

(NASDAQ: PEP) today reported results for the second quarter 2024. \u201cDuring the second quarter, our business delivered net revenue growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth, remaining agile despite facing difficult net revenue growth comparisons versus the prior year, subdued category performance within North America convenient foods and the impacts associated with certain product recalls at Quaker Foods North America,\u201d said Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta.\nLaguarta continued, \u201cFor the balance of the year, we will further elevate and accelerate our productivity initiatives and make disciplined commercial investments in the marketplace to stimulate growth. These investments will focus on surgically providing optimal value propositions within certain portions of our North America convenient foods portfolio, amplifying our advertising and marketing initiatives and leveraging our go-to-market distribution capabilities to enable more precise marketplace execution. As a result, we now expect to deliver approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4 percent) and have a high degree of confidence in delivering at least 8 percent core constant currency EPS growth for full-year 2024.\u201d 1 Please refer to the Glossary for the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, including \u201cOrganic revenue growth,\u201d \u201cCore\u201d and \u201cConstant currency,\u201d and to \u201cGuidance and Outlook\u201d for additional information regarding PepsiCo\u2019s full-year 2024 financial guidance.

For 2024, the Company now expects: \u2022 Approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4%). In addition, the Company continues to expect: \u2022 At least 8 percent increase in core constant currency EPS; \u2022 A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; \u2022 Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8.2 billion, comprised of dividends of $7.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion; and \u2022 An approximate 1-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to impact reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates.\nThis assumption and the guidance above imply 2024 core EPS of at least $8.15, a 7 percent increase compared to 2023 core EPS of $7.62.\nPrepared Management Remarks and Live Question and Answer Webcast At approximately 6:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will post prepared management remarks (in pdf format) of its second quarter 2024 results and business update, including its outlook for 2024, at www.pepsico.com/investors. At 8:15 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will host a live question and answer session with investors and financial analysts.

5 Non-GAAP Measures In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): organic revenue growth, core results and core constant currency results. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); product recall-related impact; pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures included herein. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nGlossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies: Acquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nConcentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d in \u201cItem 2 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Q2 2024 Form 10-Q and in \u201cItem 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items: Mark-to-market net impact Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Restructuring and impairment charges Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures, primarily consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nImpairment and other charges/credits We recognized impairment charges taken as a result of our quantitative assessments of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and related to our investment in Tropicana Brands Group. We also recognized adjustments to charges recorded in prior years from changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.\nA - 6 Product recall-related impact We recognized property, plant and equipment and inventory write-offs, product returns, employee severance costs, customer and consumer-related costs and other costs in our Quaker Foods North America division associated with a previously announced voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals.\nPension and retiree medical-related impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs.\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. 2024 guidance Our 2024 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2024 core effective tax rate guidance and our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges and other items noted above. Our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2024 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2024 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2024 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2024 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2024 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2024 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.\nA - 7 PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information Organic Revenue Growth Rates 12 and 24 Weeks Ended June 15, 2024 (unaudited) 12 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 Impact of Impact of Net Revenue Year over Year % Change Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a) Organic volume(b) Effective net pricing Frito-Lay North America (0.5) % \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 % (4) 3 Quaker Foods North America (c) (18) % \u2014 \u2014 (18) % (17) (1) PepsiCo Beverages North America 1 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (3.5) 5 Latin America 7 % (5) \u2014 2 % (5) 6 Europe 2.5 % 5 \u2014 7 % 2 5 Africa, Middle East and South Asia 2 % 11 (1) 12 % 1 11 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region (2) % 3 \u2014 1 % \u2014 1.5 Total 1 % 1 \u2014 2 % (3) 5 24 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 Impact of Impact of Net Revenue Year over Year % Change Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a) Organic volume(b) Effective net pricing Frito-Lay North America 0.5 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (3) 3 Quaker Foods North America (c) (21) % \u2014 \u2014 (21) % (20) (1) PepsiCo Beverages North America 1 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (4) 5 Latin America 10 % (6) \u2014 4 % (3) 7 Europe 3 % 5.5 \u2014 8 % 2 6 Africa, Middle East and South Asia 2 % 8 \u2014 10 % 2 7 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region 2 % 4 \u2014 6 % 5 0.5 Total 1.5 % 1 \u2014 2 % (2) 5 (a) A financial measure that is not in accordance with GAAP.

The report offers market size and values in (USD Billion) during the forecasted years for the above segments.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Size\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Analysis\nThe Beauty and Personal Care Products Market size is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, registering a CAGR of 4.64% over the next five years.\nMillennials are increasingly using beauty products like color cosmetics as part of their regular grooming routines. For instance, as of 2021, according to financial comparison service provider Mozo, the average Australian woman spent approximately USD 3,600 on beauty and personal care products yearly. The simple accessibility of these cosmetic items through various sales channels, with the increased emphasis on personal grooming, aided the sales value. Furthermore, the emergence of cosmetics with natural, non-toxic, and organic components helped the market expansion. With the rising awareness about the harmful effects of chemicals and synthetic products, consumers are inclined toward organic personal care products. It is expected to drive market growth during the study period. Besides this, companies are capitalizing on consumers' demands to expand their share and consumer base in the market. For instance, in February 2022, a United Kingdom-based fashion company, Boohoo, launched a vegan beauty range of more than 50 products. Boohoo Beauty's cosmetics line includes highlighter sticks, blush, setting sprays, cosmetic palettes, and others available exclusively.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Trends\nInclination toward Natural/Organic Formulations\nThe growing concerns regarding the side effects of chemicals in personal care products, leading to skin irritation, allergies, and dullness, fueled the demand for natural and organic skincare products. Prolonged use of synthetic cosmetics may cause various health issues, such as irritation, hormonal imbalance, and toxicity. However, cosmetic products made of organic ingredients, such as plant extracts and natural oils, do not harm the skin. Natural skincare and cosmetic products that are free from chemicals and transparent about the content are preferred by consumers. This factor resulted in a shift in preference from synthetic skincare products to organic products among consumers.\nTo capitalize on this growing interest, manufacturers are revamping and expanding their product offerings by introducing a wide range of organic skincare products. These products contain plant-based, clean-label ingredients with organic, vegan, natural, chemical-free, and cruelty-free claims. For instance, in April 2022, Shiseido revealed a new skincare brand, Ul\u00e9. It sources pesticide-free botanicals from local vertical farms. The dissemination of knowledge related to the benefits of natural skincare led consumers to seek eco-friendly, sustainable, natural skincare products that offer greater product ingredient transparency. Furthermore, the growing trend of organic concepts through online stores for bio-cosmetic products is expected to boost the growth of the natural and organic beauty and personal care products market.\nAsia-Pacific Emerges as the Fastest-growing Region\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, countries like China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam present considerable growth opportunities for the market players. It is primarily due to the growing demand for color cosmetics, as many people unleash the potential of cosmetics in their daily makeup routine. Hence, the significant players are intensely embarking on product innovation and mergers and acquisitions as their prime strategy to consolidate the market. For instance, in April 2023, Personal care and beauty brand The Body Shop launched its 'activist' product range in the Indian market. The new line strengthens the brand's sustainable commitment in the country with a selection of skin products and color cosmetics.\nFurthermore, growing awareness regarding cosmetics products, such as facial makeup, hairstyling, and coloring products, with increasing demand for clean labels and natural ingredients, is expected to drive the market shortly. The need for multifunctional products is driving innovation as price-conscious consumers are opting for products that provide hydration and skin protection. The trend of social media influencers showcasing their beauty regimens increased over the past few years. Thus, both local and international beauty companies are turning to influencers to increase their brand awareness and reach potential consumers. For instance, in September 2022, as part of its global expansion, the Honest Company, a clean lifestyle company founded by Jessica Alba, launched its business in China. To capitalize on the relatively small but rising demand for sanitary beauty products, the digitally native company created a flagship store on Tmall Global, Alibaba Group's cross-border e-commerce platform. Chinese shoppers can purchase skin care and color cosmetics from Honest's brand, Honest Beauty. Shoppers on Tmall Global can select from various stock-keeping units, including its Extreme Length Mascara + Lash Primer and Hydrogel Cream, a face cream enriched with hyaluronic acid.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Industry Overview\nThe global beauty and personal care market is highly competitive, with a strong presence of regional and international players in the market like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. Demand is mainly driven by more adaptation toward skincare routines and consumer awareness about brand know-how.

    "Summarized_Document2": "The Beauty and Personal Care Products Market is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 4.64%. The market is driven by millennials' increasing use of beauty products and the accessibility of these products through various sales channels.

Companies are expanding their product offerings to include organic skincare products. For instance, Boohoo launched a vegan beauty range in February 2022. The Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam, is the fastest-growing market due to the increasing demand for color cosmetics and the influence of social media. Major players in the market include Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. The market is segmented by product type, distribution channel, category, and geography.

Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased four percent. Higher pricing contributed four points of growth to organic sales. Shipment volumes and mix were unchanged versus the prior year.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $6.02, an increase of two percent versus prior year as the increase in net sales was partially offset by a non-cash charge to impair the carrying value of the Gillette trade name intangible asset and higher non-core restructuring charges. Core net earnings per share increased by 12% to $6.59. Currency-neutral core EPS increased 16% versus the prior year EPS.\nThe Company generated operating cash flow of $19.8 billion and net earnings of $15.0 billion for the fiscal year. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 105%, which is calculated as operating cash flow less capital spending and certain other items, as a percentage of net earnings excluding the Gillette impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria.\nThe Company returned over $14 billion of value to shareholders in fiscal 2024 via $9.3 billion in dividend payments and $5 billion of share repurchases. With the dividend increase in April 2024, this marks the 68th consecutive year that P&G has increased its dividend and the 134th consecutive year that P&G has paid a dividend since its incorporation in 1890.\nApril-June Quarter Results\nThe Company reported fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter net sales of $20.5 billion, unchanged versus the prior year. A one percent increase in all-in volume and one percent increase due to higher pricing were offset by two percentage points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased two percent. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased two percent. Mix had a neutral impact on sales growth for the quarter.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS increased six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nOperating cash flow was $5.8 billion and net earnings were $3.1 billion, with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 148%.\nApril-June Quarter Business Discussion\nApril - June 2024\nVolume\nForeign\nExchange\nPrice\nMix\nOther (2)\nNet Sales\nOrganic\nVolume\nOrganic\nSales\nNet Sales Drivers (1)\nBeauty\n(1)%\n(3)%\n3%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n(1)%\n1%\n3%\nGrooming\n2%\n(7)%\n5%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n2%\n7%\nHealth Care\n2%\n(1)%\n2%\n1%\n(1)%\n3%\n1%\n4%\nFabric & Home Care\n2%\n(1)%\n(1)%\n1%\n(1)%\n\u2014%\n3%\n2%\nBaby, Feminine & Family Care\n(1)%\n(2)%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n(3)%\n(1)%\n(1)%\nTotal P&G\n1%\n(2)%\n1%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n2%\n2%\n(1) \u00a0Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.\n(2) \u00a0Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.\nBeauty segment organic sales increased three percent versus year ago. Skin and Personal Care organic sales were unchanged as growth from increased pricing was offset by lower sales of the super-premium SK-II brand and in Greater China. Hair Care organic sales increased high single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix due to growth of premium products.\nGrooming segment organic sales increased seven percent versus year ago driven by increased pricing primarily in Latin America and volume growth from innovation.\nHealth Care segment organic sales increased four percent versus year ago. Oral Care organic sales increased high single digits due to premium product mix and volume growth in North America and Europe. Personal Health Care organic sales were unchanged as growth due to pricing and volume increases were offset by unfavorable mix due to lower incidence of cough and cold.\nFabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased two percent versus year ago. Fabric Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth driven by North America and Europe was offset by lower pricing due to increased promotional spending. Home Care organic sales increased high single digits due to volume growth from innovation and favorable product mix.\nBaby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales declined one percent versus year ago. Baby Care organic sales decreased mid-single digits due to volume declines from share losses, partially offset by premium product mix. Feminine Care organic sales increased low single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix. Family Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth was offset by unfavorable product mix.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27 for the quarter, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased by two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS were up six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nReported gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points versus year ago. Core gross margin for the quarter increased 140 basis points versus year ago, 180 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 210 basis points of productivity savings, 100 basis points of lower commodity costs and 40 basis points of pricing benefit. These were partially offset by 130 basis points of unfavorable product mix and 40 basis points of product/package reinvestments and other impacts.\nReported selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 260 basis points versus the prior year. Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 240 basis points versus year ago and 240 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 300 basis points of marketing reinvestments and 30 basis points of wage inflation and overhead investments, partially offset by 40 basis points of productivity savings and 50 basis points of net sales growth leverage and other impacts.\nReported operating margin for the quarter decreased 140 basis points due primarily to higher restructuring charges. Excluding 40 basis points of non-core restructuring charges, core operating margin for the quarter decreased 100 basis points versus the prior year, 60 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. Core operating margin included gross productivity savings of 250 basis points.\nLimited Market Portfolio Restructuring\nIn December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company said that it expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to 1.5 billion after tax, including foreign currency translation losses to be recognized upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has substantially liquidated its operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, and recorded a non-cash charge of $216 million after tax for accumulated currency translation losses. On July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 million for accumulated currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\nIntangible Asset Impairment\nIn the October-December 2023 quarter of the fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge, on intangible assets acquired as part of the Company\u2019s acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nThe impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value.\nFiscal Year 2025 Guidance\nP&G expects fiscal year 2025 all-in sales growth in the range of two to four percent versus the prior year. Foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately one percentage point to all-in sales growth. The Company expects organic sales growth in the range of three to five percent.\nP&G expects fiscal 2025 diluted net earnings per share growth in the range of 10% to 12% versus fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS of $6.02. P&G expects its fiscal 2025 core net earnings per share growth in the range of five to seven percent versus fiscal 2024 core EPS of $6.59. This outlook equates to a range of $6.91 to $7.05 per share, with a mid-point estimate of $6.98, or an increase of 6%.\nThe Company said its outlook estimates a net headwind of around $500 million after-tax from unfavorable commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. The net headwind equates to a $0.20 per share for fiscal 2025, or a three percentage drag on core EPS growth.\nIn addition, the prior fiscal year included benefits from minor brand divestitures and tax impacts that are unlikely to repeat to the same extent in the new fiscal year. Combined, these are an additional $0.10 to $0.12 headwind to core EPS.\nThe Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures without unreasonable efforts given the unpredictability of the timing and amounts of discrete items, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or impairments, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nP&G said it expects a core effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% in fiscal 2025.\nCapital spending is estimated to be in the range of four to five percent of fiscal 2025 net sales.\nP&G said it expects adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% and expects to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 to $7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures because the Company cannot predict the timing and amounts of discrete items such as acquisition and divestitures, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nThe Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:\nIncremental restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges.\nIntangible asset impairment: In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($1.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying value of the Gillette intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nWe do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.\nOrganic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nCore EPS and Currency-neutral EPS: Core net earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as useful supplemental measures of Company performance over time.\nCore gross margin and Currency-neutral Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's Core gross margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nCore selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as a percentage of sales and Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales: Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's Core selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provides a supplemental perspective to the Company's operating efficiency over time.\nCore operating margin and Currency-neutral Core operating margin: Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's Core operating margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nAdjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.\nAdjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G\u2019s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nTHE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nAmounts in millions except per share amounts\nAs Reported\n(GAAP)\n\u00a0\nIncremental\nRestructuring\n\u00a0\nIntangible\nImpairment\n\u00a0\nCore\n(Non-GAAP)\n\u00a0\nAs Reported\n(GAAP) (1)\nCost of products sold\n$\n10,348\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n(45\n)\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,303\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,613\n\u00a0\nGross profit\n\u00a0\n10,183\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n10,229\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n9,940\n\u00a0\nGross margin\n\u00a0\n49.6\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n49.8\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n48.4\n%\nCurrency impact to Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n50.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n\u00a0\n6,299\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(28\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n6,271\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5,778\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n30.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(0.2\n)%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n28.1\n%\nCurrency impact to Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperating income\n\u00a0\n3,884\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n73\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,958\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4,162\n\u00a0\nOperating margin\n\u00a0\n18.9\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.3\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n20.3\n%\nCurrency impact to Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOther non-operating income, net\n\u00a0\n98\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n248\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n346\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n195\n\u00a0\nIncome taxes\n\u00a0\n726\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(6\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n720\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n841\n\u00a0\nNet earnings attributable to P&G\n\u00a0\n3,137\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n327\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,464\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,384\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted net earnings per common share (2)\n$\n1.27\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n0.13\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.40\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.37\n\u00a0\nCurrency impact to Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n0.05\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n1.45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n\u00a0\n2,472.2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2,477.5\n\u00a0\nCommon shares outstanding -

The report offers market size and values in (USD Billion) during the forecasted years for the above segments.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Size\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Analysis\nThe Beauty and Personal Care Products Market size is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, registering a CAGR of 4.64% over the next five years.\nMillennials are increasingly using beauty products like color cosmetics as part of their regular grooming routines. For instance, as of 2021, according to financial comparison service provider Mozo, the average Australian woman spent approximately USD 3,600 on beauty and personal care products yearly. The simple accessibility of these cosmetic items through various sales channels, with the increased emphasis on personal grooming, aided the sales value. Furthermore, the emergence of cosmetics with natural, non-toxic, and organic components helped the market expansion. With the rising awareness about the harmful effects of chemicals and synthetic products, consumers are inclined toward organic personal care products. It is expected to drive market growth during the study period. Besides this, companies are capitalizing on consumers' demands to expand their share and consumer base in the market. For instance, in February 2022, a United Kingdom-based fashion company, Boohoo, launched a vegan beauty range of more than 50 products. Boohoo Beauty's cosmetics line includes highlighter sticks, blush, setting sprays, cosmetic palettes, and others available exclusively.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Trends\nInclination toward Natural/Organic Formulations\nThe growing concerns regarding the side effects of chemicals in personal care products, leading to skin irritation, allergies, and dullness, fueled the demand for natural and organic skincare products. Prolonged use of synthetic cosmetics may cause various health issues, such as irritation, hormonal imbalance, and toxicity. However, cosmetic products made of organic ingredients, such as plant extracts and natural oils, do not harm the skin. Natural skincare and cosmetic products that are free from chemicals and transparent about the content are preferred by consumers. This factor resulted in a shift in preference from synthetic skincare products to organic products among consumers.\nTo capitalize on this growing interest, manufacturers are revamping and expanding their product offerings by introducing a wide range of organic skincare products. These products contain plant-based, clean-label ingredients with organic, vegan, natural, chemical-free, and cruelty-free claims. For instance, in April 2022, Shiseido revealed a new skincare brand, Ul\u00e9. It sources pesticide-free botanicals from local vertical farms. The dissemination of knowledge related to the benefits of natural skincare led consumers to seek eco-friendly, sustainable, natural skincare products that offer greater product ingredient transparency. Furthermore, the growing trend of organic concepts through online stores for bio-cosmetic products is expected to boost the growth of the natural and organic beauty and personal care products market.\nAsia-Pacific Emerges as the Fastest-growing Region\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, countries like China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam present considerable growth opportunities for the market players. It is primarily due to the growing demand for color cosmetics, as many people unleash the potential of cosmetics in their daily makeup routine. Hence, the significant players are intensely embarking on product innovation and mergers and acquisitions as their prime strategy to consolidate the market. For instance, in April 2023, Personal care and beauty brand The Body Shop launched its 'activist' product range in the Indian market. The new line strengthens the brand's sustainable commitment in the country with a selection of skin products and color cosmetics.\nFurthermore, growing awareness regarding cosmetics products, such as facial makeup, hairstyling, and coloring products, with increasing demand for clean labels and natural ingredients, is expected to drive the market shortly. The need for multifunctional products is driving innovation as price-conscious consumers are opting for products that provide hydration and skin protection. The trend of social media influencers showcasing their beauty regimens increased over the past few years. Thus, both local and international beauty companies are turning to influencers to increase their brand awareness and reach potential consumers. For instance, in September 2022, as part of its global expansion, the Honest Company, a clean lifestyle company founded by Jessica Alba, launched its business in China. To capitalize on the relatively small but rising demand for sanitary beauty products, the digitally native company created a flagship store on Tmall Global, Alibaba Group's cross-border e-commerce platform. Chinese shoppers can purchase skin care and color cosmetics from Honest's brand, Honest Beauty. Shoppers on Tmall Global can select from various stock-keeping units, including its Extreme Length Mascara + Lash Primer and Hydrogel Cream, a face cream enriched with hyaluronic acid.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Industry Overview\nThe global beauty and personal care market is highly competitive, with a strong presence of regional and international players in the market like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. Demand is mainly driven by more adaptation toward skincare routines and consumer awareness about brand know-how. The companies improved the quality and product innovation regarding ingredients, functionality, and packaging. The key players are embarking on mergers, acquisitions, and product innovation as their key strategies to achieve consolidation and optimize offerings. Moreover, these players merge with local players to gain dominance in the local market.\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Leaders\nThe Procter & Gamble Company\nL'Oreal SA\nUnilever PLC\nColgate-Palmolive Company\nThe Estee Lauder Companies\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market News\nBeauty and Personal Care Products Market Report - Table of Contents\n1.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Procter & Gamble (P&G) reported its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results, highlighting strong performance despite economic and geopolitical challenges. For fiscal year 2024, net sales increased by 2% to $84.0 billion, and organic sales grew by 4%. Diluted EPS rose by 2% to $6.02, while core EPS increased by 12% to $6.59. The company generated $19.8 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $14 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, net sales remained flat at $20.5 billion, with organic sales up by 2%. Diluted EPS for the quarter decreased by 7% to $1.27, while core EPS increased by 2% to $1.40.

P&G also plans to pay around $10 billion in dividends and repurchase $6-7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025.

Despite these, P&G remains committed to its integrated strategy focused on product superiority, productivity, and constructive disruption.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The Beauty and Personal Care Products Market is estimated at USD 525.61 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 659.32 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 4.64%. The market is driven by millennials' increasing use of beauty products and the accessibility of these products through various sales channels. The demand for natural, non-toxic, and organic components is rising due to awareness of the harmful effects of chemicals. Companies are expanding their product offerings to include organic skincare products. For instance, Boohoo launched a vegan beauty range in February 2022. The Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Vietnam, is the fastest-growing market due to the increasing demand for color cosmetics and the influence of social media. Major players in the market include Procter & Gamble, Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al SA, Colgate-Palmolive Company, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Inc. The market is segmented by product type, distribution channel, category, and geography. Seasonal trends between May 2024 and September 2024 affected Unilever's demand forecasts for personal care products, with increased demand during summer months due to higher usage of skincare and grooming products. The market is highly competitive, with companies focusing on mergers, acquisitions, and product innovation to maintain their market position.",

For 2024, the Company now expects: \u2022 Approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth (previously at least 4%). In addition, the Company continues to expect: \u2022 At least 8 percent increase in core constant currency EPS; \u2022 A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; \u2022 Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8.2 billion, comprised of dividends of $7.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion; and \u2022 An approximate 1-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to impact reported net revenue and core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates.\nThis assumption and the guidance above imply 2024 core EPS of at least $8.15, a 7 percent increase compared to 2023 core EPS of $7.62.\nPrepared Management Remarks and Live Question and Answer Webcast At approximately 6:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on July 11, 2024, the Company will post prepared management remarks (in pdf format) of its second quarter 2024 results and business update, including its outlook for 2024, at www.pepsico.com/investors.

5 Non-GAAP Measures In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): organic revenue growth, core results and core constant currency results. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); product recall-related impact; pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures included herein. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nGlossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies: Acquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nConcentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d in \u201cItem 2 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Q2 2024 Form 10-Q and in \u201cItem 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items: Mark-to-market net impact Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Restructuring and impairment charges Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures, primarily consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nImpairment and other charges/credits We recognized impairment charges taken as a result of our quantitative assessments of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and related to our investment in Tropicana Brands Group. We also recognized adjustments to charges recorded in prior years from changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.\nA - 6 Product recall-related impact We recognized property, plant and equipment and inventory write-offs, product returns, employee severance costs, customer and consumer-related costs and other costs in our Quaker Foods North America division associated with a previously announced voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals.\nPension and retiree medical-related impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs.\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. 2024 guidance Our 2024 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2024 core effective tax rate guidance and our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges and other items noted above. Our 2024 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2024 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2024 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2024 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2024 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2024 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2024 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2024 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.\nA - 7 PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information Organic Revenue Growth Rates 12 and 24 Weeks Ended June 15, 2024 (unaudited) 12 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 Impact of Impact of Net Revenue Year over Year % Change Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a) Organic volume(b) Effective net pricing Frito-Lay North America (0.5) % \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 % (4) 3 Quaker Foods North America (c) (18) % \u2014 \u2014 (18) % (17) (1) PepsiCo Beverages North America 1 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (3.5) 5 Latin America 7 % (5) \u2014 2 % (5) 6 Europe 2.5 % 5 \u2014 7 % 2 5 Africa, Middle East and South Asia 2 % 11 (1) 12 % 1 11 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region (2) % 3 \u2014 1 % \u2014 1.5 Total 1 % 1 \u2014 2 % (3) 5 24 Weeks Ended 6/15/2024 Impact of Impact of Net Revenue Year over Year % Change Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures Organic % Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a) Organic volume(b) Effective net pricing Frito-Lay North America 0.5 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (3) 3 Quaker Foods North America (c) (21) % \u2014 \u2014 (21) % (20) (1) PepsiCo Beverages North America 1 % \u2014 \u2014 1 % (4) 5 Latin America 10 % (6) \u2014 4 % (3) 7 Europe 3 % 5.5 \u2014 8 % 2 6 Africa, Middle East and South Asia 2 % 8 \u2014 10 % 2 7 Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region 2 % 4 \u2014 6 % 5 0.5 Total 1.5 % 1 \u2014 2 % (2) 5 (a) A financial measure that is not in accordance with GAAP.

In certain instances, the impact of organic volume on net revenue performance differs from the unit volume disclosed in the Summary Second-Quarter 2024 Performance table and Summary Year-to-Date Performance on pages 2 and 3, respectively, due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE. We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE.

The quarter included one additional day, which resulted in a 1-point tailwind to revenue growth. For the full year, net revenues grew 6% to $45.8 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 12%, driven by 10% growth in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales. For both the quarter and the full year, organic revenue (non-GAAP) performance was strong across all operating segments.\n- Operating margin:\u00a0For the quarter, operating margin was 21.0% versus 20.5% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 23.1% versus 22.7% in the prior year. For the full year, operating margin was 24.7% versus 25.4% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 29.1% versus 28.7% in the prior year. Operating margin performance included items impacting comparability and currency headwinds. For both the quarter and full year, comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion was primarily driven by strong topline growth, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, as well as currency headwinds.\n- Earnings per share:\u00a0For the quarter, EPS declined 2% to $0.46, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 10% to $0.49. EPS performance included the impact of a 14-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 13-point currency headwind. For the full year, EPS grew 13% to $2.47, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 8% to $2.69. EPS performance included the impact of an 8-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 7-point currency headwind.\n- Market share:\u00a0For both the quarter and the full year, the company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages.\n- Cash flow:\u00a0Cash flow from operations was $11.6 billion for the full year, an increase of $581 million versus the prior year, driven by strong business performance and working capital initiatives, partially offset by a transition tax payment and currency headwinds. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $9.7 billion for the full year, an increase of $213 million versus the prior year.\n-\u00a0Connecting with consumers through experiences and digital engagement: The company continues to leverage its marketing transformation to build globally scaled marketing platforms tailored to local consumers. In the fourth quarter, \u201cThe World Needs More Santas\u201d campaign was executed in over 80 markets, continuing the company\u2019s rich history of celebrating the holidays. The company leveraged the success of its first AI-based platform, \u201cCreate Real Magic\u201d, by inviting consumers to create sharable, digital greeting cards featuring iconic brand assets such as cherished depictions of Santa Claus and the Coca\u2011Cola polar bear. Local initiatives generated buzz and excitement, such as the Coca\u2011Cola Caravan Truck Tour, which travelled throughout nearly 60 countries around the world making over a thousand stops and meeting over 16 million consumers to share in the magic. In total, the holiday campaign experiences garnered approximately 9 billion impressions on social media. By combining the company\u2019s global scale with local relevancy, the holiday activation contributed to Trademark Coca\u2011Cola\u00ae volume and value share gains as well as unit case volume and transactions growth for both the quarter and for the full year.\n-\u00a0Building a system that is increasingly positioned for sustainable long-term growth: Since the start of 2023, the company completed the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations in Vietnam to a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Limited (Swire), completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Pakistan to Coca\u2011Cola \u0130\u00e7ecek and completed the sale of its stake in the bottler in Indonesia to Coca\u2011Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP). More recently, the company completed the refranchising of a portion of its company-owned bottling operations in India to existing franchise bottlers and received regulatory approval to sell its bottling operations in the Philippines to CCEP and Aboitiz Equity Ventures, which is expected to close towards the end of February 2024. Additionally, the company recently completed the sale of its stake in the largest bottler in Thailand to Swire and existing shareholders of the bottler. Our franchise business model has enabled the company to develop a strong global footprint with a local touch in markets around the world. The company continuously works to optimize the system with trusted, capable and motivated bottling partners allowing it to focus on building and growing consumer-loved brands.\n-\u00a0Delivering on our purpose by empowering people to drive growth: The company\u2019s strategy is centered around people, starting with the employees who are critical in bringing this strategy to life. In November, the company was ranked #1 on the 2023 American Opportunity Index, which assessed how effectively companies enable employees to progress in their careers in the United States. Around the world, the company provides thousands of jobs and is invested in the long-term success of its employees. Over the year, the company enhanced its learning and related technologies, making strides towards nurturing a more innovative and informed workforce. The company\u2019s 2023 Culture & Engagement Survey results underscore the strong levels of employee pride and growth opportunities with a strong number of respondents saying they are proud to work at The Coca\u2011Cola Company and see good opportunities to learn and grow in their roles.\nOperating Review \u2013 Three Months Ended December 31, 2023\nOperating Review \u2013 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nIn addition to the data in the preceding tables, operating results included the following:\n- Unit case volume grew 2% for the quarter.

Growth was led by Germany and Nigeria.\n- Price/mix grew 24% for the quarter, approximately one-third of which was driven by the continued impact of pricing in hyperinflationary markets and the remaining driven primarily by pricing actions across operating units. For the quarter, concentrate sales were 1 point ahead of unit case volume, primarily due to one additional day.\n- Operating income grew 30% for the quarter, which included a 22-point currency headwind.

Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 24% for the quarter, primarily driven by strong organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments.\n- For the year, the company gained value share in total NARTD beverages, led by share gains in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.\n- Unit case volume declined 1% for the quarter, as growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages and Trademark Coca\u2011Cola was more than offset by a decline in water, sports, coffee and tea.\n- Price/mix grew 8% for the quarter, primarily driven by pricing actions already in the marketplace, timing related adjustments and favorable category mix. For the quarter, concentrate sales were 2 points behind unit case volume, primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments, partially offset by one additional day.\n- Operating income grew 19% for the quarter, which included items impacting comparability.

Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 66% for the quarter, driven by organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth, partially offset by higher operating costs.\n-\u00a0Reinvesting in the business: The company continued to invest in its various lines of business and spent\n$1.9 billion on capital expenditures in 2023, an increase of 25% versus the prior year.\n-\u00a0Continuing to grow the dividend: The company paid dividends totaling $8.0 billion during 2023. The company has increased its dividend in each of the last 61 years.\n-\u00a0M&A initiatives: In 2023, the company did not make any significant acquisitions. The company continues to evaluate inorganic growth opportunities through brands and capabilities. In 2023, with respect to divestitures, the company made progress towards refranchising company-owned bottling operations.\n-\u00a0Share repurchases: In 2023, the company issued $0.5 billion of shares in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees and purchased $2.3 billion of shares. Consequently, net share repurchases (non-GAAP) were $1.7 billion. The company\u2019s remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately $6 billion.\nOutlook\nThe 2024 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full-year 2024 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2024 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported effective tax rate, full-year 2024 projected comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS, or full-year 2024 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2024 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and exact impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes throughout 2024; the exact timing and exact amount of items impacting comparability throughout 2024; and the exact impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates throughout 2024. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s full-year 2024 reported financial results.\nThe company expects to deliver organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth of 6% to 7%.\nFor comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 2% to 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company\u2019s underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 19.2%. This does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the company were not to prevail.\nGiven the above considerations, the company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 8% to 10% and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 4% to 5%, versus $2.69 in 2023.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 4% to 5% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe company expects to generate free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.2 billion through cash flow from operations of approximately $11.4 billion, less capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion. This does not include any potential payments related to ongoing tax litigation with the IRS.\nComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an approximate 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include an approximate 8% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\nThe first quarter has one less day compared to the first quarter of 2023.\nNotes\n- All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise noted.\n- All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales in the fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted, and are computed on a reported basis for the full year. \u201cUnit case\u201d means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. \u201cUnit case volume\u201d means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.\n- \u201cConcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, \u201cconcentrate sales\u201d represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the fourth quarter, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment for the full year, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.\n- \u201cPrice/mix\u201d represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.\n- First quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to first quarter 2022, and fourth quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one additional day as compared to fourth quarter 2022. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.\nConference Call\nThe company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2023 operating results today, Feb. 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company\u2019s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section.

The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.\n1Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.\n\"Our first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations on both the top and bottom line, tracking the trajectory we outlined for this year and setting up a return to growth in the second quarter,\" said Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation. \"Our topline performance improved for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in our digital business led by strength in our same-day fulfillment services. Consumers continue to respond to the newness and value that we offer across our shopping experience, and we're pleased with early results from the relaunch of Target Circle. Looking ahead, our team will deliver for our guests through lower prices, a seasonally relevant assortment, ease and convenience, as we keep investing in our strategy and efficiency initiatives to get back to growth and deliver on our longer-term financial goals.\"\nGuidance\nFor the second quarter, the Company expects a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.95 to $2.35.\nFor the full year, the Company continues to expect a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60.\nOperating Results\nComparable sales declined 3.7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a comparable store sales decline of 4.8 percent partially offset by a comparable digital sales increase of 1.4 percent. Total revenue of $24.5 billion was 3.1 percent lower than last year, reflecting a total sales decline of 3.2 percent and a 3.9 percent increase in other revenue. First quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was 2.4 percent lower than last year, driven by lower sales volume.\nFirst\u00a0quarter operating income margin rate was 5.3 percent in 2024, compared with 5.2 percent in 2023. First quarter gross margin rate was 27.7 percent, compared with 26.3 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of merchandising activities, including cost improvements that more than offset higher promotional markdown rates, combined with favorable category mix and lower book to physical inventory adjustments as compared to the prior year.\u00a0 First quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.1 percent in 2024, compared with 19.8 percent in 2023, reflecting the combined impact of lower sales and higher costs, including continued investments in pay and benefits and marketing, partially offset by disciplined cost management.\nInterest Expense and Taxes\nThe Company's first quarter 2024 net interest expense was $106 million, compared with $147 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in interest income reflecting higher cash balances year-over-year.\nFirst\u00a0quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.7 percent, compared with the prior year rate of 21.1 percent, reflecting lower discrete benefits as compared to the prior year.\nCapital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital\nThe Company paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, compared with $497 million last year, reflecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.\nThe Company did not repurchase any stock in the first quarter.\u00a0 As of the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by Target's Board of Directors in August 2021.\nFor the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2024, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.4 percent, compared with 11.4 percent for the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2023. The increase in ROIC reflects higher operating income, partially offset by higher average invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information about the Company's ROIC calculation.\nWebcast Details\nTarget will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call at 7:00 a.m. CT today.

    "Document1": "Amazon sales come up short, profits nearly double\nby Todd Bishop on August 1, 2024 at 1:21 pmAugust 1, 2024 at 5:30 pm\nIn-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant\u2019s hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.\nAmazon\u2019s sales fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates but profits exceeded expectations in the company\u2019s second quarter results, released Thursday afternoon for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nThe tech giant reported a 10% increase in second-quarter revenue, to $147.98 billion, shy of expectations of $148.56 billion. Profits were $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per share, nearly double Amazon\u2019s profits in the same quarter a year ago, and surpassing expectations of $1.03 per share.\nSpeaking with reporters on a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said average selling prices (ASP) are declining amid cautious consumer spending. Unit sales growth was strong, he said, and an increase in shipping speeds is prompting growth in purchasing of everyday essentials. \n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is really around ASP, and lower ASP in products selected by customers,\u201d Olsavsky said. \u201cThey are continuing to be cautious with their spending, trading down to lower ASP products. And even on the higher-ticket items \u2026 there\u2019s certainly a drop-off from probably more of a steady-state, thriving economy.\u201d\nAmazon is reportedly planning to launch a new storefront with lower-priced items and slower shipping, directly from Chinese suppliers, to compete with emerging rivals including Temu and Shein. Olsavsky declined to comment directly on those reports in response to a question on the media call.\nIn addition, Olsavsky said Amazon experienced a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange rates, which was about $300 million higher than the company expected.\nIn the realm of artificial intelligence, Amazon is spending significant sums to expand its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure. Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures and equipment finance leases amounted to $30.5 billion for the first half of the year, and the number is expected to grow in the second half of the year, Olsavsky said.\n\u201cThe majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure, as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads,\u201d he said.\nHighlights from the company\u2019s business segments:\nIn its guidance for the current quarter, which began July 1, Amazon said it expects net sales between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, which translates into a midpoint of $156.25 billion, below the average estimate of $158.24 billion.\nOlsavsky said the current quarter was proving especially challenging to predict, due in part to consumers becoming distracted by news events, elections, and the Olympics, among other factors.\nShares fell 4% in initial after-hours trading. \nGeekWire Newsletters\nSubscribe to GeekWire's free newsletters to catch every headline\nSend Us a Tip\nHave a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

Comparable sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 2.8%, and comparable sales in the U.S. decreased 3.2%.\u00a0\n\nNet earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $3.6 billion, or $3.63 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $3.9 billion, or $3.82 per diluted share, in the same period of fiscal 2023.\u00a0\n\"The team executed at a high level in the quarter, and we continued to grow market share,\" said Ted Decker, chair, president and CEO. \"And while the quarter was impacted by a delayed start to spring and continued softness in certain larger discretionary projects, we feel great about our store readiness, our product assortment in stores and online, and our associate engagement.\u00a0 Our associates are energized and ready to serve our customers as spring breaks across the country. I would like to thank them for their continued hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities.\"\nFiscal 2024 Guidance\nThe company reaffirms its fiscal 2024 guidance, which includes 53 weeks of operating results.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon\u2019s sales fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates but profits exceeded expectations in the company\u2019s second quarter results, released Thursday afternoon for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The tech giant reported a 10% increase in second-quarter revenue, to $147.98 billion, shy of expectations of $148.56 billion. Profits were $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per share, nearly double Amazon\u2019s profits in the same quarter a year ago, and surpassing expectations of $1.03 per share. Speaking with reporters on a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said average selling prices (ASP) are declining amid cautious consumer spending. Unit sales growth was strong, he said, and an increase in shipping speeds is prompting growth in purchasing of everyday essentials. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is really around ASP, and lower ASP in products selected by customers,\u201d Olsavsky said. \u201cThey are continuing to be cautious with their spending, trading down to lower ASP products. And even on the higher-ticket items \u2026 there\u2019s certainly a drop-off from probably more of a steady-state, thriving economy.\u201d Amazon is reportedly planning to launch a new storefront with lower-priced items and slower shipping, directly from Chinese suppliers, to compete with emerging rivals including Temu and Shein. Olsavsky declined to comment directly on those reports in response to a question on the media call. In addition, Olsavsky said Amazon experienced a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange rates, which was about $300 million higher than the company expected. In the realm of artificial intelligence, Amazon is spending significant sums to expand its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure. Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures and equipment finance leases amounted to $30.5 billion for the first half of the year, and the number is expected to grow in the second half of the year, Olsavsky said. \u201cThe majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure, as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads,\u201d he said. Highlights from the company\u2019s business segments: In its guidance for the current quarter, which began July 1, Amazon said it expects net sales between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, which translates into a midpoint of $156.25 billion, below the average estimate of $158.24 billion. Olsavsky said the current quarter was proving especially challenging to predict, due in part to consumers becoming distracted by news events, elections, and the Olympics, among other factors. Shares fell 4% in initial after-hours trading.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer, reported first-quarter fiscal 2024 sales of $36.4 billion, a 2.3% decrease from the same period in fiscal 2023. Comparable sales dropped by 2.8%, with U.S. sales down by 3.2%. Net earnings were $3.6 billion, or $3.63 per diluted share, compared to $3.9 billion, or $3.82 per diluted share, in fiscal 2023. Despite a delayed start to spring and softness in larger discretionary projects, the company maintained market share and reaffirmed its fiscal 2024 guidance, which includes 53 weeks of operating results. The acquisition of SRS Distribution Inc. is not reflected in this guidance as it has not yet closed. The Home Depot operated 2,337 retail stores and employed approximately 465,000 associates as of the end of the first quarter. The company\u2019s stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol HD and is part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 index. Forward-looking statements in the report highlight various risks and uncertainties that could impact future performance. Financial highlights include a gross profit of $12.4 billion, operating income of $5.1 billion, and net earnings of $3.6 billion. The balance sheet shows total assets of $79.2 billion and total liabilities of $77.4 billion. Cash flows from operating activities were $5.5 billion, with net cash used in investing and financing activities amounting to $830 million and $4.1 billion, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period were $4.3 billion.",

The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.\n1Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.\n\"Our first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations on both the top and bottom line, tracking the trajectory we outlined for this year and setting up a return to growth in the second quarter,\" said Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation. \"Our topline performance improved for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in our digital business led by strength in our same-day fulfillment services. Consumers continue to respond to the newness and value that we offer across our shopping experience, and we're pleased with early results from the relaunch of Target Circle. Looking ahead, our team will deliver for our guests through lower prices, a seasonally relevant assortment, ease and convenience, as we keep investing in our strategy and efficiency initiatives to get back to growth and deliver on our longer-term financial goals.\"\nGuidance\nFor the second quarter, the Company expects a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.95 to $2.35.\nFor the full year, the Company continues to expect a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60.\nOperating Results\nComparable sales declined 3.7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a comparable store sales decline of 4.8 percent partially offset by a comparable digital sales increase of 1.4 percent. Total revenue of $24.5 billion was 3.1 percent lower than last year, reflecting a total sales decline of 3.2 percent and a 3.9 percent increase in other revenue. First quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was 2.4 percent lower than last year, driven by lower sales volume.\nFirst\u00a0quarter operating income margin rate was 5.3 percent in 2024, compared with 5.2 percent in 2023. First quarter gross margin rate was 27.7 percent, compared with 26.3 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of merchandising activities, including cost improvements that more than offset higher promotional markdown rates, combined with favorable category mix and lower book to physical inventory adjustments as compared to the prior year.\u00a0 First quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.1 percent in 2024, compared with 19.8 percent in 2023, reflecting the combined impact of lower sales and higher costs, including continued investments in pay and benefits and marketing, partially offset by disciplined cost management.\nInterest Expense and Taxes\nThe Company's first quarter 2024 net interest expense was $106 million, compared with $147 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in interest income reflecting higher cash balances year-over-year.\nFirst\u00a0quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.7 percent, compared with the prior year rate of 21.1 percent, reflecting lower discrete benefits as compared to the prior year.\nCapital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital\nThe Company paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, compared with $497 million last year, reflecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.\nThe Company did not repurchase any stock in the first quarter.\u00a0 As of the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by Target's Board of Directors in August 2021.\nFor the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2024, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.4 percent, compared with 11.4 percent for the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2023. The increase in ROIC reflects higher operating income, partially offset by higher average invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information about the Company's ROIC calculation.\nWebcast Details\nTarget will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call at 7:00 a.m. CT today. Investors and the media are invited to listen to the meeting at Corporate.Target.com/Investors (click on \"Q1 2024 Target Corporation Earnings Conference Call\" under \"Events & Presentations\"). A replay of the webcast will be provided when available.

The tech giant reported a 10% increase in second-quarter revenue, to $147.98 billion, shy of expectations of $148.56 billion. Profits were $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per share, nearly double Amazon\u2019s profits in the same quarter a year ago, and surpassing expectations of $1.03 per share. Speaking with reporters on a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said average selling prices (ASP) are declining amid cautious consumer spending. Unit sales growth was strong, he said, and an increase in shipping speeds is prompting growth in purchasing of everyday essentials. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is really around ASP, and lower ASP in products selected by customers,\u201d Olsavsky said. \u201cThey are continuing to be cautious with their spending, trading down to lower ASP products. And even on the higher-ticket items \u2026 there\u2019s certainly a drop-off from probably more of a steady-state, thriving economy.\u201d Amazon is reportedly planning to launch a new storefront with lower-priced items and slower shipping, directly from Chinese suppliers, to compete with emerging rivals including Temu and Shein. Olsavsky declined to comment directly on those reports in response to a question on the media call. In addition, Olsavsky said Amazon experienced a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange rates, which was about $300 million higher than the company expected. In the realm of artificial intelligence, Amazon is spending significant sums to expand its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure. Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures and equipment finance leases amounted to $30.5 billion for the first half of the year, and the number is expected to grow in the second half of the year, Olsavsky said. \u201cThe majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure, as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads,\u201d he said. Highlights from the company\u2019s business segments: In its guidance for the current quarter, which began July 1, Amazon said it expects net sales between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, which translates into a midpoint of $156.25 billion, below the average estimate of $158.24 billion. Olsavsky said the current quarter was proving especially challenging to predict, due in part to consumers becoming distracted by news events, elections, and the Olympics, among other factors. Shares fell 4% in initial after-hours trading.",

The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.\n1Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.\n\"Our first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations on both the top and bottom line, tracking the trajectory we outlined for this year and setting up a return to growth in the second quarter,\" said Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation. \"Our topline performance improved for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in our digital business led by strength in our same-day fulfillment services. Consumers continue to respond to the newness and value that we offer across our shopping experience, and we're pleased with early results from the relaunch of Target Circle. Looking ahead, our team will deliver for our guests through lower prices, a seasonally relevant assortment, ease and convenience, as we keep investing in our strategy and efficiency initiatives to get back to growth and deliver on our longer-term financial goals.\"\nGuidance\nFor the second quarter, the Company expects a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.95 to $2.35.\nFor the full year, the Company continues to expect a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60.\nOperating Results\nComparable sales declined 3.7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a comparable store sales decline of 4.8 percent partially offset by a comparable digital sales increase of 1.4 percent. Total revenue of $24.5 billion was 3.1 percent lower than last year, reflecting a total sales decline of 3.2 percent and a 3.9 percent increase in other revenue. First quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was 2.4 percent lower than last year, driven by lower sales volume.\nFirst\u00a0quarter operating income margin rate was 5.3 percent in 2024, compared with 5.2 percent in 2023. First quarter gross margin rate was 27.7 percent, compared with 26.3 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of merchandising activities, including cost improvements that more than offset higher promotional markdown rates, combined with favorable category mix and lower book to physical inventory adjustments as compared to the prior year.\u00a0 First quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.1 percent in 2024, compared with 19.8 percent in 2023, reflecting the combined impact of lower sales and higher costs, including continued investments in pay and benefits and marketing, partially offset by disciplined cost management.\nInterest Expense and Taxes\nThe Company's first quarter 2024 net interest expense was $106 million, compared with $147 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in interest income reflecting higher cash balances year-over-year.\nFirst\u00a0quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.7 percent, compared with the prior year rate of 21.1 percent, reflecting lower discrete benefits as compared to the prior year.\nCapital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital\nThe Company paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, compared with $497 million last year, reflecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.\nThe Company did not repurchase any stock in the first quarter.\u00a0 As of the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by Target's Board of Directors in August 2021.\nFor the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2024, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.4 percent, compared with 11.4 percent for the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2023. The increase in ROIC reflects higher operating income, partially offset by higher average invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information about the Company's ROIC calculation.\nWebcast Details\nTarget will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call at 7:00 a.m. CT today. Investors and the media are invited to listen to the meeting at Corporate.Target.com/Investors (click on \"Q1 2024 Target Corporation Earnings Conference Call\" under \"Events & Presentations\").

At the same time, not enough stock causes slow order fulfillment, the potential for missed sales, and lost revenue.\nReorder point (ROP) is a supply chain management technique that businesses can use to guide this delicate balancing act to improve inventory operations, avoid stockouts, and maintain ideal inventory levels.\nWhat is the reorder point?\nThe reorder point is the minimum number of units a company needs to have in stock to fill sales orders or meet production targets. Once inventory dips below the calculated reorder point, replenishment is triggered through a new purchase order.\nRegularly calculating reorder points removes the mystery from inventory cost control and helps your business maintain optimal service levels.\nWhy should your business know your reorder points?\nReorder points help to ensure products and cash flow in the right direction, at the right time. With accurate reorder points for all of your product SKUs, you can meet customer demand in a timely fashion to improve cash flow and avoid the bloated costs of overstock.\nPrimary business benefits of using reorder points include the following:\nCost control\nInventory\u00a0carrying costs\u00a0typically account for 15-30% of total inventory costs. This affects the profit margin on goods sold. By using the most optimal reorder levels, businesses can keep storage and warehousing costs low to protect profits. \nOptimal inventory levels\nBy reordering a predetermined amount of replenishment inventory according to demand forecasts, you can avoid sunk costs from inventory shrinkage and obsolescence.\nSupply chain optimization\n The reorder point calculation takes into account delivery lead time from suppliers. By keeping track of average delivery lead time, you can identify your most reliable and least reliable suppliers and make more informed\u00a0procurement decisions.\nImproved forecasting\nTo accurately calculate reorder points, you\u2019ll need to have strong records on sales volume and trends over a certain time period. As you build this body of data, you can improve forecasting to better meet customer demand.\nNow, let\u2019s see how to find the reorder point.\nHow does the reorder point formula work?\nThe reorder point formula takes into account three factors: average daily sales or usage, average delivery lead time, and safety stock.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nFirst, let\u2019s define all of the components that make up this equation.\nComponents of the reorder equation\nAverage daily sales or usage\n Average daily sales is the average number of units sold or used per day over a defined time period. Three months or 90 days is a good starting increment to use. A retailer would measure the average number of units sold, while a manufacturer would calculate the average number of components used per day. \nLet\u2019s say you sold 40 units of an item in March, 60 in April, and 46 in May.\nOver those three months (or 92 days) that averages out to 1.5 units sold on average per day.\nAverage delivery lead time\n Average delivery lead time is the average amount of time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the time the order was placed. Average delivery lead time changes with fluctuations in seasonal demand, the quantity ordered, and distance from the up-chain supplier. For a reasonable measure, take an average of the past three months of POs for the SKU item you want to set a reorder point for. If your sales cycle is longer or shorter, adjust accordingly. \nSafety stock\nSafety stock\u00a0is the amount of inventory a business holds to mitigate the risk of shortages or stockouts. The safety stock calculation is the difference between the maximum daily sales/usage and lead time, and the average daily usage and lead time. \n(Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time)\n Let\u2019s say a manufacturer used 10 units of a component on their busiest day of production. The longest time it would take the supplier to deliver this component is 15 days. And let\u2019s assume that the average daily use is 1.5 units, and the average lead time is 12 days. \n(10 x 15) \u2013 (1.5 x 12)\n150 \u2013 18 = 132\u00a0\nThe manufacturer should hold 132 safety stock units to avoid bottlenecks in production.\nThe reorder point formula in action\nNow we\u2019ve got all reorder point sub-metrics ready. Let\u2019s continue with the manufacturer example and calculate the reorder point.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nAverage daily usage = 1.5 units\nAverage lead team = 12 days\nSafety stock = 132 units\n(1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150\nTherefore, the manufacturer should reorder this component when stock falls to 150 units. By doing so, the company can prevent stockouts and avoid dipping into safety stock while they wait for new stock to arrive.\nHow to start using the reorder point formula in your business\nIf you have at least one procurement cycle and one sales cycle worth of data, you can start using the reorder point formula to improve your inventory operations.\nBusinesses with a limited number of products can start with excel spreadsheets and format cells to turn red when inventory levels reach the reorder point.\nFor growing\u00a0retailers,\u00a0manufacturers, or\u00a0wholesalers, working with dozens or hundreds of spreadsheets can be time-consuming and error-prone. If your business falls into this category, consider the benefits of\u00a0inventory management software.\n A modern inventory management system can bring greater efficiency to inventory processes through automation and digital tools. For example, real-time inventory tracking allows staff to see what\u2019s in stock, what\u2019s on order, and where each item is located. Software tools can also collect and present data on purchase orders, sales fulfillment, and demand forecasting on a single user dashboard. \n With this information readily available, inventory managers can avoid wasting time manually searching through spreadsheets and crunching numbers. Some inventory management tools also enable businesses to generate customized reports on inventory stock by item, vendor, delivery date, assembly, and more. Rich inventory insights like these empower businesses to fine-tune their reorder points and overall inventory management processes. \nFinal thoughts\nKeep in mind, reorder points are not static. Sales volumes fluctuate, and supply delivery times vary. Demand for certain product lines may grow or fall.\nTo maintain an accurate reorder point, check the underlying metrics \u2014 average daily sales/usage and average lead time \u2014 at least once per quarter. If you have a high season and low season, or seasonal bad weather that slows down deliveries, factor this in.\nAn effective reorder point ensures that your business keeps flowing\u2014 it helps you fulfill orders quickly, protects your margins, and keeps customers happy.\nRecommended for you\nMidsize business\nWhat is the safety stock formula?

The reorder point (ROP) is a technique in supply chain management to balance these issues by determining the minimum number of units needed in stock to meet sales orders or production targets. When inventory falls below this point, a new purchase order is triggered. Calculating reorder points helps maintain optimal service levels and improve cash flow.The reorder point formula is: Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock. Components of the formula include:- Average daily sales or usage: The average number of units sold or used per day over a defined period, typically three months.- Average delivery lead time: The average time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the order date, which can vary with seasonal demand and other factors.- Safety stock: Extra inventory held to mitigate the risk of shortages, calculated as (Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time).For example, if a manufacturer uses 1.5 units daily on average, with an average lead time of 12 days and a safety stock of 132 units, the reorder point would be (1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150 units. This means the manufacturer should reorder when stock falls to 150 units to avoid stockouts.Businesses can start using the reorder point formula with at least one procurement and sales cycle worth of data. Small businesses might use spreadsheets, while larger operations may benefit from inventory management software for greater efficiency and accuracy. These tools can automate processes, provide real-time tracking, and generate detailed reports to fine-tune inventory management.Reorder points should be reviewed at least quarterly to account for fluctuations in sales volumes and delivery times. An effective reorder point helps fulfill orders quickly, protect margins, and keep customers satisfied.",

Ground unauthorized package charges\u2014fees for packages that are so big that FedEx Ground has the discretion to refuse, return to the shipper or dispose of them\u2014are now $410, up from $385 in the year prior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025 Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon Hikes Hourly Warehouse, Delivery Minimum Wage to $22\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025 Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon Hikes Hourly Warehouse, Delivery Minimum Wage to $22\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nFedEx is also implementing surcharges that target larger shippers\u2019 volume spikes during the holidays to mitigate strain on its network. Starting Oct. 30, enterprise-level customers shipping more than 20,000 residential and FedEx Ground Economy packages will be subject to the company\u2019s \u201cresidential delivery charge.\u201d\n\n\tThis charge can range from $1.35 to $6.35 per FedEx Ground package, and $2.40 to $7.40 per FedEx Express package. The amount depends on how much more the customer is shipping compared to their weekly average residential and FedEx Ground Economy volume from June 5 to July 2. FedEx calls that increase a shipper\u2019s \u201cpeaking factor.\u201d\n\n\tFedEx will calculate the peaking factor each week from Oct. 9-15 to Dec. 18-24, with a week\u2019s charge being applied three weeks later. This means that a customer that ships 20 percent more volume the week starting Nov. 6 than they did from June 5 to July 2 will see an added $1.35 charge for each applicable FedEx Ground package shipped the week starting Nov. 27.\n\n\tTommy Storch, a transportation procurement expert at Insight Sourcing Group, said FedEx and UPS have both gotten increasingly creative in their residential delivery surcharges as they have expanded their networks.\n\n\t\u201cOutside metro areas, costs get more expensive because the density of delivery is not as prevalent,\u201d Storch previously told Sourcing Journal. \u201cFedEx and UPS are very good at always creating new charges\u2026It\u2019s so complex, and they only make it more complex every single year. It\u2019s really something that if a shipper is not managing on a monthly basis, you can all of a sudden have your costs explode on you.\u201d\n\n\tAs of Jan. 1, 2024, FedEx will raise shipping rates 5.9 percent on average across its FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery services. FedEx Ground Economy shipping rates will also increase an undisclosed amount.\n\n\tThe average annual rate increases are one percentage point lower than last year\u2019s general rate increase (GRI) of 6.9 percent. But the higher rates came when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 6.5 percent, well above the July 2023 inflation number of 3.2 percent.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAccording to FedEx, the price adjustments reflect incremental costs associated with the current operating environment, while also accounting for the investments the company has made in service enhancement, fleet maintenance, technology innovations \u201cand other areas to serve customers more effectively and efficiently.\u201d\n\n\tUPS has yet to unveil its 2024 GRI, but it has traditionally hiked rates directly in line with FedEx, which raised its rates 6.9 percent for 2023. Both companies raised GRI 5.9 percent in 2022, and 4.9 percent each year from 2012-2021.\n\n\tThe only reason this year could be different is based on speculation that UPS could decide to pass on the higher costs to customers after 340,000 unionized employees secured a new contract worth \u201c$30 billion in new money\u201d over five years.\n\n\tFedEx Freight shipping rates will increase by an average of 5.9 percent to 6.9 percent dependent on the customer\u2019s transportation rate scale. This change applies to shipments within the U.S. (including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and between the contiguous U.S. and Canada.\n\n\tDetails of all changes to rates, surcharges, and fees will be available on Sept. 7, the package delivery company says.\n\n\tAlso effective Jan. 1, FedEx will be increasing customs clearance service fees on imports.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Newsletters\n\t\n\t\nReceive Our Daily Newsletter & Special Offers\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Recommends\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAAFA Calls on Biden to Intervene in East Coast Port\u00a0Talks\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChain Reaction: John Singleton of Wen-Parker Logistics on Navigating Post-Pandemic Supply Chain\u00a0Disruptions\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2018A Very Difficult Moment\u2019 for Retail: How Could A Change to De Minimis Impact Shippers\u2019\u00a0Costs?\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025\u00a0Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSJ Newsletters\t\t\n\t\n\nGet the news straight to your inbox\n\n\n\t\n\t\tVideos\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIs Your Cotton Safe?

Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), one of the most vocal critics of recent USPS delays,\u00a0 met with DeJoy last month to discuss the agency\u2019s improved performance in his state. In a press release following the meeting, Ossoff said that \u201cwhile data has shown improvement, there is still more needed.\u201d\n\u201cFor months I have sustained relentless pressure on USPS management to fully resolve disastrous performance failures impacting my constituents in Georgia. I\u2019m still hearing from Georgia families and businesses about the difficulty they continue to face sending and receiving their mail,\u201d Ossoff said in a statement.\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who also met with DeJoy last month, said service in his state is improving after USPS opened a large regional mail processing plant in Richmond.\n\u201cWhile we are glad to see some gains in the on-time delivery rate in Virginia, there\u2019s much more work to do. We will continue to press for increased transparency, greater engagement with the public, and a higher standard of service for communities across Virginia,\u201d Warner said in a statement last month.\nUSPS spokesman Dave Walton told Federal News Network that the agency is \u201cdedicated to maintaining the positive advancements observed in the Richmond and Atlanta areas.\u201d\nFor the week ending Aug. 2, USPS delivered about 95% of first-class mail within six days.\nThe agency considers first-class mail delivered on time within five days, but also tracks its \u201cplus-one day\u201d performance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Read more: Agency Oversight \nIn Virginia, USPS also delivered more than 95% of first-class mail within six days.\n\u201cWe continue to enhance employee availability, provide comprehensive training for management, address operational and maintenance challenges, and have implemented new transportation schedules,\u201d Walton said.\n\u2018Back to normal\u2019\nEdmund Carley, national president of United Postmasters and Managers of America (UPMA), said Richmond is \u201cback to normal,\u201d after dealing with some issues, such as challenges with employee availability.\n\u201cEverybody was mad, it was chaos. We didn\u2019t know when the trucks were running. We didn\u2019t implement the change. It\u2019s better than it was a year ago, with a much more efficient process. But it takes a while for it to work out,\u201d Carley said.\nUSPS is shaking up its nationwide delivery network to save money in the long term. Carley said the status quo is unsustainable for USPS, which is more than a third of the way through a 10-year plan to regain its financial footing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while for the savings and efficiencies to come back after the implementation,\u201d he added. \u201cBut you can\u2019t compare it to perfect. You can\u2019t compare the Richmond plants and its performance today to perfect. You\u2019ve got to compare it to what it was before the change. And as long as it\u2019s better, and we\u2019re using a lot less hours, it\u2019s a success. I don\u2019t think anybody steps back and allows us the room to do that.\u201d\nPostal experts say USPS improvements to on-time delivery are needed, and must continue, for Congress to allow these plans to keep moving forward.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Want to stay up to date with the latest federal news and information from all your devices? Download the revamped Federal News Network app\n\u2018Steady decline over three years\u2019\nWhile USPS is addressing regional hotspots with the most severe delays, its data shows mail delivery is slowing year-over-year at a national level.\nDave Lewis, president of the postal metrics company SnailWorks, said USPS delivered about 93.6% of first-class mail on time in 2022 \u2014 but that so far in fiscal 2024, the agency is delivering about 81% of first-class mail on time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a steady decline over three years. And those aren\u2019t fluky numbers. You see it week after week. So they have deteriorated, and it is a general deterioration,\u201d Lewis said in a recent interview.\nSource: SnailWorks. 2024 data is for the year so far.\nAccording to SnailWorks data, a first-class letter took 2.96 days to get delivered on average, in 2022.\u00a0So far in 2024, USPS is taking about 3.76 days to deliver that same letter.\n\u201cYou go, \u2018Oh that\u2019s a day. That\u2019s not that big a deal.\u2019 But these are averages. [On] the bad end, anecdotally, I just hear a lot of really nightmare stories. It\u2019s just things taking weeks to deliver. The bulk of it goes kind of slower, that\u2019s not that big a deal. But at the fringes, I think it\u2019s worse than it looks there.\u201d\nThroughout the year, those outliers included Atlanta, Houston and Richmond, Virginia. Lewis said USPS service is improving in \u201chotspots\u201d that saw the worst declines in on-time delivery.\nIn the Atlanta metro area, USPS took about 10-12 days to deliver a first-class letter at the worst point of its regional delays\u2014 \u201cway beyond the norm,\u201d Lewis said.\n\u201cIt has normalized now. Now it\u2019s down to about four days, which is kind of average. It falls in the middle of the pack,\u201d he said.\nLewis said USPS is also stabilizing service in Houston, another previous hotspot of service problems. The regional plant dealt with equipment changes, as well as a recent major storm that knocked out power for the region for about two or three days.\n\u201cIt just fell apart,\u201d Lewis said about the launch of a new RPDC in Houston. \u201cA lot of mailers were complaining that they couldn\u2019t even get their trucks into the facilities. They were just jammed up. They\u2019re relatively back to normal.\u201d\nUSPS is improving on-time delivery in these hotspots. However, Lewis attributed part of the Postal Service\u2019s improved service delivery to a relatively low volume of mail during the summer.\nThe agency, however, will see its workload grow in the leadup to Election Day in November and the agency\u2019s peak season at the end of the year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s slow right now, it\u2019s summertime, there\u2019s not much mail volume. This service is kind of consistent,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cBut I do worry that, because they are planning on rolling out more of these network updates in the coming months, and the volume is going to be much, much heavier. At the end of August, it will be flooded with political mail. And I am concerned that there\u2019s going to be places where mail just may get stuck and may not move.\u201d\n\u201cFor the second half of 2024, I think we will see serious declines. I think there will be some serious issues, because I think the volume of mail will be very heavy,\u201d he said.\n\u2018Something\u2019s going wrong\u2019\nThomas Day, vice chairman of the Postal Regulatory Commission, said USPS is addressing regional delays, but performance still isn\u2019t back to where it was before the agency made its network modernization changes.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t seem to get it back. They can\u2019t even match prior performance,\u201d Day said. \u201cSomething\u2019s going wrong, and I don\u2019t know what the something is. I find it very, very confusing.\u201d\nFor the week of Aug. 3, USPS delivered about nearly 87% of mail in Georgia on time \u2014 and got 95% of mail to its destination a day past its maximum five-day window of being on time.\n\u201cIf the scores had dropped from 90% down to in the mid-80s, and then after a month or two, you bring it back up to 90%, close to 95%, that\u2019s a reasonable disruption. We\u2019re seeing much broader declines,\u201d Day said. \u201cAnd the other thing that\u2019s troubling to me is that this is prolonged. This is not a couple of weeks of adjustment, getting the staff up to speed on how to do it. This is month after month of performance that is just unacceptable.\u201d\nDay, a former USPS executive with 35 years of experience, oversaw the opening of major facilities during his tenure. He said the opening of Atlanta\u2019s Regional Processing and Distribution Center was the \u201cworst implementation of a new postal facility I\u2019ve ever encountered.\u201d\nRather than take a gradual approach, Day said USPS \u201cflipped the switch\u201d on Feb. 24 and \u201cmoved everything at once.\u201d\n\u201cI have never heard of something like that being done. That\u2019s not the way things are done. You don\u2019t just flip the switch and everything starts up. You do gradual build-ups to make sure things are working. And once you\u2019ve got stability, bring in some more. You want to take advantage of the new facility, but you\u2019ve got to take several weeks, a month or more, to gradually build it up,\u201d Day said.\n\u201cIn Atlanta, because of the way they did it, they have spent so much more money on trying to clean up the mess, than anything they would have lost in savings opportunity, by just doing a gradual opening over weeks or even a couple of months,\u201d he added. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even postal operations. This is a lack of understanding of basic operational concepts.\u201d\n\u2018It just continues to decline year over year\u2019\nWhile USPS remains in the early stages of its network modernization plans, Lewis said the strategy so far has yet to meet its goals of lowering operations costs and reliable services.\n\u201cThe optimist says that, \u2018Well, that just takes time to get these changes adapted, and then they\u2019ll start to improve.\u2019 The evidence I\u2019ve seen so far is that it just continues to decline year over year. If had to bet the house, I would say I don\u2019t see any reason why they won\u2019t continue declining next year. I\u2019m hopeful l see otherwise, but that\u2019s certainly been the pattern so far,\u201d Lewis said.\nDay said scrutiny of USPS performance in Atlanta isn\u2019t just about the on-time metrics.\nUnlike other parts of the country, where USPS is retrofitting existing facilities and turning them into RPDCs, the large mail processing hub it opened in Atlanta was brand-new construction and a model of what USPS management envisioned from its new facilities.\n\u201cThere was a building that was constructed exactly to what they wanted and equipped with exactly what they wanted inside it with all the transport people, you name it. It was to be the crowning glory of what RPDC was to be all about. It was terrible,\u201d Day said.\nDay said the best USPS scores in the country are in the parts of the network that are still operating under the old system for mail processing.\n\u201cUnfortunately, that has not worked, at least from a service standpoint \u2014 although I should say I\u2019m not seeing a financial standpoint either,\u201d he said.\nCarley said DeJoy\u2019s network modernization plans are looking to achieve what USPS sought under another reform plan that began more than a decade ago \u2014 and was halted by Congress.\n\u201cSome of the stuff he\u2019s doing now with those plants is what should have been done 10 years ago,\u201d Carley said. \u201cThe idea is that you have 300-some-odd plants across the country, when you could have 60 larger facilities and 150 small facilities. In essence, it logically makes sense, and it\u2019s where we would have been, if we hadn\u2019t had the political pressure in 2014.\u201d\nCarley said that some parts of the latest USPS reforms haven\u2019t gone according to plan, but DeJoy has made adjustments when\u00a0implementation falls short of expectations.\n\u201cI\u2019m all for the plan being flexible. You have a game plan, and you realize you miscalculated something, we\u2019re going to modify the plan,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m grateful for is the idea that, \u2018OK, we screwed that up. Let\u2019s stop and think what went wrong,'\u201d he added. \u201cYears before, we would\u2019ve just plowed ahead \u2014 \u2018We don\u2019t care, we\u2019re going to keep doing it. Round peg, square hole, we\u2019re going to keep doing it.\u2019\u201d\nBy all accounts, some elements of these reforms are paying off. USPS is saving about $1 billion annually by moving more mail and packages on trucks, rather than paying contractors to fly them across the country.\n\u201cHe made a critical decision, and he saved a lot of money by doing it,\u201d Day said. \u201c[It\u2019s] consistency of service, and you save money.\u201d\nHowever, Day said USPS can \u2014 and should \u2014 improve service while also cutting costs.\n\u201cWhen you do the right steps to achieve consistent, reliable service performance, what you\u2019re going to do is follow a process in an orderly manner, which also is cost-efficient. So when you provide top-quality service, you\u2019re also going to provide the lowest possible cost, because the efficiencies come together,\u201d Day said. \u201cThere\u2019s this mistaken belief that if we let mail go slower, we save money. No, you don\u2019t. That is absolutely false.\u201d\nNetwork modernization continues\nAside from a summertime drop in mail volume, USPS was able to address regional delays because it\u2019s putting some of its network modernization changes on hold until at least January 2025,\u00a0at the urging of lawmakers\nHowever, USPS is still moving ahead with some projects that are already in the works.\n\u201cAt first, the industry was overjoyed to hear that. It looked like they were stopping, but they really aren\u2019t,\u201d Lewis said.\nUSPS plans to launch 15 new Sorting and Delivery Centers (S&DCs) across the U.S. on Sept. 7.\u00a0 S&DCs are smaller versions of Regional Processing and Distribution Centers.\nThe agency will open these new hubs in Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Florida and Pennsylvania.\n\u201cThe Postal Service has targeted key markets where it is beneficial to aggregate delivery units into fewer, larger, centrally located S&DCs \u2014 leveraging both repurposed and new facilities \u2014 to simplify the entire network and create a more reliable and efficient Postal Service,\u201d USPS wrote in an industry notice obtained by Federal News Network.\nCarley said the pause of some network modernization is about \u201cperfecting the implementation.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not slowing down. Nothing has slowed down here. The planning is still ongoing. I think they\u2019ll hopefully have a better handle on the implementation, come 2025. I don\u2019t think, by the end of 2025, they\u2019re going to have any fewer facilities implemented than they would have done without the pause,\u201d he said.\nWhile USPS has seen service degrade in some spots where it\u2019s rolled out its network modernization plans, Carley said USPS is also shaking up its network in places where there aren\u2019t\u00a0complaints about on-time delivery.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve put 53 of these S&DCs together. Atlanta\u2019s the only one you hear about,\u201d he said. \u201cAre the other 52 perfect? Probably not, but they\u2019re at least not getting in the newspaper.\u201d\nMarketing mail holds steady\nWhile first-class mail service deteriorated in areas where USPS first rolled out its network modernization plans, performance for marketing mail remains consistent.\n\u201cThat service has not deteriorated in three years. It\u2019s exactly the same. In fact, it\u2019s gotten a little bit better for flat-size mail,\u201d Lewis said.\nLewis suspects marketing mail performance is holding steady, because USPS discounts prices for marketers who drop off their mail to a facility that\u2019s closer to the area in which it will be delivered.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last mile, and they\u2019re really good at that. And that has not gotten worse. It\u2019s the getting it to the last mile seems to be where they\u2019re really struggling.\u201d\nIn other words, first-class mail is moving slower when coming in and out of a state or metropolitan area.\n\u201cThat transportation element, that\u2019s really the heart of what they\u2019re trying to change with this network. And the transportation piece just doesn\u2019t seem to be working. That\u2019s where the first-class mail is. The marketing mail, knock on wood, is doing very well for that same time period,\u201d Lewis said.\nLewis said flagging USPS service may drive away customers, particularly as the agency keeps raising prices. USPS raised the price of a first-class stamp from 68 to 73 cents in July.\n\u201cThe prices just go up and up and up, and then the prices drive more mail out of the system,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cBanks are going crazy trying to get people to go paperless, way more than they have in the past. They really don\u2019t want people using the mail for that.\u201d\nElection mail challenges\nLewis said USPS is well positioned to handle mail-in ballots ahead of Election Day. It\u2019s everything else broadly categorized as \u201celection mail\u201d that may put a strain on the agency.\nLewis said his company tracked more than a billion pieces of election mail USPS delivered in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\u201cThat means, the \u2018Vote for me\u2019\u2019 stuff the candidates mail, and that will be billions and billions of pieces mailed in the next three months,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThere are billions of pieces of that, and that\u2019s what\u2019s clogs the system up. That may get in the way of some of the ballots. That concerns me.\u201d\nUSPS relies on tried-and-true \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to expedite the delivery of ballots to election officials They include extra deliveries and collections, arranging special pickups, expanding hours at processing facilities and bypassing some standard mail processing procedures to fast-track ballots to election officials.\nLewis said the agency can automatically sort out and fast-track the delivery of ballots because of an intelligent mail barcode that goes on every piece of commercial mail.\n\u201cThat indicates that it\u2019s ballot mail. So the machines can automatically identify ballot mail as it goes through. And the point of that is so the Postal Service, as the election nears, they can identify where that mail is and pull it out and make sure it gets delivered on time, and they\u2019ve done a very good job of that in the past,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be terrible,\u201d Lewis added about the agency\u2019s performance ahead of Election Day. \u201cI think ballots will be well delivered. The Post Service understands the importance, and they have something in place to identify that and give it the special handling that it needs.\nDay said recent USPS performance in Atlanta raises legitimate concerns about whether state election officials will receive mail-in ballots in time to be counted. \u201c\nAt the very least, a great deal of caution has to be shown about how mail-in ballots are going to be handled in the Atlanta area. Just to be very, very safe and make sure everything gets counted,\u201d he said.\nSome states count mail-in ballots after Election Day, as long as the ballot is postmarked before the election. However, Georgia has stricter rules and will accept ballots no later than Election Day.\nDay advised Georgia voters voting by mail to drop off their ballot about 10 days in advance of Election Day, \u201cjust to be safe.\u201d\n\u201cGeorgia is a swing state, not the place you want to have problems with mail-in balance,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so there\u2019s going to have to be a real concern about how people are advised in the state of Georgia.\u201d\nCopyright\n                            \u00a9\u00a02024 Federal News Network.

    "Summarized_Document1": "FedEx is increasing surcharges for the 2023 peak season and has announced its general rate increase (GRI) for 2024. The company aims to boost profitability and cut $4 billion in costs by the end of its 2025 financial year. The surcharges, now called 'demand' surcharges, will apply during any period of elevated demand, not just the holiday season. Key surcharge changes include: \n\n- Small businesses using FedEx Ground Economy will see surcharges rise to $1.60 from Oct. 30 to Nov. 26 and Dec. 11 to Jan. 14, up from $1.50 last year. During the peak period from Nov. 27 to Dec. 10, surcharges will increase to $2.60 from $2.50. \n- 'Additional handling' surcharges will increase to $6.95 from $6.55 per package, and oversize charges will rise from $68.75 to $73. \n- Ground unauthorized package charges will jump to $410 from $385. \n\nFedEx is also targeting larger shippers' volume spikes during the holidays with a 'residential delivery charge' ranging from $1.35 to $6.35 per FedEx Ground package and $2.40 to $7.40 per FedEx Express package. This charge depends on the customer's shipping volume compared to their weekly average from June 5 to July 2. \n\nStarting Jan. 1, 2024, FedEx will raise shipping rates by an average of 5.9% across its FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Home Delivery services. FedEx Ground Economy shipping rates will also increase by an undisclosed amount. This rate increase is one percentage point lower than last year's 6.9% GRI. \n\nFedEx Freight shipping rates will increase by 5.9% to 6.9%, depending on the customer's transportation rate scale. This applies to shipments within the U.S. and between the contiguous U.S. and Canada. \n\nDetails of all changes to rates, surcharges, and fees will be available on Sept. 7. Additionally, FedEx will increase customs clearance service fees on imports starting Jan. 1, 2024.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The USPS is addressing mail delays in regions where it launched its network modernization plans, including the opening of Regional Processing and Distribution Centers (RPDCs). Postmaster General Louis DeJoy acknowledged service deterioration but emphasized the necessity of these changes for long-term improvements. Lawmakers from affected areas like Atlanta and Richmond, Virginia, noted some improvements but stressed the need for continued efforts. For the week ending Aug. 2, USPS delivered about 95% of first-class mail within six days, with similar performance in Virginia. However, national on-time delivery rates have declined from 93.6% in 2022 to about 81% in fiscal 2024. The average delivery time for a first-class letter increased from 2.96 days in 2022 to 3.76 days in 2024. Regional hotspots like Atlanta and Houston have seen improvements, but concerns remain about the USPS's ability to handle increased mail volumes during peak seasons, including the lead-up to Election Day. The USPS is also launching 15 new Sorting and Delivery Centers (S&DCs) in various states. Despite some successes, the overall performance has not met the goals of lowering costs and improving reliability. The USPS is saving about $1 billion annually by moving more mail via trucks instead of air transport. Marketing mail performance has remained consistent, but first-class mail service has deteriorated. The USPS is preparing for the upcoming election mail surge, with measures in place to expedite ballot delivery. However, concerns persist about the timely delivery of mail-in ballots, especially in swing states like Georgia.",

Authored by USApple Vice President of Insights and Analytics, Chris Gerlach, the report takes an in-depth look at the trends and forces \u2013 from political headwinds to weather events \u2013 that shape the U.S. apple industry.\n*The Outlook Report is based on recently released United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates. After the presentation of those numbers, USApple members met in-person to discuss current growing conditions to formulate a more up-to-date production estimate. The final USApple 2024/25 crop year forecast is an adjustment of the USDA numbers based on those conversations.\nU.S. Production\nAccording to USApple\u2019s analysis, total U.S. apple production for the 2024/25 crop year (CY) will be 259,517,252 bushels. This represents a 10.1% decrease compared to last year\u2019s final production figure.\n\u201cGrowers from across the U.S. are reporting the crop quality is excellent,\u201d said Gerlach.\nThese figures are more comprehensive than USDA data, which only look at the top seven apple-producing states. USApple analyzes the production from states outside of the top seven and adds that back into USDA\u2019s figure. It also incorporates feedback from growers based on what they\u2019re seeing in the field every day.\n\u201cDespite various challenges, the resilience and dedication of our growers have led to another promising year for apple production,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cThe data we\u2019ve gathered not only highlights the strength of our industry, but also underscores the importance of innovation and adaptability in ensuring a bountiful harvest.\u201d\nVarietal Mix\nAt the varietal level, Gala is expected to retain the top spot with more than 48 million bushels produced, accounting for around 17% of the U.S. apple market. After Gala, rounding out the top five are Red Delicious (12.3%), Granny Smith (10%), Honeycrisp (9.8%) and Fuji (9.4%).\nIn general, the varieties on the rise include Honeycrisp, Pink Lady/Cripps Pink and Cosmic Crisp\u00ae. Fuji, Rome and \u201cother\u201d varieties have remained relatively consistent compared to 2019/20 production volumes. Varieties on the decline include Gala and Red Delicious.\n\u201cWe still see strong Honeycrisp production, but it\u2019s tempered this year,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cWith volumes aligning more closely with Gala and Red Delicious, we may see production levels stabilize rather than increase dramatically in the future.\u201d\nTrade\nAccording to USDA trade data, fresh apple exports totaled 46.4 million bushels in the 2023/24 CY (July to June). This is around 14 million bushels higher than 2022/23 export levels \u2013 an astonishing 44% year-over-year increase.\nDuring the same period, fresh apple imports dropped by around one million bushels, a 15% decline. The joint effects of increasing exports and decreasing imports caused the already net positive fresh apple trade balance to grow to more than 42 million bushels.\nThe surge in fresh apple exports is largely attributed to the abundant domestic supply, competitive pricing abroad, and favorable positive trade policies.\n\u201cThanks to the removal of previously imposed tariffs on our apples, exports to India are up nearly 4,000% year over year. We are optimistic that this critical market will continue to grow in volume and value,\u201d said Gerlach.\nGlobal ProductionAccording to United Nations (UN) data, worldwide apple production surpassed 5 billion bushels for the first time in 2022 (the latest available datapoint). In 2022, China alone was responsible for producing 2.5 billion bushels, around half of the world\u2019s total supply. In 2021, Turkey overtook the U.S. to become the world\u2019s second largest apple producer and maintained that spot in 2022, even widening the gap between us (with 253 million bushels, 5% of world production). The U.S., in the third spot, was credited with 232 million bushels and 4.6% of world production. Rounding out the top five were Poland (4.4%) and India (2.7%).\nNewton\nLaunched in 2022, USApple\u2019s\u00a0Newton Database & Dashboard\u00a0is a one-stop-shop for apple-related statistics. Newton consolidates data from USApple and multiple USDA sources in to one place giving users up-to-date information on apple production, utilization, trade, prices, storages, movement, economic impacts and more. This unique USApple member benefit gives users the ability to view preset reports or create custom queries for download.\nFinal USApple Production Forecast, including states\n\nProduction levels measured in 42-pound bushels\n\nUSApple is the national trade association representing all segments of the apple industry. Members include 36 state and regional apple associations, representing 26,000 apple growers throughout the country and more than 3,700 apple-related companies. Our members collectively grow more than 10 billion pounds of apples a year on average, supporting about 150,000 jobs and generating more than $8 billion in total wages and almost $23 billion in economic activity.\nThe Voice of\nthe Apple Industry\nWhat We Do Become a Member News & Resources\nPolicy Priorities Who We Are Industry Partners\n\u00a9 2024 USApple Association.

    "Document2": "2024 Manufacturing Outlook for Sourcing & Supply Chain Resiliency\nKey Takeaways:\nThe Full Article:\nResilience remains a top priority for manufacturers, who continue to increase their operational visibility and transparency and become more agile to proactively address potential supply chain disruptions. To remain competitive in 2024, digital transformation solutions enabling organizations to achieve supply chain resiliency, profitability, and sustainability goals are crucial.\nAccording to KPMG, \u201csmart\u201d supply chain management and sourcing initiatives will make waves powered by advanced technologies such as automation, data analytics, digital twins, and more.\nThis article explores six main priorities that manufacturers are navigating to stay ahead of the competition in 2024:\n1. Increase Supply Chain Speed and Performance with Digitalization\nDigital transformation (DX) can significantly benefit manufacturing sourcing and procurement teams. A growing body of work shows that successful DX initiatives require effective planning and a detailed implementation plan that addresses new technology, employee training, and operational guidelines (workflows) to drive value.\nA 10-year Deloitte study of publicly traded companies worldwide finds that DX tied to an effective strategy and a comprehensive deployment and onboarding process can yield a market capitalization increase of up to 5%. By contrast, DX programs executed without the same level of rigor can cause value erosion.\nHere are two areas of strategic sourcing to consider enhancing:\nI) Streamline Supplier Communications and Revisit Strategic Sourcing Operations\nManufacturers and suppliers want to streamline their sourcing and procurement processes in the current business landscape. A survey conducted by IndustryWeek in collaboration with aPriori found that 70% of respondents want to accelerate the quoting process, and 79% prefer a 24-hour to two-week completion window.\nDigital tools like aPriori provide a centralized solution for real-time supplier collaboration and information exchange. These automated platforms eliminate the need for traditional request for quotation (RFQ) processes that are time-consuming and prone to delays.\nInstead, today\u2019s digital technologies deliver \u201cZero RFQ\u201d or automated procurement capabilities that enable manufacturing companies to:\nII) Accelerate the Product Design and Production Process\nDigital automation-driven solutions help innovators bring together teams spread across different departments. These teams can combine their efforts on a single solution covering design, manufacturing, and sourcing operations.\nWith access to real-time data and visibility into the design and production process, sourcing professionals can get involved early in product development. This helps them identify potential component shortages and recommend design alternatives and changes to an existing bill of materials (BOM). This way, manufacturing companies can avoid supply chain risks and mitigate any negative impacts that may emerge.\naPriori\u2019s real-time co-working application, aP Workspace, expedites task management and provides data audibility for decision-making. Users can access links to the application from their product lifecycle management (PLM) systems to gain actionable insights. These capabilities allow teams to collaborate seamlessly and communicate effectively, achieving their profitability and sustainability goals without reinventing existing business processes.\n2. Build a Solid Foundation for Artificial Intelligence\nManufacturers continue to make digital investments to automate processes, manage data, strengthen internal resources, and facilitate cross-functional collaboration. The result is faster and more informed business decisions for forward-thinking manufacturers.\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most alluring digital tools. S&P\u2019s 2024 Supply Chain Outlook states, \u201cWhile AI cannot prevent supply chain disruptions, if deployed in the correct manner, it could provide predictive probabilities of future disruptions.\u201d\nAI cannot work in a vacuum: It needs robust, accurate data to analyze and address specific manufacturing challenges. But as the MIT Sloan Management Review points out, \u201cManufacturing data is often localized or specific to a particular industry domain or a company\u2019s operations. As a result, there isn\u2019t a lot of relevant data available for building reliable AI models.\u201d\nAdditionally, product design, sourcing, and manufacturing data often reside in individual departments (either in systems that are not integrated or personalized spreadsheets filled with supplier information that is not easily accessible).\nCentralizing and providing access to data across the product development life cycle is central to making data-driven insights (with or without AI). Adding weight, carbon emissions, and other information to a PLM system \u2013 which already stores a bill of materials (BOM) \u2013 makes it easier for product development and sourcing teams to make decisions confidently and anticipate potential issues throughout the development process.\nManufacturers can also use automated analysis solutions like aPriori\u2019s aP Generate, which integrates with the PLM to centralize critical manufacturing information. aP Generate links to aP Design and aP Workspace in the PLM, enabling users to take further steps or ask questions for up-to-date decision-making.\nSome manufacturers are already gaining end-to-end insights using digital twins to connect product design, manufacturing processes, and individual factory capabilities. This data-driven insight is powerful on its own. And it can serve as part of a digital platform that AI can use to make additional analysis quickly.\nPrioritizing data quality is key to unlocking the full potential of AI in the manufacturing industry. With data-driven insights, manufacturers can evaluate alternatives, improve scenario planning operations, transform business models, and enhance supply chain resiliency.\n3. De-Risk Supply Chains and Evaluate Reshoring\nMaintaining a diverse supplier base and reducing overreliance on specific supplier locations mitigates risks associated with geopolitical issues, natural disasters, and other unprecedented events like the 2020 pandemic. Diversified supply chains improve resilience and ensure business continuity in today\u2019s dynamic global environment.\nOne tool that can help manufacturers with this is aPriori\u2019s Regional Data Libraries (RDLs). These digital libraries provide real-world and timely variable material and supplier production costs across 87 global regions. By utilizing this feature, innovators can assess manufacturing alternatives effectively, consider the impact of region-specific tariffs, and avoid an overreliance on specific regions with potential risks. This often leads to significant cost savings and reduced lead times.\nManufacturers can also consider the benefits of reshoring specific manufacturing operations. This can lead to a reduction in shipping costs and taking advantage of valuable tax credits. For instance, automotive manufacturers can use reshoring to redirect the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain to the U.S. This helps eliminate their dependency on semiconductors produced in China and capitalize on a $7,500 tax credit.\nIn its annual Reshoring Index report, the global consulting firm Kearney provides further insight into U.S. reshoring initiatives. Its findings include:\nRead our insights on why reshoring U.S. manufacturing could be right for you.\n4. Offset Labor Shortages via Automation\nAccording to Deloitte\u2019s 2024 Manufacturing Industry Outlook survey, nearly 80% of respondents consider labor market shortages a critical threat. To address this challenge, approximately 50% of manufacturing executives equip their production workforce with advanced digital technologies and flexible schedules. This approach aims to:\nLeading innovators like Woodward leverage aPriori\u2019s automation, simulation capabilities, and actionable insights to counteract the shortage of skilled workers. By employing aPriori, the company can achieve more with fewer resources, such as:\n5. Capitalize on Economic Tailwinds to Accelerate U.S. Manufacturing Growth\nProduct innovators can take advantage of positive economic factors supporting business growth in the upcoming year. These economic trends include:\nI) Federal Investments in Manufacturing Innovation\nThe Biden administration has introduced new measures to strengthen North America\u2019s supply chains and reduce costs. One of the measures implemented is the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act, which aims to reduce America\u2019s reliance on foreign-produced chips.\nThis federal initiative includes $231 billion to build semiconductor factories in the U.S. The program also includes a 25% tax credit for capital investments in semiconductor production to spur innovation and manufacturing in this area.\nAlongside the U.S. CHIPS initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) aims to propel clean energy and sustainable manufacturing domestically. The IRA provides more than $1.7 billion in funding and additional tax credits to incentivize manufacturers. This initiative primarily targets consumers, empowering them to purchase green products like EVs.\nCompanies across multiple industries can take advantage of the incentives offered by federal programs. For instance, the building and construction industry can capitalize on these incentives by developing energy-efficient buildings with sustainable insulation, lighting, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Similarly, federal investments to advance the clean energy sector range from EV production in the automotive industry to zero-emissions battery materials.\n6. Use the Green Supply Chain as a Competitive Advantage\nProduct manufacturers increasingly recognize the growing demand from customers and stakeholders for sustainable, green innovations. Manufacturers can achieve a net-zero future by selecting the appropriate raw materials and production processes to decarbonize their product portfolios.\nAcross the globe, several regulations have been implemented to increase sustainable manufacturing and sourcing operations. These measures include:\nThe financial impact of sustainability requires manufacturers to assign a cost to carbon as they design new products and initiate value engineering on older products. Internal Carbon Pricing (ICP) is an approach that manufacturers and other organizations use internally to assign a cost for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted. This enables manufacturing and sourcing teams to understand the cost of carbon and to compare it to traditional manufacturing costs (e.g., material, labor, and manufacturing overhead costs).\nWith an \u201capples-to-apples\u201d comparison, sourcing teams can easily evaluate carbon and other manufacturing costs. Then, they can select the suppliers that will enable them to reach their key performance indicators for cost, CO2e, and other goals.\nGain the Ability to Navigate Global Supply Chain Uncertainty\nThe ongoing process of digital transformation shapes the 2024 manufacturing outlook. This encompasses trends like Generative AI, automation, and digital twin technologies for supply chain resiliency. Advanced digital solutions like aPriori provide real-time advantages, from accelerating product design to counteracting critical labor market shortages.\nIn addition to investing in digital technologies, economic tailwinds, fueled by initiatives like the CHIPS Act, provide sustainable growth opportunities and promote reshoring.\nAt its core, this post highlights the various obstacles, opportunities, and trends that manufacturing companies can expect to face in the upcoming year.\nGet the State of Procurement Report\nSubscribe to the aPriori Blog!\nListen to Our Most Popular Manufacturing Podcasts of 2023\n13 Must-Read Manufacturing Sourcing & Procurement Posts of 2023\nRead Our 7 Best Product Sustainability and Innovation Posts of 2023\nWhat Is Design to Cost?

    "Summarized_Document1": "Chicago (August 16, 2024)\u2014 After record-breaking production last year, apple growers expect another high-performing year, according to a new report released by the U.S. Apple Association (USApple) at the organization\u2019s 129th annual Outlook Conference in Chicago. USApple\u2019s Industry Outlook 2024 provides the most up-to-date data and analysis on U.S. and global apple production, utilization, and trade. Authored by USApple Vice President of Insights and Analytics, Chris Gerlach, the report takes an in-depth look at the trends and forces \u2013 from political headwinds to weather events \u2013 that shape the U.S. apple industry. The Outlook Report is based on recently released United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates. After the presentation of those numbers, USApple members met in-person to discuss current growing conditions to formulate a more up-to-date production estimate. The final USApple 2024/25 crop year forecast is an adjustment of the USDA numbers based on those conversations. According to USApple\u2019s analysis, total U.S. apple production for the 2024/25 crop year (CY) will be 259,517,252 bushels. This represents a 10.1% decrease compared to last year\u2019s final production figure. \u201cGrowers from across the U.S. are reporting the crop quality is excellent,\u201d said Gerlach. These figures are more comprehensive than USDA data, which only look at the top seven apple-producing states. USApple analyzes the production from states outside of the top seven and adds that back into USDA\u2019s figure. It also incorporates feedback from growers based on what they\u2019re seeing in the field every day. \u201cDespite various challenges, the resilience and dedication of our growers have led to another promising year for apple production,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cThe data we\u2019ve gathered not only highlights the strength of our industry, but also underscores the importance of innovation and adaptability in ensuring a bountiful harvest.\u201d At the varietal level, Gala is expected to retain the top spot with more than 48 million bushels produced, accounting for around 17% of the U.S. apple market. After Gala, rounding out the top five are Red Delicious (12.3%), Granny Smith (10%), Honeycrisp (9.8%) and Fuji (9.4%). In general, the varieties on the rise include Honeycrisp, Pink Lady/Cripps Pink and Cosmic Crisp\u00ae. Fuji, Rome and \u201cother\u201d varieties have remained relatively consistent compared to 2019/20 production volumes. Varieties on the decline include Gala and Red Delicious. \u201cWe still see strong Honeycrisp production, but it\u2019s tempered this year,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cWith volumes aligning more closely with Gala and Red Delicious, we may see production levels stabilize rather than increase dramatically in the future.\u201d According to USDA trade data, fresh apple exports totaled 46.4 million bushels in the 2023/24 CY (July to June). This is around 14 million bushels higher than 2022/23 export levels \u2013 an astonishing 44% year-over-year increase. During the same period, fresh apple imports dropped by around one million bushels, a 15% decline. The joint effects of increasing exports and decreasing imports caused the already net positive fresh apple trade balance to grow to more than 42 million bushels. The surge in fresh apple exports is largely attributed to the abundant domestic supply, competitive pricing abroad, and favorable positive trade policies. \u201cThanks to the removal of previously imposed tariffs on our apples, exports to India are up nearly 4,000% year over year. We are optimistic that this critical market will continue to grow in volume and value,\u201d said Gerlach. According to United Nations (UN) data, worldwide apple production surpassed 5 billion bushels for the first time in 2022 (the latest available datapoint). In 2022, China alone was responsible for producing 2.5 billion bushels, around half of the world\u2019s total supply. In 2021, Turkey overtook the U.S. to become the world\u2019s second largest apple producer and maintained that spot in 2022, even widening the gap between us (with 253 million bushels, 5% of world production). The U.S., in the third spot, was credited with 232 million bushels and 4.6% of world production. Rounding out the top five were Poland (4.4%) and India (2.7%). Launched in 2022, USApple\u2019s Newton Database & Dashboard is a one-stop-shop for apple-related statistics. Newton consolidates data from USApple and multiple USDA sources in to one place giving users up-to-date information on apple production, utilization, trade, prices, storages, movement, economic impacts and more. This unique USApple member benefit gives users the ability to view preset reports or create custom queries for download. USApple is the national trade association representing all segments of the apple industry. Members include 36 state and regional apple associations, representing 26,000 apple growers throughout the country and more than 3,700 apple-related companies. Our members collectively grow more than 10 billion pounds of apples a year on average, supporting about 150,000 jobs and generating more than $8 billion in total wages and almost $23 billion in economic activity.",

    "Document1": "Amazon Fee Changes 2024: Significant Fee Updates\nAmazon regularly introduces changes to their FBA fulfillment fees in order to complement the changes in the global eCommerce industry. This year, the tech giant introduced significant changes in core Amazon FBA fees and other Amazon selling fees in general, the majority of which will take effect on February 5th, 2024.\nThe upcoming Amazon fee changes are brought about by multiple factors affecting Amazon\u2019s business operations and the eCommerce industry in its totality. The new Amazon fees for 2024 are designed to motivate sellers to utilize the platform\u2019s services to benefit all parties involved, facilitating faster deliveries and ensuring efficient use of space in Amazon fulfillment centers.\nAmazon Fee Changes in 2024 | Summary\nAs Amazon continues to invest in technology, infrastructure, transportation, and people in order to innovate its services, additional costs are bound to be incurred. The changes to Amazon fees are largely focused on fulfillment, referral, storage, unit sales, and returns processing.\nAs an overview of the impact of these changes in Amazon fees, an average increase of $0.15 in fees per unit sold is to be expected by Amazon sellers. However, Amazon emphasizes that such an increase is \u201csignificantly less than other logistics providers.\u201d\nTo further enlighten sellers on the changes in Amazon selling fees this year, here are some core fee adjustments to be implemented in 2024.\nAmazon Referral Fees Update for 2024\nStarting January 15, 2024, there will be some changes in Amazon referral fees for apparel products, while other referral fees will remain unchanged. Apparel products priced at a certain level will be updated.\nAs mentioned, referral fees for other Amazon products will remain unchanged. You may refer on the table below for the referral fees of specific Amazon categories:\n15% for products with a total sales price greater than $10.00\n15% for items with a total sales price greater than $10.00\n8% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $300.00\n8% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $100.00\n15% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $100.00 up to $1,000.00,\n10% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $1,000.00 up to $5,000.00, and\n5% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $5,000.00\n10% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $200.00\n15% for products with a total sales price greater than $15.00\n5% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $250.00\n8% for products with a total sales price greater than $500.00\n3% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $1,500.00\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cReferral fee rates,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nFBA Fulfillment Fees (Excluding Apparel)\nOn February 5th, 2024, the new granular rate cards for standard-sized products and large bulky & extra-large size tiers will take effect. Moreover, starting April 15th, 2024, FBA fulfillment fee rates for the aforementioned size tiers will be implemented.\nTo better understand the FBA fulfillment fees in 2024, you may refer to the chart below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cTable 1. FBA fulfillment fees (excluding Apparel),\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cTable 2. FBA fulfillment fees (excluding Apparel),\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Table 3. FBA fulfillment fees (excluding Apparel),\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nInbound and Outbound Fee Changes\nThe new inbound placement service fee aligns with the changes in Amazon seller fees for 2024. Starting March 1st, 2024, there will be an inbound placement service fee for standard and Large Bulky-sized products. The standard-sized products will have an average fee of $0.27 per unit, whereas Large Bulky-sized products will have an average fee of $1.58 per unit.\nThe implementation of this inbound placement service fee will commence 45 days after the products are received. It means that Amazon will start charging sellers inbound placement fees on April 15th, 2024. For reference, you can check the table below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cFBA inbound placement service fee,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cFBA inbound placement service fee,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nTo minimize or eliminate fees associated with inbound placement services, Amazon recommends opting for the \u201cDiscounted\u201d FBA inbound placement service, provided your shipping plan meets the criteria. This choice will significantly reduce or completely eliminate fees for dispatching your inventory to various inbound locations within the Amazon network.\nIn relation to inbound fees, effective March 1, 2024, Amazon will introduce an inbound defect fee. This particular Amazon fee will cover shipments delivered to the wrong fulfillment center or deleted and abandoned shipments. The below outlines the per-unit inbound defect fee amount.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cInbound defect fees,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nFor outbound products, sellers will also observe a reduced FBA fulfillment fee rate of $0.20 per unit for standard-sized products and $0.61 per unit for large bulky-sized products for large bulky-sized products.\nAnother fee update relating to fulfillment fees includes a fulfillment fee discount ranging from $0.04 to $1.32, depending on item size and weight, for eligible products in the Ships in Product Packaging (SIPP) program.\nAccordingly, items certified as SIPP will automatically receive lowered FBA fulfillment fees on each certified unit shipped. You may refer to the table below for the allotted discount per SIPP-certified unit in 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Jan 24, 2024.\nInventory and Storage Fee Changes\nAmazon recommends that sellers using Fulfillment by Amazon ensure they have a healthy inventory level to minimize order fulfillment costs, including shipping costs.\nIn an effort to promote healthy inventory levels among third-party sellers, Amazon is introducing a low-inventory-level fee for standard-sized products that consistently fall below customer demand. The said fee is set to be implemented on April 1st, 2024, and for guidance may refer to the table below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Jan 24, 2024.\nIn relation to storage fee updates, Amazon indicated that non-peak monthly storage for standard-size product fees will be reduced. Amazon FBA sellers can expect a non-peak monthly inventory storage fees reduction to an average of $0.09 per cubic foot, effective April 1st, 2024.

Significant business model issues have been starting to manifest for fleets already deploying battery-electric trucks.\nIn many respects, Sanchez\u2019s message echoed that of J.B. Hunt President Shelley Simpson the previous day.\nBEV Technology is Still in its Infancy\nLooking at diesel versus electric in light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, Sanchez said that while Ryder expected to see cost increases for adopting BEVs instead of conventional diesel trucks, they did not expect to see the magnitude of those costs, which he cited as a major barrier to widespread adoption at the current time.\n\u201cWe know the commercial EVs beyond light-duty transit vans are not ready for mass adoption due to price range and payload limitations,\u201d Sanchez told show attendees.\n\u201cWe also know that we have a lack of critical charging infrastructure, and we would [have to] make major improvements to their power grid in order to support it.\n\u201cFrom our point of view, for commercial EVs to work in the real world, we need a breakthrough in battery technology and an expansion of the charging infrastructure. We need an inflection point.\u201d\nToday's EVs are Like the First Mobile Phones\nSanchez produced a vintage Motorola \u201cbrick\u201d cell phone from the podium to make his next point: That BEV technology \u2014 much like the brick cell phone in the late 1970s \u2014 is still in the very earliest stage of its development path.\nOver time, of course, cellphone technology improved exponentially. Better batteries were developed. Phones got smaller. And, as more and more capabilities were added, they eventually evolved into smartphones.\nThere\u2019s a distinct parallel between the evolution of cellular and commercial zero-emissions vehicle technology, Sanchez said. Like the cell phone, he added, the industry needs electric vehicle costs to come down.\n\u201cWe need smaller, lighter and more powerful battery technology to improve the range and capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need a nationwide infrastructure. We need the fastest applicable charges available where professional drivers can conveniently charge their trucks.\u201d\nWe Need a Technological Breakthrough\nThe North American trucking industry clearly needs a new technological breakthrough to drive capabilities up and costs down. The problem, Sanchez cautioned, is that we don\u2019t know when that breakthrough will come, and what kind of changes it will bring.\nThe real-world numbers highlight the scope of issue.\n\u201cAt Ryder, we have a stable of nearly 250,000 commercial vehicles,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnd only 60 of those trucks are EVs.\n\u201cWe also have 40,000 commercial vehicle customers. And so far, only 18 of them have chosen to deploy EVs in their fleets.\u201d\nThose figures hold true for the North American trucking industry at large, Sanchez added. He said that there are nearly 16 million commercial vehicles in service in North America today. And to date, only 28,000 of them are EVs.\n\u201cThe problem is not lack of interest,\u201d Sanchez explained. \u201cWe have many customers who asked about the cost benefit of converting to EVs. We found that there was significant barrier to conversion in the total cost of transport, or the TCT.\u201d\nTCT, he explained, includes the cost of vehicle, fuel or electricity, driver wages, as well as other factors that go into transporting the same load the same distance and achieving the equivalent delivery times.\nThe business case for converting to BEV technology just isn\u2019t there yet, Sanchez said.\nIn fact, he added, if you take the average load that is currently being moved by a heavy-duty diesel truck today and convert that tractor to electric, it requires nearly two vehicles and more than two trailers to deliver the same load at the same time as one diesel vehicle, at more than double TCT.\n\u201cI think most of you would agree that this is a tough sell.\u201d\nThe Diesel and Electric Total Cost of Transport Gap\nRyder did the math to better understand how significant the TCT gap between diesel and battery-electric trucks actually is. The results are detailed in a white paper, \u201cCharged Logistics: The cost of electric vehicle conversion for U.S. commercial fleets.\u201d\nRyder analyzed the total cost to transport, in one-to-one comparisons, for transitioning Class 4 (light-duty), Class 6 (medium-duty), and Class 8 (heavy-duty) vehicles operating in California and Georgia from internal combustion engines to EVs in today\u2019s market.\nThen it also examined the TCT for transitioning a mixed fleet (light, medium, and heavy) of 25 ICE vehicles to EVs. The mix was based on the overall mix of commercial vehicles in the U.S. according to Polk Data Services.\nThe analysis is based on representative network loads and routes from Ryder\u2019s dedicated fleet operations, which includes more than 13,000 commercial vehicles and professional drivers, as well as the impact of EV charging time and maximum payload to achieve equivalent delivery times.\nCritical factors include general labor, energy costs, loads and routes, Sanchez explained.\n\u201cWe then factored in a number of cost assumptions using current market prices for vehicles, maintenance, fuel, and charging infrastructure. We also factored in driver\u2019s wages, other professional costs, as well as general and administrative expenses.\u201d\nThen, Ryder took the range and payload capabilities needed to achieve equivalent diesel delivery targets and ran the numbers.\n\u201cIt currently costs about $170,000 a year to run the light-duty diesel Transit van,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cFor electric vehicles, that cost increases an estimated 3%. The cost of the vehicle nearly doubles. However, maintenance cost savings largely offset the increase in vehicle cost.\u201d\nThe additional driver hours needed for EV charging time in Georgia costs a fleet about $156,000 per year. And while equipment maintenance costs remain the same as that of California, Sanchez noted, Georgia\u2019s lower fuel and energy costs do not provide the same level of savings while transitioning from diesel to electric. All this results in a higher cost disadvantage for Georgia than California.\nHeavy-Duty Comparison\nAs the study moved from light-duty to larger vehicles, the cost benefits start to wane even more.\nLooking at Class 8, in Georgia, it costs a fleet about $291,000 to run a diesel-powered truck. In California, it\u2019s about $334,000 per year.\nBut given current BEV range and payload limitations, Sanchez said it could require nearly twice the equipment and more than twice the labor compared to a diesel truck for fleets to deliver the same loads.\nSo for that same fleet in Georgia, an electric truck would take $622,438 to deliver the same loads.\nIn California, the cost to deliver those same loads with electric would cost $648,712.\nOverall, Ryder\u2019s analysis estimates cost increases of 94% to 114% to convert heavy-duty trucks to EVs and 56% to 67% to convert mixed fleets of 25 vehicles, depending on which state.\nOverall, Ryder\u2019s analysis estimates cost increases of 94% to 114% to convert heavy-duty trucks to EVs.\nImage: HDT graphic\nUltimately, consumers will have to pay for those prices increases.\n\u201cKeep in mind that nearly three-quarters of all goods in the U.S. are transported by trucks,\u201d he added.\n\u201cSo if you extrapolate the TCT analysis for the entire U.S. fleet of commercial vehicles to a 100% transition to EVs, and passing the average total cost of transport on to consumers, we estimate that this increased costs cumulatively adding from .5% to 1% in overall inflation.\u201d\nCan the Cost Parity Gap Be Closed?\nSanchez said the purpose of Ryder\u2019s analysis is to quantify the current gap in cost between diesel and EVS and to identify the cost drivers.\nThis, in turn, will help equipment manufacturers, technology companies, innovators, and regulators to better focus their ZEV development efforts.\n\u201cWe believe those to be advanced battery technology to address payload and range limitations, reducing vehicle costs, and building out sufficient charging networks and delivering power,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe believe [by addressing] those three areas \u2026 we can start to close the gap and created a cost parity between diesel and electric trucks.\u201d\nThere are also multiple ways to reduce vehicle emissions, including electric, natural gas, hydrogen, hybrid carbon capture, as well as continuing to advance diesel emissions technology, Sanchez added.\n\u201cPeople and businesses will see the benefits of zero-emission vehicles,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cAnd mass adoption will follow. It will take all of us in this room and throughout the industry, working together to strike a balance between encouraging innovation, safeguarding the interests of businesses and consumers and the environment alignment.

Robert Sanchez, Ryder System\u2019s CEO, highlighted this during his keynote at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo (ACT Expo) in Las Vegas on May 22, 2024. Despite advancements in zero-emission powertrain technologies, significant business model issues have emerged for fleets using BEVs. Sanchez compared the current state of BEV technology to the early stages of mobile phones, emphasizing the need for breakthroughs in battery technology and charging infrastructure.Ryder's analysis of the total cost of transport (TCT) for Class 4, Class 6, and Class 8 vehicles in California and Georgia revealed substantial cost disparities between diesel and electric trucks. For instance, running a light-duty diesel Transit van costs about $170,000 annually, while an electric version increases costs by 3%. For heavy-duty trucks, the cost to run a diesel truck in Georgia is approximately $291,000, compared to $622,438 for an electric truck. In California, these costs are $334,000 for diesel and $648,712 for electric.Overall, Ryder estimates a 94% to 114% cost increase for converting heavy-duty trucks to EVs and a 56% to 67% increase for mixed fleets of 25 vehicles. These increased costs could add 0.5% to 1% to overall inflation if passed on to consumers. Sanchez stressed the need for advancements in battery technology, vehicle cost reduction, and charging infrastructure to close the cost parity gap between diesel and electric trucks.

    "Document1": "How FedEx Drivers Optimize Their Routes (And Their Biggest Hurdle)\nZach Blank\nStraightaway\nFebruary 22, 2021\nOver the last 12 months, FedEx has done incredibly well due to the online shift from the COVID-19 pandemic. Shipping orders are rising, earnings are soaring, and the market cap is nearly double what it was at the start of 2020. More growth means more packages, more customers, and more deliveries. But in the delivery game, it is extremely difficult to stay on top.\nThe competition is thicker than ever, with Amazon, UPS, and the US Postal Service fighting to get every order and every delivery. Amazon is constantly pushing towards customer-centricity, which has driven so much of their success in the last decade. As a result, Amazon had one-third of all US online retail growth in 2020. The key to customer-centricity is timely delivery, without a doubt. Fast, reliable deliveries create loyal customers that will continue to use a certain service. For FedEx to continue their growth, delivery drivers not only have to compete with today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s juggernauts, but they also have to beat them.\nHow can delivery drivers keep up with the intense competition? Route Optimization Software.\nWhat is Route Optimization Software?\nThe best way for any delivery business, including FedEx, to stay on top is with software-driven routing. Software is a game-changer because it allows drivers to navigate their routes without having to worry about changing traffic and road-conditions. For those not familiar, think Google Maps or Waze built specifically for delivery companies.\nRoute optimization software can poll thousands of data points at once to determine if the driver is going to make all their deliveries in time, and if not, it can use this vast pool of data to re-route the driver and save the day. For delivery drivers, the implications of route optimization software are crucial:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Time saved with dynamic routing\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 More customers served, more packages delivered\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Lower mileage, leading to savings on gas\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Longer life for delivery vehicles\nThe list goes on. But the takeaway is clear. When delivery drivers start using route optimization software, their routes are better, their customers are happier, and their business can continue to grow.\nConsidering all of these benefits, the impact of route optimization software at FedEx would be nothing short of transformational. FedEx delivery would not only soar to the top of the delivery market, but it would continue to dominate and lead the world.\nBut what is the reality of FedEx\u00e2\u0080\u0099s route optimization software?\nFedEx DRO At Work\nFedEx DRO, which stands for Dynamic Route Optimization, is the standard-issue route optimization software given to FedEx drivers. FedEx DRO was released in 2019 to great anticipation and excitement. Drivers had been eagerly awaiting a tool much like UPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Orion or Amazon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rabbit, something that can help them make their deliveries faster, smoother, and easier.\nHowever, since DRO has been released, it has failed to live up to the expectations of FedEx drivers. The software has instead created more problems than it set out to solve, and become a pain-point and headache for FedEx drivers. One employee even shared that FedEx DRO let managers assign 8 full hours of deliveries for drivers, not giving them the chance to use the restroom, grab a snack, or fill up on gasoline. Consistently, online reviews highlight the limitations of FedEx DRO, which acts as a roadblock instead of a greenlight.\nThe impact of poor route optimization software is significant. Instead of saving time and getting packages to customers quickly, drivers are now navigating a mess, trying to stay on top of bigger delivery manifests. In this situation, though all of FedEx suffers, drivers bear most of the burden. When deliveries take longer than they should, drivers lose valuable time from their personal lives working to meet deadlines.\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nWhat Can FedEx Drivers Do\nFor FedEx drivers, there are two paths forward. Drivers can either stick with DRO, or look for something else.\nFor the FedEx drivers staying with DRO, they may be able to help the software turn the corner and become competitive. But, such a challenge will require time and energy on behalf of the driver. Patiently waiting to give feedback on DRO, dealing with bugs day-to-day, and spending extra hours to make up for delays and issues during the day is horrible for the drivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experience. The worst part with all this frustration and difficulty is that the customer will take notice before long.\nOr, drivers can find an alternative. The market for route optimization software is only growing, and there are several apps they can use today. We even did a comparison of these apps for drivers, check it out. One of the best options for FedEx drivers is Straightaway.\nStraightaway is built from the ground-up for delivery drivers, using powerful technologies like OCR and Machine Learning to give them every edge they need on the road. FedEx drivers only have to take a photo of their day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manifest, and Straightaway takes care of the rest. Route planning and sequence are all done automatically, and drivers can add stops or re-arrange them with complete ease, so if they need to grab a bite or fill up at the pump, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no problem at all. With all of this, drivers save an average of an hour every day on their route.\nOne of the best parts of Straightaway? Feedback. For any delivery driver, Straightaway takes feedback seriously. No waiting for slow updates, no lengthy review process. Straightaway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engineering teams want to know the specific problems drivers face, and make the app better and better. Once a driver starts using Straightaway, it's hard to stop. The service, the ease-of-use, and the reliability is next level.\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nConclusion\nWhile making it to the top is incredible, staying on top is incredibly difficult. For FedEx, the successes of the last 12 months require innovative and clever thinking across all levels of the company, especially delivery drivers. FedEx DRO may have been considered the end-all be-all solution for route optimization, but reality tells a different tale, and for drivers that accounts to real losses in time and money.\nThe good news is that all hope is not lost. FedEx drivers can save time, money, and energy by moving to a third-party service, like Straightaway, today. It is faster, more reliable, and built just for drivers. FedEx\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs are only growing, and for FedEx drivers, every minute wasted matters in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delivery market. For drivers everywhere, start saving time and changing your delivery game. Start using Straightaway.\nLike this article?

    "Document2": "How Long Does DHL Take to Deliver? [DHL Delivery Time]\nEvery time you need to deliver a package, DHL never fails to come to mind. It\u2019s because DHL is a global leader in the logistics industry. But how long does DHL take to deliver?\nDHL\u2019s delivery time varies because it greatly depends on several factors. Among these are the type of product to deliver and the destination. For neighboring countries, delivery time can take 2 to 3 days. Whereas, for countries with long distances, it can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services typically indicate the expected delivery time on their websites.\nRead on to learn more about how long does DHL take to deliver and other topics related to it.\nHow Long Does DHL Take to Deliver?\nDHL delivery for neighboring countries usually takes 2 to 3 days. DHL delivery for countries with long distances can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services normally post the expected delivery time on their websites.\nDHL International GmbH, or simply DHL, is a global express mail, package delivery, and courier service. It delivers more than a billion parcels annually and ships to over 200 countries daily.\nThis logistics company is greatly recognized for its reliability in delivering products and services. It is also known for offering competitive rates in terms of international shipments.\nDHL Delivery Times\nTo answer your question on how long does DHL Express take to deliver, they follow three timelines:\nThe process for all these timelines is basically the same. But let me briefly explain each one of them.\nUnder this timeline, DHL Express performs a door-to-door delivery on or before 9:00 AM. If you don\u2019t receive the package, you have the right to get your money back. All you have to do is to coordinate with DHL Express Customer Support.\nWith the DHL Express at 10:30, expect a door-to-door delivery on or before 10:30 AM. So, if the package does not arrive, you have the right to get your money back. Contact DHL Customer Support to know how to go about this.\nAs for the DHL Express 12:00, you will receive your door-to-door delivery package on or before 12:00 noon. Similarly, you have the right to get your money back if the package is not delivered to you. All you have to do is to contact DHL Customer Support and coordinate with them.\nDHL follows a strict process before parcels are delivered. The delivery time depends on the place of origin and the destination of the delivery. Also, before delivering the package, DHL practices due diligence to ensure that the items to be delivered are all legal. They then determine the exact cost of the package and then queue it for shipping.\nHow long does DHL Express take to deliver? In most cases, it takes them 4 to 5 days to deliver an international package. But if you\u2019re wondering how long it takes DHL to ship from China to the United States, it usually takes 2 to 3 days.\nHowever, in case you don\u2019t want to get the express services of DHL, the delivery time will be a little longer. Some deliveries can take up to 20 days or even a month.\nAside from the place of origin and destination, there are other factors affecting delivery time. These include the shape, size, and type of the item inside the package. Suffice it to say that these are also the factors affecting delivery cost.\nDHL Domestic and International Shipping Time\nFor domestic deliveries, shipping typically takes roughly 3 to 8 business days. This applies to standard shipping.\nAs for DHL\u2019s international shipping, the standard shipping takes approximately 1 to 3 weeks. At the same time, its expedited shipping takes 4 to 12 business days. Again, the delivery time depends on several factors.\nDHL Delivery Delays\nDHL follows strict timelines to make sure that all packages are delivered on time. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that cause delays in deliveries. These circumstances include bad weather conditions and traffic, among others.\nWhen these situations occur, DHL makes sure that its customers are informed and are warned that there may be some delays. You may also visit the DHL website to get updated about their latest advisories.\nDHL Domestic Shipping\nDomestic delivery times and delivery rates are posted on the DHL website.\nDHL offers different types of domestic deliveries based on weight.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Over the last 12 months, FedEx has seen significant growth due to the online shift from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the competition with Amazon, UPS, and the US Postal Service is intense. To stay competitive, FedEx has implemented route optimization software, specifically FedEx DRO (Dynamic Route Optimization), released in 2019. This software was expected to improve delivery efficiency by saving time, serving more customers, reducing mileage, and extending vehicle life. However, FedEx DRO has not met drivers' expectations, often causing more problems than it solves. Drivers report issues such as being assigned 8 full hours of deliveries without breaks, leading to delays and frustration. As a result, drivers lose valuable personal time and customers notice the delays. FedEx drivers have two options: continue using DRO and hope for improvements or switch to alternative route optimization software like Straightaway. Straightaway offers features like OCR and Machine Learning, allowing drivers to take a photo of their manifest and have routes planned automatically. It also allows for easy adjustments and saves drivers an average of an hour daily. Straightaway's focus on feedback and continuous improvement makes it a strong alternative for FedEx drivers looking to save time and improve efficiency.",

DHL Delivery Times To answer your question on how long does DHL Express take to deliver, they follow three timelines: The process for all these timelines is basically the same. But let me briefly explain each one of them. Under this timeline, DHL Express performs a door-to-door delivery on or before 9:00 AM. If you don\u2019t receive the package, you have the right to get your money back. All you have to do is to coordinate with DHL Express Customer Support. With the DHL Express at 10:30, expect a door-to-door delivery on or before 10:30 AM. So, if the package does not arrive, you have the right to get your money back. Contact DHL Customer Support to know how to go about this. As for the DHL Express 12:00, you will receive your door-to-door delivery package on or before 12:00 noon. Similarly, you have the right to get your money back if the package is not delivered to you. All you have to do is to contact DHL Customer Support and coordinate with them. DHL follows a strict process before parcels are delivered. The delivery time depends on the place of origin and the destination of the delivery. Also, before delivering the package, DHL practices due diligence to ensure that the items to be delivered are all legal. They then determine the exact cost of the package and then queue it for shipping. How long does DHL Express take to deliver? In most cases, it takes them 4 to 5 days to deliver an international package. But if you\u2019re wondering how long it takes DHL to ship from China to the United States, it usually takes 2 to 3 days. However, in case you don\u2019t want to get the express services of DHL, the delivery time will be a little longer. Some deliveries can take up to 20 days or even a month. Aside from the place of origin and destination, there are other factors affecting delivery time. These include the shape, size, and type of the item inside the package. Suffice it to say that these are also the factors affecting delivery cost. DHL Domestic and International Shipping Time For domestic deliveries, shipping typically takes roughly 3 to 8 business days. This applies to standard shipping. As for DHL\u2019s international shipping, the standard shipping takes approximately 1 to 3 weeks. At the same time, its expedited shipping takes 4 to 12 business days. Again, the delivery time depends on several factors. DHL Delivery Delays DHL follows strict timelines to make sure that all packages are delivered on time. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that cause delays in deliveries. These circumstances include bad weather conditions and traffic, among others. When these situations occur, DHL makes sure that its customers are informed and are warned that there may be some delays.

    "Document1": "How FedEx Drivers Optimize Their Routes (And Their Biggest Hurdle)\nZach Blank\nStraightaway\nFebruary 22, 2021\nOver the last 12 months, FedEx has done incredibly well due to the online shift from the COVID-19 pandemic. Shipping orders are rising, earnings are soaring, and the market cap is nearly double what it was at the start of 2020. More growth means more packages, more customers, and more deliveries. But in the delivery game, it is extremely difficult to stay on top.\nThe competition is thicker than ever, with Amazon, UPS, and the US Postal Service fighting to get every order and every delivery. Amazon is constantly pushing towards customer-centricity, which has driven so much of their success in the last decade. As a result, Amazon had one-third of all US online retail growth in 2020. The key to customer-centricity is timely delivery, without a doubt. Fast, reliable deliveries create loyal customers that will continue to use a certain service. For FedEx to continue their growth, delivery drivers not only have to compete with today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s juggernauts, but they also have to beat them.\nHow can delivery drivers keep up with the intense competition? Route Optimization Software.\nWhat is Route Optimization Software?\nThe best way for any delivery business, including FedEx, to stay on top is with software-driven routing. Software is a game-changer because it allows drivers to navigate their routes without having to worry about changing traffic and road-conditions. For those not familiar, think Google Maps or Waze built specifically for delivery companies.\nRoute optimization software can poll thousands of data points at once to determine if the driver is going to make all their deliveries in time, and if not, it can use this vast pool of data to re-route the driver and save the day. For delivery drivers, the implications of route optimization software are crucial:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Time saved with dynamic routing\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 More customers served, more packages delivered\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Lower mileage, leading to savings on gas\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Longer life for delivery vehicles\nThe list goes on. But the takeaway is clear. When delivery drivers start using route optimization software, their routes are better, their customers are happier, and their business can continue to grow.\nConsidering all of these benefits, the impact of route optimization software at FedEx would be nothing short of transformational. FedEx delivery would not only soar to the top of the delivery market, but it would continue to dominate and lead the world.\nBut what is the reality of FedEx\u00e2\u0080\u0099s route optimization software?\nFedEx DRO At Work\nFedEx DRO, which stands for Dynamic Route Optimization, is the standard-issue route optimization software given to FedEx drivers. FedEx DRO was released in 2019 to great anticipation and excitement. Drivers had been eagerly awaiting a tool much like UPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Orion or Amazon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rabbit, something that can help them make their deliveries faster, smoother, and easier.\nHowever, since DRO has been released, it has failed to live up to the expectations of FedEx drivers. The software has instead created more problems than it set out to solve, and become a pain-point and headache for FedEx drivers. One employee even shared that FedEx DRO let managers assign 8 full hours of deliveries for drivers, not giving them the chance to use the restroom, grab a snack, or fill up on gasoline. Consistently, online reviews highlight the limitations of FedEx DRO, which acts as a roadblock instead of a greenlight.\nThe impact of poor route optimization software is significant. Instead of saving time and getting packages to customers quickly, drivers are now navigating a mess, trying to stay on top of bigger delivery manifests. In this situation, though all of FedEx suffers, drivers bear most of the burden. When deliveries take longer than they should, drivers lose valuable time from their personal lives working to meet deadlines.\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nWhat Can FedEx Drivers Do\nFor FedEx drivers, there are two paths forward. Drivers can either stick with DRO, or look for something else.\nFor the FedEx drivers staying with DRO, they may be able to help the software turn the corner and become competitive. But, such a challenge will require time and energy on behalf of the driver. Patiently waiting to give feedback on DRO, dealing with bugs day-to-day, and spending extra hours to make up for delays and issues during the day is horrible for the drivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experience. The worst part with all this frustration and difficulty is that the customer will take notice before long.\nOr, drivers can find an alternative. The market for route optimization software is only growing, and there are several apps they can use today. We even did a comparison of these apps for drivers, check it out. One of the best options for FedEx drivers is Straightaway.\nStraightaway is built from the ground-up for delivery drivers, using powerful technologies like OCR and Machine Learning to give them every edge they need on the road. FedEx drivers only have to take a photo of their day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manifest, and Straightaway takes care of the rest. Route planning and sequence are all done automatically, and drivers can add stops or re-arrange them with complete ease, so if they need to grab a bite or fill up at the pump, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no problem at all. With all of this, drivers save an average of an hour every day on their route.\nOne of the best parts of Straightaway? Feedback. For any delivery driver, Straightaway takes feedback seriously. No waiting for slow updates, no lengthy review process. Straightaway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engineering teams want to know the specific problems drivers face, and make the app better and better. Once a driver starts using Straightaway, it's hard to stop. The service, the ease-of-use, and the reliability is next level.\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nConclusion\nWhile making it to the top is incredible, staying on top is incredibly difficult. For FedEx, the successes of the last 12 months require innovative and clever thinking across all levels of the company, especially delivery drivers. FedEx DRO may have been considered the end-all be-all solution for route optimization, but reality tells a different tale, and for drivers that accounts to real losses in time and money.\nThe good news is that all hope is not lost. FedEx drivers can save time, money, and energy by moving to a third-party service, like Straightaway, today. It is faster, more reliable, and built just for drivers. FedEx\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs are only growing, and for FedEx drivers, every minute wasted matters in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delivery market. For drivers everywhere, start saving time and changing your delivery game. Start using Straightaway.\nLike this article?

    "Document2": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024\nOne thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them.\nTo that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe.\nThis is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers.\nFastest speeds ever in 2023\nWe achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service.\nIn the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them.\nAnd we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEven faster delivery speeds in 2024\nAfter reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019.\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever:\n1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers\nWe\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow.\nLast year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024.\nAround the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster.\nAs part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient.\n2.\u00a0Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally\nAmazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day.\nWe know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT.\nIn December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey.\nFor services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix.\n3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies\nWe\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.\nWe\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location.\nMany years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.\nSign up for the weekly Amazon newsletter\nWhat is Amazon Day Delivery?

    "Summarized_Document1": "Over the last 12 months, FedEx has seen significant growth due to the online shift from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the competition with Amazon, UPS, and the US Postal Service is intense. To stay competitive, FedEx has implemented route optimization software, specifically FedEx DRO (Dynamic Route Optimization), released in 2019. This software was expected to improve delivery efficiency by saving time, serving more customers, reducing mileage, and extending vehicle life. However, FedEx DRO has not met drivers' expectations, often causing more problems than it solves. Drivers report issues such as being assigned 8 full hours of deliveries without breaks, leading to delays and frustration. As a result, drivers lose valuable personal time and customers notice the delays. FedEx drivers have two options: continue using DRO and hope for improvements or switch to alternative route optimization software like Straightaway. Straightaway offers features like OCR and Machine Learning, allowing drivers to take a photo of their manifest and have routes planned automatically. It also allows for easy adjustments and saves drivers an average of an hour daily. Straightaway's focus on feedback and continuous improvement makes it a strong alternative for FedEx drivers looking to save time and improve efficiency.",

    "Document1": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024\nOne thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them.\nTo that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe.\nThis is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers.\nFastest speeds ever in 2023\nWe achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service.\nIn the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them.\nAnd we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEven faster delivery speeds in 2024\nAfter reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019.\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever:\n1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers\nWe\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow.\nLast year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024.\nAround the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster.\nAs part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient.\n2.\u00a0Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally\nAmazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day.\nWe know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT.\nIn December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey.\nFor services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix.\n3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies\nWe\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.\nWe\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location.\nMany years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.\nSign up for the weekly Amazon newsletter\nWhat is Amazon Day Delivery?

    "Document2": "How Long Does DHL Take to Deliver? [DHL Delivery Time]\nEvery time you need to deliver a package, DHL never fails to come to mind. It\u2019s because DHL is a global leader in the logistics industry. But how long does DHL take to deliver?\nDHL\u2019s delivery time varies because it greatly depends on several factors. Among these are the type of product to deliver and the destination. For neighboring countries, delivery time can take 2 to 3 days. Whereas, for countries with long distances, it can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services typically indicate the expected delivery time on their websites.\nRead on to learn more about how long does DHL take to deliver and other topics related to it.\nHow Long Does DHL Take to Deliver?\nDHL delivery for neighboring countries usually takes 2 to 3 days. DHL delivery for countries with long distances can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services normally post the expected delivery time on their websites.\nDHL International GmbH, or simply DHL, is a global express mail, package delivery, and courier service. It delivers more than a billion parcels annually and ships to over 200 countries daily.\nThis logistics company is greatly recognized for its reliability in delivering products and services. It is also known for offering competitive rates in terms of international shipments.\nDHL Delivery Times\nTo answer your question on how long does DHL Express take to deliver, they follow three timelines:\nThe process for all these timelines is basically the same. But let me briefly explain each one of them.\nUnder this timeline, DHL Express performs a door-to-door delivery on or before 9:00 AM. If you don\u2019t receive the package, you have the right to get your money back. All you have to do is to coordinate with DHL Express Customer Support.\nWith the DHL Express at 10:30, expect a door-to-door delivery on or before 10:30 AM. So, if the package does not arrive, you have the right to get your money back. Contact DHL Customer Support to know how to go about this.\nAs for the DHL Express 12:00, you will receive your door-to-door delivery package on or before 12:00 noon. Similarly, you have the right to get your money back if the package is not delivered to you. All you have to do is to contact DHL Customer Support and coordinate with them.\nDHL follows a strict process before parcels are delivered. The delivery time depends on the place of origin and the destination of the delivery. Also, before delivering the package, DHL practices due diligence to ensure that the items to be delivered are all legal. They then determine the exact cost of the package and then queue it for shipping.\nHow long does DHL Express take to deliver? In most cases, it takes them 4 to 5 days to deliver an international package. But if you\u2019re wondering how long it takes DHL to ship from China to the United States, it usually takes 2 to 3 days.\nHowever, in case you don\u2019t want to get the express services of DHL, the delivery time will be a little longer. Some deliveries can take up to 20 days or even a month.\nAside from the place of origin and destination, there are other factors affecting delivery time.

Again, the delivery time depends on several factors.\nDHL Delivery Delays\nDHL follows strict timelines to make sure that all packages are delivered on time. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that cause delays in deliveries. These circumstances include bad weather conditions and traffic, among others.\nWhen these situations occur, DHL makes sure that its customers are informed and are warned that there may be some delays.

Even faster delivery speeds in 2024 After reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019. Here\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever: 1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers We\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow. Last year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024. Around the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster. As part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient. 2. Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally Amazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day. We know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT. In December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey. For services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix. 3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies We\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas. We\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location. Many years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Every time you need to deliver a package, DHL never fails to come to mind. It\u2019s because DHL is a global leader in the logistics industry. But how long does DHL take to deliver? DHL\u2019s delivery time varies because it greatly depends on several factors. Among these are the type of product to deliver and the destination. For neighboring countries, delivery time can take 2 to 3 days. Whereas, for countries with long distances, it can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services typically indicate the expected delivery time on their websites. Read on to learn more about how long does DHL take to deliver and other topics related to it. How Long Does DHL Take to Deliver? DHL delivery for neighboring countries usually takes 2 to 3 days. DHL delivery for countries with long distances can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services normally post the expected delivery time on their websites. DHL International GmbH, or simply DHL, is a global express mail, package delivery, and courier service. It delivers more than a billion parcels annually and ships to over 200 countries daily. This logistics company is greatly recognized for its reliability in delivering products and services. It is also known for offering competitive rates in terms of international shipments. DHL Delivery Times To answer your question on how long does DHL Express take to deliver, they follow three timelines: The process for all these timelines is basically the same. But let me briefly explain each one of them. Under this timeline, DHL Express performs a door-to-door delivery on or before 9:00 AM. If you don\u2019t receive the package, you have the right to get your money back. All you have to do is to coordinate with DHL Express Customer Support. With the DHL Express at 10:30, expect a door-to-door delivery on or before 10:30 AM. So, if the package does not arrive, you have the right to get your money back. Contact DHL Customer Support to know how to go about this. As for the DHL Express 12:00, you will receive your door-to-door delivery package on or before 12:00 noon. Similarly, you have the right to get your money back if the package is not delivered to you. All you have to do is to contact DHL Customer Support and coordinate with them. DHL follows a strict process before parcels are delivered. The delivery time depends on the place of origin and the destination of the delivery. Also, before delivering the package, DHL practices due diligence to ensure that the items to be delivered are all legal. They then determine the exact cost of the package and then queue it for shipping. How long does DHL Express take to deliver? In most cases, it takes them 4 to 5 days to deliver an international package. But if you\u2019re wondering how long it takes DHL to ship from China to the United States, it usually takes 2 to 3 days. However, in case you don\u2019t want to get the express services of DHL, the delivery time will be a little longer. Some deliveries can take up to 20 days or even a month. Aside from the place of origin and destination, there are other factors affecting delivery time. These include the shape, size, and type of the item inside the package. Suffice it to say that these are also the factors affecting delivery cost. DHL Domestic and International Shipping Time For domestic deliveries, shipping typically takes roughly 3 to 8 business days. This applies to standard shipping. As for DHL\u2019s international shipping, the standard shipping takes approximately 1 to 3 weeks. At the same time, its expedited shipping takes 4 to 12 business days. Again, the delivery time depends on several factors. DHL Delivery Delays DHL follows strict timelines to make sure that all packages are delivered on time. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that cause delays in deliveries. These circumstances include bad weather conditions and traffic, among others. When these situations occur, DHL makes sure that its customers are informed and are warned that there may be some delays.

    "Document1": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024\nOne thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them.\nTo that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe.\nThis is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers.\nFastest speeds ever in 2023\nWe achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service.\nIn the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them.\nAnd we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEven faster delivery speeds in 2024\nAfter reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019.\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever:\n1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers\nWe\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow.\nLast year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024.\nAround the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster.\nAs part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient.\n2.\u00a0Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally\nAmazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day.\nWe know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT.\nIn December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey.\nFor services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix.\n3.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024. One thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them. To that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. This is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers. Fastest speeds ever in 2023 We achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service. In the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022. We focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them. And we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023. Even faster delivery speeds in 2024 After reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019. Here\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever: 1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers We\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow. Last year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024. Around the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster. As part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient. 2. Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally Amazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day. We know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT. In December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey. For services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix. 3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies We\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas. We\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies.

    "Document1": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024\nOne thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them.\nTo that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe.\nThis is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers.\nFastest speeds ever in 2023\nWe achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service.\nIn the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them.\nAnd we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEven faster delivery speeds in 2024\nAfter reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019.\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever:\n1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers\nWe\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow.\nLast year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024.\nAround the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster.\nAs part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient.\n2.\u00a0Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally\nAmazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day.\nWe know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT.\nIn December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey.\nFor services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix.\n3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies\nWe\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.\nWe\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location.\nMany years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.\nSign up for the weekly Amazon newsletter\nWhat is Amazon Day Delivery?

Whereas, for countries with long distances, it can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services typically indicate the expected delivery time on their websites.\nRead on to learn more about how long does DHL take to deliver and other topics related to it.\nHow Long Does DHL Take to Deliver?\nDHL delivery for neighboring countries usually takes 2 to 3 days. DHL delivery for countries with long distances can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services normally post the expected delivery time on their websites.\nDHL International GmbH, or simply DHL, is a global express mail, package delivery, and courier service. It delivers more than a billion parcels annually and ships to over 200 countries daily.\nThis logistics company is greatly recognized for its reliability in delivering products and services. It is also known for offering competitive rates in terms of international shipments.\nDHL Delivery Times\nTo answer your question on how long does DHL Express take to deliver, they follow three timelines:\nThe process for all these timelines is basically the same.

If you don\u2019t receive the package, you have the right to get your money back. All you have to do is to coordinate with DHL Express Customer Support.\nWith the DHL Express at 10:30, expect a door-to-door delivery on or before 10:30 AM. So, if the package does not arrive, you have the right to get your money back. Contact DHL Customer Support to know how to go about this.\nAs for the DHL Express 12:00, you will receive your door-to-door delivery package on or before 12:00 noon. Similarly, you have the right to get your money back if the package is not delivered to you. All you have to do is to contact DHL Customer Support and coordinate with them.\nDHL follows a strict process before parcels are delivered. The delivery time depends on the place of origin and the destination of the delivery. Also, before delivering the package, DHL practices due diligence to ensure that the items to be delivered are all legal. They then determine the exact cost of the package and then queue it for shipping.\nHow long does DHL Express take to deliver? In most cases, it takes them 4 to 5 days to deliver an international package. But if you\u2019re wondering how long it takes DHL to ship from China to the United States, it usually takes 2 to 3 days.\nHowever, in case you don\u2019t want to get the express services of DHL, the delivery time will be a little longer. Some deliveries can take up to 20 days or even a month.\nAside from the place of origin and destination, there are other factors affecting delivery time.

Again, the delivery time depends on several factors.\nDHL Delivery Delays\nDHL follows strict timelines to make sure that all packages are delivered on time. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that cause delays in deliveries. These circumstances include bad weather conditions and traffic, among others.\nWhen these situations occur, DHL makes sure that its customers are informed and are warned that there may be some delays.

In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023. Even faster delivery speeds in 2024 After reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019. Here\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever: 1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers We\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow. Last year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024. Around the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster. As part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient. 2. Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally Amazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day. We know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT. In December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey. For services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix. 3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies We\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas. We\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location. Many years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Every time you need to deliver a package, DHL never fails to come to mind. It\u2019s because DHL is a global leader in the logistics industry. But how long does DHL take to deliver? DHL\u2019s delivery time varies because it greatly depends on several factors. Among these are the type of product to deliver and the destination. For neighboring countries, delivery time can take 2 to 3 days. Whereas, for countries with long distances, it can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services typically indicate the expected delivery time on their websites. Read on to learn more about how long does DHL take to deliver and other topics related to it. How Long Does DHL Take to Deliver? DHL delivery for neighboring countries usually takes 2 to 3 days. DHL delivery for countries with long distances can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services normally post the expected delivery time on their websites. DHL International GmbH, or simply DHL, is a global express mail, package delivery, and courier service. It delivers more than a billion parcels annually and ships to over 200 countries daily. This logistics company is greatly recognized for its reliability in delivering products and services. It is also known for offering competitive rates in terms of international shipments. DHL Delivery Times To answer your question on how long does DHL Express take to deliver, they follow three timelines: The process for all these timelines is basically the same. But let me briefly explain each one of them. Under this timeline, DHL Express performs a door-to-door delivery on or before 9:00 AM. If you don\u2019t receive the package, you have the right to get your money back. All you have to do is to coordinate with DHL Express Customer Support. With the DHL Express at 10:30, expect a door-to-door delivery on or before 10:30 AM. So, if the package does not arrive, you have the right to get your money back. Contact DHL Customer Support to know how to go about this. As for the DHL Express 12:00, you will receive your door-to-door delivery package on or before 12:00 noon. Similarly, you have the right to get your money back if the package is not delivered to you. All you have to do is to contact DHL Customer Support and coordinate with them. DHL follows a strict process before parcels are delivered. The delivery time depends on the place of origin and the destination of the delivery. Also, before delivering the package, DHL practices due diligence to ensure that the items to be delivered are all legal. They then determine the exact cost of the package and then queue it for shipping. How long does DHL Express take to deliver? In most cases, it takes them 4 to 5 days to deliver an international package. But if you\u2019re wondering how long it takes DHL to ship from China to the United States, it usually takes 2 to 3 days. However, in case you don\u2019t want to get the express services of DHL, the delivery time will be a little longer. Some deliveries can take up to 20 days or even a month. Aside from the place of origin and destination, there are other factors affecting delivery time. These include the shape, size, and type of the item inside the package. Suffice it to say that these are also the factors affecting delivery cost. DHL Domestic and International Shipping Time For domestic deliveries, shipping typically takes roughly 3 to 8 business days. This applies to standard shipping. As for DHL\u2019s international shipping, the standard shipping takes approximately 1 to 3 weeks. At the same time, its expedited shipping takes 4 to 12 business days. Again, the delivery time depends on several factors. DHL Delivery Delays DHL follows strict timelines to make sure that all packages are delivered on time. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that cause delays in deliveries. These circumstances include bad weather conditions and traffic, among others. When these situations occur, DHL makes sure that its customers are informed and are warned that there may be some delays.

    "Document1": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024\nOne thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them.\nTo that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe.\nThis is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers.\nFastest speeds ever in 2023\nWe achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service.\nIn the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them.\nAnd we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEven faster delivery speeds in 2024\nAfter reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019.\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever:\n1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers\nWe\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow.\nLast year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024.\nAround the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster.\nAs part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient.\n2.\u00a0Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally\nAmazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day.\nWe know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT.\nIn December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey.\nFor services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix.\n3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies\nWe\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.\nWe\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location.\nMany years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.\nSign up for the weekly Amazon newsletter\nWhat is Amazon Day Delivery?

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024. One thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them. To that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. This is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers. Fastest speeds ever in 2023 We achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service. In the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022. We focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them. And we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023. Even faster delivery speeds in 2024 After reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019. Here\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever: 1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers We\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow. Last year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024. Around the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster. As part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient. 2. Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally Amazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day. We know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT. In December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey. For services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix. 3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies We\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.

No matter where, no matter when, there is always something that could and likely will impact the group\u2019s supply chain.\nMotter\u2019s predecessors at Group Logistics also dealt with disruptions. Employees at Volkswagen Konzernlogistik, as it is incorporated in Germany, have long worked in close collaboration with plants, brand logistics, procurement and manufacturing teams to keep delivery and production stable. Group Logistics was also already responsible for prioritising and allocating critical inventory, when necessary, where decisions needed to be made across plants and brands.\n\u201cIn logistics, we have become more relevant and able to influence decisions, both in terms of ensuring stability, but also in terms of costs and emissions.\u201d\u2013Simon Motter, Volkswagen Group Logistics\nHowever, scarcity in supply and capacity has intensified the need for this central steering and collaboration. At the worst points of supply shortages, Group Logistics was orchestrating daily supply and production decisions, notably in a taskforce for semiconductors. Motter says that extreme volatility has turned \u201ccrisis management into day-to-day operations\u201d for his team and all logistics functions in the group. They now have a better grip on key supply chain requirements and have adapted processes and tools to support them, even taking direct control of transport capacity where required.\nAnd the results have paid off. Whilst there are still risks in semiconductor supply, the situation is much more stable. For vehicle logistics, which has faced more than 18 months of bottlenecks, delivery performance in Europe has considerably improved, helping the Volkswagen Group to a strong delivery volume at the end of 2023.\n\nDigitalising and designing the supply chain\nSource: Volkswagen\nGroup Logistics is helping to lead on strategic initiatives, including automating and digitalising processes, and influencing supplier, sourcing and manufacturing decisions\nMeanwhile, crises which would have previously caused production stoppages and delivery shortages, including widespread transport-related strikes in Germany and diversions from Red Sea shipping routes, have led to few disruptions thus far. Motter credits these results to better anticipation and finding alternatives earlier in production, supply and transport, as well as better communication with stakeholders. For vehicle logistics, Group Logistics has worked with its partners to secure more capacity directly where needed. In the response to the Red Sea issues, the company has not only diverted ships \u2013 material for Volkswagen factories has even been trucked from China to Europe.\nBut whilst this task-force orientation has brought Group Logistics deeper into the layers of the supply chain, Simon Motter knows that it will be just as important to keep Volkswagen Group\u2019s supply chain resilient over the long term. Motter believes strongly that logistics should be involved at the earliest stages of product and sourcing decisions, and thus help to ensure that changes to the production network avoid unnecessary cost, risk and emissions.\n\u201cIn logistics, we have become more relevant and able to influence decisions, both in terms of ensuring stability, but also in terms of costs and emissions,\u201d he says.\nThat influence has been increasingly evident across strategic priorities, including ramping up battery electric vehicle volumes, meeting sustainability targets and controlling costs. For example, Group Logistics has worked with plants in Zwickau and Braunschweig, Germany and Mlada Boleslav, Czech Republic to develop and implement an automated loading system to handle and transport battery modules by rail, which it will expand this year. Experts from Group Logistics have also worked closely with the carmaker\u2019s PowerCo battery cell subsidiary, helping to choose locations and develop the infrastructure and requirements for the gigafactory it is building in Salzgitter and those it has confirmed to launch in Spain and Canada.\n\u201cThat is one of the best things that can happen for us as a logistics organisation \u2013 that we are able to redesign something, and that is exactly what we are doing for electrification and batteries with our production network, our processes and technologies,\u201d says Motter.\n\nSecuring a sustainable future\nSource: MAN\nVolkswagen Group Logistics is working with partners, including group truckmaker MAN and its logistics providers, to implement the first electric trucks into its logistics network in Germany this year\nGroup Logistics is also using lower emission transport and encouraging logistics providers to use greener technology and alternative fuels. This year it will see the first full electric trucks go into operation for Volkswagen\u2019s material logistics in its collecting service network, which for example will see one of its partner in Germany, Duvenbeck, using e-trucks from MAN, also part of the Volkswagen Group.\nAlong with zero emission technology, Motter emphasises \u2018defossilisaiton\u2019 of its logistics operations, including for deep-sea shipping. This year, Group Logistics, which has long-term charters of pure-car-and-truck carriers (PCTCs), will continue to bring into operation in total four new dual fuel LNG ships, which will also have capabilities to use other, lower emission technology and fuels.\nDigitalisation has also been one of Motter\u2019s strategic pillars for gaining supply chain resilience, whether implementing microservices in transport systems, analysing the potential of artificial intelligence applications or leading on enterprise-wide changes. For example, Group Logistics is deeply involved in moving from legacy systems in inbound logistics to a cloud-based, SAP 4/Hana ERP that will eventually cover operations such as transport order management, warehouse, yard and plant logistics. Group Logistics is leading on the project, called \u2018ONE Log\u2019, which includes more than 200 cross-functional employees on the integration across production, plant logistics, IT and finance.\nMotter is also looking at global opportunities to improve logistics performance. In North America, where Volkswagen is adding new products across existing operations in the US and Mexico and new plants both for PowerCo and its new EV truck brand, Scout, he has supported initiatives with local brand entities to deepen existing synergies in the region.\n\nOliver Bronder, head of vehicle logistics at Volkswagen Group Logistics, will be a keynote speaker at Automotive Logistics and Supply Chain Europe, March 19-21 in Bonn, Germany. The conference will feature major OEMs, suppliers and industry experts discussing how to leverage logistics as a competitive advantage. Find out more and register to join.Find out more and register for ALSC Europe\nRecent spikes in logistics costs and risks have emphasised just how important visibility and holistic planning have become for complex supply chains. With uncertainty in the economy and the pace of EV demand, and rising competition among established and newer players in Europe, including from China, carmakers like Volkswagen will have to make considerable savings to remain competitive. Motter admits that will include significant efforts to reduce logistics costs.\nBut he also sees this objective as an opportunity for supply chain leaders to exert greater influence on strategic decision, including where it makes sense to localise supply chains. \u201cIf the individual logistics costs rise, as they have in almost every index across the industry including for Volkswagen, then we have to think about different levers, from the choice of transport carriers to sourcing,\u201d he says.\nGroup Logistics is increasingly involved in identifying those levers. For new products and projects, it now develops what it calls \u2018ideal logistics\u2019 \u2013 an outline of what the most efficient supply chain and infrastructure would look like for an efficient logistics flow. This \u2018ideal\u2019 then becomes a basis to measure and compare with other objectives across procurement, finance and production. \u201cWe then go into discussion. For example, logistics would want to ensure that we have large modules located in a park that is connected to the assembly line with conveyor technology, or to have key suppliers able to deliver from close distances,\u201d Motter says.\nCompromises are always necessary, however the arguments for localisation and other logistics considerations are coming to the fore. \u201cThere are costs and efficiency reasons to consider, but increasingly also sustainability and resiliency reasons \u2013 and on these points our voice is being heard,\u201d Motter says.\nGroup Logistics: seeking synergies, governing standards, building consensus\n Volkswagen Konzernlogistik GmbH, or Group Logistics, is a limited liability company based in Wolfsburg, Germany, wholly owned by Volkswagen Group. With more than 800 employees, it is the central and coordinating organisation of the group\u2019s logistics, but with a special set of functions ranging from the highly operational \u2013 including managing PCTC fleets and a returnable packaging network \u2013 to setting processes and standards across the entire group\u2019s logistics.\n\nSimon Motter, head of Volkswagen Group Logistics\u00a0\nSource: Volkswagen\nSimon Motter took over as managing director of Volkswagen Konzernlogistik (Group Logistics) in January 2021 after working across logistics and plant functions since 1999, mainly with Audi\nSimon Motter has been managing director and head of Group Logistics since January 2021, leading the full scope of the organisation. He previously held a range of logistics roles at Audi, including as head of international logistics, material logistics at Audi\u2019s engine plant in Hungary, and most recently as head of plant logistics for the carmaker\u2019s plant in Ingolstadt, Germany. Motter reports to Christian Vollmer, board member for production at Volkswagen.\nEach brand of the Volkswagen Group is responsible for programme planning and logistics flows across their own plants, with factories usually responsible for plant logistics. Group Logistics, meanwhile, manages international material and vehicle logistics, along with synergies across multiple brands and shared suppliers. In Europe, where the group has the most plants and largest volume, Group Logistics operates material logistics, container management and vehicle logistics as a joint network, including cross-brand network design and forward planning, and the use of logistics digitalisation tools. Group Logistics also manages cross-company steering of critical parts and inventory. During the chip crisis, for example, it allocated chip supply based on company-wide priorities.\nAs a limited company, Group Logistics is responsible for purchasing and contracting for material and vehicle logistics services across Europe, and cross-regional flows. It also directly charters ro-ro ships, especially for Europe-North America trade.\nIt is a scope that continues to evolve. Recently, Group Logistics incorporated used car logistics into its European operations. During recent vehicle logistics capacity shortages, it chartered and commissioned vehicle logistics carriers across the continent as well.\nMotter emphasises the \u2018governance\u2019 role among the most important for Group Logistics, such as setting network structures, standards and best practice, as well as coordinating cross-brand and functional projects. \u201cIt makes absolute sense that our brands and plants have their own logistics, but we want to find synergies, and to do that we need to find cooperation models to define common standards, which is such an important task,\u201d says Motter.\n\u201cIt makes absolute sense that our brands and plants have their own logistics, but we want to find synergies, and to do that we need to find cooperation models to define common standards, which is such an important task.\u201d \u2013Simon\u00a0Motter, Volkswagen Group Logistics\nThis cooperation is often developed in working groups, in which a Group Logistics manager brings together leaders and experts from brand logistics, plants and other functions in a \u2018group management circle\u2019. These groups meet regularly to align on synergies and opportunities, as well as to settle political and technical issues. It\u2019s a consensus-building body, but also one that uses tools and data to advise and take critical decisions where necessary, for example on logistics infrastructure, inventory and network design.\nWhile the group has direct responsible for international transports, it does not usually take operational roles in global regions. Here, however, the governance role is important for developing standards and sharing best practice across entities. However, with the growth of key overseas regions, Group Logistics and its partner entities are aligning more closely.\n\nDeveloping global synergies\nSource: Volkswagen\nWhilst in Europe Group Logistics take direct resonsibilities for many areas of material, vehicle logistics and packaging, globally it has more of a governance role. However, it is increasingly working with regions and local entities to collaborate across the network\nIn China, for example, where Volkswagen Group operates across joint ventures with different Chinese companies, there is no single, countrywide shared logistics network. However, its JVs are exploring common logistics efficiencies, including establishing a returnable container management network closely modelled on the setup and system that Group Logistics runs in Europe, according to Motter.\nIn North America, Motter and Group Logistics are directly supporting regional efforts to find cross-brand and cross-country synergies. Volkswagen Group companies are building new factories, including for the Scout EV truck brand in South Carolina and battery cell maker PowerCo in Canada. Volkswagen Group is also investing across existing factories in the US and Mexico for Volkswagen and Audi, as well as commercial vehicle brands Navistar and Volkswagen Truck & Bus.\nWhilst regional logistics and brand teams remain responsible for logistics in these regions, Group Logistics has done network studies on the region\u2019s material logistics and production networks. At the Automotive Logistics & Supply Chain Mexico conference in November 2023, leaders from regional logistics leaders, together with Group Logistics head of global transport networks Christoph Hartmann, highlighted opportunities including cross-border flows, crossdocking, less-than-truckload and container management. The regional brands are currently planning tenders for some combined logistics services in the region.\n\u201cIt is precisely our job in Group Logistics to exercise global governance on the one hand, and to leverage synergies concretely,\u201d says Motter.\nThe synergy analysis is currently focused on material logistics and containers, but could expand to vehicle logistics within North America, where there are shared responsibilities between Volkswagen Group of America, and different brands in Mexico. But the company has yet to determine the pace of such developments, says Motter.\u00a0\nHe also does not rule out the possibility that the group would eventually incorporate an entity in North America like Group Logistics in Germany, which could bundle certain services together. \u201cThe question arises, of course, but there is no definitive answer yet, as the business model may need to be different,\u201d Motter says. \u201cBut we believe that sharing networks, as we do here in Europe, makes sense in North America.\n\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s important to take the first steps and to get concrete results, and then go forward from there,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nTopics\nVolkswagen Group Logistics series: Simon Motter on securing the supply chain\nHow Group Logistics is overcoming crises and shaping Volkswagen's future supply chain\nReady for any crisis, anywhere in Volkswagen Group\u2019s supply chain\nThe electrifying influence of logistics\nThe many roads, fuels and tech leading to zero emission logistics at Volkswagen Group\nThe quest for one source of truth in Volkswagen Group\u2019s digital supply chain\nRelated articles\n\nVolkswagen Group\u2019s North America vehicle logistics approach saves cost and delivery time\n\n\n2024-06-17T14:04:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nVolkswagen relies on localisation in Europe for EV project\n\n\n2024-06-03T11:11:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nHoerndlein to lead vehicle logistics for Volkswagen Group Logistics; Bronder moves to SAIC JV\n\n\n2024-05-29T15:43:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nOn the right track for rail investment\n\n\n2024-05-03T15:08:00Z\n\n\nBy Marcus Williams\n\n\nDuvenbeck switches to biogas for ZF\n\n\n2024-03-12T10:49:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nDuvenbeck expands into Benelux through Schotpoort Logistics takeover\n\n\n2024-03-04T15:30:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\nNo comments yet\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nMore Volkswagen\n\nLogistics in another dimension for SAIC VW in China\n\n\n2022-06-06T21:00:00Z\nBy Marcus Williams and  Christopher Ludwig\n\nSusanne Lehmann, who leads logistics at SAIC Volkswagen, reveals how the JV has managed lockdowns in China and is advancing digitalisation and supply partnerships\n\nVW opens IT centre in Dresden\n\n\n2019-06-26T10:41:00Z\nBy Steve Garnsey\n\nGerman carmaker\u00a0Volkswagen\u00a0(VW)\u00a0has opened a new\u00a0production software development centre (SDC) at\u00a0its\u00a0showcase\u00a0Gl\u00e4serne Manufaktur\u00a0site in Dresden\u2026\n\nVolkswagen Group part 2: Talking \u2018then and now\u2019 with head of group logistics, Thomas Zernechel\n\n\n2017-10-10T13:09:00Z\nBy Christopher Ludwig\n\nThe group\u2019s head of group logistics talks about the major changes seen over the past two decades \u2013 and why he is optimistic about the future of logistics\nAutomotive Logistics is the leading resource for automotive logistics and supply chain professionals globally.\n\nJoin today to access Automotive Logistics\u2019 wealth of global news, insights, intelligence and to make important connections across the automotive industry.\n\n\nJoin today to access Automotive Logistics\u2019 wealth of global news, insights, intelligence and to make important connections across the automotive industry.\n\nYour free registration includes:\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud\n",

    "Summarized_Document2": "Volkswagen Group Logistics, under the leadership of Simon Motter since January 2021, has significantly improved its resilience to supply chain disruptions. The company has faced numerous crises, including semiconductor shortages, shipping schedule misalignments, and supplier impacts due to geopolitical events. Despite these challenges, Volkswagen has managed to stabilize its supply chain through digitalization, investment, and effective partner management. The company operates across 115 plants and collaborates with 8,100 suppliers globally.Key strategies include the digitalization of processes, direct control of transport capacity, and better communication with stakeholders. For instance, during the semiconductor shortage, Volkswagen's Group Logistics orchestrated daily supply and production decisions, which helped stabilize the situation. The company has also implemented automated loading systems for battery modules and is working on electrification and sustainability initiatives, such as introducing electric trucks and dual-fuel LNG ships.Group Logistics plays a crucial role in strategic decisions, influencing costs, emissions, and supply chain stability. The organization is involved in early stages of product and sourcing decisions to avoid unnecessary risks and costs. It also focuses on 'defossilization' of logistics operations and is exploring the use of artificial intelligence and cloud-based systems for better supply chain management.In North America, Volkswagen is expanding its operations with new factories and investments in existing ones. Group Logistics is supporting these efforts by identifying synergies and optimizing logistics networks. The company is also exploring the possibility of establishing a similar logistics entity in North America to bundle services and improve efficiency.Overall, Volkswagen Group Logistics has become more relevant in influencing strategic decisions, ensuring stability, and controlling costs and emissions. The organization continues to evolve, incorporating new technologies and practices to maintain a resilient and efficient supply chain.",

The retailer\u2019s unit delivery costs from a sortation center are about 20 percent lower than the average, the CFO said during the company\u2019s Wednesday earnings call. Mass merchants appear to be figuring out how to optimize these expenses as they scale their logistics networks, with Walmart saying just days earlier that it slashed delivery costs per order nearly 40 percent year over year.\n\n\tIn 2024, Target\u2019s sortation centers have processed 19 percent more packages than the year-to-date period in 2023.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThis was the plan all along for Target, which is spending $100 million on the sortation project to bolster its last-mile delivery capabilities. The facilities are designed to serve a different purpose than the company\u2019s legacy distribution centers, in that they\u2019re positioned farther downstream from the retailer\u2019s stores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShuffle Board: Fair Trade Founder Departs, Target Names CFO\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025 Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShuffle Board: Fair Trade Founder Departs, Target Names CFO\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025 Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tThe sortation centers provide another direct, but often unheralded benefit to Target, Fiddelke noted. Processing space is freed up in the stores the facility serves in the individual market, while saving labor costs in those locations as well.\n\n\tTarget is opening its 11th sortation center this month, debuting it in Detroit. The warehouse is expected to process up to 60,000 packages daily by 2028, while operating in a \u201csmaller-than-average\u201d footprint, according to Fiddelke.\n\n\tLast year, the Minneapolis-based retailer outlined a goal to operate at least 15 sortation centers by the end of 2026.\n\n\t\u201cBeyond growth in the number of these facilities, our existing sort centers continue to ramp up their capacity, and we\u2019re finding new ways to integrate them into our broader network,\u201d said Fiddelke. \u201cFor example, our recently opened sort center in Chicago will be feeding the Detroit sortation center, increasing the number of packages eligible for next-day delivery in that market.\u201d\n\n\tTarget is also cutting down fulfillment costs from both within the warehouse and the store by using fewer brown boxes for packaging.\n\n\t\u201cThe most expensive thing we do in fulfilling product is shipping a brown box,\u201d said Fiddelke, who noted that the retail giant cut costs in the area primarily by better aligning inventory with expected demand.\n\n\t\u201cWe have to split shipments frequently,\u201d said Fiddelke. \u201cThe core productivity within those processes, big improvements in our stores team, and how we delivering that product more efficiently as we pick and pack in the stores\u2014that work adds up. And the teams have been at it for multiple quarters now, and we\u2019re seeing it pay off.\n\n\tTarget\u2019s e-commerce business saw 8.7 comparable sales growth in the quarter, outpacing the 0.7 percent comparable sales growth for stores. But the demand for faster delivery and pickup options is clearly working in the company\u2019s favor.\n\n\tAccording to Target CEO Brian Cornell, same-day services saw double-digit growth that surpassed the digital sales growth.\n\n\tThe Drive Up curbside pickup service and the membership-based Target Circle 360 same-day delivery offering both grow roughly 14 percent each.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSame-day services now account for more than two-thirds of e-commerce sales, with the biggest contribution coming from Drive Up, which generated sales of more than $2 billion in the second quarter and more than $4 billion so far this year.\n\n\t\u201cThe thing we see when people engage with Drive Up and with Circle 360 same-day delivery, is that their in-store shopping actually increases after they become users of those services,\u201d Fiddelke said. \u201cAnd so, continue to watch that relationship closely and growth of those services means growth in our share of wallet as the consumers that use those services.\u201d\n\n\tThe digital sales jump for Target is promising, as it was the largest individual increase for the company since the second quarter of 2022, when online comparable sales growth jumped 9 percent. The metric increased just 1.4 percent from the year prior in the first quarter.\n\n\tAcross the company, Target saw total revenue increase 2.7 percent to $25.5 billion on net income of $1.2 billion\u2014a 42.7 percent improvement from the year prior. Comparable store sales increased 2 percent year over year, with traffic growing 3 percent in the period.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Newsletters\n\t\n\t\nReceive Our Daily Newsletter & Special Offers\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Recommends\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAAFA Calls on Biden to Intervene in East Coast Port\u00a0Talks\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChain Reaction: John Singleton of Wen-Parker Logistics on Navigating Post-Pandemic Supply Chain\u00a0Disruptions\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2018A Very Difficult Moment\u2019 for Retail: How Could A Change to De Minimis Impact Shippers\u2019\u00a0Costs?\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025\u00a0Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSJ Newsletters\t\t\n\t\n\nGet the news straight to your inbox\n\n\n\t\n\t\tVideos\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIs Your Cotton Safe?

    "Document2": "Advertisement\nIHL Study: Inventory Distortion Will Cost Retailers $1.77 Trillion in 2023\nInventory distortion, whether it\u2019s out-of-stocks or overstocks, are a huge and costly challenge for retailers and suppliers, and too often a source of great inconvenience to consumers. A recent study by IHL Group projects that the global cost of inventory distortion in 2023 will be $1.77 trillion \u2014 bigger than the combined retail GDP of all of Latin America. But as ghastly as this figure is, it is down by $172 billion from 2022.\nThe spike in inventory distortion does need to be put into historical context. According to the report, titled Inventory Distortion: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, \u201cTo be fair, the last few years could be said to be the most challenging years in modern retailing, starting with COVID lockdowns that caused massive shortages, causing retailers to overstock merchandise as economies reopened only to have an unexpected war that created millions of refugees, rapid energy price inflation and the largest supply country [China] remaining in lockdowns.\u201d\nInventory distortion, which is equivalent to 7.2% of retail sales, has multiple causes, including inaccurate demand planning, lack of inventory visibility and inadequate staff training. The report cited vendor issues as the primary driver of both out-of-stocks and overstocks in 2023, contributing $417.7 billion, \u201cbut down $174 billion and after 2022 showing tremendous improvement in product availability,\u201d according to the report. \u201cTheft has contributed $379 billion this year: nearly $203 billion by consumers and approximately $175 billion by employees.\nNorth America\u2019s Retail Problems are \u2018Ugly\u2019\nThe IHL study examined inventory distortion in four global regions: EMEA, Latin America, Asia/Pacific and North America. While the first three regions all achieved modest but measurable single-digit declines in out-of-stocks between 2022 and 2023, in North America out-of-stocks increased 17.7% \u2014 and the report blames retail theft for a large portion of this jump.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe primary drivers of this increase [in North America] are empty shelves, which have risen by 22.8% ($29.6 billion),\u201d said the report. \u201cThe supply chain has stabilized, but now a new (well, not really new) problem has reared its ugly head in the form of an increase in organized retail crime (ORC) that has more than negated other improvements. While a problem across the U.S., the issue is particularly acute in major cities in California, Oregon, Washington and New York, leading to retailers locking up most, if not all merchandise or removing stores altogether.\u201d IHL estimates the cost of ORC in the U.S. alone at $100 billion.\nNorth American retailers\u2019 labor struggles also are having an outsize impact in the region. Incidents of customers unable to find an associate to help them increased 36.3% this year over 2022, compared to just a 10% increase worldwide. Even when associates were available, customers who \u201cfound someone but couldn\u2019t find the item\u201d increased by 17.6% in North America, compared to just 1.4% worldwide.\nSome Good News: Overstocks Improve 23.1%\nEven factoring in North America\u2019s challenges, retailers in all four global regions were able to improve inventory distortion by an average of 8.9% this year. Reductions in overstocks have been a big help, improving 23.1% this year compared to last. \u201cThe radical shock to the world economy from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 found many retailers who had stocked up for post-COVID \u2018revenge buying\u2019 stuck with the wrong merchandise for a tighter consumer and higher energy prices,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThis has mostly been worked through and demonstrates that retailers are becoming more effective in managing their inventory levels and avoiding excessive stockpiling in 2023.\u201d\nSupplier-related issues, while still problematic, are headed in the right direction, declining by $174 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. \u201cWe expect this to continue to improve and thankfully many of the issues are targeted at specific products and not as systemic as they have been during the last three years,\u201d according to the report.\nAI Could Help Lessen Inventory Distortion\nIHL is bullish on the ability of AI and machine learning to mitigate inventory distortion\u2019s impact, and forecasts that generative AI will only improve its capabilities. The report predicts that retailers could improve their gross margins by 25% or more by 2029 \u201cif they were able to fully take advantage of all the benefits that AI can provide.\u201d\nThe report noted that AI can help tackle inventory distortion by improving demand forecasting: \u201cAI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data from multiple sources, such as sales data, customer trends, social media and external factors like weather and events. By identifying patterns and correlations, AI can generate more accurate demand forecasts.\u201d\nWith AI-powered inventory optimization systems, retailers can streamline their supply chains. \u201cThese systems consider multiple factors, including lead times, supplier performance, transportation costs and demand fluctuations, to determine optimal replenishment schedules. By automating this process and considering real-time data, AI can minimize stockouts and overstocks, manage safety stocks, consider sellable and non-sellable supply buckets and reduce the likelihood of further inventory distortion.\u201d\nThe report also noted that the most advanced AI solutions can realize savings by using analysis \u201cto route online orders to stores with merchandise most likely to go on markdown while also considering the shipping cost. Similarly, these system can optimize which stores can fulfill the complete orders to maximize margins and optimize sustainability rather than shipping from multiple locations.\u201d\nWhile inventory distortion continues to be a monumental problem, the industry has made progress in a number of areas. But the job is far from over: \u201cWhile retail sales were rapidly growing post-COVID the cost of overstocks and out-of-stocks could be put on the back burner due to even greater increases in sales,\u201d according to the report. \u201cBut as the world economy has slowed, fixing inventory issues is all the more critical to preserving or improving the bottom line.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMaximizing Retail Success Using Location Intelligence\u200b\u00a0\n\u2018Tis the Season to Get a Jumpstart on Your Holiday Marketing Plans\nNo Video, No Sales!

    "Summarized_Document1": "Target\u2019s second-quarter sales increase was accompanied by faster delivery speeds due to the expansion of sortation centers. According to Michael Fiddelke, Target\u2019s COO and CFO, local orders processed through a sortation center arrive more than one day faster than the company\u2019s network average. Additionally, unit delivery costs from a sortation center are about 20 percent lower than the average. In 2024, Target\u2019s sortation centers have processed 19 percent more packages than the same period in 2023. Target is investing $100 million in the sortation project to enhance last-mile delivery capabilities. These facilities are positioned farther downstream from the retailer\u2019s stores, freeing up processing space and saving labor costs in those locations. Target is opening its 11th sortation center in Detroit, expected to process up to 60,000 packages daily by 2028. The company aims to operate at least 15 sortation centers by the end of 2026. The sortation centers are also helping to cut fulfillment costs by using fewer brown boxes for packaging. Target\u2019s e-commerce business saw 8.7 percent comparable sales growth in the quarter, with same-day services accounting for more than two-thirds of e-commerce sales. Drive Up curbside pickup service and Target Circle 360 same-day delivery both grew roughly 14 percent each. Same-day services generated more than $2 billion in sales in the second quarter and more than $4 billion so far this year.

    "Summarized_Document2": "IHL Study: Inventory Distortion Will Cost Retailers $1.77 Trillion in 2023\nInventory distortion, including out-of-stocks and overstocks, is a significant challenge for retailers and suppliers, costing an estimated $1.77 trillion globally in 2023, down $172 billion from 2022. The report, titled 'Inventory Distortion: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,' highlights the impact of recent global events such as COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, and supply chain disruptions.\n\nInventory distortion, accounting for 7.2% of retail sales, is caused by inaccurate demand planning, lack of inventory visibility, and inadequate staff training. Vendor issues are the primary driver, contributing $417.7 billion, down $174 billion from 2022. Theft also plays a significant role, costing $379 billion, with $203 billion attributed to consumers and $175 billion to employees.\n\nNorth America faces severe challenges, with out-of-stocks increasing by 17.7% from 2022 to 2023, largely due to retail theft. Empty shelves rose by 22.8% ($29.6 billion), and organized retail crime (ORC) costs in the U.S. alone are estimated at $100 billion. Labor issues also exacerbate the problem, with a 36.3% increase in incidents where customers couldn't find an associate and a 17.6% increase in cases where associates couldn't find the item.\n\nDespite these challenges, there is some good news. Overstocks improved by 23.1% in 2023, and overall inventory distortion decreased by an average of 8.9% across all regions. Supplier-related issues are also improving, with a $174 billion decline in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nAI and machine learning are seen as potential solutions to mitigate inventory distortion. AI can enhance demand forecasting by analyzing vast amounts of data and identifying patterns, leading to more accurate predictions. AI-powered inventory optimization systems can streamline supply chains, minimize stockouts and overstocks, and optimize replenishment schedules. Advanced AI solutions can also optimize order routing and fulfillment to maximize margins and sustainability.\n\nWhile progress has been made, the report emphasizes that addressing inventory issues is crucial for maintaining or improving the bottom line, especially as the global economy slows.",

    "Document1": "WBEZ\nChicagoans living near heavy-traffic corridors breathe the most polluted air\n\n\n      Maria Ines Zamudio\n    \n\n From\nWhen Irma Morales moved to Little Village nearly three decades ago, she vividly remembers the thin layer of dust blanketing the ground. The single mother of five lived about a mile from a coal plant.\n\"When I walked outside, my shoes would be covered with dust,\" Morales said in Spanish.\nMorales joined the 12-year community-led effort to close the Crawford Power Plant.\nHow does Chicago's air quality affect you? Share your story.\n\"We shut them down,\" said Morales, adding she was diagnosed with a brain tumor during the campaign. \"But for what? So they can bring more diesel trucks?\"\nThe plant closed in 2012 and was replaced by a 1 million-square-foot Target warehouse bringing an estimated hundreds of trucks per day to the neighborhood. Morales and other protesters tried to stop the development.\nEven the building process polluted the neighborhood. A botched implosion of a 378-foot smokestack from the old coal plant left her neighborhood blanketed in dust in April 2020.\n\"Why are you selling ... [our health] to the highest bidder?\" Morales asked of city officials, saying her neighborhood is basically a \"sacrifice zone\" for industry.\nIndeed, in one of the most wide-scale surveys of air quality in Chicago, some stretches of this mostly Mexican community were found to have the highest pollution levels in the city, along with portions of Austin, Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Irving Park and Avondale that see heavy traffic or are near industrial areas, an analysis of readings from newly-installed air sensors show.\nThe data is supplied by Microsoft, which consulted with the city and community groups before installing 115 of the sensors mostly on CTA bus shelters last summer, and has been collecting readings from them every five minutes over the past 10 months.\nEven with more than 100 sensors, it's not nearly enough to cover the entire city and that inhibits a complete analysis of pollution for large swaths of the Southeast and Far South sides \u2014 areas long known to have poor air quality. Still, the data provide some of the most extensive hyperlocal measurements of air quality in Chicago, specifically in the high-pollution months of July through October 2021.\nThis story is part of a monthslong reporting collaboration on Chicago's air quality by the Sun-Times, WBEZ and MuckRock.\nThe newsrooms' analysis found that the worst air pollution levels among areas with sensors were recorded last year near the following locations:\nalong 26th Street near Central Park and California avenues, and near the intersection of California and Cermak in Little Village;\nat two locations along streets near the Kennedy Expressway in Irving Park and Avondale;\nat six locations in Austin, with the highest near a bus stop at Chicago and Cicero avenues;\nand along Halsted near 74th Street in Englewood and 87th in Auburn Gresham.\nResidents who live in these areas are exposed to high levels of air pollution known as particulate matter 2.5 \u2014 tiny material made up of many chemicals and other contaminants \u2014 that can lodge deep in the lungs and cause serious health problems. The pollutants measure 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller, which make them a fraction of the diameter of a human hair.\nFine particulate matter is the single largest environmental contributor to death and is linked to a number of health problems, including heart and lung disease and asthma. An estimated 5% of all premature deaths in Chicago can be attributed to particle pollution. Health experts compare the harm of breathing these particle pollutants to cigarette smoking.\nTens of thousands of diesel trucks travel in and out of the city's industrial corridors on a daily basis, transportation experts say, and they are a known source of particle pollution.\nChicago's poor air quality, and many of its hotspots, have been well-known to residents for decades. But the new data reveal the gulfs between neighborhoods. For example, levels of pollution in these hotspots are consistently higher than in neighborhoods that abut the lakefront on the North Side, including Lincoln Park, Lake View, Uptown and Rogers Park. The Microsoft data also provides other insights into air quality in Chicago.\nThe worst time of day for particle pollution readings, at least in Little Village, was the 6 p.m. evening rush hour \u2014 although 6 a.m. was also bad.\nBut even days when most people aren't working can be hazardous. The Fourth of July and other holidays \u2014 when many people clog the roads to vacation, attend barbecues or other events \u2014 ranked among the most heavily polluted days of the year.\nBut it was Friday, July 23, 2021, a 90-degree day, with wildfire smoke plumes arriving from the West, that stood out as one of the year's worst days for particulate matter. Wildfire smoke, hot temperatures and stagnant air worsen air pollution, including both ozone and particulate matter.\nTo be sure, the sensors are not as precise as the high-quality monitors used by the Environmental Protection Agency to take readings and set policy.\nAnd there may be blind spots in the data on the Far South and heavily industrial Southeast sides, where the EPA monitors almost 250 facilities for air pollution.\nMicrosoft said in a statement that it was limited by a lack of bus shelters and gaps in cell tower connectivity that prevented devices on the Southeast Side from reporting readings. In a statement, the company said it is working on improving antenna placements.\nChicago's air is improving but still harmful to the most vulnerable\nParticulate matter pollution has dropped over the past 20 years, largely thanks to government efforts, including programs under the federal Clean Air Act, to reduce harmful emissions from trucks, cars and power plants.\nThe levels in Chicago currently do not exceed standards set by the EPA, which maintains an annual average limit of 12 micrograms per cubic meter of fine particle pollution. But critics say that standard is way too high and the agency is expected to lower that maximum concentration this year. The World Health Organization says the level should be no higher than 5 micrograms per cubic meter, though health experts say no level of particulate matter is safe.\n\"Even a little particulate matter in the air is going to trigger asthma attacks and heart attacks, put people with lung and heart disease and other chronic diseases in the hospital and cause premature deaths,\" said Brian Urbaszewski, director of environmental health policy at the Respiratory Health Association in Chicago. It also can contribute to birth complications, developmental and mental health issues and cognitive decline.\nChicago's particle pollution is in addition to the smog, or ozone pollution, we breathe, resulting in among the worst levels of pollution in the country, the American Lung Association said last month.\nCritics have said EPA standards and methodology for collecting particle pollution data are flawed. The large spaces between sensors \u2014 there are just a dozen official sensors in Cook County \u2014 provide limited data. The agency also uses computer modeling to assess pollution levels in the city where there are no sensors.\n\"If you rely on EPA monitors, you will miss quite a few hotspots,\" said Yang Liu, department chair of Environment Health at Emory University.\nThe more sensors, the better\nIn a statement, the EPA said the Microsoft and other lower-grade monitors give a wider picture of air-quality in the area although they don't meet \"stringent regulatory criteria.\"\nChicago officials say they want to increase the number of air monitors in the city as part of a wider environmental impact study.\n\"The goal ultimately is to get more real-time, more hyperlocal data to help us make decisions,\" said Megan Cunningham, managing deputy commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health.\nThe city also is studying seven Southwest industrial corridors and the impact of truck traffic on safety and air pollution. While city economic development officials have promoted growth of transportation, distribution and logistics facilities in the area, the study is intended to address community concerns.\nTraffic is a known \"source of air pollution in Chicago,\" the city health department said in a statement. \"We are doing our part to provide guidance and health-based recommendations to other departments.\"\n\"People who live or work in urban areas ... have health issues\"\nEven though the sensors were largely on bus stops, pollution from a CTA bus alone isn't enough to cause the higher readings in the hotspots around the city. Microsoft said it placed the sensors in certain areas to account for both population and traffic.\nStill, heavy traffic is a potential source for the high readings in Avondale, where the sensor is located directly above the Kennedy Expressway on Addison Street, and in Irving Park, where the sensor is just west on a busy stretch of Irving Park Road. On average, more than 190,000 cars and trucks a day clog the expressway as it runs through the area.\nThe intersection of 87th and Halsted is heavily traveled with tens of thousands of cars, trucks and other vehicles driving through daily. The intersection is near two school bus depots where older, diesel-fuel vehicles contribute to air pollution. It's also near a Metra train station.\nFarther north at 74th and Halsted, there is less traffic but there are railroad tracks for freight trains nearby. That sensor was particularly high for the last two weeks of July and the first week of August.\nIn Austin, an air sensor on the bus shelter at West Chicago and North Cicero avenues is exposed to heavy traffic at the intersection of two major streets. Cicero is also U.S. Highway 50. The area is surrounded by light industry and a large construction project nearby.\nOnce a thriving community, the stretch of busy roads lacks trees and greenspace.\n\"Most people think those kind of [pollution] issues left when the vast majority of industry left,\" said the Rev. Joseph Kyles, who has been pastor at The Promise Church of Chicago for 17 years.\nKyles, who grew up in Austin but now lives in Oak Park, didn't know there was an air monitor at the bus shelter outside the church's front door. He wasn't surprised Austin ranked among the most polluted spots in the city.\n\"It's a known problem,\" said the 61-year-old Kyles, who had a double-lung transplant six years ago. \"People who live or work in urban areas are going to have health issues.\"\nStill, he notes that with the economic and social challenges and a lack of adequate health care in the Austin community, \"It's just one more thing.\"\nThough the sensors were placed within city limits, they could reveal implications for surrounding suburbs, towns and villages.\nOne example is Cicero, where more than 90% of the population is Hispanic and the air is impacted by similar industrial and diesel pollution to neighboring Little Village. Microsoft did not install any sensors in Cicero, but there are several on 26th Street just east of Cicero Avenue, which separates Cicero and Little Village, and several above Cicero in Austin on Laramie and Central avenues. Using surrounding sensors like these, the newsrooms' analysis suggests that high concentrations of particulate matter in Little Village are similarly high in Cicero.\nBack in Little Village, Morales says no one is listening to them. She's been organizing for decades to improve air quality.\n\"It feels like they don't care about our community even though we are homeowners and pay taxes,\" she said.\nMorales, who co-founded the community organization \u00danete La Villita, told neighbors last month during a vigil near the site of the botched implosion that it's important to transform outrage and frustration into activism.\n\"That anger is the fuel keeping some of us in the struggle,\" Morales said. \"It keeps us fighting for justice, accountability. We wanted and want a fair transition plan from the coal plant the community fought years to close down.\"\nOther community organizers agree it's beyond time for government officials to act.\nTiffany Werner, a community science organizer with the Environmental Law and Policy Center who has been a liaison between Microsoft and local community groups, urged the city to begin crafting policy changes, such as limiting the number of new warehouse facilities in a given area.\nThey say while the new data isn't perfect, there is no need to wait for additional studies about the city's hotspots.\n\"The information is already out there,\" said Alfredo Romo, executive director of the McKinley Park group Neighbors for Environmental Justice. \"It has gotten to the point \u2014 what is the city going to do with that information?\"\nIndi Khera of WBEZ and April Alonso and Irene Romulo of the Cicero Independiente contributed reporting.\nDillon Bergin and Smarth Gupta are reporters for MuckRock, a nonprofit collaborative newsroom that works on editorial projects with partners, and brings together journalists, researchers and the public on its news platform.

The new Microsoft data goes a step further.\nBetween April and July 2021, 115 sensors were installed across Chicago.\nThe first sensors were placed at EPA regulatory stations in May. An additional 100 sensors were installed in July, 80 of which were placed atop city bus shelters based on a random sampling of Chicago-area traffic and density data.\nTwenty sensors were placed in coordination with environmental justice groups. Microsoft is partnered with the Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago, which assembled a group of community organizations to weigh in on some sensor locations including Blacks In Green in West Woodlawn, BUILD Inc. in Austin representing the border West Side, Neighbors for Environmental Justice in McKinley Park, Latinos Progresando in Marshall Square and the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization.\nMicrosoft's leaf-shaped air quality sensors are solar-powered, cellular-connected devices that collect readings on fine particulate matter, PM2.5, humidity and barometric pressure.\nThey have air vents on the top and bottom and feed data using a connection to a Microsoft cloud service into a real-time website maintained by the tech company. The devices collect data on particulate matter using a Sensirion SPS30 sensor, which is among the best performing low-cost air quality sensors in lab and field tests.\nBut there are limitations.\nThe difference in data quality between the low-cost Microsoft sensors and regulatory-grade EPA monitors is large, said Zac Adelman, executive director of the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium. Microsoft's calibrated +/- 29% error rate is below the EPA Air Sensor guidebook's recommended threshold of +/- 30% but the large error rate of the raw particulate matter readings makes them difficult to rely on for hourly or daily figures by sensor.\nAnd there have been a handful of problems during the study: Some devices weren't able to get the cellular signal they needed. In the winter, devices \u2014 particularly those near tall buildings that block out sunlight \u2014 went into hibernation mode, resulting in lost data. In one instance, a sensor was stolen. One of the bus shelters where a sensor was located was destroyed in a car accident.\nThe temperature readings from the devices are largely inaccurate as the sensors overheated during hot days. The gaseous readings still need calibration before they can be used for analysis and thus were not released with the rest of the data.\nBut when the particulate matter readings are \"calibrated\" \u2014 compared to other sensors in the same network and EPA monitors for consistency \u2014 and compared to each other, they are revealing.\n\"What low-cost sensors tend to be good for is looking at patterns across time. Maybe the exact number isn't right, but you're seeing spikes or dips in the readings across time, or areas of higher or lower concentrations across an urban area \u2014 that's what I think we're seeing is really interesting with these sensors,\" Adelman said.\nThe sensors can also be used to fill in gaps where there aren't high quality expensive sensors, to identify spikes and hotspots, and to empower people with concerns about the air pollution in their neighborhoods, experts say. Microsoft said it is also working to create \"a suite of analytics \u2014 including anomaly detection methods \u2014 to better enable broader accessibility to the data.\"\nWhat we did to analyze Microsoft's air quality data\nMicrosoft gave us access to its Eclipse sensor data through the project's Application Programming Interface, or API. The API acts as a pipeline to the 115 sensors around Chicago and the information those sensors have recorded for 10 months \u2014 every five minutes, every hour of the day.\nIf all this data were placed into one spreadsheet, it would be more than 8 million rows.\nBecause of the massive amount of data, and the details in each reading, MuckRock and Columbia University's Brown Institute for Media Innovation, WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times aimed not to answer all questions at once, but one critical question first:\nIn each month since the sensors have been installed, what areas of Chicago have been PM2.5 pollution hotspots?\nTo do this, reporters stored the dataset in our own database, and then averaged sensor readings by hour, day and month. At each aggregation step, a so-called \"data completion criteria\" was applied to match the data quality standards laid out by the EPA for Hotspot Identification and Characterization. Any sensor's aggregated reading which had a sampling rate of less than 75% in the defined aggregation period was excluded. We also looked for hyperlocal correlations of these sensors and removed any sensor that had anomalous readings.\nAt this point, the collected readings still only showed the amount of PM2.5 recorded at each individual sensor.\nTo estimate how the reading of an individual sensor might explain pollution in specific neighborhoods, census tracts or community areas, reporters used a mathematical formula called Inverse Distance Weighting, or IDW. This is a popular interpolation technique, which makes use of the readings from all sensors at a given time, and uses those readings, based on the sensor's distance, to estimate the level of PM2.5 pollution in regions between sensors.\nThe reporters used this technique to estimate air quality levels at more than 50,000 uniformly distributed geocoordinates in the entire Chicago region and then generated tract level aggregated estimates. These estimates were then normalized based on the average estimated air quality in Chicago.\nWhile IDW is a popular approach for modeling the spread of pollution in neighborhoods, estimates are not as accurate in regions with few nearby sensors. Microsoft's research team also cautioned that interpolations outside the edges of the sample, like those in Cicero, will be more uncertain because the network was designed for the city of Chicago.\nEarlier this month, a project called ChiVes, housed at the Healthy Regions and Policies Lab at the University of Chicago, began visualizing weekly readings by sensor, census tract, and time of week. ChiVes has also collected dozens of sources to help scientists and community members explore environmental metrics alongside demographic, health and ecological data.\n\u00a9 2024 WBEZ\nQuestions or comments about the story?\n\nWBEZ values your feedback.\n        \nMore Local Stories From WBEZ\n\n                Johnny Pippins has earned bachelor's and master's degrees behind bars.

Mitigation strategies are, therefore, needed to reduce urban heat, particularly against a background of urbanization, anthropogenic warming and increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves. In this Review, we evaluate the potential of green infrastructure as a mitigation strategy, focusing on greenery on the ground (parks) and greenery on buildings (green roofs and green walls). Green infrastructure acts to cool the urban environment through shade provision and evapotranspiration. Typically, greenery on the ground reduces peak surface temperature by 2\u20139\u2009\u00b0C, while green roofs and green walls reduce surface temperature by ~17\u2009\u00b0C, also providing added thermal insulation for the building envelope. However, the cooling potential varies markedly, depending on the scale of interest (city or building level), greenery extent (park shape and size), plant selection and plant placement. Urban planners must, therefore, optimize design to maximize mitigation benefits, for example, by interspersing parks throughout a city, allocating more trees than lawn space and using multiple strategies in areas where most cooling is required. To do so, improved translation of scientific understanding to practical design guidelines is needed.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nRelevant articles\nOpen Access articles citing this article.\nImproved human greenspace exposure equality during 21st century urbanization\nNature Communications\nOpen Access\n13 October 2023\nSpatial\u2013temporal variation and temperature effect of urbanization in Guangdong Province from 1951 to 2018\nEnvironment, Development and Sustainability\nOpen Access\n27 March 2023\nNumerical evaluation of enhanced green infrastructures for mitigating urban heat in a desert urban setting\nBuilding Simulation\nOpen Access\n10 October 2022\nAccess options\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n$29.99 /\u00a030\u00a0days\ncancel any time\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 digital issues and online access to articles\n$99.00 per year\nonly $8.25 per issue\nRent or buy this article\nPrices vary by article type\nfrom$1.95\nto$39.95\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nReferences\nAkbari, H. & Kolokotsa, D.

    "Summarized_Document1": "When Irma Morales moved to Little Village nearly three decades ago, she noticed a thin layer of dust from a nearby coal plant. Morales joined a 12-year effort to close the Crawford Power Plant, which was replaced by a Target warehouse, bringing hundreds of diesel trucks daily. The neighborhood faced pollution from the building process, including a botched implosion in April 2020. A survey found Little Village, Austin, Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Irving Park, and Avondale had the highest pollution levels in Chicago. Microsoft installed 115 air sensors, collecting data every five minutes over 10 months, revealing high levels of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) in these areas. PM2.5 can cause serious health issues, including heart and lung disease. The worst pollution times were during rush hours and holidays, with July 23, 2021, being notably bad due to wildfire smoke and high temperatures. Despite improvements in air quality over 20 years, Chicago's levels still pose health risks. The EPA's standards are criticized for being too high, and more sensors are needed for accurate data. The city plans to increase air monitors and study the impact of truck traffic. Heavy traffic and industrial areas contribute to high pollution levels, affecting residents' health. Microsoft\u2019s sensors, though less precise than EPA monitors, provide valuable data on pollution patterns. The data helps identify hotspots and informs community activism for better air quality policies.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The absence of vegetation in urban areas contributes to the urban heat island effect, increasing thermal stress for residents and driving morbidity and mortality. Mitigation strategies are needed to reduce urban heat, especially with increasing urbanization, anthropogenic warming, and more frequent heatwaves. Green infrastructure, such as parks, green roofs, and green walls, can cool urban environments through shade and evapotranspiration. Ground-level greenery typically reduces peak surface temperatures by 2\u20139\u00b0C, while green roofs and walls can reduce surface temperatures by ~17\u00b0C and provide thermal insulation for buildings. The cooling potential varies based on city or building level, park shape and size, plant selection, and placement. Urban planners should optimize designs by interspersing parks, allocating more trees than lawn space, and using multiple strategies where cooling is most needed. Improved translation of scientific understanding to practical design guidelines is essential. Key references include studies on urban heat islands, mitigation technologies, and the impact of green spaces on urban temperatures.",

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website. Rent prices listed are averages and may not reflect the cost of specific units. Rental prices can vary depending on factors like size, location, amenities, and availability.\nHow Much Is Rent for a Studio Apartment in San Diego?\nOn average, expect to pay around $2,545 per month for a studio apartment in San Diego.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 1-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nThe average rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in San Diego is approximately $3,106 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 2-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nIn San Diego, a 2-bedroom apartment typically rents for around $3,926 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 3-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nA 3-bedroom apartment in San Diego will cost, on average, $4,754 per month.\nTransportation in San Diego\nSan Diego residents have a few popular choices when it comes to getting around the city, and the best option often depends on the trip and personal preferences:\nMTS: The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) operates a network of buses and trolleys that cover a large portion of the city. It's a convenient and affordable option, especially for commuting to and from work. The PRONTO card system allows for easy fare payment and transfers.\nCOASTER: The North County Transit District (NCTD) operates the COASTER commuter trains, which connect downtown San Diego with coastal towns to the north. This is a great option for residents who live along the coast or want a scenic ride.\nCar: While public transportation is good, many San Diegans still rely on cars for the ultimate flexibility. Traffic congestion can be a concern, though.\nRidesharing: Lyft and Uber are popular choices for on-demand rides, particularly for evening outings or trips that aren't well-served by public transportation.\nBiking and Walking: San Diego's weather makes biking and walking year-round possibilities. The city has invested in bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, making these attractive options for shorter trips.\nPet-Friendly Apartment Hunting in San Diego\nSan Diego doesn't have any city-wide restrictions on pets, so renting with a furry friend is up to the discretion of landlords. Here are some restrictions you might run into:\nThe good news? Major rental listing websites like Apartment List allow filtering by pet-friendliness. Simply select \u201cDog-Friendly\u201d or \u201cCat-Friendly\u201d in your preferences when you start your search.\nFAQs about Living in San Diego\nStill have questions about renting in San Diego? Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website. Rent prices listed are averages and may not reflect the cost of specific units. Rental prices can vary depending on factors like size, location, amenities, and availability.\nHow Much Is Rent for a Studio Apartment in San Diego?\nOn average, expect to pay around $2,545 per month for a studio apartment in San Diego.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 1-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nThe average rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in San Diego is approximately $3,106 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 2-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nIn San Diego, a 2-bedroom apartment typically rents for around $3,926 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 3-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nA 3-bedroom apartment in San Diego will cost, on average, $4,754 per month.\nTransportation in San Diego\nSan Diego residents have a few popular choices when it comes to getting around the city, and the best option often depends on the trip and personal preferences:\nMTS: The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) operates a network of buses and trolleys that cover a large portion of the city. It's a convenient and affordable option, especially for commuting to and from work. The PRONTO card system allows for easy fare payment and transfers.\nCOASTER: The North County Transit District (NCTD) operates the COASTER commuter trains, which connect downtown San Diego with coastal towns to the north. This is a great option for residents who live along the coast or want a scenic ride.\nCar: While public transportation is good, many San Diegans still rely on cars for the ultimate flexibility. Traffic congestion can be a concern, though.\nRidesharing: Lyft and Uber are popular choices for on-demand rides, particularly for evening outings or trips that aren't well-served by public transportation.\nBiking and Walking: San Diego's weather makes biking and walking year-round possibilities. The city has invested in bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, making these attractive options for shorter trips.\nPet-Friendly Apartment Hunting in San Diego\nSan Diego doesn't have any city-wide restrictions on pets, so renting with a furry friend is up to the discretion of landlords. Here are some restrictions you might run into:\nThe good news? Major rental listing websites like Apartment List allow filtering by pet-friendliness. Simply select \u201cDog-Friendly\u201d or \u201cCat-Friendly\u201d in your preferences when you start your search.\nFAQs about Living in San Diego\nStill have questions about renting in San Diego? Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website. Rent prices listed are averages and may not reflect the cost of specific units. Rental prices can vary depending on factors like size, location, amenities, and availability.\nHow Much Is Rent for a Studio Apartment in San Diego?\nOn average, expect to pay around $2,545 per month for a studio apartment in San Diego.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 1-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nThe average rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in San Diego is approximately $3,106 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 2-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nIn San Diego, a 2-bedroom apartment typically rents for around $3,926 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 3-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nA 3-bedroom apartment in San Diego will cost, on average, $4,754 per month.\nTransportation in San Diego\nSan Diego residents have a few popular choices when it comes to getting around the city, and the best option often depends on the trip and personal preferences:\nMTS: The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) operates a network of buses and trolleys that cover a large portion of the city. It's a convenient and affordable option, especially for commuting to and from work. The PRONTO card system allows for easy fare payment and transfers.\nCOASTER: The North County Transit District (NCTD) operates the COASTER commuter trains, which connect downtown San Diego with coastal towns to the north. This is a great option for residents who live along the coast or want a scenic ride.\nCar: While public transportation is good, many San Diegans still rely on cars for the ultimate flexibility. Traffic congestion can be a concern, though.\nRidesharing: Lyft and Uber are popular choices for on-demand rides, particularly for evening outings or trips that aren't well-served by public transportation.\nBiking and Walking: San Diego's weather makes biking and walking year-round possibilities. The city has invested in bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, making these attractive options for shorter trips.\nPet-Friendly Apartment Hunting in San Diego\nSan Diego doesn't have any city-wide restrictions on pets, so renting with a furry friend is up to the discretion of landlords. Here are some restrictions you might run into:\nThe good news? Major rental listing websites like Apartment List allow filtering by pet-friendliness. Simply select \u201cDog-Friendly\u201d or \u201cCat-Friendly\u201d in your preferences when you start your search.\nFAQs about Living in San Diego\nStill have questions about renting in San Diego? Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

    "Document1": "\n\nArticles\n\n\nApril 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\nAccording to the Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the small but meaningful affordability gains seen since the start of the year were eclipsed by a renewed rise in mortgage rates, fueled by stronger-than-expected inflation and employment readings in March and April.\u00a0\nWhile the nation\u2019s median list price did not increase compared with last year due to an influx of more affordable and smaller homes, the typical home\u2019s price per square foot continued to grow, and, driven by rising rates, the cost to purchase a home once again outpaced wage growth after just a one-month reprieve in March.\nMeanwhile, sellers continued to list homes at a greater rate than last year. This has led to a promising increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. In response, the time a typical home spends on the market continues to be below pre-pandemic levels\u2014but the gap is shrinking. Sellers are also continuing to adjust to market conditions, with price reductions remaining above the previous year\u2019s levels.\u00a0\nHome listing availability continues to improve in April\nThere were 30.4% more homes actively for sale on a typical day in April compared with the same time in 2023, marking the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth.\nFor the first four months of this year, the inventory of homes actively for sale was at its highest level since 2020. However, while inventory this April is much improved compared with the previous three years, it is still down 35.9% compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. This is a slight improvement compared with last month\u2019s 37.9% gap, as inventory continues to slowly improve toward normalcy.\n\nIn April, as in the previous two months, the growth in homes particularly priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range outpaced all other price categories, as home inventory in this range grew by 41.0% compared with last year, surpassing even last month\u2019s high 30.5% growth rate. As we show in the next section, this increase is primarily fueled by a greater availability of smaller and more affordable homes in the South.\nThe total number of homes for sale, including homes that were under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared with last year, growing on an annual basis for the fifth month in a row after ending a seven-month streak of annual total listing declines.\u00a0\n\nThe number of homes under contract but not yet sold (pending listings) increased by 6.3%, which is similar to last month\u2019s 6.2% growth rate. After reports of unexpectedly persistent inflation, mortgage rates increased in April on expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely push back its first cut to the primary policy rate, which was originally expected in June of this year.\nNext month, we may see the growth in pending listings slow, and as pending home sales are an early indicator of the direction of existing-home sales, it is possible that sales may decelerate further in April and May, after dipping 4.3% in March.\n\nHowever, providing a boost to overall inventory, which has been a drag on sales the past couple of years, sellers turned out in higher numbers this April as newly listed homes were 12.2% above last year\u2019s levels, matching last month\u2019s growth rate. This marked the sixth month of increasing listing activity after a 17-month streak of declines. However, sellers, of whom roughly three-quarters plan to also purchase a home, have been fairly rate-sensitive over this past year.\nIf mortgage rates remain elevated over the next few months, the housing market may see a return to the holding pattern of scarce inventory, as we\u2019ve seen over the past few years. For buyers, that could mean fewer opportunities for finding their ideal home as summer approaches.\u00a0\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends\nThe South leads the way in more affordable inventory growth\nThe South has been largely driving the increase in availability of homes in the $200,000 to $350,000 price range, and the increase in availability of homes overall. Home listings located in the South made up more than half (56.6%) of available inventory in April 2024, up from 52.0% last year and 47.7% in April 2019.\nIn April, all four regions saw active inventory grow over the previous year. The South saw listings grow by 43.0%, while inventory grew by 27.4% in the West, 17.6% in the Midwest, and only 4.0% in the Northeast.\nThe inventory of homes for sale increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros compared with last year. In seven large metros, inventory was above pre-pandemic levels. Metros that saw the most inventory growth included Tampa (+69.5%), Orlando (+64.2%), and Jacksonville (+59.1%). In large Florida metros, the inventory growth was primarily driven by an increase in the availability of attached homes (condos, townhomes, or row homes).\u00a0\nDespite higher inventory growth compared with last year, most metros still had a lower level of inventory compared with pre-pandemic years. Among the 50 largest metro areas, only seven saw higher levels of inventory in April compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. However, this is up from only four metros last month. The top metros that saw inventory surpass pre-pandemic levels were Austin (+28.9%), San Antonio (+27.4%), and Denver (+15.2%).\nThe South saw newly listed homes increase the most compared with last year\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South, by 19.7%, whereas new inventory grew by 18.4% in the West, 7.5% in the Midwest, and 2.9% in the Northeast.\nIn April, 48 of the 50 largest metros saw new listings increase over the previous year, but only three saw more newly listed homes than the typical April from 2017 to 2019. The metros that saw the largest growth in newly listed homes included Seattle (+46.5%), San Jose (+40.6%), and Austin (+36.1%), while Detroit (-3.8%) and Cincinnati (-1.6%) saw new listings decline. Only Austin (+18.8%), San Antonio (+2.6%), and Jacksonville (+1.6%) saw more new listings enter the market this April compared with typical pre-pandemic levels.\nHomes are spending slightly more time on the market compared with last year\u00a0\nThe typical home spent 47 days on the market this April, which is 1 day more than the same time last year and a week less than the average April from 2017 to 2019. April was the first month since September 2023 to see homes spend more time on the market than the previous year.\nMeanwhile, the gap between time on the market this year and typical pre-pandemic levels, while still present, is shrinking as inventory grows. The gap shrank from 12 days last month to just seven days this month.\n\nRegional and metro area time on the market trends\nThis month, not all regions saw the inventory of homes for sale spend less time on the market than last year. In the South, where the growth in home inventory has been the largest, the typical home spent two days more on the market in April compared with last year. However, in the Midwest, Northeast, and West, homes are still spending two days less on the market than last April.\nWhile all regions were still seeing time on the market below pre-pandemic levels, in the West, homes are spending only one day less on the market compared with the typical April from 2017 to 2019. Time on the market was nine days less than pre-pandemic levels in the South, 11 days less in the Midwest, and 15 days less in the Northeast.\nMeanwhile, time on the market decreased compared with last year in 26 of the 50 largest metro areas this April, down from 41 markets last month. It decreased the most in Kansas City (-15 days), Las Vegas (-11 days), and Raleigh (-10 days). Time on the market increased compared with last year in 21 of the 50 largest metros, including Hartford (+9 days), Denver (+8 days), Pittsburgh, and Phoenix (+5 days each). Ten predominantly Western markets saw homes spend more time on the market than typical 2017 to 2019 pre-pandemic timing, including Phoenix (+11 days), Seattle (+8 days), Denver, and Portland (+7 days each).\nThe median list price remained stable compared with last April, but the price per square foot continues to rise\nThe national median list price continued to increase seasonally, to $430,000 in April compared with $424,900 in March, and the median list price remained stable compared with the same time last year, when it was also $430,000.\u00a0\nCompared with last year, sellers are inching back to list more small and affordable homes, particularly in the South, and this change in the mix of available homes has kept the nation\u2019s median list price stable.\nWhile the median list price remained relatively unchanged, on an adjusted per-square-foot basis, the median list price grew by 3.8%, as homes continue to retain their value despite increased inventory compared with last year.\nMeanwhile, higher mortgage rates compared with last April still increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $148 (6.9%) compared with a year ago. This increased the required household income to purchase the median-priced home by $5,900, to $116,000, after also accounting for the cost of tax and insurance.\u00a0\nFor the past several months, growth in the monthly cost to purchase a home was slowing. However, the renewed mortgage rate growth seen in April has once again fueled an increase in the growth rate of the cost to purchase a home (+6.9% year over year). In March, average hourly earnings for private employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, grew by 4.1% annually. However, this increase is no longer outpacing the increase in the cost to purchase a home as it did last month.\n\nWhile the percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% in April of last year to 15.5% this year, the overall share of inventory is no longer historically high, as the share dipped back below pre-pandemic levels seen in 2017 and 2018 (15.8%, respectively).\nLast month we noted that sellers were adjusting to an increase in more competitive home listings. Indeed, a Realtor.com survey also showed that sellers have more realistic market expectations this year, with fewer potential sellers expecting a bidding war or sale within a week or sale above their asking price compared with last year. Yet while sellers continue to adjust expectations and are cutting prices at a greater rate than last year, when inventory levels were historically low, historical data shows that their behavior in adjusting prices is not unusual for pre-pandemic norms.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends\nIn April, listing prices remained stable on a year-over-year basis in the South (-0.1%), where competitive home inventory has grown the most, but prices continued to increase in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%) compared with the same time last year. On an adjusted per-square-foot basis, prices in all regions grew similarly, by 3.9% to 5.2%, as soft median list price growth in the South was driven by a larger inventory of affordable, smaller homes available for sale.\nThe median list price in Buffalo (+14.0%), Cleveland (+13.4%), and Rochester (+11.4%) saw the biggest increases among large metros. Meanwhile, 21 metros saw their median list price decline compared with last year, up from 18 last month. The metros included Miami (-10.7%), San Francisco (-10.7%), and Kansas City (-8.3%). However, on a price-per-square-foot basis, listing prices in Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City declined only by 6.6%, 2.8%, and 4.3%, respectively, as the mix of listing inventory consisted of smaller homes relative to the previous year.\nNotably, 34 of the 50 largest metro areas required a household income of more than $100,000 to afford the median-priced home at current interest rates, and six even required a household income of more than $200,000. Midwestern metros were commonly among the 16 remaining metro areas that required a household income of less than $100,000. The most affordable by this measure were Pittsburgh ($67,000), Detroit ($69,000), and Cleveland ($71,000). The most expensive metros were predominantly in the West, including San Jose ($361,000), Los Angeles ($298,000), and San Diego ($259,000).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that recent price and interest rate trends are affecting the income required to buy a home differently. In six markets, the median home listing price has fallen enough over the past year to offset rising mortgage rates and the income needed to buy a home has dropped. These markets were Miami (-6.2% required income year over year), San Francisco (-5.5%), Kansas City (-3.6%), Denver (-2.9%), Oklahoma City (-2.2%), and Seattle (-0.6%). In 15 markets, the median list price has declined, but rising mortgage rates have pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. These markets included San Jose (+1.1% required income year over year), Raleigh (+2.7%), and Cincinnati (+2.7%). Yet in the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates have combined to push required incomes higher, and in 14 of the 50 largest metros, the required income grew by double digits compared with last year. The top three metros that saw the required income increase the most were Buffalo (+20.0%), Cleveland (+19.3%), and Pittsburgh (+17.1%).\nThe share of price reductions was up compared with last year in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw the share of price reductions increase compared with last April, up from 34 in March. Portland saw the greatest increase (+9.7 percentage points), followed by Tampa (+8.8 percentage points) and Jacksonville (+7.3 percentage points).\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics vs. Pre-Pandemic 2017\u201319\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Housing Overview of the 50 Largest Metros\u00a0\n* The required income to purchase a home, assuming an affordability price-to-income ratio of 30%, a 20% down payment, a 30-year term, a 30-year fixed mortgage rate, and local tax and insurance rates\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMethodology\nRealtor.com housing data as of April 2024.

    "Summarized_Document1": "April 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\n\nAccording to Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the affordability gains seen earlier in the year were overshadowed by rising mortgage rates due to stronger-than-expected inflation and employment figures in March and April. The national median list price remained stable compared to last year, but the price per square foot continued to grow. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate than last year, leading to an increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. The time a typical home spends on the market is still below pre-pandemic levels, but the gap is shrinking.\n\nHome listing availability improved in April, with 30.4% more homes actively for sale compared to April 2023. This marked the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth. Inventory in April was at its highest level since 2020 but still down 35.9% compared to 2017-2019 levels. Homes priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range saw the most significant growth, with inventory in this range increasing by 41.0% compared to last year. The total number of homes for sale, including those under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared to last year.\n\nPending listings increased by 6.3%, similar to last month's 6.2% growth rate. Mortgage rates increased in April, likely delaying the Federal Reserve's first policy rate cut. This may slow the growth in pending listings and existing-home sales in the coming months. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate, with newly listed homes 12.2% above last year's levels, marking the sixth month of increasing listing activity.\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends showed the South leading in affordable inventory growth, with listings growing by 43.0%. The West saw a 27.4% increase, the Midwest 17.6%, and the Northeast 4.0%. Inventory increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros, with Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville seeing the most growth. Despite higher inventory growth, most metros still had lower inventory levels compared to pre-pandemic years.\n\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South by 19.7%, followed by the West (18.4%), Midwest (7.5%), and Northeast (2.9%). Seattle, San Jose, and Austin saw the largest growth in newly listed homes. Homes spent slightly more time on the market compared to last year, with the typical home spending 47 days on the market in April, one day more than last year.\n\nThe national median list price remained stable at $430,000, the same as last year. However, the price per square foot grew by 3.8%. Higher mortgage rates increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by $148 (6.9%) compared to last year, raising the required household income to $116,000. The percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% last year to 15.5% this year.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends showed stable listing prices in the South (-0.1%) but increases in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%). Buffalo, Cleveland, and Rochester saw the biggest increases in median list prices, while Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City saw declines. The required household income to afford the median-priced home exceeded $100,000 in 34 of the 50 largest metro areas, with the most expensive metros in the West.\n\nRecent price and interest rate trends affected the income required to buy a home differently across markets. In six markets, the median home listing price fell enough to offset rising mortgage rates, reducing the required income. In 15 markets, rising mortgage rates pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. In the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates combined to push required incomes higher, with 14 metros seeing double-digit increases in required income compared to last year.\n\nThe share of price reductions increased in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw an increase in price reductions compared to last April, with Portland, Tampa, and Jacksonville seeing the greatest increases.",

    "Document1": "\n\nArticles\n\n\nApril 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\nAccording to the Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the small but meaningful affordability gains seen since the start of the year were eclipsed by a renewed rise in mortgage rates, fueled by stronger-than-expected inflation and employment readings in March and April.\u00a0\nWhile the nation\u2019s median list price did not increase compared with last year due to an influx of more affordable and smaller homes, the typical home\u2019s price per square foot continued to grow, and, driven by rising rates, the cost to purchase a home once again outpaced wage growth after just a one-month reprieve in March.\nMeanwhile, sellers continued to list homes at a greater rate than last year. This has led to a promising increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. In response, the time a typical home spends on the market continues to be below pre-pandemic levels\u2014but the gap is shrinking. Sellers are also continuing to adjust to market conditions, with price reductions remaining above the previous year\u2019s levels.\u00a0\nHome listing availability continues to improve in April\nThere were 30.4% more homes actively for sale on a typical day in April compared with the same time in 2023, marking the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth.\nFor the first four months of this year, the inventory of homes actively for sale was at its highest level since 2020. However, while inventory this April is much improved compared with the previous three years, it is still down 35.9% compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. This is a slight improvement compared with last month\u2019s 37.9% gap, as inventory continues to slowly improve toward normalcy.\n\nIn April, as in the previous two months, the growth in homes particularly priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range outpaced all other price categories, as home inventory in this range grew by 41.0% compared with last year, surpassing even last month\u2019s high 30.5% growth rate. As we show in the next section, this increase is primarily fueled by a greater availability of smaller and more affordable homes in the South.\nThe total number of homes for sale, including homes that were under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared with last year, growing on an annual basis for the fifth month in a row after ending a seven-month streak of annual total listing declines.\u00a0\n\nThe number of homes under contract but not yet sold (pending listings) increased by 6.3%, which is similar to last month\u2019s 6.2% growth rate. After reports of unexpectedly persistent inflation, mortgage rates increased in April on expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely push back its first cut to the primary policy rate, which was originally expected in June of this year.\nNext month, we may see the growth in pending listings slow, and as pending home sales are an early indicator of the direction of existing-home sales, it is possible that sales may decelerate further in April and May, after dipping 4.3% in March.\n\nHowever, providing a boost to overall inventory, which has been a drag on sales the past couple of years, sellers turned out in higher numbers this April as newly listed homes were 12.2% above last year\u2019s levels, matching last month\u2019s growth rate. This marked the sixth month of increasing listing activity after a 17-month streak of declines. However, sellers, of whom roughly three-quarters plan to also purchase a home, have been fairly rate-sensitive over this past year.\nIf mortgage rates remain elevated over the next few months, the housing market may see a return to the holding pattern of scarce inventory, as we\u2019ve seen over the past few years. For buyers, that could mean fewer opportunities for finding their ideal home as summer approaches.\u00a0\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends\nThe South leads the way in more affordable inventory growth\nThe South has been largely driving the increase in availability of homes in the $200,000 to $350,000 price range, and the increase in availability of homes overall. Home listings located in the South made up more than half (56.6%) of available inventory in April 2024, up from 52.0% last year and 47.7% in April 2019.\nIn April, all four regions saw active inventory grow over the previous year. The South saw listings grow by 43.0%, while inventory grew by 27.4% in the West, 17.6% in the Midwest, and only 4.0% in the Northeast.\nThe inventory of homes for sale increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros compared with last year. In seven large metros, inventory was above pre-pandemic levels. Metros that saw the most inventory growth included Tampa (+69.5%), Orlando (+64.2%), and Jacksonville (+59.1%). In large Florida metros, the inventory growth was primarily driven by an increase in the availability of attached homes (condos, townhomes, or row homes).\u00a0\nDespite higher inventory growth compared with last year, most metros still had a lower level of inventory compared with pre-pandemic years. Among the 50 largest metro areas, only seven saw higher levels of inventory in April compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. However, this is up from only four metros last month. The top metros that saw inventory surpass pre-pandemic levels were Austin (+28.9%), San Antonio (+27.4%), and Denver (+15.2%).\nThe South saw newly listed homes increase the most compared with last year\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South, by 19.7%, whereas new inventory grew by 18.4% in the West, 7.5% in the Midwest, and 2.9% in the Northeast.\nIn April, 48 of the 50 largest metros saw new listings increase over the previous year, but only three saw more newly listed homes than the typical April from 2017 to 2019. The metros that saw the largest growth in newly listed homes included Seattle (+46.5%), San Jose (+40.6%), and Austin (+36.1%), while Detroit (-3.8%) and Cincinnati (-1.6%) saw new listings decline. Only Austin (+18.8%), San Antonio (+2.6%), and Jacksonville (+1.6%) saw more new listings enter the market this April compared with typical pre-pandemic levels.\nHomes are spending slightly more time on the market compared with last year\u00a0\nThe typical home spent 47 days on the market this April, which is 1 day more than the same time last year and a week less than the average April from 2017 to 2019. April was the first month since September 2023 to see homes spend more time on the market than the previous year.\nMeanwhile, the gap between time on the market this year and typical pre-pandemic levels, while still present, is shrinking as inventory grows. The gap shrank from 12 days last month to just seven days this month.\n\nRegional and metro area time on the market trends\nThis month, not all regions saw the inventory of homes for sale spend less time on the market than last year. In the South, where the growth in home inventory has been the largest, the typical home spent two days more on the market in April compared with last year. However, in the Midwest, Northeast, and West, homes are still spending two days less on the market than last April.\nWhile all regions were still seeing time on the market below pre-pandemic levels, in the West, homes are spending only one day less on the market compared with the typical April from 2017 to 2019. Time on the market was nine days less than pre-pandemic levels in the South, 11 days less in the Midwest, and 15 days less in the Northeast.\nMeanwhile, time on the market decreased compared with last year in 26 of the 50 largest metro areas this April, down from 41 markets last month. It decreased the most in Kansas City (-15 days), Las Vegas (-11 days), and Raleigh (-10 days). Time on the market increased compared with last year in 21 of the 50 largest metros, including Hartford (+9 days), Denver (+8 days), Pittsburgh, and Phoenix (+5 days each). Ten predominantly Western markets saw homes spend more time on the market than typical 2017 to 2019 pre-pandemic timing, including Phoenix (+11 days), Seattle (+8 days), Denver, and Portland (+7 days each).\nThe median list price remained stable compared with last April, but the price per square foot continues to rise\nThe national median list price continued to increase seasonally, to $430,000 in April compared with $424,900 in March, and the median list price remained stable compared with the same time last year, when it was also $430,000.\u00a0\nCompared with last year, sellers are inching back to list more small and affordable homes, particularly in the South, and this change in the mix of available homes has kept the nation\u2019s median list price stable.\nWhile the median list price remained relatively unchanged, on an adjusted per-square-foot basis, the median list price grew by 3.8%, as homes continue to retain their value despite increased inventory compared with last year.\nMeanwhile, higher mortgage rates compared with last April still increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $148 (6.9%) compared with a year ago. This increased the required household income to purchase the median-priced home by $5,900, to $116,000, after also accounting for the cost of tax and insurance.\u00a0\nFor the past several months, growth in the monthly cost to purchase a home was slowing. However, the renewed mortgage rate growth seen in April has once again fueled an increase in the growth rate of the cost to purchase a home (+6.9% year over year). In March, average hourly earnings for private employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, grew by 4.1% annually. However, this increase is no longer outpacing the increase in the cost to purchase a home as it did last month.\n\nWhile the percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% in April of last year to 15.5% this year, the overall share of inventory is no longer historically high, as the share dipped back below pre-pandemic levels seen in 2017 and 2018 (15.8%, respectively).\nLast month we noted that sellers were adjusting to an increase in more competitive home listings. Indeed, a Realtor.com survey also showed that sellers have more realistic market expectations this year, with fewer potential sellers expecting a bidding war or sale within a week or sale above their asking price compared with last year. Yet while sellers continue to adjust expectations and are cutting prices at a greater rate than last year, when inventory levels were historically low, historical data shows that their behavior in adjusting prices is not unusual for pre-pandemic norms.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends\nIn April, listing prices remained stable on a year-over-year basis in the South (-0.1%), where competitive home inventory has grown the most, but prices continued to increase in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%) compared with the same time last year. On an adjusted per-square-foot basis, prices in all regions grew similarly, by 3.9% to 5.2%, as soft median list price growth in the South was driven by a larger inventory of affordable, smaller homes available for sale.\nThe median list price in Buffalo (+14.0%), Cleveland (+13.4%), and Rochester (+11.4%) saw the biggest increases among large metros. Meanwhile, 21 metros saw their median list price decline compared with last year, up from 18 last month. The metros included Miami (-10.7%), San Francisco (-10.7%), and Kansas City (-8.3%). However, on a price-per-square-foot basis, listing prices in Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City declined only by 6.6%, 2.8%, and 4.3%, respectively, as the mix of listing inventory consisted of smaller homes relative to the previous year.\nNotably, 34 of the 50 largest metro areas required a household income of more than $100,000 to afford the median-priced home at current interest rates, and six even required a household income of more than $200,000. Midwestern metros were commonly among the 16 remaining metro areas that required a household income of less than $100,000. The most affordable by this measure were Pittsburgh ($67,000), Detroit ($69,000), and Cleveland ($71,000). The most expensive metros were predominantly in the West, including San Jose ($361,000), Los Angeles ($298,000), and San Diego ($259,000).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that recent price and interest rate trends are affecting the income required to buy a home differently. In six markets, the median home listing price has fallen enough over the past year to offset rising mortgage rates and the income needed to buy a home has dropped. These markets were Miami (-6.2% required income year over year), San Francisco (-5.5%), Kansas City (-3.6%), Denver (-2.9%), Oklahoma City (-2.2%), and Seattle (-0.6%). In 15 markets, the median list price has declined, but rising mortgage rates have pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. These markets included San Jose (+1.1% required income year over year), Raleigh (+2.7%), and Cincinnati (+2.7%). Yet in the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates have combined to push required incomes higher, and in 14 of the 50 largest metros, the required income grew by double digits compared with last year. The top three metros that saw the required income increase the most were Buffalo (+20.0%), Cleveland (+19.3%), and Pittsburgh (+17.1%).\nThe share of price reductions was up compared with last year in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw the share of price reductions increase compared with last April, up from 34 in March. Portland saw the greatest increase (+9.7 percentage points), followed by Tampa (+8.8 percentage points) and Jacksonville (+7.3 percentage points).\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics vs. Pre-Pandemic 2017\u201319\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Housing Overview of the 50 Largest Metros\u00a0\n* The required income to purchase a home, assuming an affordability price-to-income ratio of 30%, a 20% down payment, a 30-year term, a 30-year fixed mortgage rate, and local tax and insurance rates\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMethodology\nRealtor.com housing data as of April 2024.

    "Summarized_Document1": "April 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\n\nAccording to Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the affordability gains seen earlier in the year were overshadowed by rising mortgage rates due to stronger-than-expected inflation and employment figures in March and April. The national median list price remained stable compared to last year, but the price per square foot continued to grow. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate than last year, leading to an increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. The time a typical home spends on the market is still below pre-pandemic levels, but the gap is shrinking.\n\nHome listing availability improved in April, with 30.4% more homes actively for sale compared to April 2023. This marked the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth. Inventory in April was at its highest level since 2020 but still down 35.9% compared to 2017-2019 levels. Homes priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range saw the most significant growth, with inventory in this range increasing by 41.0% compared to last year. The total number of homes for sale, including those under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared to last year.\n\nPending listings increased by 6.3%, similar to last month's 6.2% growth rate. Mortgage rates increased in April, likely delaying the Federal Reserve's first policy rate cut. This may slow the growth in pending listings and existing-home sales in the coming months. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate, with newly listed homes 12.2% above last year's levels, marking the sixth month of increasing listing activity.\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends showed the South leading in affordable inventory growth, with listings growing by 43.0%. The West saw a 27.4% increase, the Midwest 17.6%, and the Northeast 4.0%. Inventory increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros, with Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville seeing the most growth. Despite higher inventory growth, most metros still had lower inventory levels compared to pre-pandemic years.\n\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South by 19.7%, followed by the West (18.4%), Midwest (7.5%), and Northeast (2.9%). Seattle, San Jose, and Austin saw the largest growth in newly listed homes. Homes spent slightly more time on the market compared to last year, with the typical home spending 47 days on the market in April, one day more than last year.\n\nThe national median list price remained stable at $430,000, the same as last year. However, the price per square foot grew by 3.8%. Higher mortgage rates increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by $148 (6.9%) compared to last year, raising the required household income to $116,000. The percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% last year to 15.5% this year.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends showed stable listing prices in the South (-0.1%) but increases in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%). Buffalo, Cleveland, and Rochester saw the biggest increases in median list prices, while Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City saw declines. The required household income to afford the median-priced home exceeded $100,000 in 34 of the 50 largest metro areas, with the most expensive metros in the West.\n\nRecent price and interest rate trends affected the income required to buy a home differently across markets. In six markets, the median home listing price fell enough to offset rising mortgage rates, reducing the required income. In 15 markets, rising mortgage rates pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. In the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates combined to push required incomes higher, with 14 metros seeing double-digit increases in required income compared to last year.\n\nThe share of price reductions increased in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw an increase in price reductions compared to last April, with Portland, Tampa, and Jacksonville seeing the greatest increases.",

    "Document1": "\n\nArticles\n\n\nApril 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\nAccording to the Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the small but meaningful affordability gains seen since the start of the year were eclipsed by a renewed rise in mortgage rates, fueled by stronger-than-expected inflation and employment readings in March and April.\u00a0\nWhile the nation\u2019s median list price did not increase compared with last year due to an influx of more affordable and smaller homes, the typical home\u2019s price per square foot continued to grow, and, driven by rising rates, the cost to purchase a home once again outpaced wage growth after just a one-month reprieve in March.\nMeanwhile, sellers continued to list homes at a greater rate than last year. This has led to a promising increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. In response, the time a typical home spends on the market continues to be below pre-pandemic levels\u2014but the gap is shrinking. Sellers are also continuing to adjust to market conditions, with price reductions remaining above the previous year\u2019s levels.\u00a0\nHome listing availability continues to improve in April\nThere were 30.4% more homes actively for sale on a typical day in April compared with the same time in 2023, marking the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth.\nFor the first four months of this year, the inventory of homes actively for sale was at its highest level since 2020. However, while inventory this April is much improved compared with the previous three years, it is still down 35.9% compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. This is a slight improvement compared with last month\u2019s 37.9% gap, as inventory continues to slowly improve toward normalcy.\n\nIn April, as in the previous two months, the growth in homes particularly priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range outpaced all other price categories, as home inventory in this range grew by 41.0% compared with last year, surpassing even last month\u2019s high 30.5% growth rate. As we show in the next section, this increase is primarily fueled by a greater availability of smaller and more affordable homes in the South.\nThe total number of homes for sale, including homes that were under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared with last year, growing on an annual basis for the fifth month in a row after ending a seven-month streak of annual total listing declines.\u00a0\n\nThe number of homes under contract but not yet sold (pending listings) increased by 6.3%, which is similar to last month\u2019s 6.2% growth rate. After reports of unexpectedly persistent inflation, mortgage rates increased in April on expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely push back its first cut to the primary policy rate, which was originally expected in June of this year.\nNext month, we may see the growth in pending listings slow, and as pending home sales are an early indicator of the direction of existing-home sales, it is possible that sales may decelerate further in April and May, after dipping 4.3% in March.\n\nHowever, providing a boost to overall inventory, which has been a drag on sales the past couple of years, sellers turned out in higher numbers this April as newly listed homes were 12.2% above last year\u2019s levels, matching last month\u2019s growth rate. This marked the sixth month of increasing listing activity after a 17-month streak of declines. However, sellers, of whom roughly three-quarters plan to also purchase a home, have been fairly rate-sensitive over this past year.\nIf mortgage rates remain elevated over the next few months, the housing market may see a return to the holding pattern of scarce inventory, as we\u2019ve seen over the past few years. For buyers, that could mean fewer opportunities for finding their ideal home as summer approaches.\u00a0\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends\nThe South leads the way in more affordable inventory growth\nThe South has been largely driving the increase in availability of homes in the $200,000 to $350,000 price range, and the increase in availability of homes overall. Home listings located in the South made up more than half (56.6%) of available inventory in April 2024, up from 52.0% last year and 47.7% in April 2019.\nIn April, all four regions saw active inventory grow over the previous year. The South saw listings grow by 43.0%, while inventory grew by 27.4% in the West, 17.6% in the Midwest, and only 4.0% in the Northeast.\nThe inventory of homes for sale increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros compared with last year. In seven large metros, inventory was above pre-pandemic levels. Metros that saw the most inventory growth included Tampa (+69.5%), Orlando (+64.2%), and Jacksonville (+59.1%). In large Florida metros, the inventory growth was primarily driven by an increase in the availability of attached homes (condos, townhomes, or row homes).\u00a0\nDespite higher inventory growth compared with last year, most metros still had a lower level of inventory compared with pre-pandemic years. Among the 50 largest metro areas, only seven saw higher levels of inventory in April compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. However, this is up from only four metros last month. The top metros that saw inventory surpass pre-pandemic levels were Austin (+28.9%), San Antonio (+27.4%), and Denver (+15.2%).\nThe South saw newly listed homes increase the most compared with last year\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South, by 19.7%, whereas new inventory grew by 18.4% in the West, 7.5% in the Midwest, and 2.9% in the Northeast.\nIn April, 48 of the 50 largest metros saw new listings increase over the previous year, but only three saw more newly listed homes than the typical April from 2017 to 2019. The metros that saw the largest growth in newly listed homes included Seattle (+46.5%), San Jose (+40.6%), and Austin (+36.1%), while Detroit (-3.8%) and Cincinnati (-1.6%) saw new listings decline. Only Austin (+18.8%), San Antonio (+2.6%), and Jacksonville (+1.6%) saw more new listings enter the market this April compared with typical pre-pandemic levels.\nHomes are spending slightly more time on the market compared with last year\u00a0\nThe typical home spent 47 days on the market this April, which is 1 day more than the same time last year and a week less than the average April from 2017 to 2019. April was the first month since September 2023 to see homes spend more time on the market than the previous year.\nMeanwhile, the gap between time on the market this year and typical pre-pandemic levels, while still present, is shrinking as inventory grows. The gap shrank from 12 days last month to just seven days this month.\n\nRegional and metro area time on the market trends\nThis month, not all regions saw the inventory of homes for sale spend less time on the market than last year. In the South, where the growth in home inventory has been the largest, the typical home spent two days more on the market in April compared with last year. However, in the Midwest, Northeast, and West, homes are still spending two days less on the market than last April.\nWhile all regions were still seeing time on the market below pre-pandemic levels, in the West, homes are spending only one day less on the market compared with the typical April from 2017 to 2019. Time on the market was nine days less than pre-pandemic levels in the South, 11 days less in the Midwest, and 15 days less in the Northeast.\nMeanwhile, time on the market decreased compared with last year in 26 of the 50 largest metro areas this April, down from 41 markets last month. It decreased the most in Kansas City (-15 days), Las Vegas (-11 days), and Raleigh (-10 days). Time on the market increased compared with last year in 21 of the 50 largest metros, including Hartford (+9 days), Denver (+8 days), Pittsburgh, and Phoenix (+5 days each). Ten predominantly Western markets saw homes spend more time on the market than typical 2017 to 2019 pre-pandemic timing, including Phoenix (+11 days), Seattle (+8 days), Denver, and Portland (+7 days each).\nThe median list price remained stable compared with last April, but the price per square foot continues to rise\nThe national median list price continued to increase seasonally, to $430,000 in April compared with $424,900 in March, and the median list price remained stable compared with the same time last year, when it was also $430,000.\u00a0\nCompared with last year, sellers are inching back to list more small and affordable homes, particularly in the South, and this change in the mix of available homes has kept the nation\u2019s median list price stable.\nWhile the median list price remained relatively unchanged, on an adjusted per-square-foot basis, the median list price grew by 3.8%, as homes continue to retain their value despite increased inventory compared with last year.\nMeanwhile, higher mortgage rates compared with last April still increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $148 (6.9%) compared with a year ago. This increased the required household income to purchase the median-priced home by $5,900, to $116,000, after also accounting for the cost of tax and insurance.\u00a0\nFor the past several months, growth in the monthly cost to purchase a home was slowing. However, the renewed mortgage rate growth seen in April has once again fueled an increase in the growth rate of the cost to purchase a home (+6.9% year over year). In March, average hourly earnings for private employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, grew by 4.1% annually. However, this increase is no longer outpacing the increase in the cost to purchase a home as it did last month.\n\nWhile the percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% in April of last year to 15.5% this year, the overall share of inventory is no longer historically high, as the share dipped back below pre-pandemic levels seen in 2017 and 2018 (15.8%, respectively).\nLast month we noted that sellers were adjusting to an increase in more competitive home listings. Indeed, a Realtor.com survey also showed that sellers have more realistic market expectations this year, with fewer potential sellers expecting a bidding war or sale within a week or sale above their asking price compared with last year. Yet while sellers continue to adjust expectations and are cutting prices at a greater rate than last year, when inventory levels were historically low, historical data shows that their behavior in adjusting prices is not unusual for pre-pandemic norms.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends\nIn April, listing prices remained stable on a year-over-year basis in the South (-0.1%), where competitive home inventory has grown the most, but prices continued to increase in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%) compared with the same time last year. On an adjusted per-square-foot basis, prices in all regions grew similarly, by 3.9% to 5.2%, as soft median list price growth in the South was driven by a larger inventory of affordable, smaller homes available for sale.\nThe median list price in Buffalo (+14.0%), Cleveland (+13.4%), and Rochester (+11.4%) saw the biggest increases among large metros. Meanwhile, 21 metros saw their median list price decline compared with last year, up from 18 last month. The metros included Miami (-10.7%), San Francisco (-10.7%), and Kansas City (-8.3%). However, on a price-per-square-foot basis, listing prices in Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City declined only by 6.6%, 2.8%, and 4.3%, respectively, as the mix of listing inventory consisted of smaller homes relative to the previous year.\nNotably, 34 of the 50 largest metro areas required a household income of more than $100,000 to afford the median-priced home at current interest rates, and six even required a household income of more than $200,000. Midwestern metros were commonly among the 16 remaining metro areas that required a household income of less than $100,000. The most affordable by this measure were Pittsburgh ($67,000), Detroit ($69,000), and Cleveland ($71,000). The most expensive metros were predominantly in the West, including San Jose ($361,000), Los Angeles ($298,000), and San Diego ($259,000).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that recent price and interest rate trends are affecting the income required to buy a home differently. In six markets, the median home listing price has fallen enough over the past year to offset rising mortgage rates and the income needed to buy a home has dropped. These markets were Miami (-6.2% required income year over year), San Francisco (-5.5%), Kansas City (-3.6%), Denver (-2.9%), Oklahoma City (-2.2%), and Seattle (-0.6%). In 15 markets, the median list price has declined, but rising mortgage rates have pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. These markets included San Jose (+1.1% required income year over year), Raleigh (+2.7%), and Cincinnati (+2.7%). Yet in the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates have combined to push required incomes higher, and in 14 of the 50 largest metros, the required income grew by double digits compared with last year. The top three metros that saw the required income increase the most were Buffalo (+20.0%), Cleveland (+19.3%), and Pittsburgh (+17.1%).\nThe share of price reductions was up compared with last year in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw the share of price reductions increase compared with last April, up from 34 in March. Portland saw the greatest increase (+9.7 percentage points), followed by Tampa (+8.8 percentage points) and Jacksonville (+7.3 percentage points).\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics vs. Pre-Pandemic 2017\u201319\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Housing Overview of the 50 Largest Metros\u00a0\n* The required income to purchase a home, assuming an affordability price-to-income ratio of 30%, a 20% down payment, a 30-year term, a 30-year fixed mortgage rate, and local tax and insurance rates\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMethodology\nRealtor.com housing data as of April 2024.

    "Summarized_Document1": "April 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\n\nAccording to Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the affordability gains seen earlier in the year were overshadowed by rising mortgage rates due to stronger-than-expected inflation and employment figures in March and April. The national median list price remained stable compared to last year, but the price per square foot continued to grow. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate than last year, leading to an increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. The time a typical home spends on the market is still below pre-pandemic levels, but the gap is shrinking.\n\nHome listing availability improved in April, with 30.4% more homes actively for sale compared to April 2023. This marked the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth. Inventory in April was at its highest level since 2020 but still down 35.9% compared to 2017-2019 levels. Homes priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range saw the most significant growth, with inventory in this range increasing by 41.0% compared to last year. The total number of homes for sale, including those under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared to last year.\n\nPending listings increased by 6.3%, similar to last month's 6.2% growth rate. Mortgage rates increased in April, likely delaying the Federal Reserve's first policy rate cut. This may slow the growth in pending listings and existing-home sales in the coming months. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate, with newly listed homes 12.2% above last year's levels, marking the sixth month of increasing listing activity.\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends showed the South leading in affordable inventory growth, with listings growing by 43.0%. The West saw a 27.4% increase, the Midwest 17.6%, and the Northeast 4.0%. Inventory increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros, with Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville seeing the most growth. Despite higher inventory growth, most metros still had lower inventory levels compared to pre-pandemic years.\n\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South by 19.7%, followed by the West (18.4%), Midwest (7.5%), and Northeast (2.9%). Seattle, San Jose, and Austin saw the largest growth in newly listed homes. Homes spent slightly more time on the market compared to last year, with the typical home spending 47 days on the market in April, one day more than last year.\n\nThe national median list price remained stable at $430,000, the same as last year. However, the price per square foot grew by 3.8%. Higher mortgage rates increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by $148 (6.9%) compared to last year, raising the required household income to $116,000. The percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% last year to 15.5% this year.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends showed stable listing prices in the South (-0.1%) but increases in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%). Buffalo, Cleveland, and Rochester saw the biggest increases in median list prices, while Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City saw declines. The required household income to afford the median-priced home exceeded $100,000 in 34 of the 50 largest metro areas, with the most expensive metros in the West.\n\nRecent price and interest rate trends affected the income required to buy a home differently across markets. In six markets, the median home listing price fell enough to offset rising mortgage rates, reducing the required income. In 15 markets, rising mortgage rates pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. In the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates combined to push required incomes higher, with 14 metros seeing double-digit increases in required income compared to last year.\n\nThe share of price reductions increased in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw an increase in price reductions compared to last April, with Portland, Tampa, and Jacksonville seeing the greatest increases.",

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website.

Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

    "Document1": "\n\nArticles\n\n\nApril 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\nAccording to the Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the small but meaningful affordability gains seen since the start of the year were eclipsed by a renewed rise in mortgage rates, fueled by stronger-than-expected inflation and employment readings in March and April.\u00a0\nWhile the nation\u2019s median list price did not increase compared with last year due to an influx of more affordable and smaller homes, the typical home\u2019s price per square foot continued to grow, and, driven by rising rates, the cost to purchase a home once again outpaced wage growth after just a one-month reprieve in March.\nMeanwhile, sellers continued to list homes at a greater rate than last year. This has led to a promising increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. In response, the time a typical home spends on the market continues to be below pre-pandemic levels\u2014but the gap is shrinking. Sellers are also continuing to adjust to market conditions, with price reductions remaining above the previous year\u2019s levels.\u00a0\nHome listing availability continues to improve in April\nThere were 30.4% more homes actively for sale on a typical day in April compared with the same time in 2023, marking the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth.\nFor the first four months of this year, the inventory of homes actively for sale was at its highest level since 2020. However, while inventory this April is much improved compared with the previous three years, it is still down 35.9% compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. This is a slight improvement compared with last month\u2019s 37.9% gap, as inventory continues to slowly improve toward normalcy.\n\nIn April, as in the previous two months, the growth in homes particularly priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range outpaced all other price categories, as home inventory in this range grew by 41.0% compared with last year, surpassing even last month\u2019s high 30.5% growth rate. As we show in the next section, this increase is primarily fueled by a greater availability of smaller and more affordable homes in the South.\nThe total number of homes for sale, including homes that were under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared with last year, growing on an annual basis for the fifth month in a row after ending a seven-month streak of annual total listing declines.\u00a0\n\nThe number of homes under contract but not yet sold (pending listings) increased by 6.3%, which is similar to last month\u2019s 6.2% growth rate. After reports of unexpectedly persistent inflation, mortgage rates increased in April on expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely push back its first cut to the primary policy rate, which was originally expected in June of this year.\nNext month, we may see the growth in pending listings slow, and as pending home sales are an early indicator of the direction of existing-home sales, it is possible that sales may decelerate further in April and May, after dipping 4.3% in March.\n\nHowever, providing a boost to overall inventory, which has been a drag on sales the past couple of years, sellers turned out in higher numbers this April as newly listed homes were 12.2% above last year\u2019s levels, matching last month\u2019s growth rate. This marked the sixth month of increasing listing activity after a 17-month streak of declines. However, sellers, of whom roughly three-quarters plan to also purchase a home, have been fairly rate-sensitive over this past year.\nIf mortgage rates remain elevated over the next few months, the housing market may see a return to the holding pattern of scarce inventory, as we\u2019ve seen over the past few years. For buyers, that could mean fewer opportunities for finding their ideal home as summer approaches.\u00a0\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends\nThe South leads the way in more affordable inventory growth\nThe South has been largely driving the increase in availability of homes in the $200,000 to $350,000 price range, and the increase in availability of homes overall. Home listings located in the South made up more than half (56.6%) of available inventory in April 2024, up from 52.0% last year and 47.7% in April 2019.\nIn April, all four regions saw active inventory grow over the previous year. The South saw listings grow by 43.0%, while inventory grew by 27.4% in the West, 17.6% in the Midwest, and only 4.0% in the Northeast.\nThe inventory of homes for sale increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros compared with last year. In seven large metros, inventory was above pre-pandemic levels. Metros that saw the most inventory growth included Tampa (+69.5%), Orlando (+64.2%), and Jacksonville (+59.1%). In large Florida metros, the inventory growth was primarily driven by an increase in the availability of attached homes (condos, townhomes, or row homes).\u00a0\nDespite higher inventory growth compared with last year, most metros still had a lower level of inventory compared with pre-pandemic years. Among the 50 largest metro areas, only seven saw higher levels of inventory in April compared with typical 2017 to 2019 levels. However, this is up from only four metros last month. The top metros that saw inventory surpass pre-pandemic levels were Austin (+28.9%), San Antonio (+27.4%), and Denver (+15.2%).\nThe South saw newly listed homes increase the most compared with last year\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South, by 19.7%, whereas new inventory grew by 18.4% in the West, 7.5% in the Midwest, and 2.9% in the Northeast.\nIn April, 48 of the 50 largest metros saw new listings increase over the previous year, but only three saw more newly listed homes than the typical April from 2017 to 2019. The metros that saw the largest growth in newly listed homes included Seattle (+46.5%), San Jose (+40.6%), and Austin (+36.1%), while Detroit (-3.8%) and Cincinnati (-1.6%) saw new listings decline. Only Austin (+18.8%), San Antonio (+2.6%), and Jacksonville (+1.6%) saw more new listings enter the market this April compared with typical pre-pandemic levels.\nHomes are spending slightly more time on the market compared with last year\u00a0\nThe typical home spent 47 days on the market this April, which is 1 day more than the same time last year and a week less than the average April from 2017 to 2019. April was the first month since September 2023 to see homes spend more time on the market than the previous year.\nMeanwhile, the gap between time on the market this year and typical pre-pandemic levels, while still present, is shrinking as inventory grows. The gap shrank from 12 days last month to just seven days this month.\n\nRegional and metro area time on the market trends\nThis month, not all regions saw the inventory of homes for sale spend less time on the market than last year. In the South, where the growth in home inventory has been the largest, the typical home spent two days more on the market in April compared with last year. However, in the Midwest, Northeast, and West, homes are still spending two days less on the market than last April.\nWhile all regions were still seeing time on the market below pre-pandemic levels, in the West, homes are spending only one day less on the market compared with the typical April from 2017 to 2019. Time on the market was nine days less than pre-pandemic levels in the South, 11 days less in the Midwest, and 15 days less in the Northeast.\nMeanwhile, time on the market decreased compared with last year in 26 of the 50 largest metro areas this April, down from 41 markets last month. It decreased the most in Kansas City (-15 days), Las Vegas (-11 days), and Raleigh (-10 days). Time on the market increased compared with last year in 21 of the 50 largest metros, including Hartford (+9 days), Denver (+8 days), Pittsburgh, and Phoenix (+5 days each). Ten predominantly Western markets saw homes spend more time on the market than typical 2017 to 2019 pre-pandemic timing, including Phoenix (+11 days), Seattle (+8 days), Denver, and Portland (+7 days each).\nThe median list price remained stable compared with last April, but the price per square foot continues to rise\nThe national median list price continued to increase seasonally, to $430,000 in April compared with $424,900 in March, and the median list price remained stable compared with the same time last year, when it was also $430,000.\u00a0\nCompared with last year, sellers are inching back to list more small and affordable homes, particularly in the South, and this change in the mix of available homes has kept the nation\u2019s median list price stable.\nWhile the median list price remained relatively unchanged, on an adjusted per-square-foot basis, the median list price grew by 3.8%, as homes continue to retain their value despite increased inventory compared with last year.\nMeanwhile, higher mortgage rates compared with last April still increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $148 (6.9%) compared with a year ago. This increased the required household income to purchase the median-priced home by $5,900, to $116,000, after also accounting for the cost of tax and insurance.\u00a0\nFor the past several months, growth in the monthly cost to purchase a home was slowing. However, the renewed mortgage rate growth seen in April has once again fueled an increase in the growth rate of the cost to purchase a home (+6.9% year over year). In March, average hourly earnings for private employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, grew by 4.1% annually. However, this increase is no longer outpacing the increase in the cost to purchase a home as it did last month.\n\nWhile the percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% in April of last year to 15.5% this year, the overall share of inventory is no longer historically high, as the share dipped back below pre-pandemic levels seen in 2017 and 2018 (15.8%, respectively).\nLast month we noted that sellers were adjusting to an increase in more competitive home listings. Indeed, a Realtor.com survey also showed that sellers have more realistic market expectations this year, with fewer potential sellers expecting a bidding war or sale within a week or sale above their asking price compared with last year. Yet while sellers continue to adjust expectations and are cutting prices at a greater rate than last year, when inventory levels were historically low, historical data shows that their behavior in adjusting prices is not unusual for pre-pandemic norms.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends\nIn April, listing prices remained stable on a year-over-year basis in the South (-0.1%), where competitive home inventory has grown the most, but prices continued to increase in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%) compared with the same time last year. On an adjusted per-square-foot basis, prices in all regions grew similarly, by 3.9% to 5.2%, as soft median list price growth in the South was driven by a larger inventory of affordable, smaller homes available for sale.\nThe median list price in Buffalo (+14.0%), Cleveland (+13.4%), and Rochester (+11.4%) saw the biggest increases among large metros. Meanwhile, 21 metros saw their median list price decline compared with last year, up from 18 last month. The metros included Miami (-10.7%), San Francisco (-10.7%), and Kansas City (-8.3%). However, on a price-per-square-foot basis, listing prices in Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City declined only by 6.6%, 2.8%, and 4.3%, respectively, as the mix of listing inventory consisted of smaller homes relative to the previous year.\nNotably, 34 of the 50 largest metro areas required a household income of more than $100,000 to afford the median-priced home at current interest rates, and six even required a household income of more than $200,000. Midwestern metros were commonly among the 16 remaining metro areas that required a household income of less than $100,000. The most affordable by this measure were Pittsburgh ($67,000), Detroit ($69,000), and Cleveland ($71,000). The most expensive metros were predominantly in the West, including San Jose ($361,000), Los Angeles ($298,000), and San Diego ($259,000).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that recent price and interest rate trends are affecting the income required to buy a home differently. In six markets, the median home listing price has fallen enough over the past year to offset rising mortgage rates and the income needed to buy a home has dropped. These markets were Miami (-6.2% required income year over year), San Francisco (-5.5%), Kansas City (-3.6%), Denver (-2.9%), Oklahoma City (-2.2%), and Seattle (-0.6%). In 15 markets, the median list price has declined, but rising mortgage rates have pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. These markets included San Jose (+1.1% required income year over year), Raleigh (+2.7%), and Cincinnati (+2.7%). Yet in the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates have combined to push required incomes higher, and in 14 of the 50 largest metros, the required income grew by double digits compared with last year. The top three metros that saw the required income increase the most were Buffalo (+20.0%), Cleveland (+19.3%), and Pittsburgh (+17.1%).\nThe share of price reductions was up compared with last year in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw the share of price reductions increase compared with last April, up from 34 in March. Portland saw the greatest increase (+9.7 percentage points), followed by Tampa (+8.8 percentage points) and Jacksonville (+7.3 percentage points).\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Regional Statistics vs. Pre-Pandemic 2017\u201319\n\u00a0\nApril 2024 Housing Overview of the 50 Largest Metros\u00a0\n* The required income to purchase a home, assuming an affordability price-to-income ratio of 30%, a 20% down payment, a 30-year term, a 30-year fixed mortgage rate, and local tax and insurance rates\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMethodology\nRealtor.com housing data as of April 2024.

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website. Rent prices listed are averages and may not reflect the cost of specific units. Rental prices can vary depending on factors like size, location, amenities, and availability.\nHow Much Is Rent for a Studio Apartment in San Diego?\nOn average, expect to pay around $2,545 per month for a studio apartment in San Diego.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 1-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nThe average rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in San Diego is approximately $3,106 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 2-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nIn San Diego, a 2-bedroom apartment typically rents for around $3,926 per month.\nHow Much Is Rent for a 3-Bedroom Apartment in San Diego?\nA 3-bedroom apartment in San Diego will cost, on average, $4,754 per month.\nTransportation in San Diego\nSan Diego residents have a few popular choices when it comes to getting around the city, and the best option often depends on the trip and personal preferences:\nMTS: The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) operates a network of buses and trolleys that cover a large portion of the city. It's a convenient and affordable option, especially for commuting to and from work. The PRONTO card system allows for easy fare payment and transfers.\nCOASTER: The North County Transit District (NCTD) operates the COASTER commuter trains, which connect downtown San Diego with coastal towns to the north. This is a great option for residents who live along the coast or want a scenic ride.\nCar: While public transportation is good, many San Diegans still rely on cars for the ultimate flexibility. Traffic congestion can be a concern, though.\nRidesharing: Lyft and Uber are popular choices for on-demand rides, particularly for evening outings or trips that aren't well-served by public transportation.\nBiking and Walking: San Diego's weather makes biking and walking year-round possibilities. The city has invested in bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, making these attractive options for shorter trips.\nPet-Friendly Apartment Hunting in San Diego\nSan Diego doesn't have any city-wide restrictions on pets, so renting with a furry friend is up to the discretion of landlords. Here are some restrictions you might run into:\nThe good news? Major rental listing websites like Apartment List allow filtering by pet-friendliness. Simply select \u201cDog-Friendly\u201d or \u201cCat-Friendly\u201d in your preferences when you start your search.\nFAQs about Living in San Diego\nStill have questions about renting in San Diego? Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

    "Summarized_Document1": "April 2024 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report\n\nAccording to Realtor.com\u00ae April housing data, the affordability gains seen earlier in the year were overshadowed by rising mortgage rates due to stronger-than-expected inflation and employment figures in March and April. The national median list price remained stable compared to last year, but the price per square foot continued to grow. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate than last year, leading to an increase in more affordable homes for sale, especially in the South. The time a typical home spends on the market is still below pre-pandemic levels, but the gap is shrinking.\n\nHome listing availability improved in April, with 30.4% more homes actively for sale compared to April 2023. This marked the sixth consecutive month of annual inventory growth. Inventory in April was at its highest level since 2020 but still down 35.9% compared to 2017-2019 levels. Homes priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range saw the most significant growth, with inventory in this range increasing by 41.0% compared to last year. The total number of homes for sale, including those under contract but not yet sold, increased by 20.0% compared to last year.\n\nPending listings increased by 6.3%, similar to last month's 6.2% growth rate. Mortgage rates increased in April, likely delaying the Federal Reserve's first policy rate cut. This may slow the growth in pending listings and existing-home sales in the coming months. Sellers listed homes at a higher rate, with newly listed homes 12.2% above last year's levels, marking the sixth month of increasing listing activity.\n\nRegional and metro area inventory trends showed the South leading in affordable inventory growth, with listings growing by 43.0%. The West saw a 27.4% increase, the Midwest 17.6%, and the Northeast 4.0%. Inventory increased in 45 of the 50 largest metros, with Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville seeing the most growth. Despite higher inventory growth, most metros still had lower inventory levels compared to pre-pandemic years.\n\nNewly listed home inventory increased the most in the South by 19.7%, followed by the West (18.4%), Midwest (7.5%), and Northeast (2.9%). Seattle, San Jose, and Austin saw the largest growth in newly listed homes. Homes spent slightly more time on the market compared to last year, with the typical home spending 47 days on the market in April, one day more than last year.\n\nThe national median list price remained stable at $430,000, the same as last year. However, the price per square foot grew by 3.8%. Higher mortgage rates increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by $148 (6.9%) compared to last year, raising the required household income to $116,000. The percentage of homes with price reductions increased from 12.3% last year to 15.5% this year.\n\nRegional and metro area price trends showed stable listing prices in the South (-0.1%) but increases in the Northeast (+5.6%), Midwest (+1.9%), and West (+1.9%). Buffalo, Cleveland, and Rochester saw the biggest increases in median list prices, while Miami, San Francisco, and Kansas City saw declines. The required household income to afford the median-priced home exceeded $100,000 in 34 of the 50 largest metro areas, with the most expensive metros in the West.\n\nRecent price and interest rate trends affected the income required to buy a home differently across markets. In six markets, the median home listing price fell enough to offset rising mortgage rates, reducing the required income. In 15 markets, rising mortgage rates pushed required incomes higher despite lower home prices. In the majority of large metro areas, home prices and mortgage rates combined to push required incomes higher, with 14 metros seeing double-digit increases in required income compared to last year.\n\nThe share of price reductions increased in the South (+4.3 percentage points), West (+2.5 percentage points), Midwest (+2.3 percentage points), and Northeast (+0.8 percentage points). Forty-four of the 50 largest metros saw an increase in price reductions compared to last April, with Portland, Tampa, and Jacksonville seeing the greatest increases.",

A high Access Ranking\u00a0(1-13) indicates that a state provides relatively more access to insurance and mental health\u00a0treatment than those ranked 39-51.\nThe eight measures that make up the Access Ranking include:\n\n\n\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness.\nIn 2022, 64% of adults who were uninsured said that they did not have health insurance because they could not afford it.\nThe state prevalence of uninsured adults with mental illness ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\nAdults with SUD Who Needed But Did Not Receive Treatment\nOver three-quarters (76.9%) of all adults with a substance use disorder did not receive the treatment they needed.\nMost adults with SUD who sought or thought about receiving treatment reported they didn\u2019t because they thought they should have been able to handle their drug or alcohol use on their own (75.4%).\nThis was followed by: Not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop or cut back using alcohol or drugs (48.4%), thought it would cost too much (47.7%), and did not know how or where to get treatment (47.3%).\nThe state prevalence of adults with SUD with unmet treatment needs ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\n10.2% of adults who experienced a mental illness in the past year had private health insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems.\nThe state prevalence of adults with AMI whose private insurance did not cover mental or emotional problems ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs\n24.58% of adults who reported experiencing 14 or more mentally unhealthy days each month were not able to see a doctor due to costs. This was a 2% increase over last year\u2019s report.\nHigh costs of mental health care are a critical barrier to access. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading. Unfortunately, doing so hides the fact that the percentages are significantly lower.\nThe state rate of students identified as having an emotional disturbance for an IEP ranges from 28.01 per 1,000 students in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 students in Alabama.\n\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\nMental Health Workforce Availability\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. The term \u201cmental health provider\u201d includes psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care.\nAs of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, and only 27% of the mental health need in shortage areas was being met by mental health providers. Over the next 15 years, the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis has projected increasing shortages for several behavioral health providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health and addiction counselors.\nThe state rate of mental health workforce ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.\nThe State of Mental Health in America\n2024 STATISTICS\nAccess to Care\nAbout Us\nGet Help\nGet Active\nGet Information\n\n                500 Montgomery Street,\n                \n                Suite 820\n                \n                Alexandria, VA. 22314\n                \n\n                Phone (703) 684.7722\n                \n                Toll Free (800) 969.6642\n                \n                Fax (703) 684.5968\n              \nFooter menu\n",

States that have the highest percentages of counties without access to maternity care include North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Oklahoma and Nebraska.\n\"For too many families across the U.S., the ability to have a healthy pregnancy depends on where they live,\" said Dr. Amanda Williams, March of Dimes\u2019 chief medical officer, in\u00a0a statement. \"Our 2024 report underscores that maternity care is still not prioritized in our country and there is an urgent need for systemic changes to improve outcomes for moms and babies in the U.S. and to ensure that these families have access to the care they need and deserve.\"\nWomen living in places without adequate maternity care face a 13% higher risk of preterm birth, among other health complications, the report says. The rates of inadequate prenatal care are higher among women of color and low-income women.\u00a0\u00a0\nRecent hospital closures and reductions in obstetric services have accelerated the spread of these deserts. Since the organization last published a report in 2022, more than 100 hospitals have closed their obstetric units. As a result, pregnant people have to travel farther for maternity care, or seek emergency services. Among the solutions the report suggested are mobile health centers, which provide maternal and infant health services to areas otherwise lacking them.\nA lack of OB-GYNs is adding to the problem, with physician burnout, lower reimbursement rates, and a desire for better work-life balance among the factors limiting the supply of specialists, according to a\u00a02022-published article\u00a0in the World Journal of Gynecology & Women\u2019s Health.\u00a0\nAnother more recent factor shaping the OB-GYN workforce\u00a0\u00a0is the shifting abortion landscape, as\u00a0Alejandra O\u2019Connell-Domenech\u00a0reported earlier this year for\u00a0The Hill.\u00a0The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn federal protections for abortion had led to declines in applications to OB/GYN residency programs \u201cfar more significantly in the\u00a013 states\u00a0that enacted complete abortion bans after the Dobbs ruling,\" according to\u00a0American Medical Association\u00a0research.\nCDC: Fetal mortality reaches historic low, but racial inequities persist\u00a0\nFetal deaths have reached a historic low, according to the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 newly\u00a0released 2022 report.\u00a0\u00a0\nWith so much public health and\u00a0media attention\u00a0focused on infant mortality, the latest measure \u2014 which looks at fetal deaths at 20 weeks gestation or more \u2014 marks progress on \u201ca major but often overlooked public health issue,\u201d the report notes.\u00a0\nThe fetal mortality rate dropped from 5.73 deaths per 1,000 births in 2021 to 5.48 in 2022, a 4% decline.\nBut a closer look within the numbers tells a different story of persistent disparities. For example, the most recent fetal mortality rate was highest for Black women and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders remains nearly twice that experienced by white women \u2014 about 10 deaths per 1,000 compared to five. The lowest rate was found among Asian females.\u00a0\nWhile the report does not explore reasons for the racial disparities, USA Today reporter\u00a0Eduardo Cuevas wrote\u00a0that experts have suggested overall \u201cracial health disparities, preexisting conditions, structural discrimination and access to quality care may be factors.\u201d\nUsha Ranji,\u00a0associate director for women\u2019s health policy at the research nonprofit KFF, also pointed to the \u201cweathering effect\u201d of stress and other factors that influence adverse health outcomes for Black mothers and other women of color.\u00a0\nFetal mortality rates were highest in Mississippi (6.22), Arkansas (5.38), and Alabama (5.21). New Mexico, Texas, Connecticut and Montana were among the states with the lowest rates.\nAmong the risk factors described in the report were maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, and pregnancies carrying more than one fetus. The measure does not include abortions.\u00a0\nFor adults on Medicaid, where you live affects your vision coverage\u00a0\nThere are major disparities in vision coverage nationwide for adults with Medicaid health insurance.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the overarching finding of a new analysis recently published in Health Affairs.\u00a0The findings offer a state-by-state analysis of adult Medicaid benefits for both fee-for-service and managed care plans.\u00a0\u00a0Among the most striking statistics: About 27% of adult Medicaid enrollees live in states without eyeglass coverage.\u00a0\nThe study, which was based on state Medicaid policies from 2022 to 2023, also noted that 12% of adults with Medicaid, or 6.5 million people, live in states that didn\u2019t cover routine eye exams. Even in the two-thirds of the states that did provide routine eye care, enrollees were required to pay a share of costs in some way.\u00a0\nWhile the federal government establishes overarching rules for Medicaid, the national health insurance for low-income adults and children, states run their own programs. That means they can modify their coverage policies, such as whether eye exams and eyeglasses for adults are fully covered. (For children, federal law provides for vision services, regardless of the state.)\u00a0\nThe study highlights a patchwork of coverage nationwide, with seven states offering no coverage for exams or glasses for adults.\u00a0\nThese coverage gaps translate into real-world health impacts. Eye exams are vital in identifying eye diseases early, when treatment can prevent vision loss. Exams are also vital for prescription glasses to correct refractive errors, the leading cause of vision impairment in the country. Paying for your own exam without insurance costs about $485, the study notes.\u00a0\n\u201cOur study clearly shows that there are opportunities to expand coverage of routine vision services at the state level, and based on previous research, we expect more generous coverage would reduce rates of vision impairment, improve quality of life, and promote health equity,\u201d said Brandy Lipton, the study\u2019s lead author and associate professor of health, society and behavior at the University of California, Irvine in a\u00a0release\u00a0on the findings.\u00a0\nHow AI can avoid embedded health bias\u00a0\u00a0\nThe data being used to build artificial intelligence could quickly compound the racial bias that already plagues the health care system, reports STAT\u2019s Katie Palmer in\u00a0the latest installment in the outlet\u2019s \u201cEmbedded Bias\u201d series.\nBut, the article asks, could these same new tech tools also deliver a better path forward?\u00a0\nFor example, Palmer describes how Olga Kravchenko, a biomedical informatician at the University of Pittsburgh, used ChatGPT to help identify patterns in ICU care. She found that patients labeled as Native American and Caucasian were more likely to use a ventilator compared to other racial groups. The reasons for the disparity are unknown but experts theorized that Indigenous Americans might arrive to the ICU sicker, while white patients might be given privileged access to ventilators.\n\u201cThe answers to those questions are rarely clear,\u201d Palmer writes. \u201cBut asking why a racial disparity appears in data is a critical step to ensuring that its signal doesn\u2019t get misused in a predictive algorithm, for example, that helps hospitals determine who\u2019s most likely to benefit from a limited supply of ventilators.\u201d\nWith so much bias already baked into today\u2019s health care data, solutions are complicated. One idea: \u201ca \u2018bias glossary\u2019 for every medical dataset, a summary of the data distortions that responsible model developers should be careful to avoid.\u201d\nThis month, the journal\u00a0npj Digital Medicine also explored \u201cfundamental shortcomings\u201d in health care AI, and the challenges inherent in new models \u2014 such as \u201cbias exhaust,\u201d or the residual biases in AI that emerge from actual systemic discrepancies in care. Even though a new AI tool might appear accurate in a controlled testing environment, that might not translate to patient care at the bedside, the authors explain. They also point to the importance of providing developers \u201cdiverse, comprehensive clinical datasets to train models on actual patient populations and scenarios.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re reading\nRelated Articles\nThe Center for Health Journalism at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism \n734 W.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Access to Care Ranking 2024\n\nThe Access Ranking indicates the level of access to mental health care within a state, including insurance, treatment, quality and cost of insurance, special education, and mental health workforce availability. A high Access Ranking (1-13) means a state provides more access to insurance and mental health treatment compared to those ranked 39-51.\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness. In 2022, 64% of uninsured adults cited affordability as the reason. The state prevalence ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\n76.9% of adults with a substance use disorder did not receive needed treatment. Reasons include self-management beliefs (75.4%), not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop using substances (48.4%), cost concerns (47.7%), and lack of knowledge on how or where to get treatment (47.3%). State prevalence ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\n10.2% of adults with a mental illness had private insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems. State prevalence ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\n24.58% of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days each month could not see a doctor due to costs, a 2% increase from last year. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness cited cost as a barrier to receiving care. State prevalence ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive mental health treatment. In 2022, 48.3% reported an unmet need for treatment, with reasons including self-management beliefs (86.9%), stigma (59.8%), privacy concerns (57.8%), and lack of knowledge on how or where to get treatment (55.5%). State prevalence ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\n8.5% of youth with private insurance lack coverage for mental or emotional difficulties, affecting over 1 million youth. State prevalence ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024\n\nOnly 0.667% of students are identified with an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP). The rate is shown per 1,000 students, with state rates ranging from 28.01 per 1,000 in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 in Alabama.\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. As of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, with only 27% of the need being met. The state rate ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The Health Divide: The maternity care crisis worsens, plus stubborn gaps in U.S. fetal mortality rates\n\nMore than 35% of U.S. counties are 'maternity care deserts,' affecting over 2.3 million women of reproductive age who live in counties without a birthing facility or obstetric clinician, according to the March of Dimes' 2024 report. States with the highest percentages of counties lacking maternity care include North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. Dr. Amanda Williams, March of Dimes\u2019 chief medical officer, emphasized the urgent need for systemic changes to improve outcomes for moms and babies in the U.S.\n\nWomen in these areas face a 13% higher risk of preterm birth and other health complications. The rates of inadequate prenatal care are higher among women of color and low-income women. Since 2022, over 100 hospitals have closed their obstetric units, forcing pregnant individuals to travel farther for care or seek emergency services. Solutions suggested include mobile health centers.\n\nA lack of OB-GYNs, driven by factors like physician burnout, lower reimbursement rates, and a desire for better work-life balance, exacerbates the problem. The shifting abortion landscape, particularly after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn federal protections for abortion, has also led to declines in OB/GYN residency applications, especially in the 13 states with complete abortion bans.\n\nCDC: Fetal mortality reaches historic low, but racial inequities persist\n\nFetal deaths have reached a historic low, with the rate dropping from 5.73 deaths per 1,000 births in 2021 to 5.48 in 2022, a 4% decline. However, disparities persist, with the highest rates among Black women and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, nearly twice that of white women. The lowest rate was among Asian females. Factors contributing to these disparities include racial health disparities, preexisting conditions, structural discrimination, and access to quality care.\n\nFetal mortality rates were highest in Mississippi (6.22), Arkansas (5.38), and Alabama (5.21), and lowest in New Mexico, Texas, Connecticut, and Montana. Risk factors include maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, and multiple pregnancies.\n\nFor adults on Medicaid, where you live affects your vision coverage\n\nA new analysis in Health Affairs highlights major disparities in vision coverage for adults with Medicaid. About 27% of adult Medicaid enrollees live in states without eyeglass coverage, and 12% live in states that don\u2019t cover routine eye exams. Even in states that provide routine eye care, enrollees often have to share costs.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of eye exams in identifying diseases early and providing prescription glasses. Without insurance, an eye exam costs about $485. Expanding coverage could reduce vision impairment rates, improve quality of life, and promote health equity.\n\nHow AI can avoid embedded health bias\n\nArtificial intelligence could compound existing racial biases in healthcare, but it also has the potential to offer better solutions. For example, Olga Kravchenko used ChatGPT to identify patterns in ICU care, finding disparities in ventilator use among different racial groups. Addressing why these disparities appear is crucial to prevent misuse in predictive algorithms.\n\nThe journal npj Digital Medicine discusses the 'bias exhaust' in AI, where residual biases from systemic discrepancies in care affect new models. Providing developers with diverse, comprehensive clinical datasets is essential for training models on actual patient populations and scenarios.",
