Volatility : 53.17% (As of Oct. 29, 2024)\nView and export this data going back to 2010. Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\n\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap. Note that \"N/A\" values will not show up in the chart.\n\nTesla's Volatility Distribution in the Vehicles & Parts Industry\nFor the Vehicles & Parts industry and Consumer Cyclical sector, Tesla's Volatility distribution charts can be found below:\n* The bar in red indicates where Tesla's Volatility falls into.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Calculation\nThe annualized volatility is calculated as following:\n\u03c3A=\u03c3M*\u221a12=\u221a 1/(n-1) \u2211(Ri - R')^2*\u221a12\nWhere: \u03c3M is the monthly volatility, n is the number of months in the period, Ri is the security's historical monthly returns and R' is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns.\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD.\n* For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

This was in direct response to the Bank of Japan hiking interest rates. The interest rate hikes wiped out trillions of dollars worth of market capitalization across big tech. However, Tesla stock\u2019s share price has since recovered, gaining 8.04% over the past five days.\nI have taken a definitively bullish stance on companies like TSLA due to the falling volatility in the market. The sharp sell-off was characteristically fueled by panic. And many market bargains are ready to be scooped up by investors during this volatile time period.\nI give Tesla stock a buy rating due to its projected earnings and revenue increases that are on the horizon. Also, I\u2019ll delineate a sell case for Tesla stock. This will provide a balanced view of the firm\u2019s opportunities and risks in the market.\nTesla\u2019s Cyclical Wobbles and New Models\nDespite Tesla\u2019s \u201cdifficult environment,\u201d the company actually managed to exceed my expectations for its recent quarterly results in some cases. Therefore, I take a contrarian stance with Tesla stock. Many factors were cyclically affecting other electric vehicle (EV stocks) too. This includes a lack of semiconductor chips from firms such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm still managed to beat analyst expectations and achieve record quarterly revenues of $25.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year (YOY). However, it\u2019s also true that its earnings fell 43% to 52 cents per share. Therefore, it missed analyst expectations by a wide margin.\nWhere my contrarian case takes hold is in Tesla\u2019s plans for new vehicles. That includes more affordable models such as its $25,000 entry-level Redwood model. It remains on track for production in the first half of 2025. Over time, Tesla\u2019s market share has come under attack by far cheaper Chinese-made EVs. Autos produced by Byd Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) currently dominate the Asian market. Yet, consider the 10,000 vehicle production target for TSLA\u2019s Redwood model. Additionally, the company expects profitability for its Cybertruck near the end of the year. These factors shape Tesla into a position of strong recovery. Also, it provides more equal footing with its budget competitor.\nBullish Technical Momentum\nWhile Tesla stock might have disappointed the market with its earnings, I see several indicators pointing to bullish momentum in the short term. And this is evidenced by strong signs in the options market for Tesla\u2019s put and call contracts. Particularly important is the open interest for the August 16 expiration, which is this Friday. The put/call open interest ratio is 0.61, showing significantly more open interest in calls compared to puts. The implied volatility of 6.45% may suggest that investors will be in for a much smoother ride this week compared to previous ones, largely in part of the VIX falling 62.23% over the past five days.\nAnother bullish signal is that after Tesla stock dipped into oversold territory on August 7, momentum has steadily risen over the past trading session. Also, investors can find underlying strength in terms of volume. This could potentially signal a bullish reversal in the near future. However, relatively little interest is being shown TSLA by bulls or bears. So, I see a gradual upward climb for Tesla stock as opposed to violent swings in its valuation.\nReasons to Sell\nDespite my bullishness of Tesla\u2019s prospects, a compelling sell case can be made from Tesla bears. Investorplace author Faizan Farooque recently wrote that the company\u2019s aggressive price cuts have led to shrinking profit margins. And gross margins dropped from 23.8% to 17.6%, and operating margin fell from 16% to 8.2%.\nAdditionally, I believe that due to the persistent undercutting by Chinese EV makers and Tesla\u2019s efforts to keep up, it is undergoing a bit of an identity crisis. For some, Tesla stock is synonymous with American-made quality (and luxurious) EV vehicles.\nTo me, an appeal to Tesla is its luxury and high technology, but as the features of EVs become more commoditized over time, there could be less differentiating features across EVs as a whole to make a specific Tesla model stand out and justify the higher price tag. So, Tesla must create its own edge in the market and not become another me-too brand. Otherwise, it becomes a race to the bottom, and that\u2019s not a competition that Tesla will ever win against its Chinese competitors.\nHowever, I maintain my buy rating for Tesla stock as it adapts to the nascent EV market. It might no longer be considered a high-end vehicle in the future. Yet, its R&D efforts can put it on the bleeding edge of the most modern vehicles. This is especially true for its cars that rest in the higher tiers such as the Cybertruck. These polarizing and unique designs may be a hint of what we can expect from the company in the future.\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business.

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nKenneth Dorell\ninvestor@meta.com\u00a0/ investor.fb.com\nPress:\nRyan Moore\npress@meta.com\u00a0/ about.fb.com/news/\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConstant Currency\nMicrosoft presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the average exchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. All growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in the last fiscal year. Microsoft has provided this non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding our performance. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue\nOperating Income\nNet Income\nDiluted Earnings per Share\n2023 As Reported (GAAP)\n$56,189\n$24,254\n$20,081\n$2.69\n2024 As Reported (GAAP)\n$64,727\n$27,925\n$22,036\n$2.95\nPercentage Change Y/Y (GAAP)\n15%\n15%\n10%\n10%\nConstant Currency Impact\n$(345)\n$(218)\n$(269)\n$(0.04)\nPercentage Change Y/Y Constant Currency\n16%\n16%\n11%\n11%\nTwelve Months Ended June 30,\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue\nOperating Income\nNet Income\nDiluted Earnings per Share\n2023 As Reported (GAAP)\n$211,915\n$88,523\n$72,361\n$9.68\n2023 As Adjusted (non-GAAP)\n$211,915\n$89,694\n$73,307\n$9.81\n2024 As Reported (GAAP)\n$245,122\n$109,433\n$88,136\n$11.80\nPercentage Change Y/Y (GAAP)\n16%\n24%\n22%\n22%\nPercentage Change Y/Y (non-GAAP)\n16%\n22%\n20%\n20%\nConstant Currency Impact\n$900\n$717\n$312\n$0.04\nPercentage Change Y/Y Constant Currency\n15%\n23%\n21%\n21%\nPercentage Change Y/Y (non-GAAP) Constant Currency\n15%\n21%\n20%\n20%\nSegment Revenue Constant Currency Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n($ in millions)\nProductivity and Business Processes\nIntelligent Cloud\nMore Personal Computing\n2023 As Reported (GAAP)\n$18,291\n$23,993\n$13,905\n2024 As Reported (GAAP)\n$20,317\n$28,515\n$15,895\nPercentage Change Y/Y (GAAP)\n11%\n19%\n14%\nConstant Currency Impact\n$(106)\n$(174)\n$(65)\nPercentage Change Y/Y Constant Currency\n12%\n20%\n15%\nSelected Product and Service Revenue Constant Currency Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\nPercentage Change Y/Y (GAAP)\nConstant Currency Impact\nPercentage Change Y/Y Constant Currency\nMicrosoft Cloud\n21%\n1%\n22%\nOffice Commercial products and cloud services\n12%\n1%\n13%\nOffice 365 Commercial\n13%\n1%\n14%\nOffice Consumer products and cloud services\n3%\n1%\n4%\nLinkedIn\n10%\n(1)%\n9%\nDynamics products and cloud services\n16%\n0%\n16%\nDynamics 365\n19%\n1%\n20%\nServer products and cloud services\n21%\n1%\n22%\nAzure and other cloud services\n29%\n1%\n30%\nWindows\n7%\n1%\n8%\nWindows OEM\n4%\n0%\n4%\nWindows Commercial products and cloud services\n11%\n1%\n12%\nDevices\n(11)%\n2%\n(9)%\nXbox content and services\n61%\n0%\n61%\nSearch and news advertising excluding traffic acquisition costs\n19%\n0%\n19%\nAbout Microsoft\nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \u201cMSFT\u201d @microsoft) creates platforms and tools powered by AI to deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers.

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConstant Currency\nMicrosoft presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the average exchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. All growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in the last fiscal year. Microsoft has provided this non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding our performance. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue\nOperating Income\nNet Income\nDiluted Earnings per Share\n2023 As Reported (GAAP)\n$56,189\n$24,254\n$20,081\n$2.69\n2024 As Reported (GAAP)\n$64,727\n$27,925\n$22,036\n$2.95\nPercentage Change Y/Y (GAAP)\n15%\n15%\n10%\n10%\nConstant Currency Impact\n$(345)\n$(218)\n$(269)\n$(0.04)\nPercentage Change Y/Y Constant Currency\n16%\n16%\n11%\n11%\nTwelve Months Ended June 30,\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue\nOperating Income\nNet Income\nDiluted Earnings per Share\n2023 As Reported (GAAP)\n$211,915\n$88,523\n$72,361\n$9.68\n2023 As Adjusted (non-GAAP)\n$211,915\n$89,694\n$73,307\n$9.81\n2024 As Reported (GAAP)\n$245,122\n$109,433\n$88,136\n$11.80\nPercentage Change Y/Y (GAAP)\n16%\n24%\n22%\n22%\nPercentage Change Y/Y (non-GAAP)\n16%\n22%\n20%\n20%\nConstant Currency Impact\n$900\n$717\n$312\n$0.04\nPercentage Change Y/Y Constant Currency\n15%\n23%\n21%\n21%\nPercentage Change Y/Y (non-GAAP) Constant Currency\n15%\n21%\n20%\n20%\nSegment Revenue Constant Currency Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n($ in millions)\nProductivity and Business Processes\nIntelligent Cloud\nMore Personal Computing\n2023 As Reported (GAAP)\n$18,291\n$23,993\n$13,905\n2024 As Reported (GAAP)\n$20,317\n$28,515\n$15,895\nPercentage Change Y/Y (GAAP)\n11%\n19%\n14%\nConstant Currency Impact\n$(106)\n$(174)\n$(65)\nPercentage Change Y/Y Constant Currency\n12%\n20%\n15%\nSelected Product and Service Revenue Constant Currency Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\nPercentage Change Y/Y (GAAP)\nConstant Currency Impact\nPercentage Change Y/Y Constant Currency\nMicrosoft Cloud\n21%\n1%\n22%\nOffice Commercial products and cloud services\n12%\n1%\n13%\nOffice 365 Commercial\n13%\n1%\n14%\nOffice Consumer products and cloud services\n3%\n1%\n4%\nLinkedIn\n10%\n(1)%\n9%\nDynamics products and cloud services\n16%\n0%\n16%\nDynamics 365\n19%\n1%\n20%\nServer products and cloud services\n21%\n1%\n22%\nAzure and other cloud services\n29%\n1%\n30%\nWindows\n7%\n1%\n8%\nWindows OEM\n4%\n0%\n4%\nWindows Commercial products and cloud services\n11%\n1%\n12%\nDevices\n(11)%\n2%\n(9)%\nXbox content and services\n61%\n0%\n61%\nSearch and news advertising excluding traffic acquisition costs\n19%\n0%\n19%\nAbout Microsoft\nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \u201cMSFT\u201d @microsoft) creates platforms and tools powered by AI to deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers.

For the 12-month's ending March 2024, dividends set a record $593.1 billion payments, up 3.4% on an aggregate basis from the prior 12-month March 2023's $573.7 billion.\nTotal shareholders return of buybacks and dividends increased to $388.4 billion in Q1 2024,\u00a0up 4.1% from Q4 2023's $373.2 billion and up 7.2% from Q1 2023's $362.3 billion. Total shareholder returns for the 12-months ending March 2024 decreased 1.5% to $1.410 trillion from the prior 12-month March 2023's $1.431 trillion.\nThe 1% tax on net buybacks, which started in 2023, reduced the Q1 2024 S&P 500 operating earnings by 0.47%, up from Q4 2023's 0.44% impact, and As Reported GAAP earnings by 0.54% up from the prior 0.50%; for the 12-month March 2024 period they reduced earnings 0.41% for operating and 0.46% for As Reported.\n\"The share count impact on EPS increased for the first time after five consecutive quarters of declines as companies increased their overall buyback expenditure by 8%, which countered the impact of both share issuance and employee options being exercised. While\u00a0buybacks supported share price, 13.3% of the issues saw a significant increase (of at least 4%) in their EPS due to share count reduction, compared to 18.5% in Q1 2023. For Q1 2024, more issues did buybacks and spent more. While the 13.3% remains lower than the 17.5% average and pales compared to the almost 25% rate posted in Q1 2019, the increase comes after five quarters of declines, and hints to a forward upswing. Companies with strong cashflows continued to aggressively do buybacks, as the top 20 issues accounted for 50.9% of the buybacks in Q1 2024,\" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\"Given the market's current expectations for interest rates to decline later in the year and the continued uncertainty over geopolitical and domestic issues, companies may be shy to finance buybacks going forward as discretionary buybacks, which reduce share count, may need to be financed from ongoing operations. Top-tier cash-flow issues however are seen as continuing their buybacks and positively impacting their EPS.\"\n1% Buyback Excise Tax:\nThe 1% excise tax on net buybacks reduced Q1 2024 operating earnings by 0.47%, up from Q4 2023's 0.44% and up from the 0.45% for Q1 2023. The 12-month impact was 0.41%, up from 2023's 40% and down from the proforma 2022 of 0.51%. The tax on As Reported GAAP earnings impact increased to 0.54%, up from the Q4 2023 0.50% and up from the Q1 2023 0.49%. The 12-month impact was 0.46%, up from 2023's 0.45% and down from the proforma 2022 0.58%.\nSilverblatt added: \"The 1% tax remains an expense but has not impacted overall buybacks at this point. However, given the initial 1% buyback tax had bipartisan support and remains an attractive cash generator for the government, there is an expectation that some increase or potential change to the type of buybacks that are taxed will remain on the table following the election cycle. Given the current corporate sensitivity to costs, a buyback tax rate of 2%-to-2.5% was seen as impacting both buybacks and the EPS impact of share-count-reduction (which is already at a lower level due to high stock prices). This is because some of the expenditures may shift from buybacks to dividends. However, any shift would not be on a-dollar-for-dollar basis as dividends remain a long-term pure cash-flow item which must be incorporated into corporate budgets.\"\nQ1 2024 GICS\u00ae Sector Analysis:\nInformation Technology maintained its lead in buybacks, representing 24.2% of all buybacks for the quarter. Q1 2024 expenditures increased 1.8% to $57.3 billion, compared to Q4 2023's $56.3 billion, it was up 24.8% from Q1 2023's $45.9 billion expenditure. For the 12-months ending March 2024, the sector decreased their expenditure 11.4% to $209.3 billion, representing 25.6% of all S&P 500 buybacks, compared to $236.3 billion spent in the prior 12-month period ending March 2023, which represented 27.6% of all buybacks.\nFinancials increased their buybacks by 46.5%\u00a0for Q1 2024 as they spent $43.1 billion on buybacks, accounting for 18.2% of all S&P 500 buybacks. This was up for the quarter compared to Q4 2023's expenditure of $29.4 billion, but down from Q1 2023's $46.9 billion. For the 12-month March 2024 period, Financials spent $134.5 billion, up from $113.6 billion for the prior 12-month period.\nHealthcare significantly increased their Q1 2024 expenditure by 93.5%, spending $25.5 billion, compared to the Q4 2023 expenditure of $13.2 billion and up 10.0% from the Q1 2023 $23.2 billion expenditure.

For the quarter, the company spent $23.5 billion, up from Q4 2023's $22.7 billion (the 10th largest in index history). Apple holds 18 of the top 20 record quarters (Meta Platforms holds #14 and QUALCOMM holds #16). For the 12-months ending March 2024, Apple spent $87.4 billion on buybacks, down from the prior 12-month period's $91.1 billion. Over the five-year period Apple has spent $429 billion, and $664 billion over the ten-year period.\nMeta Platforms (META): $18.2 billion for Q1 2024, up from the $8.2 billion in Q4 2023; the 12-month

We test these views by examining US stock buyback announcements data, and find little evidence to support these claims. There is some evidence that share buybacks are announced following a short-term period of stock price declines, which could either represent opportunistic purchasing at an attractive price or an attempt by management to stem the decline. However, on the whole, companies that announce share buybacks appear to have stronger-than-average fundamentals and long-term stock performance exceeding the market, with excess profits and cash flows that could reasonably be returned to shareholders.\nCorporate stock buybacks in the US have grown in frequency and size over the past decades (see Figure 1 below), leading to a host of concerns from\u00a0market\u00a0commentators. Among the most frequent concerns are that share purchases may be artificially propping up equity prices, suppressing market volatility, and weakening corporate balance sheets to name a few. In this\u00a0Street View, we test these views by examining nearly 25 years of US stock buyback announcements, and find little evidence to support the aforementioned concerns.\nThis\u00a0Street View\u00a0is structured as follows:\nWe performed our study on Russell 3000 Index constituents2\u00a0over a period spanning from Jan 1st, 1998 to Apr 30th, 2019. We used Bloomberg to obtain the list of share buyback announcement dates for these stocks over the period of study. There were a total of 9,698 buyback announcements,3\u00a0though accounting for multiple announcements from the same company in the same month resulted in 7,327 unique buyback events.\nWe base all the results presented in sections 3 and 4 on idiosyncratic returns to the Russell 3000 constituents relative to a CAPM-style risk model (i.e., after adjusting for the estimated market beta of each stock).\u00a04\nWe start by investigating the claim that companies tend to announce buybacks when their stock prices are declining or amid rising volatility, potentially as an attempt by management to support prices and/or reduce stock volatility. To test how past stock performance may affect the probability of a buyback announcement in the subsequent month, we use a logistic regression model5\u00a0to estimate the probability of a firm announcing a share buyback in the next month conditional on two measures of trailing performance:6\nWe split our analysis into two discrete periods: before and after the Global Financial Crisis,7\u00a0as we found notable differences in their results. To account for time-varying dispersion in the returns and volatilities of individual stocks, we also transform the historical Sharpe ratios and volatility ratios for all 3,000 stocks within each calendar month into cross-sectional z-scores before fitting the logistic regressions over all stock-month observations in each period.\nThe table below shows the z-scores quantifying the statistical significance of the dependence of the likelihood of a stock buyback announcement on the two measures of past performance we described above. A score with an absolute value greater than 2.0 roughly denotes a statistically significant relationship. A positive (negative) value of the score implies that the higher the value of the predictor, the higher (lower) the likelihood of a buyback announcement in the next month.\nA handful of key results from Table 1 deserve highlighting:\nWe can check the robustness of these regression results by also looking at the empirical frequency of buyback announcements for stock-month observations with historical Sharpe ratio or volatility ratio z-scores falling into particular narrow ranges, and plotting those empirical frequencies against the estimated probability from our logistic regression. Figure 2 shows these plots for the post-GFC period with a 36-month lookback window for both stock performance metrics. Again, there are a handful of results to highlight:\n\nMore broadly, these results suggest that buybacks tend to come from firms with strong long-term performance whose share prices had recently hit a rough patch, but without much rise in volatility. This provides some support for the hypothesis that management tends to opportunistically announce buybacks when shares appear undervalued, or as a short-term price support.8\nThe post-GFC data especially does not support the hypothesis that share buybacks have been suppressing broader market volatility, as buybacks tend to be announced more often by firms with level or declining volatility compared to history. However, this finding does not rule out the counterfactual possibility that firms announcing buybacks avoided a rise in share price volatility that would have otherwise occurred. To investigate the potential impact of share buybacks on the broader market\u2019s returns and volatility, we now turn to analyzing the average impact on share prices before and after the announcement.\nBy performing an event time study, we estimated the cumulative average abnormal returns (CAAR) in excess of the market earned by Russell 3000 Index constituents that announce a share buyback over the period immediately preceding and following the announcement month. Our results, in Figure 3, suggest that while a typical buyback announcer is selling off in the six months leading up to the buyback announcement (as shown in the previous section), the post-announcement recovery is relatively weak.\nLeading up to the buyback announcement, the average announcer\u2019s share price has been selling off, with noticeably larger negative CAAR for the pre-GFC period than post-GFC. This squares with the logistic regression results in Table 1: both periods show that buybacks tend to be more likely following a six-month period with a negative idiosyncratic returns Sharpe ratio, but the pre-GFC period also shows buybacks tend to follow rising idiosyncratic volatility, while there is no such effect in the post-GFC period. As the historical Sharpe ratio measure used in this study divides the average idiosyncratic returns by the idiosyncratic volatility, the larger denominator (from rising volatility) in the pre-GFC period suggests we should also see more strongly negative returns in the numerator.\nThe announcement month itself shows a positive market response, with roughly 0.5-0.75% average excess returns in both the pre- and post-GFC datasets.9\u00a0Here, the results from the two periods diverge again, as buyback announcers do not recover any further on average over the pre-GFC period, while the postGFC period shows an average recovery roughly to the pre-selloff level. Although the total trough-to-peak recovery for buyback announcers in the post-GFC period appears strongly statistically significant,10\u00a0the total CAAR from the beginning of the sell-off to six months after the announcement is less than 0.5% and not statistically significant.11\u00a0While the buyback announcement does appear to provide share price support in the more recent dataset, the recovery to pre-selloff levels suggests that buybacks on average do not appear to lead to \u201cartificially\u201d elevated valuations.12\nFigure 3 implies a stark difference in the recovery of a stock\u2019s price after a share buyback announcement across the pre and post GFC periods. This could point to the possibility of markets becoming more efficient in pricing a buyback announcement over recent years that now leads to quicker price recovery than what is observed pre GFC. Many other possibilities exist, such as a significant change in financial regulation post GFC, changes in market structure due to an increased flow of capital into quantitative trading strategies, and etc. This difference is an interesting question in itself and we defer its investigation to a future\u00a0Street View.\nWe now turn to the effects on share price volatility, with Figure 4 presenting the average daily idiosyncratic volatility of a buyback announcer over the twelve months preceding and following the announcement month. As suggested by the regression results in Section 3, the pre-GFC period shows a rise in short-term volatility in the months leading up to the buyback announcement, while this effect is much less clear in the post-GFC data. Volatility spikes in the announcement month for both periods as the market digests the news, with a positive average outcome as seen in Figure 3.\nHowever, share price volatility is not suppressed after a buyback is announced. In fact, the average level of idiosyncratic volatility post-announcement is slightly higher than the preannouncement volatility in both the pre- and post-GFC periods.13\u00a0We note that this effect is actually in the direction that a simple corporate finance model would suggest, as a share buyback should increase the leverage of a company\u2019s equity while leaving the underlying business risk unchanged, thus boosting the expected equity volatility.\nFinally, we want to take a deeper look at the fundamental characteristics of companies that announce share buybacks versus the broader market, to see if the data supports beliefs that companies are significantly weakening their balance sheets or foregoing worthwhile investment to return capital. To test for significant differences between firms announcing a buyback and the average Russell 3000 firm, we used the style factor definitions from MSCI Barra\u2019s most recent US risk model: the US Total Market Equity Trading Model. These style factor exposures per stock provide point-in-time scores for how each individual stock compares to the rest of the US market on a large number of dimensions, including technical factors such as momentum, beta, and residual volatility; fundamental factors such as firm profitability, earnings quality (mostly driven by cash earnings being in line with accounting earnings), and leverage; and measures combining market prices and fundamentals such as valuation metrics and market capitalization.\nWe investigated which characteristics most strongly differentiated buyback announcers from the rest of the market by comparing the distribution of scores (or loadings) on each style factor for stocks on the day before their buyback announcements to the loadings of all the stocks in our study. We performed a difference-of-means test between the two distributions to determine which style factor loadings showed statistically significant differences from the market as a whole, and the results of this analysis for the factors with the most significant differences between the buyback announcers and the broad market are presented in Figure 5 below.\nStocks announcing a share buyback tend to have significantly stronger fundamentals than average, with higher scores on Earnings Yield (i.e., lower price-to-earnings ratio), Earnings Quality (i.e., more cash earnings), and Profitability (i.e., higher return on equity and return on assets). These firms also tend to be larger (positive Size and Mid-Cap loadings), with lower Leverage and lower market-implied risk (both lower Beta and lower Residual Volatility).\nThese results suggest that corporations buying back stock are exactly those with the greatest ability to return cash to shareholders while still supporting future growth, and provide little evidence that the firms are endangering themselves through excess leverage to fund the capital returns.\nContrary to the worst claims about share buybacks, we find little evidence from our large-scale study of individual buyback announcements that they are artificially suppressing market volatility or requiring companies to forgo otherwise profitable investments or take on excess leverage. There is some evidence that share buybacks are announced following a short-term period of stock price declines, which could either represent opportunistic purchasing at an attractive price or an attempt by management to stem the decline.14\u00a0However, on the whole, companies that announce share buybacks appear to have stronger-than-average fundamentals and long-term stock performance exceeding the market, with excess profits and cash flows that could reasonably be returned to shareholders.\nOur study points towards a noticeable difference in the extent of post buyback announcement price recovery across the pre and post GFC periods. One could think of a few\u00a0a priori\u00a0explanations for this difference (that we mention in Section 4); we pose this as an open question to the wider Financial Economics research community and plan to revisit this topic in a future\u00a0Street View.\nTags\nReferences\nStephen Gandel. \u201cAdd Stock Buybacks to the Causes of the Market Downturn.\u201d Bloomberg.

      "The essential resource for\u00a0\nthe global Bio/Pharmaceutical\nmanufacturing value chain\nMaking the Innovation Cut: New Drug Approvals Thus Far in 2024\nMaking the Innovation Cut: New Drug Approvals Thus Far in 2024\nHow is product innovation faring in the bio/pharma industry thus far in 2024? Through the end of October, FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has approved 38 new drugs. Which companies \u00a0and products have made the cut, and which may be best poised for market success?\nBy Patricia Van Arnum, Editorial Director, DCAT, pvanarnum@dcat.org\nNew drug approvals thus far in 2024Although not following a strictly chronological path, examining the pace of new drug approvals is an important measure of product innovation in the bio/pharma industry. Through the end of October (as of October 31, 2024), the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) had approved 38 new molecular entities (NMEs) and biological therapeutics, compared to 46 new drugs approved through October 2023.\nLast year (2023) saw an uptick in new drug approvals compared to 2022, which was a recent dip in new drug approvals. In 2023, FDA\u2019s CDER approved 55 NMEs and new biological therapeutics, a 49% increase in the number of new drug approvals compared to 2022, when 37 new drugs were approved. The 55 new drugs approved in 2023 by FDA\u2019s CDER was in line with recent years. In 2021, 50 NMEs and new biological therapeutics were approved and 53 in 2020. The 55 new drugs approved in 2023 represented the second highest level of approvals in the past decade, except for 2018 when 59 new drugs were approved (see Figure 1).\nSmall molecules versus biologicsAnother important trend to look at is the product mix of new drug approvals. Of the 38 new drug approvals thus far in 2024 (as of October 31, 2024), 26, or 68%, were small molecules (24 drugs and two diagnostic/imaging agents), and 12, or 32%, were biologics. That is on par with the mix in 2023, when FDA\u2019s CDER approved 17 new biological therapeutics, which represented 31% of new drug approvals, and 38 small-molecule products or 69% of new drug approvals (see Figure 2).\nThe percentage of small-molecule approvals in 2023 was in line with recent years, except in 2022, which represented a recent low. In 2022, 59% of the new drug approvals by FDA\u2019s CDER were small molecules or 22 of the 37 new drug approved. Between 2018 and 2021, small molecules averaged 74% of new drug approvals. In 2021, small molecules represented 72% of new drug approvals, 75% in 2020,\u00a0 79% in 2019, and 71% in 2018.\nThe decrease in small molecules\u2019 share of new drug approvals in 2022 was largely due to the overall decline in new drug approvals in 2022 and a corresponding decline in small-molecule drug approvals and a rise in new biologic drug approvals. In 2022, FDA\u2019s CDER approved 22 new small-molecule drugs and 15 new biologics. The 17 new biologics approved in 2023 surpassed 2022 levels and matched a recent high in 2018, when 17 new biologics were approved by FDA\u2019s CDER, far exceeding biologic approvals of 14 in 2021, 13 in 2020, and 10 in 2019.\nLarge bio/pharma companies versus mid-tier/small companiesThe quantity of new drug approvals, alone, is not a singular measure of product innovation, but tracking it show some interesting trends, notably the increasing contribution of small bio/pharma companies, particularly in the small-molecule drug space. \u00a0\nOf the 38 new drugs approved thus far in 2024, 13, or 34%, were from large companies (defined as the top 25 bio/pharma companies based on 2023 revenues and one large medical technology company with approval of a diagnostic agent), and 25, or 66%, were from mid-sized or small companies. In looking at product mix, biologics accounted for more than half (54%) of new drug approvals by the large companies, but only 20% from mid-sized-to-small companies.\nThe large bio/pharma companies have had seven new biological therapeutics approved thus far in 2024 and five small-molecule drugs. For purposes of this analysis, new biological therapeutics only include those approved by FDA\u2019s CDER, which reviews and approves new molecular entities and new biological therapeutics. Other biologic-based products, including blood products, vaccines, allergenics, tissues, and cellular and gene therapies, are reviewed and approved by a separate center within FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\nSo which companies made the cut in biologics? The seven biologics approved from the large bio/pharma companies were: Amgen\u2019s Imdelltra (tarlatamab-dlle) for treating extensive-stage small cell lung cancer; Astellas\u2019 Vyloy (zolbetuximab-clzb) for treating gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, a rare type of cancer of the esophagus; Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Ebglyss (lebrikizumab-lbkz) for treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema); Lilly\u2019s Kisunla (donanemab-azbt) for treating early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease;\u00a0 Merck & Co.\u2019s Winrevair (sotatercept-csrk) for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare disease in which blood vessels in the lungs thicken and narrow, causing strain on the heart; \u00a0Pfizer\u2019s Hympavzi (marstacimab-hncq) for preventing or reducing bleeding episodes related to hemophilia A or B; and Roche\u2019s Piasky (crovalimab-akkz) for treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare blood disorder.\nThe five small-molecule drug approvals from the large bio/pharmaceutical companies were: AstraZeneca\u2019s Voydeya (danicopan) for treating extravascular hemolysis with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disease; Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Cobenfy (xanomeline and trospium chloride) for treating schizophrenia; Gilead Sciences\u2019 Livdelzi (seladelpar) for treating primary biliary cholangitis, a chronic autoimmune disease that damages the liver\u2019s bile ducts, causing a buildup of bile and toxins;\u00a0 Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Lazcluze (lazertinib) for treating non-small cell lung cancer; Roche\u2019s Itovebi (inavolisib) for treating locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In addition, GE Healthcare gained FDA approval for Flyrcado (flurpiridaz F 18), a radioactive diagnostic drug to evaluate for myocardial ischemia and infarction.\nMid-tier & small bio/pharma companies: new drug approvalsSmall-molecules by far dominated new approvals from mid-sized to small companies, with many of the drugs indicated for rare diseases. Below is a roundup of small-molecule drug approvals from mid-sized and small companies thus far this year (as of October 31, 2024):\nOn the biologics side, small-to-mid-sized bio/pharma companies have had five biologics approved thus far in 2024.

Why has the society not made faster progress on cancer front? Why do discoveries in biotechnology sector occur in fits and spurts? We claim that this slow and sporadic progress has a lot to do with the vagaries of capital markets. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s begin with a success story. There is little doubt that BioNTech (Pfizer), Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines had a profound impact on the developed world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Without them, countless more lives and trillions of dollars of economic value would have been further lost. The stock prices of these companies reached dramatic peaks after the world learned about their success. However, as of this week, they have already shed 50% of their peak market values, while we are still in the midst of the pandemic. This rapid rise and fall of these biotechnology stocks is not just about the Covid-vaccine stocks but also about the fortunes of the biotechnology sector as a whole. We describe this roller-coaster phenomenon in this post and claim that this phenomenon is not healthy for the society, particularly given the aging population and increasing need for new healthcare solutions.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnology\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\nContrary to popular beliefs, most of the new drugs or vaccines are not discovered by big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer or Merck. The development chain of a new life-science product can be divided into several phases: synthesis (discovery of a molecule or formulation), initial research (preclinical tests in lab and trials on animals), and development (human trials). The initial steps are typically taken by individual scientists, biotechnology start-ups, and research labs of universities. Those early-stage discoveries, their patents, or the discovering companies themselves, are then bought by the big pharmaceutical companies. The later steps in the development chain require numerous approvals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is numerous long and costly processes, that can only be done by big pharma. The next steps after FDA approval can also be undertaken only by big pharma: creation of brands through massive advertising campaigns, putting and scaling up manufacturing capabilities, and distribution of drugs using extensive vendor network. Small companies can try, but the likelihood of success is low given their lack of experience and capabilities in these areas. For example, Novavax is yet to be launched in the US, despite a claim that is it a better vaccine than the currently available ones.\nConsider two of Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest drugs from before Covid period: Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Palbociclib (Ibrance). They were discovered by Northwestern University and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blockbuster product, infliximab (Remicade), was synthesized at New York University in collaboration with a small biotechnology company Centocor. More recently, BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s synthesized the Covid Vaccine. It then entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to \u00e2\u0080\u009cleverage Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broad expertise in vaccine research and development, regulatory capabilities, and global manufacturing and distribution network.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Biohaven, a small biotech company, relied on Pfizer for the commercialization of its migraine drug Rimegepant.\nIt must be clear from the above discussion that small biotech firms or research labs play the foundational role in innovation of drugs and vaccines. That innovation must benefit the society, evident from the progress in healthcare, physical well being, and increasing longevity of human beings over the last century. Yet, synthesis and discovery are not straightforward activities. Behind each successful product lie millions of research hours and thousands of synthesized products that never see the light of the day. Out of thousands of synthesized molecules, only few reach what is called Phase 1 success, and just 10% of those receive FDA approval. Even after FDA approval, only a few products are launched in the market, because a launching firm must reassess market potential before spending additional billions of dollars in creating manufacturing, branding, and distribution network. So, only a few start-ups, even among those that successfully synthesized products, are finally rewarded by big pharma. Why would a small company, or a group of scientists and doctors, devote their precious time, give up their careers, and spend their meager resources to develop something that has less than a lottery like chance to succeed? The answer is lottery like payoffs.\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider a few examples. From market value of just $5 billion at the end of 2018, Moderna reached a valuation of $181 billion dollars in Sept 2021.\u00c2\u00a0 BioNTech, which got listed in October 2019, reached a peak value of $108 billion in Aug 2021. This phenomenon is not just about Covid vaccines. Axsome Therapeutics, which traded for just $2 per share by the end of 2018, reached $108 dollars by the end of 2019. More important, big pharma pays large premiums to acquire listed companies and unlisted start-ups. For example, in 2017, Gilead acquired a small biotech Kite Pharma, for $11.9 billion, and in 2020, Bayer acquired Asklepios, a gene-therapy startup, for a total cost of $4 billion. Acquisition by Big Pharma is typically the endgame for most biotech start-ups.\nBut the efforts and cost spent on drug development, after adjusting for inflation, keep doubling every nine years. This phenomenon is described in Eroom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law. (For curious people, Eroom is opposite of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law, which describes the decreasing costs of discovering new products in electronics.) Given the rising costs, only rising lottery payoffs can keep up the incentives for small biotechnology start-ups to bet it all on their ventures. Indeed, announcement of each new multibillion dollar acquisition lifts both valuations and innovation efforts across the industry.\nHowever, the purpose of this post is not to describe that small, biotechnology firms have lottery like payoffs, but to emphasize that any drop in lottery type payoffs could have an opposite impact on the society. The valuations of biotechnology companies have recently declined rather rapidly. Moderna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $64 billion and BioNTech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation is down to $38 billion, both more than 50% off their recent peaks. And it is not just about a few, isolated stocks. Diversified funds, that invest in hundreds of biotechnology stocks, are also off their recent peaks. For example, XBI, an S&P Exchange Traded Fund investing in biotechnology companies, is down 50% of its peak in less than twelve months. Neither the tech-heavy Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 index have declined by that much over the past one year, on the contrary, both have increased.\nWhy should one worry about sudden decline in valuations of biotechnology firms, or the vagaries in their fortunes? Well, they have a real impact on the society because an elaborate system of multi-stage and risky financing drives new drug discovery. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider this chain of thought. Now big pharma would pay a lower price for successful innovation, and a successful biotech firm now has a lower chance of doing the initial public offering or being acquired at an astounding price. Lowering of lottery like payoffs, in conjunction with the rising costs of discoveries, means that venture capitalists would pull out investments from risky biotech projects and doctors and researchers will spend less hours in synthesizing new drugs. Importantly, some promising research would not progress further, and their discoveries would be prematurely lost. Thus, the roller coaster in the fortunes of biotechnology sector now means lower chance of developing new drugs and vaccines, as well as loss of promising research effort. This is not just like putting off another steel plant, which can increase the steel prices, and increase the costs of automobiles. Not discovering a drug or a vaccine means prolonged illness, pain, or even more deaths. It may sound macabre, but fluctuating stock market fortunes of biotech firms would impact the health and wellbeing of citizens, something that personally touches us all, even if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invest in stock markets.\nIn sum, the rapid rise and fall of biotechnology sector adversely impact society. How to solve this problem? One proposed solution by MIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Andrew Lo, is to pool the risks of multiple cancer projects and fund it using a superfund. We strongly endorse this idea. However, it is unclear how a superfund can better allocate seed capital to individual small projects than can capital markets or venture funds which are known for their speed and efficiency. Another idea is that such important research should not be left to private ventures but should instead be done by government sponsored and not-for-profit research institutions. Indeed, health-sector research is the largest avenue for government R&D funding, sponsored through National Institute of Health. Recall that government research funding was instrumental in development of Covid vaccines. Furthermore, the benefits from public R&D spill over to many more public and private projects that do benefit from private R&D. This point is enforced by President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent announcement on cancer research.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe key takeaway from this post is that there is a need for a new model to fund grassroot research in biotechnology sector. On one hand, the current model, based on venture funding, unleashes entrepreneurial energies and efforts, and attracts the best talent to biotechnology sector. On the other hand, the vagaries of biotechnology stocks in capital markets lead to fits and starts in biotechnology discoveries and cause frequent loss of promising research. Society must find a happy balance between the two forces and find a new way to address this problem, a problem that cannot be simply left to free markets.\n\n   Volume 66, Issue 4\n   Summer 2024\n   \nTo Be or Not to Be: Will Virtual Worlds and the Metaverse Gain Lasting Traction?\nThe Metaverse Flywheel: Creating Value across Physical and Virtual Worlds\nThe Diffusion of the Metaverse: How YouTube Influencers Shape Mass Adoption\nMetaverse Management as Urban Planning: Lessons from Paradise (Nevada)\nGreen Innovation Games\nCalifornia Management Review\nBerkeley-Haas's Premier Management Journal\nPublished at Berkeley Haas for more than sixty years, California Management Review seeks to share knowledge that challenges convention and shows a better way of doing business.\nHaas School of Business\n                University of California, Berkeley\nCalifornia Management Review\n                F465 Berkeley Haas School of Business\n\t\t\t\t2220 Piedmont Ave. Berkeley, CA 94720-1900\n\t\t\t\t(510) 725-7826 |\n\t\t\t\tcmr@haas.berkeley.edu\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2024 UC Regents | UC Berkeley | Privacy Policy\n"

Another idea is that such important research should not be left to private ventures but should instead be done by government sponsored and not-for-profit research institutions. Indeed, health-sector research is the largest avenue for government R&D funding, sponsored through National Institute of Health. Recall that government research funding was instrumental in development of Covid vaccines. Furthermore, the benefits from public R&D spill over to many more public and private projects that do benefit from private R&D. This point is enforced by President Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent announcement on cancer research.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe key takeaway from this post is that there is a need for a new model to fund grassroot research in biotechnology sector. On one hand, the current model, based on venture funding, unleashes entrepreneurial energies and efforts, and attracts the best talent to biotechnology sector. On the other hand, the vagaries of biotechnology stocks in capital markets lead to fits and starts in biotechnology discoveries and cause frequent loss of promising research. Society must find a happy balance between the two forces and find a new way to address this problem, a problem that cannot be simply left to free markets.\n\n   Volume 66, Issue 4\n   Summer 2024\n   \nTo Be or Not to Be: Will Virtual Worlds and the Metaverse Gain Lasting Traction?\nThe Metaverse Flywheel: Creating Value across Physical and Virtual Worlds\nThe Diffusion of the Metaverse: How YouTube Influencers Shape Mass Adoption\nMetaverse Management as Urban Planning: Lessons from Paradise (Nevada)\nGreen Innovation Games\nCalifornia Management Review\nBerkeley-Haas's Premier Management Journal\nPublished at Berkeley Haas for more than sixty years, California Management Review seeks to share knowledge that challenges convention and shows a better way of doing business.\nHaas School of Business\n                University of California, Berkeley\nCalifornia Management Review\n                F465 Berkeley Haas School of Business\n\t\t\t\t2220 Piedmont Ave. Berkeley, CA 94720-1900\n\t\t\t\t(510) 725-7826 |\n\t\t\t\tcmr@haas.berkeley.edu\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2024 UC Regents | UC Berkeley | Privacy Policy\n",

Results from Phase I, II and III clinical studies, and FDA or European approvals (and rejections), can send stocks soaring.\nEveryone is familiar with these monster moves. Recent examples include Amarin Corp's (AMRN) 3X move in one day, or Zosano Pharma Corporations' (ZSAN) 100% rip on recent study results. Now, a new entrant in the large neurological market, NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC), could be on the eve of their first FDA approval, and few investors are paying attention to this small company because it's so new and quiet about what they're doing.\nNevertheless, NMTC is 10% owned by the Mayo Clinic and has a stable of veteran physicians and researchers on their board and advisory board. With the possibility of two FDA clearances in 2019 for their first planned medical devices, the company could have a breakout year if they execute and move from unknown to mainstream.\nNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 22, 2019 / Small healthcare stocks are known for making heroic moves, often when their development-phase drugs or devices move closer to going commercial. Completion of Phase I, II, and III trials can all send stocks rallying, as can approvals from European and U.S. regulators.\nCase in point, Zosano Pharma's (ZSAN) recent monster 100% move recently when they announced success in a Trial of their drug for migraines. Amarin Corp (AMRN) saw their stock price triple after their drug Vascepa succeeded in a large Phase III study.\nThe largest moves tend to happen when most investors aren't paying much attention, and that could be the setup for a newer neuro company that recently made their way to the public markets. NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC) is a small developer of electrode technology that just quietly submitted their first product to the U.S. FDA for a possible clearance early in 2019. NeuroOne's technologies - sometimes known as ''neurostimulation'' devices - have been tested at the Mayo Clinic, which is also a 10% owner of the company's public stock. Now that the company is headed towards their first possible FDA clearance, and with a second possible clearance for another device right on its heels, NMTC is a healthcare company to be aware of before it gets discovered.\nNeuroOne Operates In An $8B And Growing Device Market\nThe emerging field of neurostimulation refers to technologies that electrically stimulate or monitor the nervous system to treat and diagnose disorders. Though humans have learned much about the nervous system in the last twenty years, it remains a mysterious organ and technology has only recently begun to unlock some new treatment options. These devices are now helping in a variety of difficult neurological disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, Dystonia, Epilepsy and even in the treatment of pain and some nerve damage.\nIt's an exciting time as this industry takes off. In 2019 the research firm Global Markets Insights expect this to be a $8.196 billion industry across the globe, and $6.5 billion in North America and Europe alone.\nOne of the earliest successes for neurostimulation devices was in Epilepsy and Parkinson's using Deep Brain Stimulation, or DBS and ablation. After identifying brain tissue that may be causing Epileptic seizures or movement problems as in severe Parkinson's, neurologists can selectively modulate or destroy this tissue with a DBS or ablation device, reducing or sometimes eliminating symptoms of the disorder. In fact, ablation can cure about 50% of Epileptic patients.\nThe hangup for many Parkinson's, Dystonia, or Epilepsy patients who are eligible for DBS or ablation is the traumatic surgical requirements, not only for treatment but also to diagnose and pinpoint the affecting brain tissue. It can take weeks in the hospital, sometimes with wires protruding from a patient's skull!\nHere's where NeuroOne hopes to make its mark on the industry. The company's initial devices are high-fidelity electrodes designed to enhance and possibly shorten this diagnostic/treatment process. These thin-film electrodes, used in a procedure called an EEG (electroencephalogram), may provide more accurate detection of irregular brain activity over currently available technology. In limited clinical testing so far, doctors at the Mayo Clinic have been able to document pre-seizure activity (called micro-seizures) during clinical research with their patients using NeuroOne's technology. The electrodes are being developed as strips and depth electrodes, and they've already demonstrated an improvement in inflammatory response compared to existing products when used on some brain tissue. With better diagnostic process, NeuroOne hopes that their products can shorten the diagnostic time and improve safey for Epileptics and patients suffering from movement disorders.\nCombined, this first technology addresses a demand for improved diagnostic options among neurologists, and NeuroOne is now racing to market with their first medical devices for approval.\nNMTC Quietly Made Their First FDA Clearance Application\nNeuroOne has been mostly quiet on the investor front, but in a recent SEC filing they revealed that they filed their first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) application on January 28, 2019. The application covers their cortical and strip electrodes for temporary (less than 30 day) use with recording, monitoring, and acute stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring and stimulation of electrical signals on the surface of the brain.\nIn the case of this 510(k) process, which is used when the device holds a low risk to the patient, the FDA will aim to complete its review within 90 days of receiving the notification.\nThis is the biggest gating event for NeuroOne since the company went public, and it could take them from a development stage company to commercial and their first revenue. An FDA clearance could launch the into the mainstream of healthcare companies, and investors will undoubtedly take notice of this tiny company.\nThe company also plans to file a FDA 510(k) marketing clearance for their first depth electrode during the second quarter. Following that, they're working on a unique diagnostic/ablation device that could further shorten and simplify the treatment time for patients.\nNMTC could have two value-driving events in the next 5-6 months, and the markets are barely paying attention.\nStrong Advisory Board Backs NeuroOne, And Mayo Owns 10% Of The Company\nThe breadth of expertise involved in NeuroOne is impressive. The company has strong advisors and executives, and their technology has been tested over the years by both the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the Mayo Clinic, the latter of which is also a 10% holder of NMTC's public stock.\nSince going public, NeuroOne has been building a team of experienced medical tech and neurology advisory members: Mayo Clinic's Greg Worrell MD, PhD and Gregory J. Esper, MD, MBA of Emory University both sit on the company's scientific advisory board. More recently, Dr. Kip Ludwig, former Program Director for Neural Engineering at the NIH, became chair of the company's new \"artificial intelligence\" advisory board, which will focus on deploying NeuroOne's electrode technology in artificial intelligence and bioelectronics applications. Dr. Cristin Welle of the Univ. of Colorado joined, a founder of the Neural Interfaces Program at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of Science and Engineering Labs; plus Dr. Doug Weber, a Program Manager in the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) at DARPA.\nEvaluating AI opens up some unique possible opportunities as more researchers have considered the potential for electrode/brain interfaces. The possibility for some kind of translational work in this space is intriguing.\n2019 Should Be A Big Year For NMTC Shareholders\nNeuroOne has been operating in stealth mode for the last year, but 2019 could be when investors start to pay attention. The company will likely have 2 FDA clearances in the next 6 months if the FDA signs off on their cortical and depth electrode 510(k) filings. As this stock has been mostly flat since going public, these events may be the first time that investors stand up and take notice. Additionally, NMTC plans to apply for a listing on the Nasdaq, another catalyst that could create significant value for shareholders if NMTC can qualify. With CEO Dave Rosa's successful track record building venture stage healthcare companies, multiple value creating catalysts on the horizon, and an awesome technology with blue sky potential, investors long NMTC could be handsomely rewarded for a patient long position in this relatively unknown healthcare company.\nAbout One Equity Stocks\nOne Equity Stocks is a provider of paid-for research on publicly traded emerging growth companies.

Areas that are hydrologically connected to the ocean are shown in shades of blue (darker blue = greater depth).\nLow-lying areas, displayed in green, are hydrologically \"unconnected\" areas that may also flood. They are determined solely by how well the elevation data captures the area\u2019s drainage characteristics.

A more detailed analysis, may be required to determine the area\u2019s actual susceptibility to flooding.\nThere is not 100% confidence in the elevation data and/or mapping process. It is important not to focus on the exact extent of inundation, but rather to examine the level of confidence that the extent of inundation is accurate (see mapping confidence tab).\nScenarios\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

These new scenarios were developed by the U.S. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force as input into the U.S. Global Change Research\r\n                            Program Sustained Assessment process and, Fifth National Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios\r\n                            provide an update to the NOAA 2017 scenarios, which were developed as input to the Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            While these RSL scenarios begin in 2005, they have been adjusted to 2000 to more easily compare them with the 2017 RSL scenarios. They take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion.  \r\n                        \n\r\n                            By 2050 (relative to sea level in 2000), RSL projections range from 0.40\u20100.45 meters along the East Coast,\r\n                            0.55\u20100.65 meters along the Gulf Coast, 0.20\u20100.30 meters along the West Coast, 0.20\u20100.35 meters along\r\n                            the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands, 0.30 meters along the northern coast of Alaska, and an RSL\r\n                            decrease along the southern coast of Alaska\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Another important change from the 2017 scenarios is the exclusion of the extreme (2.5 meter)\r\n                            scenario. Based on the most recent scientific understanding, and as discussed in the IPCC AR6, the\r\n                            uncertain physical processes that could lead to much higher increases in sea level are now viewed as\r\n                            less plausible in the coming decades before potentially becoming a factor toward the end of the 21st\r\n                            century. A GMSL increase of 2.5 meters is thus viewed as less plausible and the associated scenario has\r\n                            been removed.\r\n                        \n2017 Sea Level Rise Technical Report:\n\r\n                            The five relative sea level rise (RSL) scenarios shown in this tab are derived from NOAA Technical Report\r\n                            NOS CO-OPS 083: \u201cGlobal and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States\u201d using the same\r\n                            methods as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change Curve Calculator.

These RSL scenarios provide a revision to the global scenarios that were developed\r\n                            (Parris et. al, 2012) as input to the Third National Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            These RSL scenarios begin in 2000 and take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional\r\n                            changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local\r\n                            vertical land motion.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            For almost all the scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be greater than the global average in the U.S. Northeast\r\n                            and the western Gulf of Mexico. In intermediate and low scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be less than the\r\n                            global average in much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For high scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be\r\n                            higher than the global average along all U.S. coastlines outside Alaska.\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nAdditional Information:\n\r\n                            A RSL-change adjustment to the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983-2001) will cause a minimal\r\n                            offset that may be needed for some applications. The USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator can\r\n                            correct for this offset.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Rounding to the nearest 1-foot mapping increment to view potential impacts is appropriate based on\r\n                            the accuracy of the elevation and tidal surface data used as mapping inputs.\r\n                        \nMapping Confidence\nThe inundation areas depicted in the Sea Level Rise tab are not as precise as they may appear. There are many unknowns when mapping future conditions, including natural evolution of the coastal landforms (e.g., barrier island overwash and migration), as well as the data used to predict the changes. The presentation of confidence in these maps only represents the known error in the elevation data and tidal corrections.\nBlue areas denote a high confidence of inundation, orange areas denote a high degree of uncertainty, and unshaded areas denote a high confidence that these areas will be dry given the chosen water level.\nIn this application 80% is considered a high degree of confidence such that, for example, the blue areas denote locations that may be correctly mapped as 'inundated' more than 8 out of 10 times. Areas with a high degree of uncertainty represent locations that may be mapped correctly (either as inundated or dry) less than 8 out of 10 times.\r\n                        For a detailed description of the confidence levels and their computation, see the methods document.\nMarsh\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

You can learn more about them within the Local\r\n                            Scenarios Tab of this viewer.\r\n                        \nNote: We do not show the low scenario as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nSocial Vulnerability\nBy overlaying social and economic data on a map that depicts sea level rise, a community can see the potential impact that sea level rise can have on vulnerable people and businesses.\nThe Social Vulnerability Index, which shows areas of high human vulnerability to hazards, is based on population attributes from Census 2010 (e.g., age and poverty) and the built environment. By looking at the intersection of potential sea level rise and vulnerable Census tracts, one can get an idea of how vulnerable populations might be affected by sea level rise. Dark red indicates tracts having a high vulnerability, and the lighter reds indicate decreasing vulnerability.\nHigh Tide Flooding\nAnnual occurrences of tidal flooding\u2014exceeding local thresholds for minor impacts\r\n            \t\t\tto infrastructure\u2014have increased 5- to 10-fold since the 1960s in several U.S. coastal\r\n            \t\t\tcities. The changes in high tide flooding over time are greatest where elevation is lower, local RSL rise is higher, or extreme variability is less.\nIn a sense, today\u2019s flood will become tomorrow\u2019s high tide, as sea level rise will cause flooding to occur more frequently and last for longer durations of time.\nThe red layer in the map represents areas currently subject to tidal flooding, often called \u201crecurrent or nuisance flooding.\u201d\nClick on a NOAA tide station icon in the map to see historical inundation events in flood days per year. The flood thresholds used in these plots are derived national flood thresholds from NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 086: Patterns and Projections of High Tide Flooding Along the U.S. Coastline Using a Common Impact Threshold. The derived thresholds used here provide a national definition of coastal flooding and impacts for quantifying and communicating risk. These thresholds may deviate from NWS impact thresholds which take into account local flood risk and are used to issue NWS coastal flood watches, warnings,  and advisories.\nCurrent Location\nHigh Tide Flooding\nHistorical Yearly Inundation Events\n\nCoastal County Snapshots\nUse the sea level rise snapshot to communicate potential impacts at the county level\nLake Level Viewer\nVisualize potential lake level changes and impacts for the U.S. Great Lakes\nCoastal Flood Exposure Mapper\nMap people, places, and natural resources that are potentially exposed to coastal flooding\nTakeaways from the 2022 Sea Level Rise Technical Report\nWatch this video to explore four takeaways from the report and key actions that communities can take\nGet more sea level rise and inundation resources and tools from the Digital Coast.\nAbout Sea Level Rise Viewer v 3.0.0\nThe purpose of this map viewer is to provide federal, state, and local coastal resource managers and planners with a preliminary look at sea level rise and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses best-available, nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help estimate impacts and prioritize actions for different scenarios.\nThe data and maps in this tool illustrate the scale of potential flooding, not the exact location, and do not account for erosion, subsidence, or future construction. Water levels are shown as they would appear during the highest high tides (excludes wind-driven tides). The data, maps, and information provided should be used only as a screening-level tool for management decisions. As with all remotely sensed data, all features should be verified with a site visit. The data and maps in this tool are provided \u201cas is\u201d without warranty to their performance, merchantable state, or fitness for any particular purpose. The entire risk associated with the results and performance of these data is assumed by the user. This tool should be used strictly as a planning reference tool and not for navigation, permitting, or other legal purposes.\nAdditional Resources\nLeveed Areas Disclaimer\nLevees are displayed as yellow lines, and enclosed leveed areas are displayed as a white stippled pattern.\nMajor federal leveed areas were assumed high enough and strong enough to protect against inundation depicted in this viewer, and therefore no inundation was mapped in these regions.\nMinor (nonfederal) leveed areas were mapped using the best available elevation data that capture leveed features. In some cases, however, breaks in elevation occur along leveed areas because of flood control features being removed from elevation data, limitations of the horizontal and vertical resolution of the elevation data, the occurrence of levee drainage features, and so forth. Flooding behind levees is only depicted if breaks in elevation data occur or if the levee elevations are overtopped by the water surface. At some flood levels, alternate pathways around\u2014not through\u2014levees, walls, dams, and flood gates may exist that allow water to flow into areas protected at lower levels. In general, imperfect levee and elevation data make assessing protection difficult, and small data errors can have large consequences.\nAs new elevation data become available, or as stakeholders provide additional levee information, the NOAA Office for Coastal Management will periodically update the inundation and levee data.\n",

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows.

When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows.

When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

Agencies and organizations are working to prepare people as their world changes around them, and NASA information is helping these efforts.\nThe agency\u2019s global data is now available in the sea level section of the Earth Information Center. NASA developed the global sea level change website in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense, the World Bank, the U.S. Department of State, and the United Nations Development Programme. \u00a0\nThe site includes information on projected sea level rise through the year 2150 for coastlines around the world, as well as estimates of how much flooding a coastal community or region can expect to see in the next 30 years. The projections come from data collected by NASA and its partners and from computer models of ice sheets and the ocean, as well as the latest sea level assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and other sources.\n\u201cNASA innovates for the benefit of humanity. Our cutting-edge instruments and data-driven information tools help communities and organizations respond to natural hazards and extreme weather, and inform critical coastal infrastructure planning decisions,\u201d said Karen St. Germain, director of the Earth science division at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nInformation to Action\nInternational organizations such as the World Bank will use the data from the global sea level change site for tasks including the creation of Climate Risk Profiles for countries especially vulnerable to sea level rise.\nThe Defense Department will continue to incorporate sea level rise data into its plans to anticipate and respond to hazards posed to its facilities by the effects of rising oceans. Similarly, the State Department uses the information for activities ranging from disaster preparedness to long-term adaptation planning to supporting partners around the world in related efforts.\n\u201cWe are at a moment of truth in our fight against the climate crisis. The science is unequivocal and must serve as the bedrock upon which decision-making is built. With many communities around the world already facing severe impacts from sea-level rise, this new resource provides a vital tool to help them protect lives and livelihoods. It also illustrates what is at stake between a 1.5-degree-Celsius world and a current-policies trajectory for all coastal communities worldwide,\u201d said Assistant Secretary-General Selwin Hart, special adviser to the United Nations secretary-general on climate action and just transition.\nRising Faster\nNASA-led data analyses have revealed that between 1970 and 2023, 96% of countries with coastlines have experienced sea level rise. The rate of that global rise has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) per year in 1993 to about 0.18 inches (0.45 centimeters) per year in 2023.\nAs the rate of sea level rise increases, millions of people could face the related effects sooner than previously projected, including larger storm surges, more saltwater intrusion into groundwater, and additional high-tide flood days \u2014 also known as nuisance floods or sunny day floods.\n\u201cThis new platform shows the timing of future floods and the magnitude of rising waters in all coastal countries worldwide, connecting science and physics to impacts on people\u2019s livelihoods and safety,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director of the ocean physics program at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nData released earlier this year found that Pacific Island nations will experience at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) of sea level rise in the next 30 years. The number of high-tide flood days will increase by an order of magnitude for nearly all Pacific Island nations by the 2050s.\n\u201cThe data is clear: Sea levels are rising around the world, and they\u2019re rising faster and faster,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and head of the agency\u2019s sea level change science team. \u201cHaving the best information to make decisions about how to plan for rising seas is more crucial than ever.\u201d\nTo explore the global sea level change site:\nhttps://earth.gov/sealevel\nNews Media Contacts\nKaren Fox / Elizabeth VlockNASA Headquarters, Washington202-358-1600karen.c.fox@nasa.gov / elizabeth.a.vlock@nasa.gov\nJane J.

      "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 (Week 16) using Drought Monitor Data Gregg Ibendahl April 19, 2024 Week 16 prediction1 Kansas wheat estimate for 4/19/24 Using Drought Monitor Data Yield range from 39.1 to 46.2 Predicted yield of 42.6 Abstract This paper uses data from the U.S. drought monitor website (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu2) to predict yields on a crop reporting district (CRD) level for Kansas. These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F. A. 2017.\nDrought Severity and Cover- age Index.\nUnited States Drought Monitor.\ndroughtmoni-tor.unl.edu/About/AbouttheData/ DSCI.aspx 4Bain, R. and T. R.

St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available. In other words, the drought index only shows moisture deficit levels and not excess moisture levels.\nWhile this report currently indicates a below average wheat year, the wide confidence intervals indicate these predictions could improve with timely rains. It is still early spring after all. The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5",

The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5"

      "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 (Week 16) using Drought Monitor Data Gregg Ibendahl April 19, 2024 Week 16 prediction1 Kansas wheat estimate for 4/19/24 Using Drought Monitor Data Yield range from 39.1 to 46.2 Predicted yield of 42.6 Abstract This paper uses data from the U.S. drought monitor website (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu2) to predict yields on a crop reporting district (CRD) level for Kansas. These CRD level numbers are aggregated upward to get a state average yield. Although this estimate is very preliminary with wide confidence intervals, there are clear indications that production may be diminished in some areas of the state (Central and South Central Kansas). The preliminary analysis developed here estimates a state average wheat yield of 42.6 bu/ac (confidence interval from 39.1 to 46.2 bu/ac).\nThe individual CRD estimates are shown in Figure 1. This estimate should be compared with Ibendahl\u2019s 4/14/2024 estimate Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 using NASS crop condition report. The NASS estimate was 1.1 bu higher than the soil moisture estimate in this paper.\nIntroduction Kansas once again has wide areas of the state in some level of drought. In particular the central and south central regions are very dry. As shown in Figure 2, 2024 is not that unusual as there have been many dry springs. The key to final yields will be the how much additional rain the state receives.\nMost farmers would agree that wheat prospects this year are less than ideal based on the current soil moisture conditions. The question that farmers, lenders, and others in agriculture are asking 1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2U.S. Drought Monitor. (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).\n1 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 though is what can Kansas expect for wheat production this year. Last year, Ibendahl estimated wheat yields and production on a regular basis throughout the growing season using the USDA estimates of crop conditions.\nThe USDA-NASS data is only available at the state level.\nThis paper estimates wheat yields on a CRD level basis and then on a state level using drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor site. This data is available since 2000 on a consistent weekly basis.\nThe drought monitor data is also more finely grained with county level and crop reporting level data available in addition to the state report. The consistent weekly data allows a yield prediction model to be developed much sooner than using the USDA crop condition indexes as the wheat crop condition reports from NASS do not start on a regular basis until April.\nData The model developed here follows a similar procedure that Ibendahl used to estimate wheat yields based on the USDA crop conditions report. Instead of the growing conditions report, the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) is used to estimate wheat yields. The DSCI (Akyuz3) shares many similarities to the Crop Condition Index (CCI) (Bain and Fortenbery4). Where the CCIndex weights the best condition with the most points, the DSCI weights the worst condition with the most points.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor labels droughts by the level of severity. There are 5 levels of drought ranging from D0 (least severe) to D4 (most severe). The DSCI is a computed by the formula: DSCI = (% acreage in D0) * 1\uffff + (% acreage in D1) * 2\uffff + (% acreage in D2) * 3\uffff + (% acreage in D3) * 4\uffff + (% acreage in D4) * 5 The index ranges from [0, 500]. An index value of 500 corresponds to 100 percent of the crop acreage in the most extreme drought (D4), and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop acreage is not in any drought state. The U.S. Drought Monitor computes these values for various sized areas including at the county level. The site has weekly data back to the year 2000.\nModel The model used in this paper first computes the trend line yield on a crop reporting district basis from 2000 to 2023.\nMost CRDs have a small positive trend line increase in yields.\nNext, the deviation from trend line is calculated for each year. This deviation from trend is what the DSCI is used to estimate. Because NASS no longer reports CRD yields, Ibendahl generated the CRD yields by aggregating individual counties within a CRD.\n3Akyuz, F. A. 2017.\nDrought Severity and Cover- age Index.\nUnited States Drought Monitor.\ndroughtmoni-tor.unl.edu/About/AbouttheData/ DSCI.aspx 4Bain, R. and T. R.

St. Louis, MO. (http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134) @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 2 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 A linear regression model is used to estimate the deviation from trend for a specific week using the data from 2000 to 2023. There is a separate regression model for each CRD. The regression model is unique to a specific week. For this paper, the lastest DSCI report for 2024 is week 16. To estimate the linear model, the DSCI data is filtered to provide only the historical week 16 DSCI numbers and these are used as the independent variable to predict the final yield. Once the linear model is developed at the CRD level, the DSCI reading for 2023 and week 16 is plugged into the equation to estimate the deviation from trend for this year\u2019s CRD yield.\nTo generate the state yield estimate, Ibendahl weighted each of the individual CRD yields by the number of planted acres last year. NASS has not yet reported planted acres on a county level for 2024. Because NASS is not able to report on all counties, aggregating upward to a state yield is not fully complete. However as long as the missing county data is representative of the reported county data, results should not change very much.\nResults The CRD level results are shown in Figure 2. The second column in each of the tables is the trend line yield. This is the expected yield for a CRD in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. The next three columns are the predicted yields based on the linear model using the DSCI to predict the yield deviation for this year. The yield deviation from the linear model is subtracted from the trend yield to get the predicted yields shown. While the most likely yield column is the point estimate of the model, the upper and lower range values should not be ignored. At this point, there is a wide range of yields that could occur and the confidence interval reflects this uncertainty.\nThe final column is the r-squared value and it tells how well the linear regression model fits the yield data. Values can range from -1 to 1 with a 0 value indicating the model doesn\u2019t predict yields at all. As Figure 2 shows, there is a wide variation in how well CRD level data works. While some CRDs show the model has no explanatory power, there are other CRDs with a strong fit. Those CRDs with an r-squared value close to zero will show a predicted yield close to trend line in most cases. In these CRDs more attention should be focused on the possible yield range.\nDiscussion These are very preliminary results.\nHowever future weeks should show an improvement in the model. Once the USDA starts producing crop condition reports on a regular basis in April, this crop condition reports will also be used to forecast yields. Be sure to check AgManager.info for the latest yield forecasts. The intention is to produce an estimate of wheat yields using both crop conditions and the drought index. While the drought index has an advantage of more detailed data down to the county level, it also has no way to indicate when there is excess moisture available. In other words, the drought index only shows moisture deficit levels and not excess moisture levels.\nWhile this report currently indicates a below average wheat year, the wide confidence intervals indicate these predictions could improve with timely rains. It is still early spring after all. The poorest quality wheat is more likely to be abandoned which would help improve the state average wheat yield but at the expense of lowering harvested acres.\n@ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 3 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 Predicted CRD Yields week - 16 CRD Trend Yield Predicted Yields R squared Lower Bounds Most Likely Yield Upper Bounds NORTHWEST 50.2 49.6 52.5 55.5 0.62 NORTH CENTRAL 43.8 39.1 42.7 46.3 0.03 NORTHEAST 51.1 48.9 55.5 62.1 0.07 WEST CENTRAL 44.9 44.2 47.2 50.3 0.51 CENTRAL 44.3 38.0 42.1 46.1 0.11 EAST CENTRAL 47.2 44.6 49.2 53.7 0.03 SOUTHWEST 42.7 41.6 44.2 46.9 0.59 SOUTH CENTRAL 38.9 32.2 35.9 39.5 0.26 SOUTHEAST 50.5 47.3 50.9 54.5 \u22120.02 Figure 1: Kansas Crop Reporting Districts - Estimated Yields @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 4 AgManager.info April 22, 2024 0% 0% 20% 11% 27% 2% 12% 0% 0% 0% 0% 15% 2% 89% 72% 28% 0% 0% 59% 0% 3% 2% 53% 69% 7% 97% 100% 43% 61% 60% 95% 31% 100% 80% 100% 100% 55% 90% 0% 1% 32% 85% 100% 17% 100% 93% 87% 33% 20% 47% 3% 0% 37% 28% 13% 3% 57% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30% 8% 11% 27% 40% 15% 0% 24% 0% 4% 11% 14% 11% 46% 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Level D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 None Kansas Drought Levels as of Week 16 Figure 2: Historical Drought Conditions in Kansas @ibendahl https://www.youtube.com/@little_pond_farm 5",
      "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 (4/14/24) Gregg Ibendahl April 16, 2024 Week #15 prediction Kansas wheat estimate for 4/14/24 Yield range from 41.5 to 45.9 Predicted yield of 43.7 Introduction1 The USDA collects weekly crop conditions throughout the growing season. The crop is rated as either: very poor, poor, fair, good, or excellent. For wheat, these estimates are reported for a few weeks in late fall and then the estimates start again in the spring. As shown by Ibendahl in previous reports on AgManager.com, these crop reports can be used to build a model to predict final crop yields. In this publication, Ibendahl estimates Kansas wheat yields based on the week #15 (April 14, 2004) crop condition report from NASS.\nAs of week 15 in Kansas, for the winter wheat crop, 6% was rated very poor, 13% was poor, 38% was fair, 38% was good, and 5% was excellent. While it is still very early in the wheat season, this paper explains the model process and projects a possible yield. This paper is the first estimate of wheat yields for 2024 in Kansas.\nBackground The USDA has historical state wheat yields going back to 1866. Figure 1 plots these as a line graph.\nWhat is interesting about this graph is that wheat yields were flat until 1950. Since then, yields have been steadily increasing. As shown in Figure 1, a regression of the last 30 years (the blue line) shows a 0.22 bushel increase in yield each year. The lowest yield in any year since 1970 has been 25% higher than the highest year before 1950. Figure 1 also shows the state average wheat yield has a large amount of variability. Yields were only 28 bushels per acre in 2014 while in 2016, yields were 57 bushels per acre.\n1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu 1 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Estimate of Crop Condition The weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report issued by the USDA National Agricultural Statis-tics Service, includes temperature, precipitation, and progress of crop planting, development and harvesting. This report is issued weekly, except during winter months when it is entered monthly.\nWhile this report gives the current crop condition, it doesn\u2019t make any projections about wheat yields. Predicting yields for wheat can be di\ufb00icult as the crop often does better than it looks in the field and can quickly improve with timely rains.\nThere has been some research that has attempted to match the crop condition report back to yields. Bain and Fortenbery (Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO.\n[http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134]) presented a paper that used an index of the crop con-dition report to estimate crop yields. Their procedure, described below, is used in this paper to show the relationship between crop conditions and wheat yields.\nProcedure Bain and Fortenbery construct an index of weekly crop conditions: CCIndex = (% acreage Excellent) * 1 +\uffff (% acreage Good) * 0.75 +\uffff (% acreage Fair) * 0.50 +\uffff (% acreage Poor) * 0.25 +\uffff (% acreage Very poor) * 0 The index ranges from [0, 100]. An index value of 100 corresponds to 100 percent of the surveyed crop being reported in excellent condition, and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop is in very poor condition. A value of 50 indicates the average crop condition for the state is in fair condition.\nWeekly crop condition reports are available from NASS and go back to 1988. The start of the weakly wheat report in Kansas varies but for all the years since 1988, there is a weekly crop report available by either the last week of March or the first week in April. There is also a series of crop reports in the fall before a break occurs. The last 20 years of the wheat crop condition for week #14 in Kansas is shown in Figure 2.\nIn this analysis, the April 14, 2024 crop condition reports (week #15) are used to construct a CCI index for the last 30 years. These CCI indexes are then used in a regression analysis to estimate the wheat yield per acre where the yield is a function of the CCI index. To account for the yield trend, the actual model is an estimation of the deviation from the yield trend as a function of the CCI index. Figure 3 plots the deviation from the state average wheat yield tend line on the left axis and the CCI index on the bottom axis. The dark gray band represents the standard error.\nThe standard error of the regression is the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line.\n@ibendahl 2 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Results As might be expected for a wheat crop condition report the second week of April, the model doesn\u2019t predict very well. Based on week #15 scores, the model predicts wheat yields with an R-squared of 0.38. The estimated yield equation is Yield = 0.381 * CCI_score - 21.2 That is, an improvement of 1% in the CCI score can increase the average state yield by nearly 0.4 bushels per acres. However, the low R-squared value is the result of large variations in the final wheat yield for a given CCI score. In other words, the CCI index is far from a perfect indicator of final wheat yields in the state, especially with the winter report on crop conditions. The large variability can easily be seen in Figure 3. A model that was able to predict yield perfectly would have all the individual points aligning along the blue regression line. Thus the model presented here should be looked at as more of an initial impression of wheat yields in the state.\nAs of week #15 for 2024, the trend line yield is 43.7 bu/ac. The CCI score of 55.8 has the model predicting a yield 0.03 bu/ac above trend. Thus the estimated yield for 7/14/24 is 43.7 bu/ac with a range from 41.5 to 45.9 bu/ac. Figure 4 shows the history of yield estimates since 4/7/24. This latest estimate is half a bushel lower from last week.\nImplications Producers should look at these results as only a guide. In Kansas, moisture is key and timely rainfall or the lack of rainfall will make a big difference in yields. Ibendahl plans to regularly this model. The reliability of the model will improve as harvest gets closer.\n@ibendahl 3 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 10 20 30 40 50 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025 Year Yield (bu/ac) Historical Kansas Wheat Yields Figure 1: Historical State Wheat Yields from Kansas @ibendahl 4 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 19% 60% 31% 16% 15% 10% 46% 16% 12% 28% 30% 33% 7% 42% 5% 19% 20% 27% 23% 4% 30% 43% 14% 33% 55% 50% 59% 12% 51% 49% 28% 26% 30% 69% 25% 71% 37% 45% 36% 38% 76% 38% 38% 26% 36% 29% 35% 31% 42% 33% 39% 44% 44% 37% 24% 33% 24% 44% 35% 37% 39% 20% 32% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Condition Very poor Poor Fair Good Excellent Condition of Kansas Wheat as of WEEK #15 4/14/24 Figure 2: Historical Crop Conditions for Wheat in Kansas for Specific Week @ibendahl 5 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 \u221210 0 10 30 40 50 60 70 CCI Score Deviation from Trend \u2212 Bu/Ac WEEK #15 Yield Prediction Based on CCI Score Figure 3: Expected Yield (Trend Deviation) for Various CCI Index Values for Specific Week @ibendahl 6 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Apr 07 Apr 09 Apr 11 Apr 13 Apr 15 Date of prediction Bu/ac Estimate Expected High Low Expected Wheat Yield for Kansas by Date of Estimation Figure 4: Weekly Model Predictions Since 4/7/24 @ibendahl 7"

      "Kansas Wheat Yield Outlook for 2024 - Week #15 (4/14/24) Gregg Ibendahl April 16, 2024 Week #15 prediction Kansas wheat estimate for 4/14/24 Yield range from 41.5 to 45.9 Predicted yield of 43.7 Introduction1 The USDA collects weekly crop conditions throughout the growing season. The crop is rated as either: very poor, poor, fair, good, or excellent. For wheat, these estimates are reported for a few weeks in late fall and then the estimates start again in the spring. As shown by Ibendahl in previous reports on AgManager.com, these crop reports can be used to build a model to predict final crop yields. In this publication, Ibendahl estimates Kansas wheat yields based on the week #15 (April 14, 2004) crop condition report from NASS.\nAs of week 15 in Kansas, for the winter wheat crop, 6% was rated very poor, 13% was poor, 38% was fair, 38% was good, and 5% was excellent. While it is still very early in the wheat season, this paper explains the model process and projects a possible yield. This paper is the first estimate of wheat yields for 2024 in Kansas.\nBackground The USDA has historical state wheat yields going back to 1866. Figure 1 plots these as a line graph.\nWhat is interesting about this graph is that wheat yields were flat until 1950. Since then, yields have been steadily increasing. As shown in Figure 1, a regression of the last 30 years (the blue line) shows a 0.22 bushel increase in yield each year. The lowest yield in any year since 1970 has been 25% higher than the highest year before 1950. Figure 1 also shows the state average wheat yield has a large amount of variability. Yields were only 28 bushels per acre in 2014 while in 2016, yields were 57 bushels per acre.\n1Kansas State University - Department of Agricultural Economics AgManager.info email: ibendahl@ksu.edu 1 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Estimate of Crop Condition The weekly Crop Progress and Condition Report issued by the USDA National Agricultural Statis-tics Service, includes temperature, precipitation, and progress of crop planting, development and harvesting. This report is issued weekly, except during winter months when it is entered monthly.\nWhile this report gives the current crop condition, it doesn\u2019t make any projections about wheat yields. Predicting yields for wheat can be di\ufb00icult as the crop often does better than it looks in the field and can quickly improve with timely rains.\nThere has been some research that has attempted to match the crop condition report back to yields. Bain and Fortenbery (Bain, R. and T. R. Fortenbery. 2013. \u201cImpacts of Crop Conditions Reports on National and Local Wheat Markets.\u201d Proceedings of the NCCC-134 Conference on Applied Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management. St. Louis, MO.\n[http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/nccc134]) presented a paper that used an index of the crop con-dition report to estimate crop yields. Their procedure, described below, is used in this paper to show the relationship between crop conditions and wheat yields.\nProcedure Bain and Fortenbery construct an index of weekly crop conditions: CCIndex = (% acreage Excellent) * 1 +\uffff (% acreage Good) * 0.75 +\uffff (% acreage Fair) * 0.50 +\uffff (% acreage Poor) * 0.25 +\uffff (% acreage Very poor) * 0 The index ranges from [0, 100]. An index value of 100 corresponds to 100 percent of the surveyed crop being reported in excellent condition, and a value of 0 indicates 100 percent of the crop is in very poor condition. A value of 50 indicates the average crop condition for the state is in fair condition.\nWeekly crop condition reports are available from NASS and go back to 1988. The start of the weakly wheat report in Kansas varies but for all the years since 1988, there is a weekly crop report available by either the last week of March or the first week in April. There is also a series of crop reports in the fall before a break occurs. The last 20 years of the wheat crop condition for week #14 in Kansas is shown in Figure 2.\nIn this analysis, the April 14, 2024 crop condition reports (week #15) are used to construct a CCI index for the last 30 years. These CCI indexes are then used in a regression analysis to estimate the wheat yield per acre where the yield is a function of the CCI index. To account for the yield trend, the actual model is an estimation of the deviation from the yield trend as a function of the CCI index. Figure 3 plots the deviation from the state average wheat yield tend line on the left axis and the CCI index on the bottom axis. The dark gray band represents the standard error.\nThe standard error of the regression is the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line.\n@ibendahl 2 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 Results As might be expected for a wheat crop condition report the second week of April, the model doesn\u2019t predict very well. Based on week #15 scores, the model predicts wheat yields with an R-squared of 0.38. The estimated yield equation is Yield = 0.381 * CCI_score - 21.2 That is, an improvement of 1% in the CCI score can increase the average state yield by nearly 0.4 bushels per acres. However, the low R-squared value is the result of large variations in the final wheat yield for a given CCI score. In other words, the CCI index is far from a perfect indicator of final wheat yields in the state, especially with the winter report on crop conditions. The large variability can easily be seen in Figure 3. A model that was able to predict yield perfectly would have all the individual points aligning along the blue regression line. Thus the model presented here should be looked at as more of an initial impression of wheat yields in the state.\nAs of week #15 for 2024, the trend line yield is 43.7 bu/ac. The CCI score of 55.8 has the model predicting a yield 0.03 bu/ac above trend. Thus the estimated yield for 7/14/24 is 43.7 bu/ac with a range from 41.5 to 45.9 bu/ac. Figure 4 shows the history of yield estimates since 4/7/24. This latest estimate is half a bushel lower from last week.\nImplications Producers should look at these results as only a guide. In Kansas, moisture is key and timely rainfall or the lack of rainfall will make a big difference in yields. Ibendahl plans to regularly this model. The reliability of the model will improve as harvest gets closer.\n@ibendahl 3 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 10 20 30 40 50 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025 Year Yield (bu/ac) Historical Kansas Wheat Yields Figure 1: Historical State Wheat Yields from Kansas @ibendahl 4 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 19% 60% 31% 16% 15% 10% 46% 16% 12% 28% 30% 33% 7% 42% 5% 19% 20% 27% 23% 4% 30% 43% 14% 33% 55% 50% 59% 12% 51% 49% 28% 26% 30% 69% 25% 71% 37% 45% 36% 38% 76% 38% 38% 26% 36% 29% 35% 31% 42% 33% 39% 44% 44% 37% 24% 33% 24% 44% 35% 37% 39% 20% 32% 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 100 50 0 50 100 Percentage Condition Very poor Poor Fair Good Excellent Condition of Kansas Wheat as of WEEK #15 4/14/24 Figure 2: Historical Crop Conditions for Wheat in Kansas for Specific Week @ibendahl 5 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 \u221210 0 10 30 40 50 60 70 CCI Score Deviation from Trend \u2212 Bu/Ac WEEK #15 Yield Prediction Based on CCI Score Figure 3: Expected Yield (Trend Deviation) for Various CCI Index Values for Specific Week @ibendahl 6 AgManager.info April 16, 2024 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Apr 07 Apr 09 Apr 11 Apr 13 Apr 15 Date of prediction Bu/ac Estimate Expected High Low Expected Wheat Yield for Kansas by Date of Estimation Figure 4: Weekly Model Predictions Since 4/7/24 @ibendahl 7",
      "Main Menu\nBreadcrumb\nClimate Change: Global Temperature\nYearly surface temperature compared to the 20th-century average from 1880\u20132022. Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means\u00a0a significant increase in accumulated heat.\nThat extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals\u2014expanding some and shrinking others.\u00a0 As the map below shows, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions.\nTrends in global average surface temperature between 1993 and 2022 in degrees Fahrenheit per decade. Most of the planet is warming (yellow, orange, red). Only a few locations, most of them in Southern Hemisphere oceans, cooled over this time period. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from NOAA Centers for Environmental Information.\nAbout surface temperature\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100\u00b0F (55\u00b0C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget\u2014how much sunlight\u00a0Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat\u2014over time.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute\u00a0temperature readings\u00a0to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple\u00a0independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate\u00a0the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nGlobal temperature in 2022\nAccording to the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2022 ranked among the ten warmest for that month, despite the cooling influence from the La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The \"coolest\" month was November, which was 1.35 \u02daF (0.75 \u02daC) warmer than average.\n(map) Global average surface temperature in 2022 compared to the 1991-2020 average, with places that were warmer than average colored red, and places that were cooler than average colored blue. (graph) The bars on the graph show global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average each year from 2022 (right) back to 1976 (left)\u2013the last year the world was cooler than average. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to NCEI,\nThe year 2022 was the sixth warmest year since global records began in 1880 at 0.86\u00b0C (1.55\u00b0F) above the 20th century average of 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F). This value is 0.13\u00b0C (0.23\u00b0F) less than the record set in 2016 and it is only 0.02\u00b0C (0.04\u00b0F) higher than the last year's (2021) value, which now ranks as the seventh highest. The 10 warmest years in the 143-year record have all occurred since 2010, with the last nine years (2014\u20132022) ranking as the nine warmest years on record.\nFor more regional details and 2022 climate statistics, see the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nPast and future change in global temperature\nThough warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA's\u00a02021 Annual Climate Report the combined\u00a0land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of\u00a00.14 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.08 degrees\u00a0Celsius)\u00a0per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 has been more than twice as fast: 0.32 \u00b0F (0.18 \u00b0C) per decade.\nThe amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activities\u2014burning fossil fuels and clearing forests\u2014add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon (equivalent to a little over 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide increases each year.\n(left) Hypothetical pathways of carbon emissions (\"representative concentration pathways,\" or RCPs) throughout the twenty-first century based on different possible energy policies and economic growth patterns. (right)\u00a0 Projected temperature increase relative to the 1901-1960 average depending on which RCP we eventually follow. Image by Katharine Hayhoe, from the 2017 Climate Science Special Report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program.\nAccording to the 2017 U.S. Climate Science Special Report, if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and possibly as much as 10.2 degrees warmer. If annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050,\u00a0 models project temperatures would still be at least 2.4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20th century, and possibly up to 5.9 degrees warmer.\nReferences\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (2023).

      "\nMain Menu\nBreadcrumb\nU.S. climate outlook for September 2024\nAfter a very hot early and middle part of summer, August provided a welcome relief across much of the nation, with much-above-normal temperatures largely confined to the Deep South. The summer as a whole did average much warmer than average across the western and eastern parts of the nation, with only the central part of the nation having an average summer.\nSummer precipitation was generally below normal across most of the country, with only those areas that were hit by tropical systems (Beryl in the middle of the nation during July, Debby in the East during August) seeing above-average rainfall for the summer. Those summer precipitation deficits contributed to a large increase in drought, with the amount of the country experiencing drought more than doubling between early June and late August.\nAs we head into fall, will temperatures remain moderate, or will summer (in the form of hot weather) make a return? Will drought continue to expand across the nation or will beneficial rains start to reduce drought? Here\u2019s the outlook from NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) for September.\nThe U.S. temperature outlook for September 2024, showing where the monthly temperature is favored to be much warmer than average (orange and red) for September or much cooler than average (blues). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme temperatures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a warm, cool, or near-average September.\u00a0Much warmer\u00a0or\u00a0much cooler than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of average September temperatures from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nOn August 31, CPC released its updated monthly climate outlooks for temperature, precipitation, and drought across the United States for September 2024. The temperature outlook in general favors well above average temperatures across most of the western and central parts of the nation, along the Gulf Coast and in New England. Below-average temperatures are favored in the Mid-Atlantic, with no tilt in odds toward any category for locations in between. The precipitation outlook favors well above average precipitation along the Pacific Northwest Coast and in a region extending from the Southern Plains, through the Southeast, to the southern mid-Atlantic. Well below average precipitation is favored across much of the North, from the Northern Rockies eastward to parts of the Northeast and also in the central Rockies and the Southwest.\nThe precipitation outlook for September 2024, showing where the average precipitation (rain and snow) is favored to be much higher than average (greens) or much lower than average (browns). Darker colors mean\u00a0higher chances, not more extreme precipitation departures. White areas mean that there are equal chances for a wet, dry, or near-average September.\u00a0Much higher\u00a0or\u00a0much lower than average\u00a0means \"in the upper or lower third\" of total September precipitation amounts from 1991-2020. Text-only\u00a0forecast for Hawaii\u00a0available from NOAA Climate Prediction Center.\u00a0\nIn addition to providing more specifics about the outlooks and their basis, I\u2019ll discuss the current state of drought, changes in drought observed during August, and the drought outlook for September. Finally, here\u2019s my monthly reminder that the colors on the temperature and precipitation outlook maps only provide information about the most likely outcome, but that other outcomes are always possible, just less likely. More details about interpreting the outlooks can be found here.\nThe updated outlooks were produced considering the Week 1 forecast from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), and CPC\u2019s own Week 2 and Week 3-4 outlooks. Other tools that forecasters examined this month were longer-range forecast models such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2), the European Ensemble Forecast System (ECMWF) as well as products derived from these models. With the expected arrival of La Ni\u00f1a somewhat delayed, it did not play a role in the September outlooks. Recent boundary conditions such as coastal sea surface temperatures (which can impact temperatures along the coast) and observed soil moisture (extremes in soil moisture (both wet and dry) can influence temperatures and precipitation during the warm part of the year) were also considered for these outlooks.\nTemperature outlook favors more heat in the West, uncertainty in much of the East\nThe September temperature outlook favors well above average temperatures across much of the western half of the nation, along the Gulf Coast into Florida, and in parts of the Northeast. (Well above average means \u201cin the warmest third of all Septembers in the recent climate record.\u201d) Well below normal temperatures are slightly favored for parts of the Mid-Atlantic region with equal chance odds found (1/3 chance each of below-, near-, and above-average) in the remainder of the eastern half of the country and along the Pacific coastal regions.\nThe best odds for a warmer-than-normal September are in southern Florida and out West in a region extending from the Northern Plains southward to the desert Southwest, with probabilities exceeding 60%. Temperatures are forecast to be above average in the western region in all CPC outlooks (6-10 day, Week-2, and Week 3-4), as well as in Florida, where well above normal sea surface temperatures surround the peninsula. Above-average temperatures are favored early in the month along the West Coast, but troughing (jet stream shifted south of normal) is predicted during the latter half of the month, which injects enough uncertainty into the monthly average that the forecast is \u201cequal chances\u201d along the coast.\nIt\u2019s a much different story in the eastern half of the nation, as September looks to begin with below-average temperatures during the first half of the month. Longer range outlooks (Weeks 3-4) do favor above-average temperatures, so \u201cequal chances\u201d is the outlook for much of this region. The exception is the mid-Atlantic, where the cooler temperatures early in the month are likely to outweigh the warmer temperatures later in the month.\nPrecipitation outlook tilts wet in across the South, mainly dry across the North\nThe precipitation outlook for September once again has a fairly large amount of the country with a non-\u201cequal chances\u201d forecast. Above-average rainfall is favored across much of the South, from West Texas eastward across the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic and also in the coastal Pacific Northwest. The tilt in the odds is largest in Texas, where heavy rainfall is anticipated during the first week of the month and in Florida where above-average rainfall is favored during most of the month. Finally, although the month is predicted to start dry in the Northwest, forecasts for Week-2 and Weeks 3-4 favor above-average rainfall with the approaching trough.\nBelow-average precipitation is slightly favored from parts of the Southwest northward across the Central Rockies into Montana, consistent with a dry start to the month and longer-range guidance favoring either below normal or equal chances. Throughout the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes, confidence for below-average September precipitation is higher, as below-normal rainfall is favored during all time periods.\nU. S. Drought area increases further during August\nThe amount of drought increased during August across the continuous United States, from about 20% to almost 28%, with another 35% of the nation in the DO category (abnormally dry) as we begin September. The percent of the country in the two most intense categories (D3-D4, representing extreme and exceptional drought) also increased during the month to almost 2.5%, although that is still fairly low by historical standards.\nThe summer of 2024 has been relatively hot and dry across much of the contiguous United States, and the area that is either abnormally dry (yellow) or in some level of drought (moderate, light orange; severe, orange; extreme, bright red; exceptional, dark red) expanded considerably between June 4 (left) and August 27 (right). Areas of exceptional drought appeared in Montana, Texas, West Virginia, and Ohio. Moderate to severe drought was in place in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and the Deep South. NOAA Climate.gov map from our\u00a0Data Snapshots Collection,\u00a0based on data from the U.S. Drought Monitor project.\u00a0\nRegionally, much of the nation saw drought degradation, particularly from the Southern Plains into the Deep South. Much of this region recorded 2-3 class changes. Mainly 1 class degradation was observed over parts of the West, central and northern Great Plains (up to 2 class changes) and in parts of Ohio and West Virginia, where despite modest changes (1-2 classes), exceptional drought (D4) developed for the first time in the 25-year Drought Monitor history. In contrast, significant drought improvement (often drought removal) was observed in parts of the East, mainly along the path of Debby, where upwards of 10 inches of rain eliminated drought in most of South Carolina and lesser amounts of rainfall improved drought conditions by 1-2 classes farther north.\nDrought outlook mainly predicts persistence and development, but improvement across parts of the South\nU.S. map of predicted drought changes or persistence in September 2024. Across Texas and the Deep South, drought is likely to end (green) or at least improve (tan). But significant parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Rockies, the Southwest, the Southern Plains, and northern West Virginia and the Ohio River valley are likely to see drought develop (yellow) or persist or worsen (dark brown). NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). See\u00a0CPC version\u00a0for Alaska and Hawaii.\nWith above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation favored during September over much of the western half of the nation, drought persistence with some new development is most likely. The exception is in parts of eastern New Mexico and Texas, where improvement or removal is likely, consistent with the expectation of above-normal rainfall, particularly during the beginning of the month. The eastern half of the nation is more of a mixed bag, with improvement and removal likely in regions where above-normal rainfall is favored across much of the South and persistence and some development (over parts of the Midwest) where the odds favor either below-average rainfall or there is no tilt in the odds towards any category.\nTo read the entire discussion of the monthly climate outlooks from the Climate Prediction Center, check out their\u00a0website.\nWe value your feedback\nHelp us improve our content\nRelated Content\nNEWS & FEATURES\nMAPS & DATA\nTEACHING CLIMATE\nCLIMATE RESILIENCE TOOLKIT\nStay Connected\n",

      "How Many Polar Bears Are Left?\nSeveral populations likely face grave danger from climate change\nPaul Souders / Getty Images\n The global polar bear population is thought to be between 22,000 and 31,000. These bears are divided into 19 subpopulations around the Arctic, with some containing fewer than 200 individuals and others consisting of more than 2,000.\n\n Polar bears' rapidly dwindling populations serve as a symbol of the climate crisis globally, but are they technically endangered? Their conservation status may surprise you. Learn more about polar bear populations, the threats these animals face, and what we can do to save them from extinction.\n\nDid You Know?\nPolar bears live in areas that fall under the jurisdiction of five countries: Canada (Labrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Qu\u00e9bec, Yukon); Denmark (Greenland); Norway (Svalbard, Jan Mayen); Russia (Yakutiya, Krasnoyarsk, West Siberia, North European Russia); and the U.S. (Alaska).\n  Are Polar Bears Endangered?  \nPaul Souders / Getty Images\n Polar bears are listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, a designation they first received in 1982 and that was upheld by the latest assessment in 2015. They are protected by the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, a multilateral treaty signed in 1973 by the five polar bear nations: Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the U.S. This agreement prohibits unregulated hunting of polar bears, including the use of aircraft or large motorized vehicles to hunt them. It compels member states to take appropriate actions to preserve the ecosystems that sustain polar bears.\n\n Although not technically endangered, the U.S. government has protected them under the Endangered Species Act since 2008, classifying them as threatened throughout their range. It's important to note that while these bears face potentially existential threats in some places, a few populations have rebounded in recent decades from overhunting in the last century, leading some people to argue polar bears are actually thriving.\n\n The late U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska was one of those people, saying in 2018 that \"there are now three times as many polar bears in the Arctic than there were in the 1970s,\" a claim that has periodically resurfaced since. According to the IUCN, it's not clear which way polar bear populations are swinging on the whole. World Wildlife Fund data from 2019 shows that more subpopulations are declining than are increasing. The largest subpopulations look to be stable.\n\nLaws Protecting Polar Bears\nCountries with polar bear populations have passed laws enacting various protections for the bears. In the U.S., polar bears are protected partly by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which prohibits the \"take\" of polar bears and other marine mammals without federal approval. They are also protected by the Endangered Species Act since being listed as a \"threatened\" species in 2008.\n  Limitations to the Data  \n Despite the encouraging rebound of some populations, there is little evidence to suggest polar bears are thriving overall. That's partly because there isn't enough long-term data on polar bears, especially for the northernmost regions.\n\n Those who doubt their current plight have claimed that only 5,000 polar bears were left in the 1960s, but that claim is largely contested by conservation experts.\n\n At least three polar bear populations are likely in decline, according to the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG), but nine of the 19 subpopulations have insufficient data. There is too little data to even estimate population size for the three in decline.\n\n While their specific status is more muddled than the overall outlook for climate change itself, there is significant evidence to suggest many polar bear populations are in peril.\n\n  How Is Climate Change Affecting Polar Bear Populations?  \nFloridaStock / Shutterstock\n To understand why polar bears are threatened by climate change, you have to consider what polar bears eat and how they get their food. Polar bears are apex predators and a keystone species in their Arctic habitats, and their favorite food, by far, is seals. They specifically target ringed and bearded seals due to their high-fat content.\n\n Polar bears spend about half their time hunting, typically by stalking seals from the sea ice and ambushing when they surface to breathe. They often travel long distances and wait hours or days for a single seal, and while only a fraction of their hunts succeed, it's generally worth the trouble for such a fatty meal.\n\n Polar bears are considered marine mammals, but while they are excellent swimmers, they are no match for a seal in the water. Sea ice is therefore instrumental to their hunting strategy, and it's now declining due to rising Arctic temperatures, now warming at roughly twice the rate of the planet overall.\n\nPaul Souders / Getty Images\n Arctic sea ice naturally waxes and wanes with the seasons, but its average late-summer minimum is now shrinking by 13% every decade, according to the NOAA. The oldest Arctic sea ice\u2014frozen for at least four years, making it more resilient than younger, thinner ice\u2014is now in steep decline. Whereas it comprised about 16% of the total ice pack in 1985, it now comprises less than 1%, representing a loss of 95% over just 33 years.\n\n In 2020, Arctic sea ice reached its second-lowest extent since record-keeping began. This decline is alarming for several reasons: Arctic sea ice performs key services for the planet like reflecting solar heat and influencing ocean currents. It's even more directly important for polar bears, as less sea ice means fewer chances for them to catch seals.\n\nPosnov / Getty Images\n The effects of climate change vary by location, and sea ice decline seems to be affecting some bears more than others. Western Hudson Bay had roughly 1,200 polar bears in the 1980s, for example, but that has since fallen to 842, and as Polar Bears International (PBI) notes, trends in their body condition, survival, and abundance have been linked to sea ice conditions. Bears in Southern Hudson Bay have also suffered a 17% decline since 2012, according to PBI, and their body conditions have similarly been linked to a longer ice-free period.\n\n Most other subpopulations are either considered stable or lack sufficient data, but many will likely also face dire challenges from the loss of sea ice in their habitats. Some might be able to adapt, but their options likely will be limited. Even if they can exploit new food sources on land, they could face competition or conflict with established residents like brown bears and people.\n\n Polar bears are slow to adapt due to their low reproductive rate and long time between generations. That doesn't bode well given the speed of modern climate change, already happening too quickly for many species to keep up.\n\nPolar bears can live up to about 30 years, but environmental factors (melting Arctic ice, for example) can significantly decrease their lifespans.\nPolar bears are apex predators and a keystone species in the Arctic. Without them, animals like Arctic foxes and seagulls would lose a food source. Seals, reindeer, whales, and birds that polar bears eat would become overpopulated.\nThe best way to help polar bear populations today is to fight climate change\u2014both systematically and in your own life. Drive less, reduce your energy consumption, recycle, and swap some of your meat intake with locally grown veggies. If you have the means, consider donating to a charity like Polar Bears International.\n\"Polar Bear Facts.\" World Wildlife Fund.\nWiig, \u00d8., et al.\u00a0\"Ursus maritimus.\"\u00a0The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\u00a02015: e.T22823A14871490.\u00a0Accessed on\u00a015 June 2022.\n\"Arctic Report Card.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Arctic Program. 2021.\n\"Climate Change: Arctic Sea Ice Summer Minimum.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 2020.\n\"Arctic Report Card.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Arctic Program. 2018.\n\"Arctic Sea Ice Extent.\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\"Are Polar Bears Endangered?\" Polar Bears International.\nObbard, Martyn Ernest, et al. \"Estimating the abundance of the Southern Hudson Bay polar bear subpopulation with aerial surveys.\" Polar Biology. 2015.\nFollow Us\n",

In addition, approximately 300 polar bears are held in captivity. However, the world's population of polar bears is on a decline, and some scientists fear they could become extinct by 2100. To protect these majestic creatures, the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibit harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing polar bears.\nA significant portion of the polar bear population resides in Canada, where two-thirds of all polar bears live. About 16,000 polar bears are spread across 13 provinces and territories, including Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Northern Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland, and Labrador. Notably, Churchill, Manitoba, is known as the polar bear capital of the world due to its high concentration of these animals.\nIn the United States, Alaska is the only state with a polar bear population, estimated to be between 4,000 and 7,000 individuals. The polar bears in Alaska are primarily divided into two subpopulations: those in the Chukchi Sea, or Alaska-Chukotka, and the Southern Beaufort Sea.\nRussia is home to an estimated 26,000 polar bears, living on islands and the mainland coast. Wrangel Island, a UNESCO-protected nature reserve in Russia, is often referred to as a polar bear maternity ward. Additional polar bear populations in Russia are found in the Barents Sea region, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya, and the Far East Village.\nGreenland's fjords and glacial ice are also home to polar bears, though they are elusive and rarely seen. It's estimated that around 4,400 polar bears inhabit Greenland, with two protected areas, Melville Bay and Greenland National Park, supporting polar bear populations.\nThe Svalbard archipelago in Norway is another prime location for spotting polar bears, with an estimated population of around 3,000. Despite their remote habitats, polar bear encounters can sometimes be dangerous. Since the 1970s, there have been six recorded human fatalities due to polar bear attacks.\nMost polar bears in captivity are found in zoos, aquariums, and parks across Europe, North America, and Asia, contributing to conservation and education efforts about these iconic Arctic inhabitants.\n\nThe global polar bear population is estimated to be 20000-25000 individuals as of 2023, shared between all countries included in the species' range: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia, and the United States, as well as in international polar regions.\nPolar bears often roam from one country's territory into another, particularly in the winter when the polar ice reaches its broadest spread. As such, per-country population estimates are logistically challenging and can become outdated very quickly.\n\nCountry\nRegions Occupied\nCanada\nLabrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Yukon Territory\nGreenland\nGreenland\nNorway\nNorway\nRussia\nChukotka, Northern European Russia, Siberia\nUnited States\nAlaska\n\nUrsus Maritimus (Polar Bear) - IUCN Red List\n\nSources\n\u00a9 2024 World Population Review \u00a0Privacy PolicyTermsContactAbout\nCite This Page\nCite This Page"

In addition, approximately 300 polar bears are held in captivity. However, the world's population of polar bears is on a decline, and some scientists fear they could become extinct by 2100. To protect these majestic creatures, the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibit harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing polar bears.\nA significant portion of the polar bear population resides in Canada, where two-thirds of all polar bears live. About 16,000 polar bears are spread across 13 provinces and territories, including Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Northern Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland, and Labrador. Notably, Churchill, Manitoba, is known as the polar bear capital of the world due to its high concentration of these animals.\nIn the United States, Alaska is the only state with a polar bear population, estimated to be between 4,000 and 7,000 individuals. The polar bears in Alaska are primarily divided into two subpopulations: those in the Chukchi Sea, or Alaska-Chukotka, and the Southern Beaufort Sea.\nRussia is home to an estimated 26,000 polar bears, living on islands and the mainland coast. Wrangel Island, a UNESCO-protected nature reserve in Russia, is often referred to as a polar bear maternity ward. Additional polar bear populations in Russia are found in the Barents Sea region, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya, and the Far East Village.\nGreenland's fjords and glacial ice are also home to polar bears, though they are elusive and rarely seen. It's estimated that around 4,400 polar bears inhabit Greenland, with two protected areas, Melville Bay and Greenland National Park, supporting polar bear populations.\nThe Svalbard archipelago in Norway is another prime location for spotting polar bears, with an estimated population of around 3,000. Despite their remote habitats, polar bear encounters can sometimes be dangerous. Since the 1970s, there have been six recorded human fatalities due to polar bear attacks.\nMost polar bears in captivity are found in zoos, aquariums, and parks across Europe, North America, and Asia, contributing to conservation and education efforts about these iconic Arctic inhabitants.\n\nThe global polar bear population is estimated to be 20000-25000 individuals as of 2023, shared between all countries included in the species' range: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia, and the United States, as well as in international polar regions.\nPolar bears often roam from one country's territory into another, particularly in the winter when the polar ice reaches its broadest spread. As such, per-country population estimates are logistically challenging and can become outdated very quickly.\n\nCountry\nRegions Occupied\nCanada\nLabrador, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec, Yukon Territory\nGreenland\nGreenland\nNorway\nNorway\nRussia\nChukotka, Northern European Russia, Siberia\nUnited States\nAlaska\n\nUrsus Maritimus (Polar Bear) - IUCN Red List\n\nSources\n\u00a9 2024 World Population Review \u00a0Privacy PolicyTermsContactAbout\nCite This Page\nCite This Page",
      "Graphing polar bear population estimates over\u00a0time\nI\u2019ve already commented on the 2013 update of polar bear population status released by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG).\nHowever, I thought it might be interesting to graph the changes in global population estimates over time (from 1981-2013) \u2014 not just the actual estimates from PBSG status tables (with their min/max error ranges) but those totals plus the so-called \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates that the PBSG have dropped from their accounts in recent (2005-2013) assessments: Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Queen Elizabeth Islands (now known as the \u201cArctic Basin\u201d), and Laptev Sea.\nIn 2001, those \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates contributed 5,000-5,400 bears to the global total, but now they\u2019re gone \u2014 no bears from those regions contribute to the official totals\u00a0listed on recent PBSG status tables.\nAdding those dropped estimates back into the global totals makes it possible to generate a graph in which the global estimates are truly comparable over time.\nTo see how the dropped estimates influenced the perception of population change over time, I\u2019ve also graphed the estimates given by the PBSG in their status tables. I\u2019ve combined the two into one image (Fig. 1, click to enlarge) to make comparison easy.\nUPDATE 5 December 2014: Links to more recent posts relevant to this issue added below. The most recent numbers, added 31 May 2015, are here.\nUPDATE 26 March 2019: See \u201cLatest global polar bear abundance \u2018best guess\u2019 estimate is 39,000 (26,000-58,000)\u201d\n\nFigure 1. Upper graph uses totals reported in PBSG status tables, with min/max; Lower graph uses the same figures, but adds back in the so-called \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates dropped 2005-2013. The 1960 figure * is a ballpark estimate\nWhat is apparent is that the global population of polar bears has not declined over the last 30 years, as the PBSG status tables indicate.\nAlthough it\u2019s true that the official estimates for 2005 and 2009 publicized by the PBSG (\u201c20,000-25,000\u201d) also indicated no recent change, the numbers listed on their status tables don\u2019t tell the same story. What\u2019s the point of insisting on supposedly more accurate \u201cscientific\u201d estimates if you don\u2019t use them to generate your official total?\nNote that the most recent status table released last week, for 2013, did not include a new total \u2014 if you wanted to know if the global total had changed (and if so, by how much), you had to add the figures up yourself. Nowhere on the PBSG website does it now list an official population estimate. What\u2019s that about?\n\nFinally, note that I\u2019ve included a ballpark estimate for 1960 that reflects international concern that many years of unregulated hunting had seriously depleted populations, as occurred for numerous other species (indicated as a broad range rather than a single figure). And while it is true that no one truly knows how many polar bears there were in 1960, it is also true that by that time, over-hunting had occurred on a large scale for decades, and that there were fewer bears then than there are now (see another discussion of that topic here).\nUPDATE 5 December 2014: Links to more recent posts relevant to this issue added below:\nStatus of Canadian polar bear populations has been changed \u2013 more good news October 28, 2014\nW Hudson Bay polar bear population no longer \u201cdeclining\u201d \u2013 where are the headlines? October 29, 2014\nThe Politics of Polar Bears documentary [excerpt links]  September 3, 2014\nNOTES ON METHODS\nWhere the PBSG status table for any given year (list below) gives a total range of estimates (maximum and minimum), as in 2001, I\u2019ve used the PBSG totals. Where the status tables do not give a total for the maximum, minimum and average numbers (i.e., 2005, 2009, 2013), I\u2019ve used those listed in the first column of each table (Fig. 2 below, and upper panel of Fig. 1). For example, the min/max and average estimates (rounded to nearest 10) from the status tables for 2005-2013 are:\n2005 15,130-27,760 (average 21,420)\n 2009 14,220-25,160 (average 19,610)\n 2013 13,070-24,240 (average 18,349)\nFig. 2 Graph using the figures listed in PBSG status tables only.\nWhile I acknowledge that earlier estimates (from the 80s and 90s) used different methods than later ones, which may have made them less accurate, they were the \u201cbest available science\u201d at the time. The purpose of this exercise is to compare the PBSG published numbers from these documents:\n1981 8th Meeting \u2013 Oslo, Norway (Anonymous 1985: Table 1)\n1993 11th Meeting \u2013 Copenhagen, Denmark (Wiig et al. 1995: Table 1)\n1997 12th Meeting \u2013 Oslo, Norway (Derocher et al. 1998: Table 1)\n2001 13th Meeting \u2013 Nuuk, Greenland (Lunn et al. 2002: Table 1)\n2005 14th Meeting \u2013 Seattle, Washington (Aars et al. 2006: Table 1)\n2009 15th Meeting \u2013 Copenhagen, Denmark (Obbard et al. 2010: Table 1)\n2013 Online status update, posted February 14, 2014\nAs I\u2019ve pointed out previously, adjustments made to the PBSG status tables that dropped to zero estimates that had formerly been included in the global totals suggested that by 2009, the totals must actually have increased by 2650 to 5700 bears since 2001.\nSo to make the population estimates comparable over time, we really need to add back in the ballpark estimates for the Queen Elizabeth Islands (which includes any bears residing there and in the Arctic Basin, last estimated at 200 bears), East Greenland (2,000 bears) and the Chukchi Sea (2,000 bears)1, which were dropped in the 2005 and 2009 PBSG assessments, as well as the estimate for the Laptev Sea (800-1200 bears, dropped in 2013, discussed here).\n[I did not include adjustments for Barents Sea changes in this graph (as I did previously), to keep the comparison simple and because some people might not agree that the Barents Sea adjustment qualifies as the same kind of change as the dropped estimates]\nFigure 3. Graph using figures from the PBSG status tables plus \u201cinaccurate\u201d estimates dropped between 2005 & 2013.\nFootnote:\n1. Although the estimate for this region is indeed less \u201cscientifically\u201d accurate than those from regions that have been surveyed, it is very clear that large number of bears reside in the Chukchi Sea. For example, Rode and colleagues (Rode et al. 2014) used an estimate of 2,000 for the Chukchi Sea region (\u201cbased on extrapolation of den surveys\u201d) to argue that the Chukchi and the Southern Beaufort population of bears were of \u201csimilar size.\u201d PBSG biologists apparently like to have it both ways: ignore the Chukchi estimate when it doesn\u2019t suit them (for global estimates) but include it when they need it for statistical work.\nReferences\nAars, J., Lunn, N.

      "10 Impactful Ways to Conserve Coral Reefs\n\n\t\t\tBy: \t\t\tAuthor Our Endangered World \nPosted on Last updated: October 13, 2023\nWhat can we do to conserve coral reefs? Coral reefs are critically important ecosystems, providing a wide range of benefits to both humans and marine life. They support extraordinary biodiversity and marine species, including fish, sea mammals, and invertebrates.\nWhile they only cover less than one percent of the ocean, coral reefs support an estimated 25% of sea life. They provide nursery, spawning, refuge, and feeding areas for various sea organisms. These include mollusks, crustaceans, and sea urchins.\nAlso, they play an essential role in water quality and coastal stability. For example, they help to filter sediments and nutrients from the water. Additionally, they act as natural breakwaters. As such, they minimize wave impacts from storms such as hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons.\nThat\u2019s not all; coral reefs form stunning ecosystems that appeal to the eyes. This makes them a powerful tourism attraction feature. In general, coral reefs provide habitat, food, income, protection, and medicine.\nHowever, various factors like water pollution threaten these beautiful sea species. And this calls for their protection. How, then, can we help protect the world\u2019s coral reefs and ensure that they continue to play an important role in the ocean ecosystem?\nTable of Contents\nHow to Conserve Coral Reefs\nIf you want to learn how to conserve coral reefs, here are superb options you can consider.\n1. Learn About the Threats Coral Reefs are Facing\nOne of the most important things you can do is to educate yourself about the threats surrounding coral reefs. You can make informed decisions that help save coral reefs when you are aware of these threats.\nSome of the main threats to coral reef survival include the following:\nPollution can come from various sources, such as agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage effluent. On the other hand, coastal development causes water runoff and sedimentation, which damage coral reefs. Also, it can disrupt coral reef habitats and lead to the introduction of non-native species.\nOverfishing can impact the populations of fish species that eat coral reef algae. This leads to the depletion of coral reef ecosystems.\nClimate change causes increased ocean temperature and oceanic acidity levels. Warmer waters increase the likelihood of coral bleaching events. And more acidic ocean waters harm coral reefs and impede their growth.\nIf we learn how to keep coral reefs healthy and reduce these threats, we can take proactive steps to protect them. In return, this helps guarantee their continued survival.\nSee Related: What is Overfishing? Examples & Solutions to Prevent\n2. Become a Reef-Safe Traveler\nIf you become a reef-safe traveler, you help protect coral reefs. Also, you help protect the beaches and ocean habitats from harm and contribute to the conservation efforts in the coastal areas.\nBut how can you become a reef-safe traveler? There are many ways to do so. First, choose accommodations with minimal environmental impacts. Choose the ones with low-flow faucets and toilets to conserve water when taking a shower or washing dishes.\nYou can also reduce your environmental impact using energy-saving or Energy Star-Certified appliances. Also, switching off lights and electronic devices while not in use or when leaving the room can help.\nWhen walking along the beach, practice responsible tourism. For example, ensure that you don\u2019t touch or step on any coral you see on the beach.\nYou can also be reef safe by using reusable water bottles and bags. Alternatively, buy locally-made eco-friendly products. Always avoid single-use plastics wherever possible.\nKeep off from souvenirs or aquariums made of living coral. And if you must purchase a souvenir, choose one made of wood or another non-coral material.\nLastly, if you have a pet, take steps to prevent it from harming the coral and surrounding environment. When you do so, you will help to conserve these valuable ecosystems for future generations to enjoy.\nSee Related: Best Solutions to Climate Change\n3. Practice Safe Snorkeling and Diving\nOne of the best ways to preserve and protect coral reefs is to practice safe snorkeling and diving. And since snorkeling is a fun activity for many people, doing it responsibly can go a long way.\nThe first step here in protecting these ecosystems is to avoid touching the reefs or anchoring your boat to them. Anchoring can damage or even kill corals. As for touching, it may damage delicate coral animals and reef fishes.\nAnother way to help protect coral reefs is to choose a dive site that is not too close to them. Also, if you see damaged coral, avoid it. Instead, report it to authorities so they can take proper measures to ensure the reef\u2019s health.\nAdditionally, ensure that the visitors on your dive trip do their part to protect the environment. We should all strive to keep coral reefs alive for future generations.\nLastly, avoid destructive actions that can damage the reef ecosystem or deprive it of vital resources for survival. For instance, avoid standing on them or crushing them.\n4. Choose a Reef-Friendly Sunscreen\nAnother common concern for reef-conscious people is the impact of the chemicals sunscreen contains. While many modern sunscreens are safe for coral, some contain dangerous chemicals that can have long-term effects on marine ecosystems.\nWhen buying sunscreen, look for mineral-based sunscreens that use a micro-sized particle or non-nano zinc oxide as their active ingredients. These are safe and effective and do not contribute to coral bleaching.\nAvoid sunscreens with oxybenzone, Parabens, Triclosan, Octocrylene, Homosalate, and Octinoxate. These ingredients are toxic to coral reefs and other marine life if washed off into the ocean.\nAlways check the sunscreens\u2019 labels to find the active ingredients and choose the ones that will be safe for corals. Finally, ensure the products are in reusable containers or bio-degradable plant-based materials.\nSee Related: Best Books on Pollution | Noise, Air and Water\n5. Dispose of Trash Properly and Recycle\nMarine debris can harm coral reefs. Therefore, reduce throwing trash around as much as possible. Use materials that support the three Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). When you reuse and recycle the trash at home and on the go, especially those made of plastic, you help conserve the environment.\nDispose of trash properly in the proper cans to avoid the probability of it getting washed away into waterways and oceans.\nWhen on the beach, leave no traces behind. That means don\u2019t throw plastic cans and cigarette butts in the sand. Also, don\u2019t leave unwanted fishing lines on the beach or in the water.\nFinally, you can organize beach or reef cleanups or volunteer at environmental organizations that do such cleanups. Pick up trash from the community and dispose of it properly. Volunteer for annual trash cleanup activities to help protect the oceans from marine debris.\n6. Reduce Stormwater Runoff\nStormwater runoff is the fastest-growing source of pollution. This water flows after the rain hits parking lots, rooftops, and roads. Thus, this untreated water contains a wide range of contaminants.\nReducing stormwater runoff helps reduce flooding, prevent water pollution, and protect our water bodies. To achieve this, homeowners can use rain barrels and gardens to collect rainwater or install water catchments. Conserving water and planting trees can also help reduce runoff into the oceans.\nAvoiding the dumping of wastewater into the ocean can help too. Ensure that it passes through treatment before it reaches the water\u2019s natural bodies, such as tributaries, lakes, rivers, and oceans.\nSee Related: Breaking Down the Best Off-Grid Water Systems\n7. Minimize the Use of Fertilizers\u00a0\u00a0\nMinimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns can help protect water quality.\nWhen you use fertilizer in gardens, the nutrients, including phosphorous and nitrogen, eventually get washed away into the waterways. Finally, they end up in the ocean, damaging sea life.\nThese fertilizers, chemicals, and pesticides pollute the water and harm coral reefs. Therefore, reducing fertilizer overuse will help save coral reefs.\nAlternatively, consider only organic or ecological fertilizers. These are less likely to contaminate lands and water.\n8. Use Environmentally-Friendly Modes of Transportation\nOpting for a cleaner means of transport reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles that use gas and fossil fuels release carbon emissions into the environment. These emissions contribute to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, which impede coral growth.\nTherefore, reduce the use of vehicles. Instead, walk, take a bike, or use public transport (like trains and buses) to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nIf you plan to purchase a vehicle, go for a fuel-efficient hybrid or electric car. This helps reduce carbon footprint. Remember, human-generated greenhouse gases are the main contributor to global warming.\n9. Marine Parks and Reserves\nThe creation of marine parks and reserves can play a role in coral reef conservation efforts. First, they can help preserve the threatened marine species or species that can no longer survive in the ocean safely.\nSecondly, the marine protected areas help limit human activity, including commercial fishing, mining, and recreational activities, which may threaten coral reefs.\nPaying a visit to marine parks can help raise awareness about the ocean ecosystem. A perfect example of marine parks in the US is the East End Marine Park, Virgin Islands. It helps protect the largest barrier reef system in the Caribbean Sea. The park comprises 60 square miles of coral reefs and shallow seas, among other ocean inhabitants.\nSee Related: Is Polyvinyl Alcohol Bad for the Environment?\n10. Spread the Word About Coral Conservation\nEducating the community around you about conserving the coral reefs is crucial. First, share this information with your friends and family.\nAdditionally, organize seminars to raise awareness about protecting water quality and conserving coral reefs. Visit local schools around you and teach about coral reef conservation.\nJoin local businesses and organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs. The Planetary Coral Reef Foundation, Coral Reef Alliance, and Reef Relief are examples of organizations working hard to stop coral reef destruction.\nFinally, find out what your local representatives are doing about the conservation efforts and support them where possible. If there has been no activity on the same, write to them and demand action.\nFAQs\nWhat are the main threats to coral reefs?\nThere are numerous threats to coral reefs. But perhaps the major ones include global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, destructive fishing practices, and disease outbreaks. Runoff water from land-based activities, sedimentation from coastal development, and bleaching also form a big part of water pollution which is also a threat to the coral reefs.\nHow can I help protect the coral reefs?\nThe first step towards protecting the coral reefs is reducing your carbon footprint. For example, switching to renewable energy sources.Minimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns and avoiding wastewater dumping into oceans and waterways will also go a long way. Lastly, you can support organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs and educating others about conservation efforts.\nWhat is ocean acidification?\nOcean acidification is a process caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It leads to increased acidity in seawater, which can be damaging to corals and other organisms living in these waters.As more carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it decreases pH levels. This, in return, leads to decreased calcification rates and makes it difficult for reef-building organisms to form their calcium carbonate skeletons.\nRelated Resources\nRead These Other Guide\nCategories Environmental Conservation\nPost navigation\nHow Does Saving Water Help Climate Change?\n9 Best Solar-Powered Computers to Buy Today\nRecent Posts\nEco-Friendly Products\nSpecies\nEco-Friendly Products\nEnergy Efficient Products\nSolar Products\nConservation\nAbout\nCopyright OurEndangedWorld | All Rights Reserved\n",

This is a sharp increase from the previous assessment, published in 2008, which found a third of corals were in danger of being lost.\nClimate change is the leading cause of the declines, with high temperatures causing corals to eject the photosynthetic algae that live in their tissues. These events, known as bleaching, are becoming more extreme and more frequent, and causing mass die-offs in reefs across the world.\nThe IUCN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Director General, Dr Grethel Aguilar, has called for strong action to limit greenhouse gas emissions as the best option to protect these vital species.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis global coral assessment vividly illustrates the severe impacts of our rapidly changing climate on life on Earth and drives home the severity of the consequences,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealthy ecosystems like coral reefs are essential for human livelihoods \u00e2\u0080\u0093 providing food, stabilising coastlines, and storing carbon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe protection of our biodiversity is not only vital for our wellbeing but crucial for our survival. Climate change remains the leading threat to reef-building corals and is devastating the natural systems we depend on. We must take bold, decisive action to cut greenhouse gas emissions if we are to secure a sustainable future for humanity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nCorals get their colour from the photosynthetic algae that live inside them, as part of a relationship which has lasted for over 380 million years. \u00c2\u00a9 Alexandre.ROSA/ Shutterstock\nHow endangered are corals, and why are they important?\nThe results of the latest Red List are the latest reminder of the dangers that reef-building corals face, with the animals having become more threatened with every reassessment of their health.\nWhile Red List assessments have changed over the past 30 years, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimated that just 13 coral species were considered Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered in the 1990s. By the time of the next assessment in 2008, this figure had risen to 231.\nIt has now risen again, by more than 100, meaning almost half of all corals are at significant risk of extinction. This makes corals proportionately more endangered than all the major animal groups on land, including amphibians, mammals and reptiles.\nIf these coral species do become extinct, their loss would cause major changes for life in the oceans. Coral reefs support around a quarter of all marine life, and so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely that coral extinctions could cause losses among fish, crustaceans and many other groups.\nThe loss of coral reefs would also remove an important nursery habitat for fish, as the hard skeletons provide a safe area for small fish to grow up in, away from large predators. Fewer nursery habitats would likely mean fewer fish, impacting both predator populations and fisheries.\nThe economic impact of coral extinctions goes much further than fishing, with reefs estimated to prevent billions of pounds worth of damage from flooding and erosion every year by breaking up waves. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also likely tourism would suffer, cutting off a vital source of income for many communities.\nThe most at-risk reefs are in the Atlantic, where half of all species are at risk of extinction and a quarter are Critically Endangered. In a separate paper, published in PLOS One, researchers have examined the threats facing these corals in particular.\nThe staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis is found in the Atlantic, and is considered Critically Endangered under the most recent Red List. \u00c2\u00a9\u00c2\u00a0Alberto Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez-Ram\u00c3\u00adrez\nWhy are Atlantic corals so threatened?\nWhile the vast majority of reefs are found in the Indian and Pacific Ocean, around 10% are found in the Atlantic. These corals are very distinct from their relatives, having been separated from other corals by the joining of North and South America over three million years ago.\nIn total, 85 shallow-water coral species live in the Atlantic, with the most important hotspots found in the Caribbean and off the coast of Brazil.\u00c2\u00a0As study co-author Dr Nadia Santodomingo explains, the limited ability of these species to respond to the threats facing them means these reefs are more vulnerable to collapse.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAtlantic corals have been hit the hardest by reef decline,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Nadia, a Curator of Fossil Cnidaria at the Natural History Museum. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re facing a perfect storm of threats, of which climate change is just one part.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese corals are being significantly impacted by overfishing, pollution and coral diseases which are more prevalent in the Atlantic than in other regions. As a result, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprised to see the results of the IUCN assessment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDisease has perhaps had the most dramatic impact on Atlantic corals, devastating not only the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corals but also the animals they depend on. An unknown illness is suspected to have killed as much as 98% of the Caribbean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-spined sea urchins in the 1980s, meaning these grazers couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent algae from dominating many reefs.\nNew diseases are continuing to emerge, with stony coral tissue loss disease first detected in 2014. The illness has spread rapidly throughout the Caribbean, killing as many as 94% of all infected corals.\nRising temperatures are also an increasing threat, with bleaching just the tip of the iceberg. Higher levels of carbon dioxide are making the ocean more acidic, making it harder for corals to grow their calcium carbonate skeletons. Climate change has also been linked with rising numbers of hurricanes in the region, which are washing away centuries-old reefs in a matter of hours.\nWhile the PLOS One study raises plenty of cause for concern, it also notes some reasons to be hopeful. After the devastating declines of the 1970s and 1980s, the researchers found that the fall in Atlantic coral cover appears to be getting smaller.\nTo support these green shoots of recovery, further research needs to be taken to understand how corals can adapt to the challenges that face them. As Dr Beth Polidoro, a co-lead author of the paper, explains, this must go hand in hand with urgent action to combat climate change and the other threats facing coral.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions alongside action to address local threats if we want to give coral reefs a chance to survive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Beth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy acting now, we can slow the pace of ocean warming and broaden the window of opportunity for corals to potentially adapt and survive in the long term.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRead more\nDiscover oceans\nFind out more about why we need to protect oceans and read about the pioneering work of our marine scientists.\nRelated posts\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCoral reefs cover more of Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface than realised, new estimates reveal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSatellite images have revealed a missing 64,000 square kilometres of coral cover, an area similar to the size of Ireland.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOver half of coral reef cover across the world has been lost since 1950\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCoral reefs have declined by over half since the 1950s as they suffer from the effects of climate change and overfishing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe resilient coral reefs surviving ocean warming\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOcean warming is threatening coral reefs but some reefs are surviving the warming waters and offer hope for these vital ecosystems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHighlighting coral reefs at risk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhat can antique corals reveal about the impact of climate change on the ocean?\nDon't miss a thing\nReceive email updates about our news, science, exhibitions, events, products, services and fundraising activities.

Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine each ranked second warmest for the January\u2013March period.\nThe Alaska January\u2013March temperature was 9.4\u00b0F, 3.5\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Much of the state was above normal for the three-month period while temperatures were near average across the eastern portions of the state and in parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\nPrecipitation\n\n\nMarch precipitation for the contiguous U.S. was 2.85 inches, 0.34 inch above average, ranking in the wettest third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average across much of the West, in the Great Lakes and along the Gulf and East coasts and in parts of the northern Plains. Conversely, precipitation was below normal across much of the Ohio Valley, the Plains, and in parts of the Northwest and Florida. Maine and Rhode Island each had their second-wettest March on record.\nAlaska\u2019s average monthly precipitation ranked in the middle third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior, south-central Alaska and in parts of the Panhandle during the month.\n\n\nThe January\u2013March precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 8.15 inches, 1.19 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across much of the contiguous U.S., with Rhode Island having its second-wettest year-to-date period on record. Conversely, precipitation was below average across much of the northern Plains and in small parts of the Northwest, central and southern Plains, Ohio Valley and Southeast during the January\u2013March period.\nThe January\u2013March precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record, with above-average precipitation observed in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior and south-central Alaska, as well as southern portions of the Panhandle during this period.\nBillion-Dollar Disasters\nOne new billion-dollar weather and climate disaster was confirmed in March 2024 after a severe weather event impacted the central and southern U.S. during mid-March, with the most severe weather occurring on March 13\u201315.\u00a0The U.S. has sustained 378 separate weather and climate disasters since 1980 where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (including CPI adjustment to 2024). The total cost of these 378 events exceeds $2.675 trillion.\nOther Notable Events\nFive wildfires, including the Smokehouse Creek wildfire, were finally contained in the Texas Panhandle, the largest cattle-producing region in the world. The wildfires resulted in approximately 1.1 million acres scorched, hundreds of destroyed structures, hundreds of miles of ruined fencing and more than 7,000 dead cattle.Winter did not bring heavy snowfall to Wisconsin nor the temperatures necessary to maintain the snow, allowing fires to begin early and in high numbers. Between January\u2013March 2024, there have been more than 220 fires across Wisconsin.A 5.25-inch diameter hail stone fell in Ada, Oklahoma on March 14, which is the largest stone reported in Pontotoc County since 1950, as well as the largest to fall in the state in nearly 13 years.\nA state of emergency was declared for Ohio as several tornadoes struck the state, resulting in 3 fatalities on March 14 when an EF-3 tornado crossed Auglaize and Logan Counties.\nDrought\nAccording to the April 2 U.S. Drought Monitor report, about 18% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought, down about 3.6% from the end of February. Drought conditions expanded or intensified in portions of the Plains and in parts of the Northwest, central Mississippi Valley, northern Great Lakes and Hawaii this month. Drought contracted or was reduced in intensity across much of the Mississippi Valley, Puerto Rico and the West, and in parts of the Plains, Great Lakes and Carolinas.\nMonthly Outlook\nAbove-average temperatures are favored to impact much of the central U.S., Northwest and Northeast in April while above-average precipitation is likely from much of the Plains to parts of the East Coast and in much of the Southwest. Drought is likely to persist along portions of the Northern Tier, the Southwest, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Visit the Climate Prediction Center\u2019s Official 30-Day Forecasts and U.S. Monthly Drought Outlook website for more details.\nSignificant wildland fire potential for April is above normal across much of the Upper Midwest and in parts of the central and southern Plains. For additional information on wildland fire potential, visit the National Interagency Fire Center\u2019s One-Month Wildland Fire Outlook.\nThis monthly summary from NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making.

Each participant\u2019s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u2014including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u2014and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u201cAppropriate monetary policy\u201d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u2019s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 11\u201312, 2024.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n2.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants\u2019 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nThe confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\u2019 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.\n* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.\nTable 2.

As described in the box \"Forecast Uncertainty,\" under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.\n1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. Return to table\n2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. Return to table\n3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. Return to table\nForecast Uncertainty\nThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur.\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second and third years, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \u201cfan charts\u201d that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants\u2019 projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants' current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.\nBack to Top\nLast Update: September 18, 2024\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nAbout the Fed\nNews & Events\nMonetary Policy\nSupervision & Regulation\nFinancial Stability\nPayment Systems\nEconomic Research\nData\nConsumers & Communities\nConnect with the Board\n\nTools and Information\n\nContact\nPublications\nFreedom of Information (FOIA)\nOffice of Inspector General\nBudget & Performance | Audit\nNo FEAR Act\nEspa\u00f1ol\nWebsite Policies | Privacy Program\nAccessibility\n\nStay Connected\nFederal Reserve Facebook Page Federal Reserve Instagram Page Federal Reserve YouTube Page Federal Reserve Flickr Page Federal Reserve LinkedIn Page Federal Reserve Threads Page Link to Federal Reserve Twitter Page Subscribe to RSS Subscribe to Email\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551"

Each participant\u2019s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u2014including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u2014and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u201cAppropriate monetary policy\u201d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u2019s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 11\u201312, 2024.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n3.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants\u2019 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nThe confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\u2019 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.\n* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.\nTable 2.

For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.\n1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. Return to table\n2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. Return to table\n3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. Return to table\nForecast Uncertainty\nThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur.\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second and third years, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \u201cfan charts\u201d that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants\u2019 projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants' current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.\nBack to Top\nLast Update: September 18, 2024\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nAbout the Fed\nNews & Events\nMonetary Policy\nSupervision & Regulation\nFinancial Stability\nPayment Systems\nEconomic Research\nData\nConsumers & Communities\nConnect with the Board\n\nTools and Information\n\nContact\nPublications\nFreedom of Information (FOIA)\nOffice of Inspector General\nBudget & Performance | Audit\nNo FEAR Act\nEspa\u00f1ol\nWebsite Policies | Privacy Program\nAccessibility\n\nStay Connected\nFederal Reserve Facebook Page Federal Reserve Instagram Page Federal Reserve YouTube Page Federal Reserve Flickr Page Federal Reserve LinkedIn Page Federal Reserve Threads Page Link to Federal Reserve Twitter Page Subscribe to RSS Subscribe to Email\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551",
      "L.A. County faces $12.5 billion in climate costs through 2040, study says\nA first-of-its-kind report has estimated  that Los Angeles County must invest billions of dollars through 2040 to protect residents from worsening climate hazards, including extreme heat, increasing precipitation, worsening wildfires, rising sea levels and climate-induced public health threats.\nThe report, published this week by the nonprofit Center for Climate Integrity, identified  14 different climate adaptation measures that authors calculated would  cost L.A. taxpayers at least $12.5 billion over the next 15 years, or approximately $780 million per year. The vast majority of those costs \u2014 more than $9 billion \u2014 will be incurred by local municipal governments, including the cities of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Santa Clarita, the report said.\n\u201cThese numbers don\u2019t include the costs of recovering from disasters \u2014 from extreme weather events that knock out power or damage infrastructure or do all the kinds of things they do,\u201d said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity. \u201cSo it\u2019s a very conservative estimate, and yet it\u2019s a really big number.\u201d \nAggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health and science.\nWiles said the costs for L.A. County are nearly as high as for the entire state of Pennsylvania, which faces about $15 billion in climate adaptation costs over roughly the same  period. \n\u201cThis is a big number, but this is going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThese costs will be incurred at some point, and it\u2019s just much better to pay now than it is to pay later. I can\u2019t emphasize that enough.\u201d\nThe most expensive adaptation categories are related to precipitation and heat, including an estimated $4.3 billion for improved stormwater management, $2.5 billion for cool pavement investments and $1.4 billion for tree canopies to combat urban heat islands, the report found. Other costs include wildfire mitigation; coastal defense and infrastructure protection; building upgrades for cooling and air conditioning; and responses to vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus.\nCounty officials said the findings weren\u2019t surprising and agreed that they may even be conservative given the scale of the threats. \n\u201cThe impacts of climate have become more and more visible over the past few years in particular,\u201d said Rita Kampalath, L.A. County\u2019s chief sustainability officer. \u201cWe know that we\u2019re facing really, really huge needs in terms of how we prepare our communities to face those, and to be resilient in the face of increased climate impacts. It\u2019s only going to increase from here.\u201d\nStormwater capture in particular has been on the minds of many Angelenos this winter as record-breaking rainfall pounded the region. A monster storm in February saw the Los Angeles River roar to life and funnel millions of gallons  into the Pacific Ocean.\nBut the  river \u2014 which was encased in concrete nearly a hundred years ago \u2014 and other local  flood channels will be no match for climate change-enhanced storms of the future. Though the long-term trend in the West is toward hotter and drier conditions, Los Angeles will still see bouts of severe storms and extreme wet years that will increase flood risk significantly, according to the state\u2019s fourth climate change assessment. \nTo mitigate these impacts, the county must expand its stormwater drainage infrastructure by installing bioswales, porous pavement and other opportunities for stormwater to seep into the ground, the report found. It noted that these \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d upgrades are the least expensive option to cope with extreme rainfall events, as opposed to increasing the size and scale of hard infrastructure such as drain pipes. \n Climate & Environment \n The unloved L.A. River just prevented a flood disaster. Can more of its water be saved? \nCapturing rainfall is only one part of the L.A. River\u2019s job. It is also a flood control channel that is critical to protecting lives and properties when stormwaters surge. \nFeb. 8, 2024\nThe county is making progress on this work through its Safe Clean Water Program, passed by voters as Measure W in 2018, Kampalath said. The program allocates about $280 million annually to stormwater capture projects, although recent reports have found that progress to date has been slow. \n\u201cWhile it is a big need, I do actually feel like the county has been investing, and our residents and voters in particular have shown that this is a high priority,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not as far as we would like to be \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say that about much of anything when it comes to climate \u2014 but I do think that we have resources available to try to address some of these needs.\u201d \nMeanwhile, extreme heat continues to pose a significant threat to L.A. County residents, and it is  predicted to only get worse in the years and decades ahead. The region is expected to experience an average of 48.5 days above 90 degrees per year between 2024 and 2040, the report says. That\u2019s about 12.5 more hot days per year than communities experienced between 1994 and 2013. \nSome of the best methods to combat the dangers of rising heat include installing cool pavements, expanding urban green space, painting railway  tracks with reflective paint to keep them at operable temperatures, and upgrading cooling systems for public buildings such as schools, the report says. Converting public parking lots to cool pavements that reflect instead of absorb sunlight can also help lower ambient temperatures.\nHeat is \u201cthe impact that affects communities of color the most, and people less able to adapt themselves and their personal lives,\u201d Wiles said. He noted that some urban areas can simmer up to 20 degrees hotter than surrounding neighborhoods with heavy tree canopies. \n\u201cFrom a public health perspective, these types of adaptations are increasingly critical just to make neighborhoods livable,\u201d he said.\nThe report comes at a moment when the state is facing a significant $37.9-billion budget deficit, which has prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom to slash $2.9 billion from California climate programs, delay an additional $1.9 billion and shift $1.8 billion to other funds. \nKampalath said it\u2019s too soon to say whether those cuts will trickle down to L.A. County\u2019s climate efforts, but that they could potentially affect  funds officials were hoping to take advantage of through grants and other programs.\nHowever, she noted that many of the county\u2019s climate adaptation strategies can have multiple benefits, such as tree canopy programs that help combat heat and improve stormwater management simultaneously.\n\u201cAs we\u2019re looking at how to address these impacts, we do need to think about a multi-benefit approach, and what kind of strategies we can put in place that are really going to address a wide range of things \u2014 not only climate, but biodiversity and health impacts and the well-being of our communities as well,\u201d she said.\n Climate & Environment \n As climate hazards converge, more Californians are living in harm\u2019s way \nWhen wildfire smoke and extreme heat combine, they create a \u201csynergistic effect\u201d or an additional burden on people\u2019s health, researchers say.\nFeb. 3, 2024\nUltimately, funding for the projects outlined in the report will come from taxpayers, whether at the municipal, state or federal level, Wiles said. But he also hopes that oil and gas companies will be held accountable for their role in the worsening climate crisis, as fossil fuel emissions are by far the largest driver of global warming.\nLast year, California filed a bombshell lawsuit against five of the largest oil and gas companies for their alleged \u201cdecades-long campaign of deception\u201d about the risks posed by fossil fuels, which have forced the state to spend billions of dollars to address environmental-related damages. State Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta is seeking to create a nuisance abatement fund to finance climate mitigation and adaptation efforts, among other outcomes. \n\u201cEach and every community in Los Angeles County should consider bringing similar legal actions to hold climate polluters accountable and ensure that taxpayers aren\u2019t left to pay the bill alone,\u201d the report says. \nIndeed, there are other climate hazards that will cost Angelenos billions in adaptation expenses over the next decade and a half, the report found. \nThey include an increase in vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus as more mosquitoes are drawn to the area\u2019s changing temperatures and precipitation patterns. About 500,000 new cases of the virus are expected in the county through 2040, which will cost an estimated $993 million to treat. Climate change will also lead to more pediatric asthma cases due to an increase in pollen, with about 160,000 new cases expected through 2040. \nThe county also needs about $680 million in road improvements as heat and rain contribute to more cracks, erosion and soft surfaces. A foot of sea level rise along the coast of L.A. County  will require at least $576 million for berms, flood walls, bank stabilization and other infrastructure measures to prevent flooding and to avoid infrastructure damage by 2040. \nWildfires, already getting larger, faster and more frequent across California, will necessitate nearly $1 billion  just to clear vegetation and other fuels from land around the county\u2019s infrastructure, the report found. It noted that L.A. County will face an average of 36 more high-fire days through 2040 when compared to the 1994-to-2013 baseline. \nThe estimated $919-million wildfire cost does not account for fighting fires or repairing damage from blazes. The 2018 Woolsey fire racked up an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion in insured losses alone. \nWiles said the expenses outlined in the report won\u2019t solve climate change but will help \u201chold things where they are today,\u201d or least prevent the hazards from getting worse. \nHe said he hoped the report would help guide county officials as they face difficult choices about where, how and to what limited funds should be allocated. Investing in climate adaptations now can save money \u2014 and lives \u2014 later, he said. \n\u201cThese costs are still coming,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cThe next disaster will happen. This is just what it\u2019s going to cost to prepare.\u201d\nToward a more sustainable California\nGet Boiling Point, our newsletter exploring climate change, energy and the environment, and become part of the conversation \u2014 and the solution.\n You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. \nMore to Read \n Endorsement: Yes on Proposition 4.

      "Effects of Climate Change on Water Resources\nGlobal Climate Change And Precipitation\nModels of climate change (GCMs) predict U.S. annual-mean temperatures to generally rise by 2\u00b0 C to 3\u00b0 C over the next 100 years, with greater increases in northern regions (5\u00b0 C), and northern Alaska (10\u00b0 C). Numerous other climatic effects are also expected. For example, U.S. precipitation, which increased by 5 to 10% over the 20th century, is predicted to continue to increase overall. More specifically, an ensemble of GCMs predicts a 20% increase for northern North America, a 15% increase in winter precipitation for northwestern regions, and a general increase in winter precipitation for central and eastern regions. Despite predictions of increased precipitation in most regions, net decreases in water availability are expected in those areas, due to offsetting increases in evaporation. A 20% decrease in summer precipitation, for example, is projected for southwestern regions, and a general decrease in summer precipitation is projected for southern areas. Although projected regional impacts of climate change are highly variable between models, the above impacts are consistent across models. \nGlobal Climate Change And Water Resources\nAdditional effects of global climate change that have important implications for water resources include increased evaporation rates, a higher proportion of precipitation received as rain, rather than snow, earlier and shorter runoff seasons, increased water temperatures, and decreased water quality in both inland and coastal areas. The physical and economic consequences of each of these effects are discussed below. \nIncreased evaporation rates are expected to reduce water supplies in many regions. The greatest deficits are expected to occur in the summer, leading to decreased soil moisture levels and more frequent and severe agricultural drought. More frequent and severe droughts arising from climate change will have serious management implications for water resource users. Agricultural producers and urban areas are particularly vulnerable, as evidenced by recent prolonged droughts in the western and southern United States, which are estimated to have caused over $6  billion in damages to the agricultural and municipal sectors. Such droughts also impose costs in terms of wildfires, both in terms of control costs and lost timber and related resources.\nWater users will eventually adapt to more frequent and severe droughts, in part by shifting limited water supplies towards higher-value uses. Such shifts could be from low- to high-value crops, or from agricultural and industrial to environmental and municipal uses. A period of delay is likely, however, because gradual changes in the frequency and severity of drought will be difficult to distinguish from normal inter-annual variations in precipitation. Economic losses will be larger during this period of delay, as compared to a world with instantaneous adjustment, but preemptive adaptation could also be costly given the uncertainty surrounding future climate. \nRising surface temperatures are expected to increase the proportion of winter precipitation received as rain, with a declining proportion arriving in the form of snow. Snow pack levels are also expected to form later in the winter, accumulate in smaller quantities, and melt earlier in the season, leading to reduced summer flows. Such shifts in the form and timing of precipitation and runoff, specifically in snow-fed basins, are likely to cause more frequent summer droughts. Research shows that these changes are already taking place in the western United States. Changes in snow pack and runoff are of concern to water managers in a number of settings, including hydropower generation, irrigated agriculture, urban water supply, flood protection and commercial and recreational fishing. Timing of runoff will affect the value of hydropower potential in some basins if peak water run-off occurs during nonpeak electricity demand. Energy shortages and resulting energy price increases will provide incentives to expand reservoir capacities or develop alternative energy sources. \nIf the runoff season occurs primarily in winter and early spring, rather than late spring and summer, water availability for summer-irrigated crops will decline, and water shortages  will occur earlier in the growing season, particularly in watersheds that lack large reservoirs. Agricultural producers, in response to reduced water supplies and crop yields, will adjust their crop mix. Producers in irrigated regions might reduce total planted acreage, or deficit-irrigate more acres, to concentrate limited water supplies on their most valuable crops (e.g. onions and potatoes, rather than wheat and alfalfa). Producers in rain-fed regions might shift to crop species and varieties with shorter growing season requirements or greater drought tolerance, such as winter grains. \nCropping practices are likely to shift as well, perhaps towards reduced- or no-till technologies, which enhance water infiltration and conserve soil moisture, or towards irrigation technologies that are more efficient at the farm level (although not necessarily at the basin level). Producers may begin to supplement dwindling surface water supplies with groundwater resources, a response that has already been observed in many drought-stricken areas. These adjustments will mitigate a portion of private economic losses. They will also affect environmental quality, although the expected direction is more difficult to predict. \nA shift in stream hydrographs to more winter flow may also disrupt the life cycle of cold water fish species, such as salmon, which depend on late spring flows to \u0093flush\u0094 young salmon to the ocean, and on summer flows to moderate water temperatures. Unless winter runoff is captured and stored for late spring or summer use, fewer salmon smolt will survive migration and more frequent fish kills will occur from lethal stream water temperatures. Such environmental impacts will intensify debates about consumptive versus instream water uses, such as those ongoing in the Klamath and Platte River Basins. \nClimate change is expected to affect water quality in both inland and coastal areas. Specifically, precipitation is expected to occur more frequently via high-intensity rainfall events, causing increased runoff and erosion. More sediments and chemical runoff will therefore be transported into streams and groundwater systems, impairing water quality. Water quality may be further impaired if decreases in water supply cause nutrients and contaminants to become more concentrated.  Rising air and water temperatures will also impact water quality by increasing primary production, organic matter decomposition, and nutrient cycling rates in lakes and streams, resulting in lower dissolved oxygen levels.  Lakes and wetlands associated with return flows from irrigated agriculture are of particular concern. This suite of water quality effects will increase the number of water bodies in violation of today\u0092s water quality standards, worsen the quality of water bodies that are currently in violation, and ultimately increase the cost of meeting current water quality goals for both consumptive and environmental purposes.  \nRising sea levels could also reduce water quality and availability in coastal areas. Recent projections of sea-level rise by the end of the 21st century range from 19 to 58 cm. A more dramatic increase in sea-level, on the order of meters rather than centimeters, is possible, but most scientists consider it a low probability risk. For example, complete melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet or West Antarctic Ice Sheet would trigger such a large rise. Rising sea levels could affect groundwater quality directly via saltwater intrusion. Radical changes to the freshwater hydrology of coastal areas, caused by saltwater intrusion, would threaten many coastal regions\u0092 freshwater supplies. \nRising sea levels could also affect water availability in coastal areas indirectly by causing water tables in groundwater aquifers to rise, which could increase surface runoff at the expense of aquifer recharge. Water shortages will cause the price of water to rise, through monthly water bills or one-time connection fees for new homes and businesses. A sufficiently large price increase could affect the extent and pattern of urban growth throughout the United States. Costly water supply projects, such as desalination plants, pipelines, and dams will also become more economically attractive. \nOne final and important effect of the water resource impacts discussed above is the potential for more frequent and intense interstate and international water allocation conflicts. Water markets have the potential to prevent or diffuse such conflicts; however, the assignment of water rights to establish the market can create more conflict than it diffuses.\nCoping With Changing Water Resources\nAlthough subject to uncertainty, forecasts of climatic change offer a glimpse into possible future water resource impacts and challenges. Predicted impacts vary by region, but include increased temperatures and evaporation rates; higher proportions of winter precipitation arriving as rain, not snow; earlier and more severe summer drought, and decreased water quality. Water shortages, which currently result in substantial economics losses, will be more common in many regions because of these impacts. Such economic losses, which occur across a range of sectors, from agriculture to energy and recreation, have profound effects on local communities. More frequent shortages imply increased costs to society, although adaptation by water users will mitigate some portion of these costs. \nWater resource users can reduce the negative effects of water shortages through a number of strategies. These include revising water storage and release programs for reservoirs, adopting crops and cropping practices that are robust over a wider spectrum of water availability, expanding and adjusting crop insurance programs (such as the Multi-Peril Crop Insurance program\u0092s Prevented Planting Provision), adjusting water prices to encourage conservation and the expansion of water supply infrastructure, and supporting water transfer opportunities. Damage from drought-induced wildfires can be minimized by using long range soil moisture forecasts to pre-position fire suppression resources and in the longer term, by changing land-use regulations to restrict development in areas facing increased fire risk.\nThe ability to anticipate and efficiently prepare for future water resource management challenges is currently limited, in part, by imprecise regional climate change models and long-term weather forecasts. Uncertainty about future climate conditions makes it more difficult to optimally prepare for and adapt to associated changes in water resource availability and quality. Imagine, for example, trying to prepare optimally for a water shortage when you are uncertain of when it will occur, how severe it will be, or how long it will persist. It may be tempting to make management plans based on the worst-case scenario; however, the opportunity cost of this \u0093safety-first\u0094 approach can be high if the worst-case does not occur. Imperfect information ultimately increases the magnitude of economic losses (or reduce the magnitude of any potential economic gains) attributable to water resource changes. \nImprovements in climate projections and long-term weather forecasts, such as forecasts based on the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO), offer potential for reducing economic losses (or increasing economic gains) associated with climate change. More specifically, improvements in the ability to detect water shortages farther in advance, to more precisely forecast their location, intensity, and duration, and to use such forecasts to inform management strategies would enhance water users\u0092 confidence in regional forecasts, and their ability to efficiently prepare for and adapt to future water resource management challenges.\nFor More Information\nAdams, R.M  and D.

      "Phoenix and Maricopa County on track to count fewer heat deaths for first time in a decade\nMaricopa County's medical examiner isn't quite done counting heat-related deaths for 2024, but the Department of Public Health told The Arizona Republic this week the totals are likely to come in under that for 2023. It would be the first year in a decade when the number has not increased.\nIn 2023, 645 people died from factors related to environmental heat in Arizona's most populous county, with a majority of those cases determined to have been directly caused by heat. That staggering death toll, which drew international attention to metro Phoenix's record-breaking temperatures due to climate change and urban development, was a 52% increase over the previous year, which was a 25% jump compared to the year before that.\nLast year's heat mortality count was also nearly an eightfold increase over the 84 heat-related deaths in 2015.\n\"This is not yet absolute by any means, but about 75% of the cases that are under investigation are what we estimate will likely be confirmed,\" Dr. Nick Staab, a medical epidemiologist and assistant medical director for the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, told The Republic Tuesday. \"With our update today, that would be around 609 cases, which would be less than the 645 from last year.\"\nThe medical examiner's office changed protocols for flagging deaths under investigation as potentially heat-related in 2023 to address process oversights that may have resulted in undercounts for previous years. But \"nothing has changed for counts of confirmed heat-related deaths,\" chief medical examiner Dr. Jeff Johnston told The Republic on Wednesday, adding that \"comparisons of annual counts of heat-related deaths are reliable and should be comparable to other jurisdictions who are medically investigating such deaths.\"\nThe protocol change reflects a growing awareness nationwide of the deadly consequences of worsening extreme heat. In 2017, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a guidance toolkit for disaster-related medical death investigations that included a form and checklist for heat wave disasters. As some of the hottest urban areas in the country, Maricopa and Pima Counties were already ahead of the curve on these efforts at that point, Johnston said.\nThe CDC still \"does not have any real-time surveillance protocols that we are aware of for such investigations,\" he said, but the agency has praised Maricopa County's heat surveillance efforts, which have helped guide practices in other regions dealing with dangerously rising temperatures, including Miami-Dade County, FL; Harris County, TX; King County, WA; the state of Louisiana; and most recently Los Angeles County.\nMore:In Arizona, a generation fears uncertainties in abortion access and climate action\nThe fact that an increased focus on considering environmental temperatures in death investigations may be offset by fewer heat-caused cases this year also suggests that local programs aimed at stemming health impacts to Arizonans from extreme heat might be working. If the 2024 heat death total bends the skyrocketing trend from recent years downward, as Staab expects, even with changes that might result in more deaths being attributed to heat over the past two years than in previous assessments, it will signify a needed shift many years in the making.\n\u201cThere has been some reporting that maybe we were ahead of last year\u2019s numbers and really we think we will end up very close to last year\u2019s numbers, and maybe just under,\" Staab said. \"We\u2019re at a point where we feel like what we\u2019re doing in public health is working because we\u2019ve all seen in the last couple of years this kind of persistent climb upwards. We really want to see that number significantly lower because, as we have always said, we do believe all these deaths are preventable.\"\nPhoenix cites 20% fewer heat-related illness emergency calls in 2024\nThough Phoenix officials also do not yet have a confirmed 2024 heat-related death count, they, too, cited measurable progress this week on addressing the human toll of extreme heat.\n\"When we look at the number of heat-related emergencies that our firefighters are dealing with, we saw a 20% reduction when compared to the same period last year,\" Phoenix's executive assistant fire chief Tim Kreis told reporters at a news briefing Thursday.\nEven with that decrease, firefighters still responded to 1,416 heat-related calls for service between May 1 and October 1, during which time fire and emergency management staff used ice-filled cooling bags to quickly reduce dangerously high body temperatures of patients more than 300 times.\nSo far in 2024, the county medical examiner has determined that 240 people died from heat-related causes within Phoenix city limits, 83% of whom were exposed to dangerous temperatures outdoors. In 2023, a total of 340 people succumbed to heat in Phoenix, with 79% of cases originating in outdoor settings.\nThe slight drop in likely totals for 2024 and shift to outdoor risks highlights both Phoenix's challenges with keeping its large unhoused population safe from extreme heat and its successes in making some headway indoors. Access to cooled spaces for unhoused people and programs to check on indoor residents who may be at risk of heat impacts, like elderly and low-income families who may not have or use air conditioning at home, seem to be helping.\nDave Hondula, who directs Phoenix\u2019s Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, told The Republic last year that he makes many of the calls to check on vulnerable residents signed up with the city's \"Cool Callers\" program during heat waves himself. He attributed this year's incremental gains to improved coordination between members of the county's regional Heat Relief Network. One stat he shared Thursday was that his office had distributed one million water bottles to network partners this summer to facilitate regional cooling hydration.\n\u201cAlthough we had a record number of heat records this summer, I\u2019m very confident there\u2019s been a significant and positive public health impact from this heat relief work,\" Hondula said Thursday. \"Lives were saved and lives were changed.\u201d\u00a0\nMore:In a heat wave, some people wait too long to turn on the AC. Smart data use could help\nMayor Kate Gallego also attributed progress on heat initiatives to collaborative action between Hondula's team and the city's Offices of Homeless Solutions, Public Health, Emergency Management and the Fire Department.\nThis year, these efforts included: expanding a network of more than sixty cooling centers and hydration stations; extending hours at certain respite centers to include overnight access; providing transitional shelter space cooled using solar-generated power; the phased opening of the new \"Phoenix Navigation Center\" homeless shelter that was controversial with nearby residents; and managing the \"Safe Outdoor Space\" campground with basic services.\nIn March, the Phoenix City Council passed an ordinance to shield city-contracted workers from extreme heat, in contrast with delayed action on worker protections by the state and nationwide. Throughout the summer, the city also distributed heat relief supplies and grant funding originating from $1.8 million in federal funds from the American Rescue Plan Act, $500,000 from the state and $1.6 million from the county, Gallego said on Thursday.\nMore:Arizona workers one step closer to extreme heat protections with proposed Biden rules\n'The weather is not working in our favor'\nAmid these indications of progress, speakers at Thursday's city news briefing and at the Maricopa County Department of Public Health underscored that more must be done to address the hundreds of preventable heat deaths that occur locally each year.\n\u201cAcross our state, we have to treat extreme heat as a public health hazard, just like other states and communities have to prepare for harsh weather such as blizzards, hurricanes, and flooding,\u201d Gallego said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we need other levels of government to provide additional resources and support to this cause. Our summers are only growing hotter and more intense, and it\u2019s past due that we treat heat like the emergency it is.\u201d \u00a0\nOne way this must happen, scientists say, is through action to address the warming influences of climate change. Burning fossil fuels for energy releases molecules into the air known as greenhouse gases, the most common of which is carbon dioxide. There, they absorb heat from the sun and alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere, which scientists have consistently concluded leads directly to more chaotic and extreme storms, drought and heat waves.\nThe destruction wrought by the most major of these \"not-so-natural\" disasters has already cost the American economy more than $61 billion in 2024, a figure that doesn't include extreme heat events and may triple after the price tags of supercharged Hurricanes Helene and Milton are confirmed. Grocery bills are also spiking in response to crop losses caused by drought and rising temperatures.\nA climate action progress report recently published by Gallego's team tracks Phoenix's recent efforts to address this root cause. But the global problem is exacerbated by other leaders, like members of the Arizona Legislature who have not engaged with climate-based solutions to heat illness and inflation. The most obvious of those solutions, experts say, is to shift energy use to clean and renewable sources. In the past two years, Arizona's solar, battery storage and electric vehicle industries have leveraged nearly $12 billion in investments and more than 18,000 jobs facilitated by President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act toward this goal, though increases in energy demand threaten overall progress.\nMore:In its first climate plan report card, Phoenix claims some progress, with work still to do\nPolitics could also play a role in how Maricopa County's scientists are able to track and study the environmental causes of local heat-related deaths. Staab of the County's Public Health Department told The Republic that insight into heat health impacts has benefitted from the use of publicly available data from the National Weather Service.\n\u201cWith data sources expanding so much, our (epidemiologists) are looking at National Weather Service data and all sorts of stuff to bring into our analysis and that power communicating it out,\" Staab said.\nThat data source has been targeted by the Project 2025 agenda for a second Donald Trump administration. While Trump has distanced himself from this 900-page plan to dismantle many federal and scientific agencies and environmental protections, its creation by members of his prior administration leads many to believe he would enact many of its suggestions, complicating Arizona's efforts to study and address heat-caused deaths.\n\u201cThere is an obvious benefit to having a public, reliable National Weather Service that is funded collectively by taxpayer dollars,\" David Kieve, president of Environmental Defense Fund Action, told The Republic in August. \"The idea that you\u2019re going to privatize that and it will run better as a private business, that\u2019s not going to work. And it\u2019s not going to work for Arizonans at a time when we\u2019re seeing a rising number of extraordinarily hot days.\"\nMore:Climate was barely mentioned in the debate, but Harris and Trump showed wide differences\nRising average temperatures and increasingly frequent extreme heat waves are, Staab also noted, not the only contributors to deaths coded by the medical examiner as heat-related. Drug use, particularly meth, is a growing problem in Phoenix and can \"shut down the body's heat defense system,\" according to reporting by The Republic this summer.\n\u201cWe continue to see a lot of our heat-related deaths amongst those who are unsheltered and those who are using substances, whether that\u2019s drugs or alcohol,\" Staab said. \"As we move forward in our efforts to reach these individuals, we need to focus on partnering with community-based organizations working with those high-risk communities.\"\nAt Thursday's heat relief briefing, Rachel Milne, director of Phoenix's Office of Homeless Solutions, highlighted efforts the city has made to \"help individuals connect with resources beyond heat relief, like housing or shelter.\" Data from the Heat Relief Network showed that 92% of more than 35,000 visitors to cooling centers during summer 2024 reported they were experiencing homelessness. More than 1,000 of them then received direct onsite assistance from Community Bridges Inc, a partner organization working with Milne.\nRead our climate series:The latest from Joan Meiners at azcentral on climate change\nBut while the progress made in 2024 to reduce preventable heat deaths \u2014 through the smart use of data sources, the application of federal, state and county funding, the body bags of ice, the heat-aware changes to medical examining protocols and more \u2014 is promising and inspiring and likely saved lives, innumerable more water bottles, cooling centers and heat ordinances may be needed if climate change is not brought under control.\n\u201cThe weather is not working in our favor,\u201d Staab said.\nJoan Meiners is the climate news and storytelling reporter at The Arizona Republic and\u00a0azcentral.com.

Over the past 12 months, the increase in the CPI has surpassed the median estimate in 5 months, matched the median estimate in 2 months, and fallen short of the median estimate in 5 months. It is interesting to note that actual CPI number has been below the estimate over the past four months (May 2024 through August 2024). Over the past 5 years (60 months), the increase in the CPI has surpassed the median estimate 52% of the time, matched the median estimate 15% of the time, and fallen short of the median estimate 33% of the time.\nThe median estimate of 2.3% is based on 17 estimates collected by FactSet. These CPI estimates range from a low of 2.20% to a high of 2.40%, for a spread of 20 bps. This spread is smaller than the trailing 12-month average spread between the low and high estimate of 27 bps and smaller than the 5-year (60 month) average spread between the low and high estimate 49 bps.\nThe median estimate (year-over-year, not seasonally adjusted) for the consumer price index excluding food & energy (Core CPI) is 3.2%.\nTomorrow (October 10) the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release the CPI and Core CPI numbers for September.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThis blog post is for informational purposes only.

Residential customers can protect their electricity rate for 2025 by securing a 2 or 3 year electricity contract now.\nElectricity prices in Texas have increased 20% over the last 5 years, according to data from the EIA. Higher prices are driven by increasing population, regulatory changes, weather conditions and aging infrastructure.\nThe best time to shop for electricity rates in Texas is spring and fall. Rates are historically at their lowest in April, May and October. And rates are typically highest in July, August, January and February.\nERCOT forecasts a 2024 peak demand of 86,130MW. As a comparison, ERCOT hit a record peak demand of 85,508MW on August 10, 2023. Peak demand is the highest amount of electricity used in a given time period. ERCOT stands for Electric Reliability Council of Texas, and they are a non-profit organization that manages the state\u2019s electrical grid.\nAs more large-scale solar generation assets come online, you can expect more of our 2024 power to come from renewable resources. One industry source projects that 38% of Texas power will come from wind and solar in 2024.  As a comparison, in 2023 31% of all electricity in Texas was generated from renewable energy. \nTags: 2024, electricity price forecast, electricity rates, electricity trends, energy trends, ERCOT, price forecast, rate forecast, regulatory changes, Texas, texas electricity market, texas market structure\nRebecca Bridges has worked in deregulated energy markets since 2001.

It identifies and explores the biggest trends in energy demand and supply, as well as what they mean for energy security, emissions and economic development.\nThis year\u2019s Outlook comes against a backdrop of escalating risks in the Middle East and heightened geopolitical tensions globally, and explores a range of energy security issues that decision makers face as they proceed with clean energy transitions. With rising investment of clean technologies and rapid growth in electricity demand, the WEO 2024 examines how far the world has come on its journey towards a safer and more sustainable energy system, and what more needs to be done to reach its climate goals.\nReflecting today\u2019s uncertainties, our three main scenarios are complemented with sensitivity cases for renewables, electric mobility, liquefied natural gas and how heatwaves, efficiency policies and the rise of artificial intelligence might affect the outlook for electricity.\nEnglish \nLanguage\n\nEnglish\nPolski\n\nPublished October 2024\nLicence CC BY 4.0 (report); CC BY NC SA 4.0 (Annex A)\nPress release\nLaunch live stream\nShare Cite\nOnline table of contents\n\n###### 1.0 Executive Summary Read online\n###### 2.0 Overview and key findings Read online\n###### 3.0 Context and scenario design Read online\n###### 4.0 Pathways for the energy mix Read online\n###### 5.0 Exploring uncertainties in the Outlook Read online\n###### 6.0 Security, affordability and sustainability Read online\n###### 7.0 Regional insights Read online\n###### 8.0 Regional dashboards Read online\n\nGlobal Energy and Climate Model\nThe Global Energy and Climate (GEC) Model key input dataset includes selected key input data for all three modelled scenarios (STEPS, APS, NZE).

      "First half of 2024: Renewable electricity generation continues to rise significantly  | Umweltbundesamt\nFirst half of 2024: Renewable electricity generation continues to rise significantly \nHeating and transport sectors remain almost unchanged \nCurrent figures from the German Environment Agency (UBA) for the first half of 2024 show that electricity generation from renewable energies increased by nine per cent compared to the same period last year. However, capacity expansion must be further accelerated to meet climate and energy targets. In the heating sector, mild weather led to lower demand for heating. In the mobility sector, the use of renewable electricity in transport increased slightly.\n\"It is a success that the renewable share of electricity continues to grow. At the same time, the growth figures make it clear that considerable efforts are still required. In the photovoltaic sector alone, we need an increase of around 50 per cent in order to meet the targets of the Renewable Energy Sources Act,\u201d says Dirk Messner, President of the German Environment Agency. \u201cPlanning reliability and careful further development of the subsidy mechanisms are important for success. In addition, distribution grid areas in which a particularly large number of renewable energy systems are connected should not be burdened further by rising grid fees.\u201d\nRenewables account for around 57 per cent of gross electricity econsumption\u2060 \u00a0 \nApproximately 147 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity were generated from renewable sources, representing an increase of about nine percent compared to the same period in the previous year (135 TWh). Two factors played a decisive role in this. Firstly, windy winter months and the addition of new plants led to a 10 per cent increase in wind power generation. In addition, the large increase in output in the photovoltaic (PV) sector led to an increase of 13 per cent compared to the same period of the previous year, despite the lack of sunshine. In the hydropower sector, rainy \u2060weather\u2060 led to an increase of 12 per cent. Over the entire first half of 2024, wind power generation accounted for the largest share of renewable electricity generation at around 51 per cent. Photovoltaics followed with 24 per cent, electricity generation from\u2060 biomass with around 15 per cent and hydropower with around 8 per cent of renewable electricity. As demand for electricity in the current year was roughly the same as in the previous year, the share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption rose significantly in the first half of 2024. According to calculations by the Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics (AGEE-Stat), the share was already around 57 per cent. A projection for the entirety of 2024 is not possible at this stage, as renewable electricity generation depends on weather conditions and the development of electricity consumption throughout the rest of the year. The increase in output in the first half of 2024 was once again heavily dominated by the expansion of PV. \u00a0For example, net additions in the first two quarters totalled 7.5 gigawatts (GW), while the addition of onshore wind energy systems only reached 0.9 GW. Around 0.4 GW of net new capacity was added to the installed capacity of offshore wind energy plants in the second quarter. With total installed capacity exceeding 88 GW, the 2024 expansion target for PV of 84 GW, as set by the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), has been achieved six months ahead of schedule. The installed capacity of onshore wind turbines currently stands at just under 62 GW, which means that the target of 69 GW set by the EEG in 2024 is unlikely to be reached\nDecline in renewable heat production \nTotal heat production from renewable sources amounted to 111 TWh in the first half of 2024. Compared to the first half of 2023, the heat provided from renewable sources fell by seven per cent overall. The main reason for this was warmer weather than in the same period of the previous year, which reduced the overall demand for heat. This decline was mitigated by an increase in the number of heat pumps. As a result of this dynamic growth in heat pumps, particularly as a result of installations in the second half of 2023, around 3.5 per cent more heat was generated from near-surface geothermal energy and environmental heat compared to the same period last year.\nHowever according to the latest reports from industry associations, sales of heat pumps have fallen sharply by around 50 per cent compared to the previous year. In order to achieve the German government\u2019s target of 500,000 installed heat pumps per year, this trend needs to be reversed. Three quarters of renewable heat still comes from biomass, around 6 per cent from biogenic waste and around 4 per cent from solar thermal systems.\nSlight increase in the transport sector \nIn the first half of the year, around 21.9 TWh from renewable sources was used in the transport sector. This is an increase of 3 per cent compared to the first half of 2023. Based on current information, the total amount of biofuels used was at the same level as in the first half of the previous year. In contrast, the use of renewable electricity in the transport sector increased by 16 per cent, as not only did the renewable share in the electricity sector grow, but so did the number of electrically powered vehicles. The amount of renewable electricity used in the transport sector corresponds to just under three per cent of the green electricity used in Germany. Around 70 per cent of this is used in rail transport and today around 30 per cent in road transport.\nFurther information: \nThe Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics (AGEE-Stat) analyses the use of renewable energies on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and\u2060 Climate Action\u2060 (BMWK) and continuously compiles reports on the development of renewable energies on the basis of currently available data. In addition to annual publications, AGEE-Stat also regularly publishes monthly and quarterly reports. In the current quarterly report, you will find further graphics on the current development of renewable energies in 2024.

The inflation adjustment factor for calendar-year 2024 is 1.9499. The 2024 reference price for facilities producing electricity from wind is 3.15 cents per kilowatt hour; because this price does not exceed the 8 cents multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor in IRC Section 45(b)(1), the phaseout of the credit under IRC Section 45(b)(1) does not apply for calendar 2024. Reference prices for facilities producing electricity from closed-loop biomass, open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, municipal solid waste, qualified hydropower production, and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy have not been determined for 2024.\nFor facilities placed in service before January 1, 2022, the PTC is:\nFor facilities placed in service on or after January 1, 2022, the PTC for electricity is 0.6 cents per kilowatt hour on the sale of electricity from all eligible technologies (3.0 cents if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met).\nImplications\nThe Inflation Reduction Act made life slightly more complicated as there are now two different PTC rates to track: a rate of 2.9 cents per kilowatt hour for older projects and a rate of 3.0 cents per kilowatt hour for newer projects (assuming the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met allowing for the 5X bonus). While these two numbers may often be the same, taxpayers will need to make sure they are using the right rate for their various projects in 2024.\nFor additional information concerning this Alert, please contact:\nTax Credit Investment Advisory Services\nThe information contained herein is general in nature and is not intended, and should not be construed, as legal, accounting or tax advice or opinion provided by Ernst & Young LLP to the reader.

      "Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of March 2024 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $16.2 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 593 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $11.1 billion has been announced for transportation \u2013 to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports \u2013 and roughly $995 million has been announced for clean water and water infrastructure. Florida received $2.1 billion to connect everyone in the state to reliable high-speed internet and, as of today, more than 1,708,000 Florida households are already saving on their monthly internet bill due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida \u2013 including rural communities and historically underserved populations \u2013 the law makes critical investments that will improve the lives of Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $8.5 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $7.7 billion in highway formula funding and $158 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges to date. o $117.1 million through the RAISE program to date. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $207 million through the INFRA program to date. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet over 272,962 homes and small businesses in Florida do not have access to high-speed internet infrastructure. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to everyone in America. The Biden-Harris Administration worked with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. Now, the Biden-Harris Administration is calling on Congress to extend this program through 2024. Without action from Congress, millions of Americans will lose their internet connection and the economic opportunities that come with it. See ACP enrollment for every state and territory here. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received $2.1 billion for high-speed internet. Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program to provide access to high-speed internet to everyone in Florida. Florida also received $2.8 million in funding to expand middle-mile infrastructure in the state. In addition, about 1,708,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in water infrastructure in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $995 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $995 million available to date to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $229.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation and 19% of transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $1.3 billion to improve public transportation options across the state. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Announced funding to date will double the number of clean transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Schools in Florida have been awarded $45 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. Communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $113.7 million has been announced in Florida to date to build out a network of EV chargers in the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy about $150 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $392.4 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power. This includes: o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; o $162.8 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received approximately $1 billion for airports. Ports and Waterways: Our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received roughly $128.3 million for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $24.9 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $1.5 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience, including $51.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $123 million has been allocated to cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites. Approximately $25 million has been allocated to Florida for capping orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaiming abandoned mine lands.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nSeptember 2024 Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks\n\nNOAA and its partners have released the latest Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks, which recap summer conditions and provide insight into what might be expected this fall.\nSummer Temperature Recap\nThe meteorological summer (June\u2013August) average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 73.8\u00b0F, 2.5\u00b0F above average, which is the fourth-warmest summer in the 130-year record. Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.The Alaska summer temperature was 51.7\u00b0F, 1.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.For the January\u2013August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9\u00b0F, 3.0\u00b0F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January\u2013August period on record.\nThe Alaska January\u2013August temperature was 31.2\u00b0F, 2.4\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June\u2013August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.For summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.The January\u2013August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January\u2013August period.The January\u2013August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month\u2019s consolidation.\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October. Precipitation consolidation guidance has trended wetter across the northern tier of the CONUS, resulting in an expansion of elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the northern High Plains and Great Lakes relative to last month. Above-normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska.\u00a0\n\n\nImpacts and Outlooks for Your Region\nMap of the United States depicting the Seasonal Precipitation Outlook for October\u2013December 2024.\u00a0\nCreating These Quarterly Summaries\u00a0\nNOAA\u2019s Regional Climate Services lead the production of these quarterly summaries of climate impacts and outlooks for various regions of the United States as well as parts of Canada along the border.

      "Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of July 2023 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $10.5 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 359 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $6.9 billion has been announced for transportation \u2013 to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports \u2013 and roughly $800 million has been announced for clean water. As of today, more than 1,389,000 households across the state are receiving affordable high-speed internet due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. To date, Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) to help provide access to high-speed internet across the state. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida \u2013 including rural communities and historically underserved populations \u2013 the law makes critical investments that will improve lives for Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, $5.4 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $5.1 billion in highway formula funding and $105.3 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges in 2022 and 2023. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 o $117.1 million through the RAISE program and $27 million through the INFRA program in 2022 and 2023. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet nearly 22% of Floridians do not have an internet subscription. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to every American. Additionally, experts estimate that as many as 3,283,000 households in Florida are eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which cuts internet bills by up to $30 per month, or $75 for households on Tribal lands, and provides a one-time $100 discount off a connected device. The Biden-Harris Administration is providing further cost savings by working with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. \u25cf Progress to date: To date, Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) to help provide access to high-speed internet across the state. In addition, about 1,389,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program, with more signing up every day. Households can check their eligibility, sign up, and find fully covered internet plans at GetInternet.gov. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, $800 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $800 million available in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $146.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 more likely to commute via public transportation and 20% transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has been allocated $529.4 million to improve public transportation options across the state in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This year alone, funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help double the number of clean public transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, schools in Florida have been awarded $11.8 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. In addition, communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $71.5 million in 2022 and 2023 to build out a network of EV chargers across the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy more than $70 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $168.5 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power in 2022 and 2023. This includes: Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; and o $31.5 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Additional grid funding will be made available in the coming months. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received approximately $658.6 million in 2022 and 2023 for airports. Ports and Waterways: Like airports, our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received roughly $143.6 million in 2022 and 2023 for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $43.2 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $1.4 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience in 2022 and 2023 including $32.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of July 7, 2023 Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, approximately $120.4 million has been allocated to cleaning up brownfield sites in Florida.

Projections indicate that millions, perhaps 1/7 of the population, might face displacement as per the World Bank's estimations,\" Saber H Chowdhury, minister for environment, forest and climate change, was quoted as saying in the report.\nSea level rise is projected to lead to a 6-9 percent decline in the country's rice production. Increasingly saline waters are also projected to disrupt fisheries, which will disproportionately affect poor coastal communities, for whom fish is an important source of protein.\nSaline water can also infiltrate groundwater and surface water sources, affecting drinking water supplies and human health.\n\"Sea level around South Asia will continue to rise over the 21st century, increasing flooding in low-lying Bangladesh. This will devastate vital food crops, forcing more people to leave their homes,\" says professor AKM Saiful Islam, director of the Institute of Water and Flood Management (IWFM) of Buet and a lead author of the report.\nThe accelerating impacts of climate change in Bangladesh highlights an urgent need to scale up international action against climate change.\nBangladesh repeatedly experiences extreme climate events like heatwaves and tropical cyclones, the report adds.\nIn 2019 and 2000, the country experienced 185 extreme weather events, making it the seventh most vulnerable to climate change in the world.\nGovernment adaptation policy and local initiatives have saved many lives and, so far, averted the worst impacts of climate change, the report says.\nBangladesh is recognised as a global leader in adaptation and resilience. In 2005, Bangladesh was one of the first least developed countries to develop a national adaptation programme of action.\nBy the end of the century, even under a very low emissions scenario, Bangladesh could see a further 0.8\u00b0C of warming compared with 1981\u20132010, and heavier rainfall could increase peak river flow by 16 percent relative to 1971\u20132000.\nIn the last few decades, the number of people who have died during cyclones has fallen from six digits (300,000+ from Cyclone Bhola in 1970) to double digits (35 from Cyclone Sitrang in 2022), largely due to the success of the country's Cyclone Preparedness Programme.\nIn the last few decades, the government has invested in saline-tolerant rice varieties, floating agriculture in regions that suffer flooding, and water-saving technologies in drought-prone areas to help safeguard food security in the face of increasingly extreme weather.\nRelated News\n\nGlobal loss and damage initiative launched in Dhaka \n\nA window of opportunity to phase out fossil fuels \n\nSea-level rise in Bangladesh: Faster than global average  \n\nWhat will happen when the 'Doomsday Glacier' disintegrates? \n\nClimate loss and damage are clearly visible in southwest Bangladesh \n\u2018\u09af\u09be\u09b0\u09be \u09ac\u09bf\u09aa\u09cd\u09b2\u09ac\u09c7\u09b0 \u0995\u09a5\u09be \u09ac\u09b2\u099b\u09c7\u09a8, \u09a4\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u0989\u099a\u09bf\u09ce \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be \u09a5\u09c7\u0995\u09c7 \u09ac\u09bf\u09aa\u09cd\u09b2\u09ac\u09c0 \u09a6\u09b2 \u09a4\u09c8\u09b0\u09bf \u0995\u09b0\u09be\u2019\n\u2018\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09bf\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09be\u099a\u09a8 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be \u098f\u09ae\u09a8 \u0995\u09cb\u09a8\u09cb \u09b6\u0999\u09cd\u0995\u09be \u09a8\u09c7\u0987, \u0985\u09a8\u09c7\u0995 \u09ac\u09bf\u09b2\u09ae\u09cd\u09ac\u0993 \u0995\u09b0\u09ac\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be\u2019\n\u0985\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09c0 \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09c7\u09df\u09be\u09a6 \u09b8\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09cb\u099a\u09cd\u099a \u09ea \u09ac\u099b\u09b0 \u09b9\u09a4\u09c7 \u09aa\u09be\u09b0\u09c7 \u09ac\u09be \u09a4\u09be\u09b0\u0993 \u0995\u09ae: \u0986\u09b2\u099c\u09be\u099c\u09bf\u09b0\u09be\u0995\u09c7 \u09a1. \u0987\u0989\u09a8\u09c2\u09b8\n",
      "\nAccessibility links\nFrom bridges and ports to a new regional hub\nBangladesh\u2019s evolving infrastructure\nSouth Asia\u2019s \"Land of Rivers\" has long faced infrastructure challenges, but from tunnels and bridges to a new deep-sea port, engineering is transforming Bangladesh.\nKnown as the \u201cLand of Rivers\u201d, Bangladesh owes its distinctive tasselled coastline to the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, the world\u2019s largest river delta. A vast network of lakes and waterways criss-crosses the country\u2019s flat, low-lying terrain, meaning that most intercity journeys require negotiating one or more rivers. Couple the riverine landscape with risks including earthquakes and climate change, and it\u2019s easy to see how infrastructure bottlenecks have long inhibited Bangladesh\u2019s development.\nBut a new wave of investment is beginning to help overcome these issues. Bangladesh\u2019s longest bridge, the record-breaking Padma Bridge, extends for more than 6km (4 miles) across the turbulent Padma River. A four-lane highway and single-track railway connect 21 districts in southwest Bangladesh with the capital Dhaka, meaning\u00a0cargos of fresh produce that would sometimes rot while\u00a0in long ferry queues can reach their destination faster.\n\nThe nation\u2019s first road tunnel, Bangabandhu Tunnel, runs for more than 3km (2 miles) under the Karnaphuli river, uniting Chattogram port with Anwara opposite, and connecting two major economic corridors \u2013 the Dhaka-Chattogram and Chattogram-Cox\u2019s Bazar highways. It will also strengthen the Asian Highway Network, a road system spanning 32 countries.\nExpanding ports, expanding exports\nPorts are essential to Bangladesh\u2019s trade, but the two riverside seaports it inherited at independence, Chattogram and Mongla, are too shallow and lack the container handling capacity to keep up with the growth of trade and the ever-increasing scale of container ships.\nAs of 2020, Bangladesh\u2019s ports handled about 6,500 billion taka ($60 billion) in exports, with ship arrivals increasing at the rate of 11% per year. A dredging programme means the Payra seaport can now handle ships with a draft of up to 10.5m (35ft), which could be as long as 225m (740ft) and as wide as 30m (100ft). That said, many container ships still have to dock in India or Sri Lanka and collect or unload goods from Bangladesh using lighter vessels. This significantly adds to the cost of doing business, as well as slowing turnaround times due to the shortage of lighters.\n\nScheduled for completion at the end of 2026, the new Matarbari deep-sea port is set to transform Bangladesh\u2019s maritime infrastructure. It will be 18m (60ft) deep, with four container berths, plus room for further expansion.\n\u201cWe expect the port will handle around 10 million tons of cargo annually in the initial phase, increasing to 40 million tons in the long term,\u201d explains project director Mohammed Zafar Alam. \u201cThis will significantly reduce transportation costs and increase trade efficiency for Bangladesh.\u201d\nAlam estimates the port could increase Bangladesh\u2019s GDP by more than 1%, alongside decreasing import costs by 15% and export costs by 10%. For larger container ships, he expects to see 35 to 62 ships visit a year, potentially increasing to as many as 250.\nDeveloping the electric vehicle sector\nElectric vehicles (EVs) face specific reputational challenges in Bangladesh. On the streets of Dhaka, home-made electric rickshaws are a danger to life and limb: bicycle frames and, perhaps most importantly, brakes are not designed to sustain the speeds batteries deliver.\nBut the nation\u2019s improved road and bridge infrastructure is setting the scene for a new wave of EVs, which are more sustainable than the fossil-fuel vehicles that contribute about 15% of Dhaka\u2019s air pollution. The country\u2019s first EV manufacturing plant is under development in Chattogram.\n\u201cWell-maintained roads and bridges reduce travel times, increase accessibility and instil confidence among consumers regarding the reliability of EVs for long-distance travel,\u201d explains Hafizur Rahman Khan, chairman of Bangladesh\u2019s Runner Automobiles Plc. \u201cThis improved infrastructure also addresses concerns regarding range anxiety, a common barrier to EV adoption, by offering a network of routes with convenient charging facilities along the way.\u201d\n\nRunner Automobiles manufactures two- and three-wheeled fossil fuel-powered vehicles but has begun distributing electric two-wheelers and has a joint venture distributing electric cars. \u201cBangladesh's expanding middle-income demographic, experiencing increased affluence, is increasingly inclined towards personal transportation solutions,\u201d Khan notes. \u201cThis growing consumer base seeks convenient and cost-effective mobility options.\u201d\nWith Bangladesh on track to graduate from the UN\u2019s Least Developed Countries list in 2026, new infrastructure is helping open up the country\u2019s domestic and international trade. With 150 bridges opened on a single day in October 2023, it\u2019s possible the \u201cLand of Rivers\u201d could one day become the \u201cLand of Bridges\u201d.\n\nRise of the Bengal Tiger\nBangladesh invites businesses to be a part of its inspiring journey towards a prosperous future. Now, it\u2019s your time to invest in the mission of Smart Bangladesh.\nExplore the BBC\n"

In the North Sea, fish have been comprehensively monitored throughout this period and resulting data provide a unique record of changes in distribution and abundance in response to climate change2,3. We use these data to demonstrate the remarkable power of generalized additive models (GAMs), trained on data earlier in the time series, to reliably predict trends in distribution and abundance in later years. Then, challenging process-based models that predict substantial and ongoing poleward shifts of cold-water species4,5, we find that GAMs coupled with climate projections predict future distributions of demersal (bottom-dwelling) fish species over the next 50 years will be strongly constrained by availability of habitat of suitable depth. This will lead to pronounced changes in community structure, species interactions and commercial fisheries, unless individual acclimation or population-level evolutionary adaptations enable fish to tolerate warmer conditions or move to previously uninhabitable locations.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\n        Receive 12 print issues and online access\n      \n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nShifting fish distributions in warming sub-Arctic oceans\n                                        \n\n\nFuture trends of marine fish biomass distributions from the North Sea to the Barents Sea\n                                        \n\n\nMarine fish traits follow fast-slow continuum across oceans\n                                        \n\nReferences\nSherman, K. & Hempel, G.

INTRODUCTION The dynamics of marine fish populations are typi-cally categorized as regulated primarily by top-down processes (i.e. predation) or by bottom-up processes (i.e. resource production) (Wollrab et al. 2012, Heath et al. 2014, Vinueza et al. 2014). For example, fish population dynamics in the North Sea were long thought to be driven by bottom-up processes (Lynam et al. 2017). In bottom-up regulated systems, the lowest-level driver is formed by abiotic factors (e.g.\ntemperature, salinity, etc.) and their influence on plankton biomass. The available plankton biomass in turn leads to cascades upwards through the food web (Gregory et al. 2009, Kirby & Beaugrand 2009, Olsen et al. 2011). Top-down interactions, represented by predation pressure from predators and fisheries ex -ploitation, have also been shown to have a large impact on the dynamics of several North Sea fish populations (Fauchald et al. 2011, Engelhard et al.\n2014). Furthermore, the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes in the North Sea eco-system can give rise to highly complex and non-linear dynamics in fish populations (Lynam et al.\n\u00a9 The authors 2021.

Smallegange2, Anieke van Leeuwen1 1NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, Department of Coastal Systems, and Utrecht University, 1797 SZ Texel, The Netherlands 2Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, 1012 WX Amsterdam, The Netherlands ABSTRACT: Distinct areas of seabed, called seascapes, are known to shape benthic habitats and communities, yet little is known about the extent to which they affect the dynamics of marine fish populations. We explored the relationship between seascapes and trends in the biomass density of several North Sea fish species. We divided the North Sea into 10 seascapes using standardized methods. Time series of fish biomass density were derived from the North Sea International Bottom-Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) and aggregated to the seascape level. We analysed the inter -dependencies between these time series using a causal association network and found independ-ent biomass density trends between adjacent seascapes at a time interval of 0 yr in all species as -sessed. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density occurred at time lags of 1\u22122 yr across different gradients of exchange: (1) both directions from North to South; (2) unidirectional, North\u2212South; (3) unidirectional, South\u2212North; (4) unidirectional, East\u2212West; and (5) no clear direc-tion. Our findings indicate that the separation in (a)biotic conditions between North Sea seascapes can represent relevant barriers to the processes determining the observed fish biomass density.\nWe found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat preferences best explained short-term causal dependencies. This combination is particular to the flatfish and ray species included in the present study. Contrarily, the movement of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species best explained long-term causal dependencies. Our work highlights how causal association networks can be used to study the temporal dependencies between spatial time series in ecology.\nKEY WORDS: IBTS \u00b7 International Bottom-Trawl Survey \u00b7 PCMCI \u00b7 Seascapes \u00b7 Spatiotemporal analysis \u00b7 Time series \u00b7 Bottom-trawl OPEN PEN ACCESS CCESS Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 2017). To attain a better understanding of the com-plexity emerging from such interactions, it is impor-tant to have a complete overview of the bottom-up and top-down processes acting upon fish populations in the North Sea.\nOne potentially important bottom-up process that is often overlooked in regulating fish populations is seabed morphology. Physically distinct areas of sea -bed, also called seascapes, can act as a bottom-up controlling mechanism by shaping abiotic conditions, leading to the formation of different types of benthic habitat and associated species assemblages (Harris & Baker 2012). Due to the strong link between seabed morphology and community structure of benthic in -vertebrates (Beaman et al. 2005, Kaskela et al. 2017), seascapes are often used as a proxy for mapping marine benthic habitats (Kostylev et al. 2001, Brown & Collier 2008). Yet, we know little about the extent to which seascapes affect the dynamics of fish popu-lations, despite the fact that the few case studies available show it could help explain the spatial dis-tribution of fish resources (Pittman & Brown 2011, Getsiv-Clemons et al. 2012). Recent research revealed that the central and lower part of the North Sea com-prises 8 distinct seascapes excluding the coastal zone (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018), and that these were selectively targeted by commercial fishing vessels.\nAlthough this preferential selection provides some indirect link to the availability and distribution of fish resources, a more complete study exploring the rela-tionship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish is missing. If seascapes are important, this changes the commonly held perspec-tive on the types of bottom-up processes affecting North Sea fish populations.\nTo understand the relationship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish, we in -vestigated the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes. We hypothesized that if seascapes are not related to trends in fish pop-ulations in the North Sea, biomass densities in sepa-rate seascapes will be directly dependent on each other. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the \u2018borders\u2019 between separate seascapes being dif-fuse, i.e. not relevant, to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed. In contrast, if seascapes define distinct abiotic environments that are important for the distribution of fish populations, we expect biomass densities in different seascapes to be unrelated to each other, although they can still be related across longer time lags. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the separation in conditions between seascapes representing relevant barriers to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed.\nTo examine the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes, we used a re cently developed causal association network ap -proach (Runge et al. 2019a). The advantage of this data-driven method is that it learns causal associa-tions at various time lags directly from aggregated sets of time series, rather than establishing causality through computer simulation experiments on correl-ative relationships found in observational data (Runge et al. 2019b). As such, our study also tests a new ap -proach to examine intraspecific dependencies in the biomass trends of North Sea fish.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study area The North Sea is a semi-enclosed shelf extending from 4\u00b0 W and 62\u00b0 N (Fig. 1a) (Daan et al. 2005). In this study, we focussed on the region that includes International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) statistical rectangles 4a, b and c. We excluded the Norwegian trench, the Skagerrak and the waters south of the English Channel, as their distinctiveness is well recognized (Bergstad 1990, ICES 2018). Ex -tending the method of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018), we derived 10 separate seascapes (Fig. 1b). These seascapes were identified based on the weighted sum of 5 bathymetry positioning indices (BPIs), which express the depth of a pixel relative to the depth of its surroundings. The specific weighted-sum BPI used (Eq. 1) highlights large-scale patterns in seabed mor-phology and is strongly linked to benthic communities (Reiss et al. 2010). A full description of the weighted BPI can be found in van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018).\nBPI 75 km + (0.9 \u00d7 BPI 50 km) + (0.8 \u00d7 BPI 30 km) + (0.7 \u00d7 BPI 10 km) + (0.6 \u00d7 BPI 5 km) (1) 2.2. Data preparation We extracted data on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 9 species of fish collected in the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) from 1978 to 2019 (ICES 2019) (Table 1). We chose 1978 as the starting year of the time series as all seascapes were systematically sampled within the NS-IBTS from this year onward. The 9 selected species cov-ered a variety of different life history strategies and 130 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed had sufficient positive catch data available in all sea-scapes across selected years. To minimize bias from potential variability in sampling gear and timing, we only included observations that had been sampled in the same quarter of the year and using the GOV trawl. Next, we determined in which seascape each haul was performed based on the shoot longitude and latitude. We estimated the biomass in kg for a given species for each haul by multiplying the num-ber of individuals of a given length class by their length\u2212weight relationship, as derived from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019), and summing over all length classes present in the haul. We then aggregated the data to a single time series per seascape and species, representing the average biomass in kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121.\nWe refer to this metric as biomass density.\n2.3.

Fish species, records and length to weight conversion used in the study. All length\u2212weight (L\u2212W) relationships were taken directly from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019). Slight differences in the number of filtered (unique) hauls between spe-cies originate from small differences in the raw North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey CPUE-length-per-hour datasets pulled from the ICES/DATRAS online database (ICES 2019) for each species (mean \u00b1 SD:13 667.2 \u00b1 104.9 filtered hauls, range 13 430\u221213 760 filtered hauls) Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 dependencies in fish biomass density between sea-scapes. If seascapes are not related to fish popula-tions in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities between separate seascapes are causally related to each other at the time interval of zero. Contrarily, if seascapes are related to fish populations in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities in separate seascapes are independent of each other at the time interval of zero, although they can be causally dependent across longer time scales.\nWe applied a causal association network approach recently developed by Runge et al. (2019a), to evalu-ate the underlying causal dependency structure be -tween the fish biomass density time series from dif-ferent seascapes (Fig. 2). The linear and non-linear time-lagged dependencies between sets of time series can cause inflated or spurious associations to be included when analysing their interdependence (Pearl 2009). These need to be accounted for in order to arrive at an approximation of the \u2018true\u2019 underlying dependency structure. The causal association net-work utilizes the PCMCI algorithm, as implemented in the package \u2018TIGRAMITE\u2019 in Python (Runge 2019), that arrives at a solution of the underlying depend-ency structure through iterative conditional inde-pendence testing. Internally, the PCMCI algorithm takes 2 processing steps. First, given a set of time se-ries, the PC1 algorithm constructs a graphical model in which all time series and their time-lagged compo-nents form separate nodes. For each of these nodes or time series variables, the PC1 algorithm then identi-fies all relevant conditions or \u2018preliminary parents\u2019 in the set , through iterative con-ditional independence testing. This conditional de-pendence can be interpreted as the relation between time series variables 1 and 2, after accounting for the relations existing between all time series variables within the set. The time series variables with signifi-cant relations to the focal time series after accounting for all relationships in the set form the preliminary parents of that focal time series. This first step reduces dimensionality, i.e. it identifies all relevant connections in the graph for a given time series vari-able and a first estimation of their strength, and will thereby increase the detection power for underlying causal relations. In the second step, the MCI algo-rithm addresses the false positives, i.e. spurious or inflated links found between the time series variables.\nIt does so by repeating the iterative conditional inde-pendence tests, but now conditioning on both the preliminary parents of and the time-shifted parents of (Runge et al. 2019b). Thus the graphi-cal model contains the focal time series variable, its preliminary parents and their preliminary parents.\nThis second step is therefore well suited to identifying spurious or in flated relationships originating from common drivers. Those time series variables with sig-nificant relations to the focal time series variable after this second iterative testing phase are included in the final causal association network. The final causal association network thus represents the algorithm\u2019s approximation of the underlying causal dependency structure existing between the set of time series.\nOur time series covered 42 yr, which is extensive in ecology, but relatively limited in data science. We therefore used the linear partial correlation test, a maximum time lag of 2 yr, and let the PC1 algorithm choose the optimal \u03b1 level for condition selection. As the linear partial correlation test is sensitive to out-liers, we applied a 95% winsorization to the data prior to analysis (Reifman & Keyton 2010). Confi-dence intervals were generated using bootstrapping, and inferences on the conditional dependence be -,..., 1 X X X t j t t N { } \u03b5 \u02c6 P Xt j ( ) Xt j Xt i \u2212\u03c4 132 Fig. 2.

Common drivers and in direct ef-fects can yield spurious associations that are accounted for in our approach. The dots in panel b represent observed biomass density values, the blue line is a fitted trend with 95% confidence bounds indicated in gray shading. Figure adapted from Runge et al. (2019a) Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed tween time series were made using a shuffle test with 3000 trials. We further corrected the results for the total number of pairwise tests performed by ap -plying the false discovery rate procedure of Benja -mini & Hochberg (1995). The final causal association network included those links between time series significant at an \u03b1 level of 0.05. If links occurred between 2 time series at multiple lags, the strongest link was included in the network. Rather than print-ing the full causal association network found for each species, which would result in a cluttered and un -clear overview, we report the results as follows: (1) For each species, we report the number of seascapes with biomass density trends independent of their adjacent seascapes at time lag zero. This provides a link back to our initial hypothesis that the contrasting conditions in seascapes are reflected in contrasting biomass density trends. (2) We produce a species-specific map where relationships at time lag zero are indicated by the borders between adjacent seascapes, and relationships over longer time lags between all seascapes are indicated by arrows.\n2.3.2. Post-hoc test to link life histories to causal relationships We conducted a post-hoc test to better understand the variables driving the observed dependencies in biomass density between seascapes at different time lags. More specifically, we used a random forest clas-sifier (RFC) model to predict the presence of causal relationships between seascapes based on a set of 17 variables pertaining to life history, the biomass den-sity of different life stages and environmental condi-tions (see Table S1 in the Supplement at www. int-res. com/ articles/ suppl/ m677 p129 _ supp .pdf).\n2.3.3. Variable collection We extracted 9 features related to life-history strate-gies from the marine fish trait database of Beukhof et al. (2019). Next, for every year and seascape combi-nation, we calculated the absolute dif ference in bio-mass density of small and large size classes in the juvenile and adult life stages. To do this, we first determined the length at maturation to split the IBTS data between adult and juvenile biomass density.\nNext, for each of these groups, we made an equal split between the 50% largest and 50% smallest individuals in terms of length. We then aggregated the data into a single data frame listing the biomass density of the 4 groups (small juveniles, large juve-niles, small adults, large adults) in each haul. Next, we computed the mean biomass density of each group per haul per year. Finally, we calculated the difference in mean biomass density per haul per year between different seascapes for each group. This dataframe was combined with the life-history trait dataframe to produce the final feature dataset for training. As there was a class imbalance in the label data between the number of samples with and with-out causal lag, we used a cost-sensitive learning ap -proach and weighted the classes according to their representation in the dataset (Weiss et al. 2007).\n2.3.4. Model training and performance We further optimised hyperparameters of the RFC through a grid search on the maximum depth, mini-mum samples per split, minimum samples per leaf and the number of trees. The final RFC model with causal lag zero as the label feature included 300 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits, a minimum 10 samples per leaf and split. The final RFC model with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature consisted of 500 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits and a minimum of 10 samples per leaf and 15 per split.\nBefore training, we split 50% of the data into a vali-dation set, and, during training, we used stratified K-fold cross validation with 5 splits (Refaeilzadeh et al.\n2009). We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values and a confusion matrix, from which we could calculate recall and pre-cision, to evaluate model performance. The model was run twice, once with causal lag zero as the label feature, and once with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature. The model performed well on the validation set in both runs, with an AUC of 98.0 and 98.2%, a recall of 95.2 and 97.1% and precision of 93.0 and 91.6%, respectively. This is further illustrated in the confusion matrixes in Fig. S1.\n2.3.5. Variable importance We calculated the importance of each of the 17 variables in predicting the presence of a causal de - pendency between seascapes at various time lags using the \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 function in the \u2018SHAP\u2019 pack-age (Lundberg et al. 2020). \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 is based on game theory and approximates Shapley values to compute the contribution of a target variable to the predicted output of tree-based machine learning 133 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 models (Shapley 1953, Lundberg & Lee 2017). It does so by re-running model predictions on the test data-set using all different combinations between vari-ables excluding the target variable, and then repeats this process, now including the target variable. The algorithm then computes the contribution of the tar-get variable based on the average difference in pre-dicted outcomes (Molnar 2020).\n3. RESULTS 3.1. Causal associations The final causal association networks of all 9 spe-cies indicated the existence of independent trends in fish biomass between adjacent seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr. The mean number of seascapes with bio-mass density trends that were independent of adja-cent seascapes at a time lag of zero was 4.7 \u00b1 2.4 SD.\nThis level of independence in biomass density trends at a time lag of zero was highest for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua (8 out of 10 seascapes), European plaice Pleuronectes platessa (7 out of 10 seascapes) and Atlantic herring Clupea harengus (7 out of 10 sea -scapes). It was lowest for starry ray Amblyraja radi-ata (1 out of 10 seascapes) and dragonet Callionymus lyra (2 out of 10 seascapes). This result was inter-preted as the separation between seascapes repre-senting relevant barriers to the processes determin-ing the observed biomass density of Atlantic cod, European plaice and Atlantic herring, but not to those of the starry ray and dragonet. In the remaining 4 species, independence in fish biomass density trends be tween adjacent sites at a time lag of zero ranged be tween 3 and 6 out of 10 seascapes. In these cases, only certain seascapes represented relevant borders to the processes determining the ob -served biomass density, whereas the biomass density trends were directly dependent on each other in the re -maining ad jacent seascapes. An addi-tional type of relationship observed was a temporal dependency at a time lag of zero be tween non-adjacent sea-scapes (Table 2).\nSpecies could be further subdivided based on the level of causal depend-encies in biomass density trends be -tween seascapes at longer time lags of 1\u22122 yr, and the directional gradient in these dynamics. Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting Merlangius merlangus and starry ray were characterized by time-lagged causal dependencies be tween distant seascapes in both directions along the North\u2212South gradient (Fig. 3). In grey gurnard Eu trigla gurnardus and At -lantic herring, exchanges were predominantly uni-directional from South to North (Fig. 4a,b). In drag-onet, ex changes occurred from East to West and from North to South (Fig. 4c). Finally, there was only a sin-gle time-lagged ex change in European sprat Sprat-tus sprattus (Fig. 5a), and no time-lagged ex changes in common dab Limanda limanda (Fig. 5b).\n3.2. Post-hoc test The RFC found that species with a non-fusiform body type, that are strictly demersal, with low to inter-mediate fecundity and maximum age, were most im -portant in predicting the presence of a causal relation-ship between seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr (Fig. 6a).\nThis is opposite to those variables best explaining longer-term causal dependencies at time lags of 1\u2212 2 yr (Fig. 6b). In that case, long-lived, benthopelagic species of large maximum size best predict the pres-ence of causal relationships between seascapes. Fur-thermore, the probability of long-term causal depend-encies between seascapes was positively impacted by small differences in juvenile biomass density and negatively impacted by large differences.\n4. DISCUSSION We found evidence for relationships between the spatial organisation of the seabed structure, i.e. sea-scapes, and population trends of several fish species in the North Sea.

This finding provides the insight that seascapes can function as a bottom-up driver of North Sea fish population dynamics. However, a con-siderable level of caution is warranted in interpreting 135 Fig. 3. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes for (a) Atlantic cod, (b) whiting, (c) starry ray and (d) European plaice. In all 4 species, time-lagged exchanges occur predominantly in both directions between more northern and southern seascapes. Arrow colour and width represent the type and strength of the relationship (red = positive, blue = negative, thin = weak, thick = strong) between different areas. The associated time-lag is listed on the arrow, and if a contemporaneous relationship was present, the border between the areas was removed Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 the results, as the relative standard error in estimated biomass density over time frequently exceeded 30% for species and seascape combinations (Table S2).\nWe further found both positive and negative causal dependencies between seascapes at time lags of 1\u22122 yr in most species. Species such as Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting and starry ray dis-played clear directional gradients in these longer-term dependencies along a North\u2212South gradient.\nPositive long-term dependencies can potentially be explained by both movement of adult biomass to, and recruitment of juvenile biomass in, the depend-ent seascapes. Negative long-term dependencies cannot be explained by the process of recruitment.\nHowever, they can still be explained by movement of biomass away from a dependent seascape to sur-136 Fig. 4. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. In (a) grey gurnard and (b) Atlantic herring, a few time-lagged exchanges occur from southern to northern seascapes, whereas in (c) drago -net, exchanges went from northern to southern and eastern to western seascapes. Other details as in Fig. 3 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed rounding areas following accumulation of biomass in the driving seascape. The dependent seascape could in this case be considered suboptimal, and the driv-ing seascape more optimal. This would be the in -verse process of that described by the basin model theory (McCall 1990), in which there is adult move-ment away from optimal basins, or seascapes in this case, to suboptimal surrounding basins following the buildup of biomass in the former (Bertrand et al. 2008, Hintzen et al. 2014).\nOur post-hoc test provided a deeper understanding of the ecological meaning of the observed depend-encies at different time lags. We found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat prefer-ences best explained short-term causal dependencies.\nThis combination is particular to the flatfish and ray included in the present study. This might be due to multiple factors. Flatfish such as European plaice ex -hibit more restricted movement patterns and stronger selection of small-scale variations in sediment type compared to benthopelagic species such as Atlantic cod (Gibson & Robb 2000, Hinz et al. 2006, Griffiths et al. 2018). Therefore, smaller-scale processes than those delineated by the seascapes might be more important in these species at the 0 yr time lag. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density be -tween seascapes were best explained by the adults of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species. In these species, the recruitment of juveniles is unlikely to drive the observed dynamics because differences in juvenile biomass negatively affected the probability of long-term causal dependencies.\nIn this study, we also addressed a missing link be -tween seascape-specific fisheries activities in the North Sea (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018) and the bio-mass of harvested stocks. van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018, their Fig. 3) showed fishing intensity with a beam trawl to target plaice was highest in seascapes 10 and 7, and the northern part of seascape 6, while otter-mix fishing was highest in the centre of seascape 9 and along the northern and southern borders of sea-scape 8. If these fishing activities affect the distribu-tion of fish biomass, we might have expected to see some effect of this in the post-hoc test. An example would be that short-term ex changes in (adult) bio-mass between intensively and less intensively fished adjacent seascapes are important in explaining the observed causal dependencies. However, no specific combination of seascape pairs was found to be im -portant in explaining the ob served dependencies.\nAlthough it might be tentative to place an explicit link between seascape-specific fisheries activities and exchanges in fish biomass, separate quantitative analysis, including North Sea-wide fishing intensity, 137 Fig. 5. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. (a) In European sprat, there is a single time-lagged exchange and (b) in common dab, there is no time-lagged exchange; both species therefore lack a clear gradient of exchange. Other details as in Fig. 3 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 would be required to provide more conclusive evi-dence. The study of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018) was based on Dutch fishing fleet data. Consequently, sea-scapes that are assumed to be free from high fishing pressure, based on Dutch data, might turn out to be intensively used by the fleets of other nations.\nThe methodological novelty of our study lies in the application of a causal association network for hypo -thesis testing using ecological time series. These types of data are typical of long-term monitoring programmes, and causal association networks there-fore have a potentially wide applica-bility in ecology. The advantage of this specific causality-based approach is that it explicitly accounts for in -flated or spurious correlations be -tween time series (Pearl 2009). Using a method that accounts for this con-founding effect differentiates our work from other, recent research examin-ing dependencies between time series of fish populations and the environ-ment. For example, Milligan et al.\n(2020) examined time-lagged depend-encies between resource productiv-ity and abundances in deep-sea fish using additive models in combination with cross-correlation analysis. Addi-tive models are a popular tool in ecol-ogy because they can include the effects of categorical and continuous covariates in fitting statistical trends to population time series (Zuur et al.\n2017, Pedersen et al. 2019). Cross-correlating such fitted statistical trends to extract time-lagged dependencies increases the risk of finding spurious relationships inherent to time series analysis (Yule 1926, Olden & Neff 2001, Runge et al. 2014). Although causal association networks explicitly account for this confounding effect, they are not able to include both cat-egorical and continuous covariates a priori. Additional insights can be gained indirectly through post-hoc testing as was done in the present study. However, this approach does not provide the explanatory power on the effects of environmental covariates that additive modelling provides. Therefore, a decision on which combination of methods to apply in future ecological 138 Fig. 6.

The presence of causal dependencies between seascapes was best explained by different types of life history traits at different time lags. In a qualitative comparison with previous research, we did not find a clear link be -tween seascape-specific fishery activities and bio-mass trends. Finally, the suitability of using causal association networks to model spatial time series in ecology will depend both on the types of effects a researcher wants to include and the need to model time-lagged dependencies.\nAcknowledgements.

INTRODUCTION The dynamics of marine fish populations are typi-cally categorized as regulated primarily by top-down processes (i.e. predation) or by bottom-up processes (i.e. resource production) (Wollrab et al. 2012, Heath et al. 2014, Vinueza et al. 2014). For example, fish population dynamics in the North Sea were long thought to be driven by bottom-up processes (Lynam et al. 2017). In bottom-up regulated systems, the lowest-level driver is formed by abiotic factors (e.g.\ntemperature, salinity, etc.) and their influence on plankton biomass. The available plankton biomass in turn leads to cascades upwards through the food web (Gregory et al. 2009, Kirby & Beaugrand 2009, Olsen et al. 2011). Top-down interactions, represented by predation pressure from predators and fisheries ex -ploitation, have also been shown to have a large impact on the dynamics of several North Sea fish populations (Fauchald et al. 2011, Engelhard et al.\n2014). Furthermore, the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes in the North Sea eco-system can give rise to highly complex and non-linear dynamics in fish populations (Lynam et al.\n\u00a9 The authors 2021.

Smallegange2, Anieke van Leeuwen1 1NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, Department of Coastal Systems, and Utrecht University, 1797 SZ Texel, The Netherlands 2Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics, University of Amsterdam, 1012 WX Amsterdam, The Netherlands ABSTRACT: Distinct areas of seabed, called seascapes, are known to shape benthic habitats and communities, yet little is known about the extent to which they affect the dynamics of marine fish populations. We explored the relationship between seascapes and trends in the biomass density of several North Sea fish species. We divided the North Sea into 10 seascapes using standardized methods. Time series of fish biomass density were derived from the North Sea International Bottom-Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) and aggregated to the seascape level. We analysed the inter -dependencies between these time series using a causal association network and found independ-ent biomass density trends between adjacent seascapes at a time interval of 0 yr in all species as -sessed. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density occurred at time lags of 1\u22122 yr across different gradients of exchange: (1) both directions from North to South; (2) unidirectional, North\u2212South; (3) unidirectional, South\u2212North; (4) unidirectional, East\u2212West; and (5) no clear direc-tion. Our findings indicate that the separation in (a)biotic conditions between North Sea seascapes can represent relevant barriers to the processes determining the observed fish biomass density.\nWe found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat preferences best explained short-term causal dependencies. This combination is particular to the flatfish and ray species included in the present study. Contrarily, the movement of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species best explained long-term causal dependencies. Our work highlights how causal association networks can be used to study the temporal dependencies between spatial time series in ecology.\nKEY WORDS: IBTS \u00b7 International Bottom-Trawl Survey \u00b7 PCMCI \u00b7 Seascapes \u00b7 Spatiotemporal analysis \u00b7 Time series \u00b7 Bottom-trawl OPEN PEN ACCESS CCESS Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 2017). To attain a better understanding of the com-plexity emerging from such interactions, it is impor-tant to have a complete overview of the bottom-up and top-down processes acting upon fish populations in the North Sea.\nOne potentially important bottom-up process that is often overlooked in regulating fish populations is seabed morphology. Physically distinct areas of sea -bed, also called seascapes, can act as a bottom-up controlling mechanism by shaping abiotic conditions, leading to the formation of different types of benthic habitat and associated species assemblages (Harris & Baker 2012). Due to the strong link between seabed morphology and community structure of benthic in -vertebrates (Beaman et al. 2005, Kaskela et al. 2017), seascapes are often used as a proxy for mapping marine benthic habitats (Kostylev et al. 2001, Brown & Collier 2008). Yet, we know little about the extent to which seascapes affect the dynamics of fish popu-lations, despite the fact that the few case studies available show it could help explain the spatial dis-tribution of fish resources (Pittman & Brown 2011, Getsiv-Clemons et al. 2012). Recent research revealed that the central and lower part of the North Sea com-prises 8 distinct seascapes excluding the coastal zone (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018), and that these were selectively targeted by commercial fishing vessels.\nAlthough this preferential selection provides some indirect link to the availability and distribution of fish resources, a more complete study exploring the rela-tionship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish is missing. If seascapes are important, this changes the commonly held perspec-tive on the types of bottom-up processes affecting North Sea fish populations.\nTo understand the relationship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish, we in -vestigated the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes. We hypothesized that if seascapes are not related to trends in fish pop-ulations in the North Sea, biomass densities in sepa-rate seascapes will be directly dependent on each other. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the \u2018borders\u2019 between separate seascapes being dif-fuse, i.e. not relevant, to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed. In contrast, if seascapes define distinct abiotic environments that are important for the distribution of fish populations, we expect biomass densities in different seascapes to be unrelated to each other, although they can still be related across longer time lags. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the separation in conditions between seascapes representing relevant barriers to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed.\nTo examine the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes, we used a re cently developed causal association network ap -proach (Runge et al. 2019a). The advantage of this data-driven method is that it learns causal associa-tions at various time lags directly from aggregated sets of time series, rather than establishing causality through computer simulation experiments on correl-ative relationships found in observational data (Runge et al. 2019b). As such, our study also tests a new ap -proach to examine intraspecific dependencies in the biomass trends of North Sea fish.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study area The North Sea is a semi-enclosed shelf extending from 4\u00b0 W and 62\u00b0 N (Fig. 1a) (Daan et al. 2005). In this study, we focussed on the region that includes International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) statistical rectangles 4a, b and c. We excluded the Norwegian trench, the Skagerrak and the waters south of the English Channel, as their distinctiveness is well recognized (Bergstad 1990, ICES 2018). Ex -tending the method of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018), we derived 10 separate seascapes (Fig. 1b). These seascapes were identified based on the weighted sum of 5 bathymetry positioning indices (BPIs), which express the depth of a pixel relative to the depth of its surroundings. The specific weighted-sum BPI used (Eq. 1) highlights large-scale patterns in seabed mor-phology and is strongly linked to benthic communities (Reiss et al. 2010). A full description of the weighted BPI can be found in van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018).\nBPI 75 km + (0.9 \u00d7 BPI 50 km) + (0.8 \u00d7 BPI 30 km) + (0.7 \u00d7 BPI 10 km) + (0.6 \u00d7 BPI 5 km) (1) 2.2. Data preparation We extracted data on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 9 species of fish collected in the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) from 1978 to 2019 (ICES 2019) (Table 1). We chose 1978 as the starting year of the time series as all seascapes were systematically sampled within the NS-IBTS from this year onward. The 9 selected species cov-ered a variety of different life history strategies and 130 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed had sufficient positive catch data available in all sea-scapes across selected years. To minimize bias from potential variability in sampling gear and timing, we only included observations that had been sampled in the same quarter of the year and using the GOV trawl. Next, we determined in which seascape each haul was performed based on the shoot longitude and latitude. We estimated the biomass in kg for a given species for each haul by multiplying the num-ber of individuals of a given length class by their length\u2212weight relationship, as derived from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019), and summing over all length classes present in the haul. We then aggregated the data to a single time series per seascape and species, representing the average biomass in kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121.\nWe refer to this metric as biomass density.\n2.3.

Fish species, records and length to weight conversion used in the study. All length\u2212weight (L\u2212W) relationships were taken directly from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019). Slight differences in the number of filtered (unique) hauls between spe-cies originate from small differences in the raw North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey CPUE-length-per-hour datasets pulled from the ICES/DATRAS online database (ICES 2019) for each species (mean \u00b1 SD:13 667.2 \u00b1 104.9 filtered hauls, range 13 430\u221213 760 filtered hauls) Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 dependencies in fish biomass density between sea-scapes. If seascapes are not related to fish popula-tions in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities between separate seascapes are causally related to each other at the time interval of zero. Contrarily, if seascapes are related to fish populations in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities in separate seascapes are independent of each other at the time interval of zero, although they can be causally dependent across longer time scales.\nWe applied a causal association network approach recently developed by Runge et al. (2019a), to evalu-ate the underlying causal dependency structure be -tween the fish biomass density time series from dif-ferent seascapes (Fig. 2). The linear and non-linear time-lagged dependencies between sets of time series can cause inflated or spurious associations to be included when analysing their interdependence (Pearl 2009). These need to be accounted for in order to arrive at an approximation of the \u2018true\u2019 underlying dependency structure. The causal association net-work utilizes the PCMCI algorithm, as implemented in the package \u2018TIGRAMITE\u2019 in Python (Runge 2019), that arrives at a solution of the underlying depend-ency structure through iterative conditional inde-pendence testing. Internally, the PCMCI algorithm takes 2 processing steps. First, given a set of time se-ries, the PC1 algorithm constructs a graphical model in which all time series and their time-lagged compo-nents form separate nodes. For each of these nodes or time series variables, the PC1 algorithm then identi-fies all relevant conditions or \u2018preliminary parents\u2019 in the set , through iterative con-ditional independence testing. This conditional de-pendence can be interpreted as the relation between time series variables 1 and 2, after accounting for the relations existing between all time series variables within the set. The time series variables with signifi-cant relations to the focal time series after accounting for all relationships in the set form the preliminary parents of that focal time series. This first step reduces dimensionality, i.e. it identifies all relevant connections in the graph for a given time series vari-able and a first estimation of their strength, and will thereby increase the detection power for underlying causal relations. In the second step, the MCI algo-rithm addresses the false positives, i.e. spurious or inflated links found between the time series variables.\nIt does so by repeating the iterative conditional inde-pendence tests, but now conditioning on both the preliminary parents of and the time-shifted parents of (Runge et al. 2019b). Thus the graphi-cal model contains the focal time series variable, its preliminary parents and their preliminary parents.\nThis second step is therefore well suited to identifying spurious or in flated relationships originating from common drivers. Those time series variables with sig-nificant relations to the focal time series variable after this second iterative testing phase are included in the final causal association network. The final causal association network thus represents the algorithm\u2019s approximation of the underlying causal dependency structure existing between the set of time series.\nOur time series covered 42 yr, which is extensive in ecology, but relatively limited in data science. We therefore used the linear partial correlation test, a maximum time lag of 2 yr, and let the PC1 algorithm choose the optimal \u03b1 level for condition selection. As the linear partial correlation test is sensitive to out-liers, we applied a 95% winsorization to the data prior to analysis (Reifman & Keyton 2010). Confi-dence intervals were generated using bootstrapping, and inferences on the conditional dependence be -,..., 1 X X X t j t t N { } \u03b5 \u02c6 P Xt j ( ) Xt j Xt i \u2212\u03c4 132 Fig. 2.

Common drivers and in direct ef-fects can yield spurious associations that are accounted for in our approach. The dots in panel b represent observed biomass density values, the blue line is a fitted trend with 95% confidence bounds indicated in gray shading. Figure adapted from Runge et al. (2019a) Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed tween time series were made using a shuffle test with 3000 trials. We further corrected the results for the total number of pairwise tests performed by ap -plying the false discovery rate procedure of Benja -mini & Hochberg (1995). The final causal association network included those links between time series significant at an \u03b1 level of 0.05. If links occurred between 2 time series at multiple lags, the strongest link was included in the network. Rather than print-ing the full causal association network found for each species, which would result in a cluttered and un -clear overview, we report the results as follows: (1) For each species, we report the number of seascapes with biomass density trends independent of their adjacent seascapes at time lag zero. This provides a link back to our initial hypothesis that the contrasting conditions in seascapes are reflected in contrasting biomass density trends. (2) We produce a species-specific map where relationships at time lag zero are indicated by the borders between adjacent seascapes, and relationships over longer time lags between all seascapes are indicated by arrows.\n2.3.2. Post-hoc test to link life histories to causal relationships We conducted a post-hoc test to better understand the variables driving the observed dependencies in biomass density between seascapes at different time lags. More specifically, we used a random forest clas-sifier (RFC) model to predict the presence of causal relationships between seascapes based on a set of 17 variables pertaining to life history, the biomass den-sity of different life stages and environmental condi-tions (see Table S1 in the Supplement at www. int-res. com/ articles/ suppl/ m677 p129 _ supp .pdf).\n2.3.3. Variable collection We extracted 9 features related to life-history strate-gies from the marine fish trait database of Beukhof et al. (2019). Next, for every year and seascape combi-nation, we calculated the absolute dif ference in bio-mass density of small and large size classes in the juvenile and adult life stages. To do this, we first determined the length at maturation to split the IBTS data between adult and juvenile biomass density.\nNext, for each of these groups, we made an equal split between the 50% largest and 50% smallest individuals in terms of length. We then aggregated the data into a single data frame listing the biomass density of the 4 groups (small juveniles, large juve-niles, small adults, large adults) in each haul. Next, we computed the mean biomass density of each group per haul per year. Finally, we calculated the difference in mean biomass density per haul per year between different seascapes for each group. This dataframe was combined with the life-history trait dataframe to produce the final feature dataset for training. As there was a class imbalance in the label data between the number of samples with and with-out causal lag, we used a cost-sensitive learning ap -proach and weighted the classes according to their representation in the dataset (Weiss et al. 2007).\n2.3.4. Model training and performance We further optimised hyperparameters of the RFC through a grid search on the maximum depth, mini-mum samples per split, minimum samples per leaf and the number of trees. The final RFC model with causal lag zero as the label feature included 300 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits, a minimum 10 samples per leaf and split. The final RFC model with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature consisted of 500 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits and a minimum of 10 samples per leaf and 15 per split.\nBefore training, we split 50% of the data into a vali-dation set, and, during training, we used stratified K-fold cross validation with 5 splits (Refaeilzadeh et al.\n2009). We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values and a confusion matrix, from which we could calculate recall and pre-cision, to evaluate model performance. The model was run twice, once with causal lag zero as the label feature, and once with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature. The model performed well on the validation set in both runs, with an AUC of 98.0 and 98.2%, a recall of 95.2 and 97.1% and precision of 93.0 and 91.6%, respectively. This is further illustrated in the confusion matrixes in Fig. S1.\n2.3.5. Variable importance We calculated the importance of each of the 17 variables in predicting the presence of a causal de - pendency between seascapes at various time lags using the \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 function in the \u2018SHAP\u2019 pack-age (Lundberg et al. 2020). \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 is based on game theory and approximates Shapley values to compute the contribution of a target variable to the predicted output of tree-based machine learning 133 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 models (Shapley 1953, Lundberg & Lee 2017). It does so by re-running model predictions on the test data-set using all different combinations between vari-ables excluding the target variable, and then repeats this process, now including the target variable. The algorithm then computes the contribution of the tar-get variable based on the average difference in pre-dicted outcomes (Molnar 2020).\n3. RESULTS 3.1. Causal associations The final causal association networks of all 9 spe-cies indicated the existence of independent trends in fish biomass between adjacent seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr. The mean number of seascapes with bio-mass density trends that were independent of adja-cent seascapes at a time lag of zero was 4.7 \u00b1 2.4 SD.\nThis level of independence in biomass density trends at a time lag of zero was highest for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua (8 out of 10 seascapes), European plaice Pleuronectes platessa (7 out of 10 seascapes) and Atlantic herring Clupea harengus (7 out of 10 sea -scapes). It was lowest for starry ray Amblyraja radi-ata (1 out of 10 seascapes) and dragonet Callionymus lyra (2 out of 10 seascapes). This result was inter-preted as the separation between seascapes repre-senting relevant barriers to the processes determin-ing the observed biomass density of Atlantic cod, European plaice and Atlantic herring, but not to those of the starry ray and dragonet. In the remaining 4 species, independence in fish biomass density trends be tween adjacent sites at a time lag of zero ranged be tween 3 and 6 out of 10 seascapes. In these cases, only certain seascapes represented relevant borders to the processes determining the ob -served biomass density, whereas the biomass density trends were directly dependent on each other in the re -maining ad jacent seascapes. An addi-tional type of relationship observed was a temporal dependency at a time lag of zero be tween non-adjacent sea-scapes (Table 2).\nSpecies could be further subdivided based on the level of causal depend-encies in biomass density trends be -tween seascapes at longer time lags of 1\u22122 yr, and the directional gradient in these dynamics. Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting Merlangius merlangus and starry ray were characterized by time-lagged causal dependencies be tween distant seascapes in both directions along the North\u2212South gradient (Fig. 3). In grey gurnard Eu trigla gurnardus and At -lantic herring, exchanges were predominantly uni-directional from South to North (Fig. 4a,b). In drag-onet, ex changes occurred from East to West and from North to South (Fig. 4c). Finally, there was only a sin-gle time-lagged ex change in European sprat Sprat-tus sprattus (Fig. 5a), and no time-lagged ex changes in common dab Limanda limanda (Fig. 5b).\n3.2. Post-hoc test The RFC found that species with a non-fusiform body type, that are strictly demersal, with low to inter-mediate fecundity and maximum age, were most im -portant in predicting the presence of a causal relation-ship between seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr (Fig. 6a).\nThis is opposite to those variables best explaining longer-term causal dependencies at time lags of 1\u2212 2 yr (Fig. 6b). In that case, long-lived, benthopelagic species of large maximum size best predict the pres-ence of causal relationships between seascapes. Fur-thermore, the probability of long-term causal depend-encies between seascapes was positively impacted by small differences in juvenile biomass density and negatively impacted by large differences.\n4. DISCUSSION We found evidence for relationships between the spatial organisation of the seabed structure, i.e. sea-scapes, and population trends of several fish species in the North Sea.

This finding provides the insight that seascapes can function as a bottom-up driver of North Sea fish population dynamics. However, a con-siderable level of caution is warranted in interpreting 135 Fig. 3. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes for (a) Atlantic cod, (b) whiting, (c) starry ray and (d) European plaice. In all 4 species, time-lagged exchanges occur predominantly in both directions between more northern and southern seascapes. Arrow colour and width represent the type and strength of the relationship (red = positive, blue = negative, thin = weak, thick = strong) between different areas. The associated time-lag is listed on the arrow, and if a contemporaneous relationship was present, the border between the areas was removed Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 the results, as the relative standard error in estimated biomass density over time frequently exceeded 30% for species and seascape combinations (Table S2).\nWe further found both positive and negative causal dependencies between seascapes at time lags of 1\u22122 yr in most species. Species such as Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting and starry ray dis-played clear directional gradients in these longer-term dependencies along a North\u2212South gradient.\nPositive long-term dependencies can potentially be explained by both movement of adult biomass to, and recruitment of juvenile biomass in, the depend-ent seascapes. Negative long-term dependencies cannot be explained by the process of recruitment.\nHowever, they can still be explained by movement of biomass away from a dependent seascape to sur-136 Fig. 4. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. In (a) grey gurnard and (b) Atlantic herring, a few time-lagged exchanges occur from southern to northern seascapes, whereas in (c) drago -net, exchanges went from northern to southern and eastern to western seascapes. Other details as in Fig. 3 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed rounding areas following accumulation of biomass in the driving seascape. The dependent seascape could in this case be considered suboptimal, and the driv-ing seascape more optimal. This would be the in -verse process of that described by the basin model theory (McCall 1990), in which there is adult move-ment away from optimal basins, or seascapes in this case, to suboptimal surrounding basins following the buildup of biomass in the former (Bertrand et al. 2008, Hintzen et al. 2014).\nOur post-hoc test provided a deeper understanding of the ecological meaning of the observed depend-encies at different time lags. We found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat prefer-ences best explained short-term causal dependencies.\nThis combination is particular to the flatfish and ray included in the present study. This might be due to multiple factors. Flatfish such as European plaice ex -hibit more restricted movement patterns and stronger selection of small-scale variations in sediment type compared to benthopelagic species such as Atlantic cod (Gibson & Robb 2000, Hinz et al. 2006, Griffiths et al. 2018). Therefore, smaller-scale processes than those delineated by the seascapes might be more important in these species at the 0 yr time lag. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density be -tween seascapes were best explained by the adults of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species. In these species, the recruitment of juveniles is unlikely to drive the observed dynamics because differences in juvenile biomass negatively affected the probability of long-term causal dependencies.\nIn this study, we also addressed a missing link be -tween seascape-specific fisheries activities in the North Sea (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018) and the bio-mass of harvested stocks. van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018, their Fig. 3) showed fishing intensity with a beam trawl to target plaice was highest in seascapes 10 and 7, and the northern part of seascape 6, while otter-mix fishing was highest in the centre of seascape 9 and along the northern and southern borders of sea-scape 8. If these fishing activities affect the distribu-tion of fish biomass, we might have expected to see some effect of this in the post-hoc test. An example would be that short-term ex changes in (adult) bio-mass between intensively and less intensively fished adjacent seascapes are important in explaining the observed causal dependencies. However, no specific combination of seascape pairs was found to be im -portant in explaining the ob served dependencies.\nAlthough it might be tentative to place an explicit link between seascape-specific fisheries activities and exchanges in fish biomass, separate quantitative analysis, including North Sea-wide fishing intensity, 137 Fig. 5. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. (a) In European sprat, there is a single time-lagged exchange and (b) in common dab, there is no time-lagged exchange; both species therefore lack a clear gradient of exchange. Other details as in Fig. 3 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 would be required to provide more conclusive evi-dence. The study of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018) was based on Dutch fishing fleet data. Consequently, sea-scapes that are assumed to be free from high fishing pressure, based on Dutch data, might turn out to be intensively used by the fleets of other nations.\nThe methodological novelty of our study lies in the application of a causal association network for hypo -thesis testing using ecological time series. These types of data are typical of long-term monitoring programmes, and causal association networks there-fore have a potentially wide applica-bility in ecology. The advantage of this specific causality-based approach is that it explicitly accounts for in -flated or spurious correlations be -tween time series (Pearl 2009). Using a method that accounts for this con-founding effect differentiates our work from other, recent research examin-ing dependencies between time series of fish populations and the environ-ment. For example, Milligan et al.\n(2020) examined time-lagged depend-encies between resource productiv-ity and abundances in deep-sea fish using additive models in combination with cross-correlation analysis. Addi-tive models are a popular tool in ecol-ogy because they can include the effects of categorical and continuous covariates in fitting statistical trends to population time series (Zuur et al.\n2017, Pedersen et al. 2019). Cross-correlating such fitted statistical trends to extract time-lagged dependencies increases the risk of finding spurious relationships inherent to time series analysis (Yule 1926, Olden & Neff 2001, Runge et al. 2014). Although causal association networks explicitly account for this confounding effect, they are not able to include both cat-egorical and continuous covariates a priori. Additional insights can be gained indirectly through post-hoc testing as was done in the present study. However, this approach does not provide the explanatory power on the effects of environmental covariates that additive modelling provides. Therefore, a decision on which combination of methods to apply in future ecological 138 Fig. 6.

The presence of causal dependencies between seascapes was best explained by different types of life history traits at different time lags. In a qualitative comparison with previous research, we did not find a clear link be -tween seascape-specific fishery activities and bio-mass trends. Finally, the suitability of using causal association networks to model spatial time series in ecology will depend both on the types of effects a researcher wants to include and the need to model time-lagged dependencies.\nAcknowledgements.

It can help identify the causes and effects of changes in the budget over time, as well as the opportunities and challenges for improvement. Budget trend analysis is important for several reasons, such as:\n1. It can help monitor and evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of budget allocation and spending. By analyzing the trends of revenues and expenditures, one can assess whether the budget is aligned with the strategic goals and objectives of the organization or project, and whether the resources are used optimally and appropriately.\n2. It can help forecast and plan for future budget needs and adjustments. By analyzing the trends of external and internal factors that affect the budget, such as inflation, market demand, customer behavior, competitor actions, regulatory changes, etc., one can anticipate the potential impacts and risks on the budget, and prepare contingency plans or corrective actions accordingly.\n3. It can help communicate and justify the budget decisions and results to stakeholders. By analyzing the trends of key performance indicators (KPIs) and benchmarks, such as return on investment (ROI), cost-benefit analysis (CBA), variance analysis, etc., one can demonstrate the value and impact of the budget, and explain the reasons and rationale behind the budget choices and outcomes.\nFor example, suppose a company wants to analyze its budget trend for the past three years and project its budget for the next year. It can use the following steps:\n- Collect and organize the historical and projected data of the budget, such as revenues, expenses, profits, etc., for each year, quarter, month, or other period of interest.\n- Calculate and compare the percentage changes, growth rates, averages, ratios, and other metrics of the budget data, and identify the patterns and variations of the budget over time.\n- analyze the causes and effects of the budget changes, and evaluate the performance and progress of the budget against the planned or expected targets and standards.\n- identify the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats, and challenges and solutions of the budget, and formulate recommendations and action plans for improvement.\n- Present and report the budget trend analysis results and findings, using charts, graphs, tables, and other visual aids, and highlight the key insights and implications for the budget decision-making and management.\n2. How to collect and prepare historical and projected data for budget trend analysis?\nOne of the most important steps in budget trend analysis is to collect and prepare the data that will be used to identify and explain the budget patterns and changes over time. The data sources and methods for this task may vary depending on the scope, purpose, and context of the analysis. However, some general principles and best practices can be followed to ensure the quality and reliability of the data. In this section, we will discuss how to select, obtain, and process historical and projected data for budget trend analysis. We will also provide some examples of data sources and methods that can be used for different types of budget analysis.\nThe following are some of the main aspects to consider when collecting and preparing data for budget trend analysis:\n1. Data selection: The first step is to determine what kind of data is needed for the analysis. This depends on the level of detail, the time period, and the budget categories that are of interest. For example, if the analysis aims to compare the budget allocations of different departments or programs, then the data should include the breakdown of the budget by these categories. If the analysis focuses on the changes in the budget over time, then the data should cover a sufficiently long time period to capture the trends and fluctuations. Some possible data sources for budget data are:\n- Official budget documents: These are the official records of the budget approved by the government or the legislature. They usually provide the most comprehensive and authoritative information on the budget, but they may not be easily accessible or updated.\n- Budget databases: These are online platforms that store and display budget data in a user-friendly format. They may offer more flexibility and functionality than budget documents, such as allowing users to download, filter, and visualize the data. However, they may not have the same level of detail or accuracy as budget documents.\n- Budget reports: These are publications that analyze and summarize the budget data and provide additional information and insights. They may be produced by the government, civil society organizations, or research institutions. They can be useful for understanding the context and rationale behind the budget decisions, but they may not have the same level of objectivity or completeness as budget documents or databases.\n2. Data acquisition: The next step is to obtain the data from the selected sources. This may involve different methods depending on the availability and format of the data. For example, if the data is available online, then it can be downloaded or scraped from the website. If the data is in a PDF or an image file, then it may need to be converted or extracted using optical character recognition (OCR) or other tools. If the data is not available online, then it may need to be requested from the data provider or obtained from other sources. Some possible methods for data acquisition are:\n- Downloading: This is the simplest and fastest method for obtaining data that is available online in a downloadable format, such as Excel, CSV, or JSON. It involves saving the data file to the local computer or a cloud storage service.\n- Scraping: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but not in a downloadable format, such as HTML, XML, or JavaScript. It involves writing a script or using a tool that can extract the data from the web page and save it in a structured format.\n- Converting: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but in a non-machine-readable format, such as PDF or image. It involves using a tool that can convert the data into a machine-readable format, such as Excel, CSV, or JSON.\n- Extracting: This is a method for obtaining data that is available online but in a partially machine-readable format, such as PDF or image with tables or charts. It involves using a tool that can extract the data from the tables or charts and save it in a structured format.\n- Requesting: This is a method for obtaining data that is not available online or in a machine-readable format, such as paper documents or proprietary formats. It involves contacting the data provider and requesting the data in a suitable format.\n- Obtaining: This is a method for obtaining data that is not available from the original source or in a suitable format, such as unofficial or alternative sources. It involves finding and accessing the data from other sources, such as third-party websites, media reports, or personal contacts.\n3. Data processing: The final step is to prepare the data for the analysis. This may involve different tasks depending on the quality and consistency of the data. For example, if the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated, then it may need to be verified, corrected, or updated. If the data is inconsistent, incompatible, or incomparable, then it may need to be harmonized, standardized, or normalized. If the data is too complex, large, or noisy, then it may need to be simplified, aggregated, or filtered. Some possible tasks for data processing are:\n- Verifying: This is a task for ensuring the validity and reliability of the data. It involves checking the data for errors, inconsistencies, or anomalies, and comparing the data with other sources or references.\n- Correcting: This is a task for improving the accuracy and completeness of the data. It involves fixing the errors, inconsistencies, or anomalies in the data, and filling the gaps or missing values in the data.\n- Updating: This is a task for enhancing the timeliness and relevance of the data. It involves adding the latest or most recent data to the existing data, and removing the outdated or obsolete data from the existing data.\n- Harmonizing: This is a task for ensuring the compatibility and comparability of the data. It involves aligning the data with a common definition, classification, or format, and resolving the differences or discrepancies in the data.\n- Standardizing: This is a task for ensuring the consistency and uniformity of the data. It involves applying a common rule, method, or procedure to the data, and converting the data into a common unit, scale, or measure.\n- Normalizing: This is a task for ensuring the fairness and equity of the data. It involves adjusting the data for the effects of external factors, such as inflation, population, or geography, and expressing the data in relative terms, such as percentages, ratios, or indexes.\n- Simplifying: This is a task for reducing the complexity and size of the data. It involves summarizing the data with descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, range, or standard deviation, and grouping the data into categories, clusters, or segments.\n- Aggregating: This is a task for increasing the level of detail and granularity of the data. It involves combining the data from multiple sources, dimensions, or variables, and calculating the total, average, or other aggregate functions for the data.\n- Filtering: This is a task for removing the noise and irrelevance from the data. It involves selecting the data that meets certain criteria, conditions, or thresholds, and excluding the data that does not meet them.\nBy following these steps, the data can be collected and prepared for budget trend analysis. The data sources and methods may vary depending on the specific needs and objectives of the analysis, but the general principles and best practices can be applied to any type of budget data. The quality and reliability of the data can have a significant impact on the results and conclusions of the analysis, so it is important to ensure that the data is valid, accurate, complete, consistent, compatible, comparable, fair, and relevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to collect and prepare historical and projected data for budget trend analysis - Budget trend analysis: How to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes\n3. How to define and measure the key aspects of your budget performance and goals?\nBudget performance\nPerformance Against Goals\nOne of the most important steps in budget trend analysis is to identify the budget categories and indicators that will help you track and evaluate your budget performance and goals. Budget categories are the broad groups of expenses or revenues that you want to analyze, such as personnel, supplies, utilities, sales, grants, etc. Budget indicators are the specific metrics or ratios that you want to measure, such as spending per employee, revenue growth rate, profit margin, etc. By defining and measuring these key aspects of your budget, you can gain insights into your budget patterns and changes over time, and compare them with your targets or benchmarks. In this section, we will discuss how to choose the appropriate budget categories and indicators for your budget trend analysis, and how to use them effectively. Here are some tips and examples to guide you:\n1. Choose budget categories that are relevant and meaningful for your organization or project. Depending on the size, scope, and nature of your budget, you may have different levels of budget categories, such as major, minor, or sub-categories. For example, a large corporation may have major categories such as operating expenses, capital expenditures, and income taxes, and minor categories such as marketing, research and development, and interest payments. A small nonprofit organization may have major categories such as program expenses, administrative expenses, and fundraising expenses, and minor categories such as salaries, travel, and rent. You should choose budget categories that reflect the main sources and uses of your funds, and that align with your strategic goals and objectives.\n2. Choose budget indicators that are relevant and measurable for your budget categories. Budget indicators are the numerical values that you use to assess your budget performance and goals. They can be absolute numbers, such as total revenue or total expenses, or relative numbers, such as percentages, ratios, or averages. You should choose budget indicators that are meaningful and informative for your budget categories, and that can be easily calculated and compared over time. For example, if you want to analyze your personnel expenses, you may use indicators such as headcount, payroll, benefits, turnover rate, or productivity. If you want to analyze your sales revenue, you may use indicators such as sales volume, sales price, market share, or customer satisfaction.\n3. Use a combination of budget indicators to get a comprehensive and balanced view of your budget performance and goals. Budget indicators can be classified into different types, such as input, output, outcome, efficiency, or effectiveness indicators. Input indicators measure the resources or inputs that you use for your budget, such as money, time, or staff. Output indicators measure the products or services that you produce or deliver with your budget, such as units, customers, or events. Outcome indicators measure the results or impacts that you achieve or influence with your budget, such as quality, satisfaction, or change. Efficiency indicators measure how well you use your inputs to produce outputs, such as cost per unit, time per customer, or staff per event. Effectiveness indicators measure how well you achieve your outcomes with your outputs, such as quality per unit, satisfaction per customer, or change per event. You should use a mix of these types of indicators to capture the different dimensions of your budget performance and goals, and to avoid focusing on only one aspect. For example, if you want to analyze your program expenses, you may use input indicators such as budget allocation, output indicators such as number of beneficiaries, outcome indicators such as impact evaluation, efficiency indicators such as cost per beneficiary, and effectiveness indicators such as impact per beneficiary.\n4. How to use projected data to create and compare different budget scenarios and outcomes?\nscenario analysis is a powerful tool that allows organizations to assess the potential impact of different budget scenarios and make informed decisions. By utilizing historical and projected data, businesses can gain valuable insights into their budget patterns and changes. In this section, we will explore the process of conducting scenario analysis and its significance in budget trend analysis.\n1. Understanding Scenario Analysis:\nScenario analysis involves creating multiple hypothetical scenarios based on different assumptions and variables. These scenarios help organizations evaluate the potential outcomes and risks associated with each scenario. By considering various factors such as market conditions, economic trends, and internal factors, businesses can gain a comprehensive understanding of their budget's performance.\n2. Creating Budget Scenarios:\nTo begin the scenario analysis, organizations need to identify the key variables that impact their budget. These variables can include factors like revenue growth, cost fluctuations, market demand, and regulatory changes. By adjusting these variables within different scenarios, businesses can simulate various budget scenarios and assess their potential impact.\n3. Comparing Budget Scenarios:\nOnce the budget scenarios are created, organizations can compare them to understand the differences in outcomes. This comparison helps in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each scenario and enables decision-makers to make informed choices. By analyzing the variations in revenue, expenses, profitability, and cash flow, businesses can evaluate the financial implications of each scenario.\n4. Assessing Risks and Opportunities:\nScenario analysis also allows organizations to assess the risks and opportunities associated with each budget scenario. By considering different market conditions and external factors, businesses can identify potential risks that may impact their budget performance. Additionally, scenario analysis helps in identifying opportunities for growth and optimization within the budget.\n5. Using Examples to Highlight Ideas:\nTo provide a better understanding, let's consider an example. Imagine a retail company planning its budget for the upcoming year. They create two scenarios: Scenario A assumes a moderate increase in sales due to market growth, while Scenario B considers a decline in sales due to increased competition. By comparing these scenarios, the company can assess the potential impact on revenue, expenses, and profitability. This analysis helps them make strategic decisions to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities.\nScenario analysis using projected data is a valuable technique for budget trend analysis. By creating and comparing different budget scenarios, organizations can gain insights into their budget patterns, assess risks and opportunities, and make informed decisions. It empowers businesses to adapt to changing market conditions and optimize their financial performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use projected data to create and compare different budget scenarios and outcomes - Budget trend analysis: How to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes\n5. How to summarize your main findings and insights from your budget trend analysis?\nIn this blog, we have discussed how to use historical and projected data to analyze your budget patterns and changes. We have seen how to collect, organize, and visualize your budget data using various tools and techniques. We have also learned how to identify and explain the trends, patterns, and outliers in your budget data, and how to use them to make informed decisions and projections. In this final section, we will summarize our main findings and insights from our budget trend analysis, and provide some tips and best practices for conducting your own budget trend analysis.\nHere are some of the key points to remember when summarizing your budget trend analysis:\n- Use a clear and concise summary statement. A summary statement is a sentence or two that captures the main message or takeaway of your budget trend analysis. It should answer the question: What did you learn from your budget trend analysis? For example, you could say: \"Our budget trend analysis revealed that our income has increased steadily over the past five years, while our expenses have fluctuated significantly due to seasonal and unexpected factors. We also found that our savings rate has improved over time, but we still need to work on reducing our debt and increasing our emergency fund.\"\n- Highlight the most important and relevant findings and insights. After stating your summary statement, you should elaborate on the most important and relevant findings and insights that support your summary statement. You should focus on the findings and insights that are most relevant to your budget goals, objectives, and questions. You should also explain how your findings and insights can help you improve your budget performance and planning. For example, you could say: \"Some of the key findings and insights from our budget trend analysis are:\n1. Our income has increased steadily over the past five years, mainly due to our career advancement and salary raises. This shows that we have been successful in growing our income and achieving our career goals. However, we also noticed that our income growth rate has slowed down in the last year, which could indicate a potential plateau or decline in our income in the future. Therefore, we should consider diversifying our income sources and exploring new opportunities for income growth.\n2. Our expenses have fluctuated significantly over the past five years, due to seasonal and unexpected factors. We observed that our expenses tend to spike in the months of December and January, due to the holiday season and the winter heating costs. We also noticed that our expenses have increased in the last two years, due to some major life events, such as buying a new car, renovating our house, and having a baby. These factors have impacted our budget balance and our ability to save and invest. Therefore, we should review our spending habits and prioritize our needs and wants. We should also create a realistic and flexible budget that can accommodate our changing needs and circumstances.\n3. Our savings rate has improved over time, but we still need to work on reducing our debt and increasing our emergency fund. We found that our savings rate has increased from 10% to 15% of our income over the past five years, which is above the average savings rate of 8.8% in the US. This shows that we have been disciplined and consistent in saving and investing our money. However, we also found that our debt-to-income ratio has increased from 25% to 35% over the same period, which is above the recommended ratio of 20% or less. This means that we are spending more than we can afford on debt payments, which can affect our credit score and our financial security. Therefore, we should pay off our high-interest debt as soon as possible and avoid taking on new debt. We should also increase our emergency fund to cover at least six months of our living expenses, in case of any unforeseen events or emergencies.\"\n- Use visual aids to support your summary. Visual aids, such as charts, graphs, tables, and diagrams, can help you present your budget data and findings in a clear and engaging way. They can also help you highlight the trends, patterns, and outliers in your budget data, and compare and contrast your budget performance and projections. You should use visual aids that are appropriate for your budget data and analysis, and that can convey your message effectively. For example, you could use a line chart to show the changes in your income and expenses over time, a pie chart to show the distribution of your expenses by category, or a bar chart to show the comparison of your budget performance and projections by month or year. You should also label your visual aids properly and provide a brief explanation or interpretation of what they show. For example, you could say: \"The following line chart shows the changes in our income and expenses over the past five years. As you can see, our income has increased steadily, while our expenses have fluctuated significantly. The gap between our income and expenses represents our budget surplus or deficit, which indicates our budget balance and our ability to save and invest.\"\n```markdown\n![Line chart of income and expenses over time](line_chart.\n6. How to cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your budget trend analysis?\nData and Information\nOne of the most important aspects of writing a budget trend analysis is to properly cite and acknowledge the sources of data and information used in your analysis.

In recent years, sea surface temperature (SST) has been increasing due to global warming, which is expected to result in stronger winds and more intense rainfall associated with typhoons. According to the announcement of the Japan Meteorological Agency, SSTs in the seas surrounding Japan during August 2023 were significantly higher than usual. Record highs were observed in both the northern and southern Sea of Japan (reference \u00e2\u0080\u009cSea Surface Temperature Rise and El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o Event\u00e2\u0080\u009d).In 2023, Japan experienced a lower number of typhoons compared to a typical year and only one typhoon, Typhoon No. 7, made landfall (Japan Meteorological Agency, Summary of Typhoon 2023). However, after making landfall near the Kii Peninsula and Akashi City in mid-August, Typhoon No. 7 brought record rainfall mainly to the Kinki and Chugoku regions. Figure 1 is a Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) animation of the temporal changes in surface precipitation from 9:00 JST on August 8, 2023 to 14:00 JST on August 14, 2023. GSMaP calculates the global precipitation distribution using data from the GPM Core Observatory and data from a constellation of satellites (satellites from countries and organizations participating in the GPM project), including AMSR2 onboard the Global Change Observation Mission \u2013 Water \u00e2\u0080\u009cSHIZUKU\u00e2\u0080\u009d (GCOM-W). The animation shows that heavy rain is falling over a wide area, mainly in the Kinki region, due to Typhoon No. 7. In addition, because of heavy rainfall accompanied by line-shaped precipitation systems, a heavy rain emergency warning was issued for Tottori Prefecture. We wish to extend our deepest sympathy to all those who have suffered hardship from the damage of the typhoon.\nIn order to better understand these phenomena, JAXA is integrating satellite and other Earth observation data with numerical simulations and is conducting research and development in collaboration with external organizations to maximize the best of both. This report introduces the analysis results of the effects of high SSTs in the Sea of Japan on Typhoon No. 7 in 2023, using data from two systems developed as part of this effort: NICAM-LETKF JAXA Research Analysis (NEXRA) (developed in collaboration with the University of Tokyo and RIKEN) and JAXA-RIKEN Ocean Analysis (LORA) (developed in collaboration with RIKEN).\nNEXRA daily forecast results: Track and intensity of Typhoon No. 7\nTyphoon No. 7, internationally named LAN, formed over Japan\u2019s southern ocean near Minamitori Island (23.9\u00cb\u009aN, 149.4\u00cb\u009aE) on August 8, 2023. The black line in Figure 2 shows the track of Typhoon No. 7 as reported by the Japan Meteorological Agency. After its formation, the typhoon moved westward with increasing strength and became a very strong typhoon on August 10. The typhoon gradually moved northward and made landfall near Shiomisaki, Wakayama Prefecture, at just before 5:00 a.m. on the 15th (JST) and made landfall again near Akashi City, Hyogo Prefecture, at around 1:00 p.m. on the same day (JST). After crossing the Sea of Japan on the 15th, it retained its typhoon structure and became an extratropical cyclone west of Hokkaido on the 17th.\nNEXRA conducts atmospheric forecast simulations every six hours, up to five days in advance using NICAM (numerical weather forecast models) on a 14 km horizontal mesh, based on highly accurate initial values generated from numerical simulations and satellite observation data such as GSMaP. The typhoon track forecasted by NEXRA is shown as a colored line overlaying the actual typhoon track (black line) in Figure 2. Simulations with an earlier forecast start time of around August 10 (blue and green lines) forecast the typhoon\u2019s track to move towards the Kanto region, unlike what actually occurred. On the other hand, the simulation with a later forecast start time around August 13 (red line) reproduces the actual typhoon track well. It is thought that the overhang of the Pacific high forecasted by NEXRA was weaker than the actual one in the simulation at the earlier forecast start time, and the track of the typhoon was more northerly. For studies of typhoon tracks, see previous NEXRA reports and research papers using NEXRA (Nakano et al., 2023).\nSea Surface Temperatures (SST) around Japan as seen by various products\nJAXA provides SST data from the Global Change Observation Mission \u2013 Water \u00e2\u0080\u009cSHIZUKU\u00e2\u0080\u009d (GCOM-W) and the Himawari satellite to monitor the ocean environment. However, satellite observations can only detect conditions at the ocean surface, and data cannot be obtained in cloudy areas or areas of heavy rainfall. Therefore, by combining these satellite and in-situ observation data with 3D numerical ocean simulations, we have begun to produce and provide high-accuracy 3D ocean analysis products, including undersea area, such as the JAXA-RIKEN Ocean Analysis (LORA) and the JAXA/JAMSTEC Ocean Weather Forecast (JCOPE-TDA). Top left panel of Figure 3 shows the observed SST and its deviation from normal on August 13, before the typhoon made landfall, based on NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) OISST (Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature) data. According to the OISST data set, SSTs in the Sea of Japan and off the northeast coast of Japan are up to 5 degrees above normal, a condition that can be described as an ocean heat wave. However, when compared with other SST data shown in the top middle and bottom rows of Figure 3, the trends do not necessarily coincide. This suggests that each product has its own uncertainty due to various factors such as differences in observing instruments/methods, SST estimation methods, and interpolation methods. In fact, there is a maximum difference of about 2 degrees between OISST and each product.JAXA-RIKEN Ocean Analysis (hereafter referred to as LORA) is characterized by the use of an ensemble data assimilation method that can estimate the uncertainty in this data set itself. Here, \u00e2\u0080\u009censemble\u00e2\u0080\u009d refers to a collection of data that are independent of each other, but have slight differences (similar to parallel worlds). LORA has 128 ensembles (each called an ensemble member), and the uncertainty of the data set itself can be estimated by looking at the size of their variation (ensemble spread) (Figure 3, top right). For example, in regions with high variability, such as off the southeastern coast of Hokkaido, there is a 1 degree difference in SSTs among the members of the LORA dataset, indicating significant uncertainty. In the Sea of Japan, which was about 5 degrees higher than normal, the variation was less than 1 degree, and it can be concluded that it seems certain that higher-than-normal SSTs were distributed in the Japan Sea.\nImpact of SST in the Japan Sea examined by NEXRA\nTyphoons derive their energy from the ocean, so they tend to intensify as the SST increases. As mentioned above, on August 13, SSTs in the Sea of Japan and off the Tohoku coast were up to 5 degrees above normal, resulting in an ocean heat wave. To investigate the impact of this ocean heat wave on typhoon, we have specially simulated two patterns of atmospheric forecasting using NEXRA: one with high SSTs in the Japan Sea as observed, and the other with normal. By comparing these results and seeing the differences in forecasted typhoon characteristics, we can examine how high SSTs affect typhoon. As a result, it is evident that high SSTs in the Sea of Japan have an impact on typhoon intensity and water vapor transportation, leading to increased precipitation, particularly on the Sea of Japan side (Figure 4).For more information on these results, see the article \u00e2\u0080\u009cEffect of significantly higher-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the Sea of Japan for Typhoon No. 7\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nConclusion\nThis article examines the impact of SST on typhoon using NEXRA and LORA as an example of research that combines satellite observations and numerical simulations. Through such research, it is possible to obtain four-dimensional information about the Earth that cannot be obtained by satellite alone, taking advantage of the features of satellite observation.NEXRA plans to improve the data by increasing the horizontal spatial resolution and assimilating new observations from future satellites, such as EarthCARE. Integrating new advanced satellite observation information into simulation models can lead to more precise estimation of atmospheric conditions. This is expected to improve the understanding and accuracy of weather phenomena forecasting, such as typhoons. Keep an eye on the future progress of NEXRA, LORA, and other research and development projects that integrate satellite observations and numerical simulations.\nThis report was jointly prepared by Dr. Shuhei Matsugishi (project researcher), Prof. Masaki Satoh, Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, the University of Tokyo, Dr. Shun Ohishi (researcher), RIKEN, and members of the Earth Observation Research Center (EORC).\nRelated Sites\n\nLatest Observation\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nDisaster\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMeteorology and the Environment\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nResearch and Development\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nApplications\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n#Earthquake\n#Land\n#Satellite Data\n#Aerosol\n#Public Health\n#GCOM-C\n#Sea\n#Atmosphere\n#Ice\n#Today's Earth\n#Flood\n#Water Cycle\n#AW3D\n#G-Portal\n#EarthCARE\n#Volcano\n#Agriculture\n#Himawari\n#GHG\n#GPM\n#GOSAT\n#Simulation\n#GCOM-W\n#Drought\n#Fire\n#Forest\n#Cooperation\n#Precipitation\n#Typhoon\n#DPR\n#NEXRA\n#ALOS\n#GSMaP\n#Climate Change\n#Carbon Cycle\n#API\n#Humanities Sociology\n#AMSR\n#Land Use Land Cover\n#Environmental issues\n#Quick Report\nRelated Tags\n\nResearch and Development\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Articles\nStay Connected\nPAGE TOP\n\n\u00a9 2003 Japan Aerospace Exploration\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAgency\n\n",

Ocean heat waves are phenomena in which ocean temperatures increase rapidly over a period of several days to several years. The frequency of their occurrence has increased significantly over the past 100 years, and may have been a factor in the expansion of the red tide along the Pacific coast of Hokkaido in September 2021.

Ocean heat waves are phenomena in which ocean temperatures increase rapidly over a period of several days to several years. The frequency of their occurrence has increased significantly over the past 100 years, and may have been a factor in the expansion of the red tide along the Pacific coast of Hokkaido in September 2021.

It influences climate and weather around the world and is home to millions of different forms of life.1 Thriving marine ecosystems provide Americans with food, medicines, jobs, and recreation. The ocean also connects people to nature and is critical to some Native cultures.\nCoral bleaching. Coral reefs are home to many sea creatures. When water is too warm or too cold, coral becomes damaged in a process called bleaching. If bleaching goes on for too long, it can kill the coral.39\nDead Zones. Harmful algal blooms (HABs), sometimes called red tides, have been linked to increasing temperatures in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Some species of HABs can produce excessive amounts of biomass that can prevent light from getting below the ocean surface. As these organisms die and decompose, oxygen levels go down, making it harder for other organisms to survive. Other species of HABs can produce toxins that are hazardous to marine life and humans.\nThreats to subsistence fishing. Salmon and other types of fish are an essential part of subsistence fishing in Alaska. Climate change is making it difficult for Indigenous people to practice fishing traditions.\nWildlife impacts. A 2014 marine heatwave caused the death of many sea lions.35 The warm water caused the fish that the sea lions eat to move elsewhere. As a result, thousands of sea lion pups starved.\nDecreases in commercial fishing harvests. America\u2019s East Coast is projected to see a 20% to 30% decrease in fish harvests by 2060.36 Climate change will drive fish further north as waters heat up.\nIncreasing emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels are causing changes in the ocean (see box). These changes can alter which species of marine life thrive best in certain areas. For example, many fish have shifted their typical range as water temperatures rise.2 However, other species are expected to decline in number or leave areas that are no longer favorable for them.3 These shifts can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems and on fishing communities.4\nMany climate change impacts will only be avoided by reducing carbon dioxide emissions.5 Climate-driven changes in the ocean are motivating people to find solutions to the new challenges. For example, new forecast tools are helping predict changes in ocean conditions that can help the fishing industry adapt. Many organizations are working together to protect coral reefs, which face hazards such as bleaching, infectious diseases, smothering from sediment, collapses in fish stocks, and other issues. Such strategies can help preserve and protect marine resources. Even with these efforts, however, it will take decades or longer for the ocean to recover.\nExplore the sections on this page to learn more about climate impacts on the ocean and marine resources:\nClimate Change Impacts on the Ocean\nHuman-caused carbon dioxide emissions are affecting the ocean in three main ways:\nTop Climate Impacts on the Ocean and Marine Resources\nClimate change affects the ocean in many ways. Three key impacts are described in this section.\n1. Changes in Ocean Ecosystems\nClimate changes to the physical and chemical makeup of the ocean have significant impacts on marine ecosystems. For example, water temperature influences which species can live in an area. Acidification affects many animals\u2019 ability to make shells or skeletons, while low oxygen levels can contribute to hypoxia, or dead zones. Warm temperatures can exacerbate the effects of both acidification and hypoxia.6\nImpacts on one species can ripple across an entire ecosystem. For example, plankton\u2014tiny organisms at the bottoms of many marine food chains\u2014are sensitive to water temperatures and oxygen concentrations. They can die off if the water gets too warm. Animals farther up the food chain, like whales, can suffer food shortages when this happens.\nClimate changes to the marine environment will come in many forms. For instance, the diversity of some temperate ecosystems is expected to increase.7 But overall, climate change is projected to disrupt marine ecosystems in ways that reduce the services they provide and their diversity of life.8\n2. More Common and Severe Extreme Marine Events\nRising water temperatures, acidification, and low oxygen levels can combine with natural ocean cycles to create extreme marine events. Marine heat waves, dead zones, and coral bleaching are just a few examples of these events, which are projected to become more common and severe.10 Extreme events can harm marine ecosystems and communities connected to these systems. For example, a large heat wave off the West Coast in 2014 shut down crab fisheries and starved baby sea lions.11\n3. Impacts on Marine Fisheries\nCommercial and recreational marine fisheries in some regions are at high risk from climate-driven changes in the size and distribution of fish populations.12 Some fish species have already altered their geographic range in response to climate change. For example, pollock and cod are moving north to colder water as local ocean temperatures rise.13\nThe movement of fish into new areas disrupts the ecosystems that they move into. It can also cause confusion about what fishing regulations apply.14 Changes in where fish live may also mean boats have to travel further from ports, potentially increasing costs.15\nClimate change is also affecting the timing of seasonal events, which can affect fisheries. For example, some species, such as striped bass, are spawning earlier in the year.16 This means that catches can peak earlier than normal. Fisheries will need to adapt to such changes or risk reduced catches and lost revenues, which can also increase prices for consumers.17\nChanges in the locations and number of fish species in the ocean can present new opportunities in some cases. For example, scientists predict that some areas, such as the Bering Sea, will see more kinds of fish as warming waters drive populations north.18 This could lead to new fishing opportunities and economic growth in that region.\nFor more specific examples of climate change impacts in your region, please see the National Climate Assessment.\nThe Marine Environment and the Economy\nMany U.S. industries depend on the ocean. The marine economy generated over $665 billion in sales in 2019, with tourism and recreation, including recreational fishing, making up more than one-third of that total.20 The marine economy also generated $397 billion in gross domestic product (GDP), which was 1.9% of the national GDP.21\nCommercial fisheries are an important contributor to the economy. In 2019, they produced 9.3 billion pounds of seafood valued at $5.5 billion.22 Other businesses, such as grocery stores, tackle shops, and restaurants, also benefit from fishery-related products and services.\nAs of 2019, almost 2.4 million Americans had jobs related to the ocean in fields including fisheries, construction, tourism, real estate, food service, and transportation.23 The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are both key trade channels for importing and exporting goods.24 The United States also extracts oil, gas, sand, and gravel from the ocean.\nThe ocean also provides many benefits that are harder to measure in economic terms. These are called ecosystem services. Carbon storage, water filtration, and shoreline protection are just a few of the many ecosystem services that the ocean provides.\nEnvironmental Justice and Equity\nHealthy oceans provide Americans with food and employment and are important to cultural traditions. Climate change leaves communities that depend on the ocean vulnerable to hardship. Many fishing communities already experience high rates of poverty.25 Unstable fish populations and market pricing can hurt fishing communities\u2019 earnings.26 This is especially true if a community depends on a single species for their livelihoods.\nOcean health is a cornerstone of many Indigenous cultures. Native American, Pacific Islander, and Alaska Native communities often practice subsistence fishing.27,28 Fluctuating fish populations can lead to food insecurity for rural Alaskan villages, where many people depend on locally caught fish for a large portion of their diet.29 For example, populations of Chinook and chum salmon hit record lows in 2021, leading to the closure of subsistence salmon fishing for much of the year.30 The number of shellfish, another important part of subsistence diets, has also been declining due to ocean acidification.31\nClimate change also affects Indigenous people culturally. Gathering and preparing food provide social, spiritual, and economic benefits for Indigenous communities.32,33 Disruptions to subsistence practices have negative health outcomes such as anxiety disorders and feelings of isolation.34\nWhat We Can Do\nWe can help reduce the impact of climate change on the marine environment in many ways, including the following:\nSee additional actions you can take, as well as steps that companies can take, on EPA\u2019s What You Can Do About Climate Change page.\nRelated Resources\nRelated Climate Indicators\nLearn more about some of the key indicators of climate change related to this sector from EPA\u2019s Climate Change Indicators in the United States:\nEndnotes\n1\u00a0National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

      "How to Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity: Key Methods for Accurate Bed Utilization\nTo calculate hospital bed capacity, use the formula: (Inpatient Days of Care / Bed Days Available) x 100. This formula determines the occupancy rate, providing valuable insights into bed utilization. The occupancy rate is normally calculated for specific periods such as a month or a year.\nSecond, the bed occupancy rate (BOR) method assesses the ratio of occupied beds to available beds, expressed as a percentage. To calculate BOR, divide the number of occupied beds by the total number of beds and multiply by 100. This method effectively highlights the efficiency of bed usage within a hospital.\nThird, the turnover interval (TI) method, which measures the time between a bed becoming vacant and being filled by the next patient, helps in understanding bed availability and throughput. A shorter turnover interval indicates higher efficiency.\nFourth, the bed manager\u2019s tool (BMT) involves real-time tracking software that updates bed status and predicts future occupancy trends. This dynamic approach allows for better resource allocation and immediate response to capacity issues.\nAccurately assessing hospital bed capacity ensures optimal resource use and improved patient care.\nIn the next section, we\u2019ll explore the impact of accurate bed utilization on hospital operations and patient outcomes. Understanding these effects can guide strategic decisions in health care management.\nWhat You Will Learn?\nWhat is Hospital Bed Capacity and Why Does It Matter?\nHospital bed capacity refers to the total number of beds available for patient care within a healthcare facility. This term encompasses both general and specialized beds, including those for intensive care and other critical needs.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospital capacity is a key component in assessing healthcare system functionality and responsiveness. The WHO emphasizes the need for adequate hospital bed capacity to ensure quality patient care.\nHospital bed capacity includes several aspects, such as the physical space, staff availability, and the types of services offered. It directly affects patient wait times, treatment outcomes, and the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also notes that bed capacity is crucial for managing public health emergencies and planning healthcare resources effectively. They define it as an essential metric for healthcare quality and operational management.\nSeveral factors influence hospital bed capacity. These factors include population demographics, disease prevalence, public health initiatives, and hospital financing. Resource allocation and administrative strategies also play significant roles.\nIn the United States, as of 2022, there were approximately 920,000 hospital beds available, according to the American Hospital Association. Projections suggest that this number may not meet increasing healthcare demands in the coming years due to an aging population.\nLimited hospital bed capacity can lead to overcrowding, longer wait times, and compromised patient care. These issues can impact patient satisfaction, recovery times, and healthcare system resilience during crises.\nThe implications extend beyond health, affecting economic stability and social equity. Delays in care can lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates, straining both families and healthcare systems.\nExamples include the COVID-19 pandemic, where hospitals faced significant bed shortages, resulting in adverse health outcomes and increased strain on healthcare workers.\nTo address bed capacity issues, the WHO recommends developing flexible healthcare models and increasing investment in hospital infrastructure. Strengthening primary care can also alleviate pressure on hospitals.\nTechnologies such as telemedicine and predictive analytics can help optimize bed management. These strategies improve patient flow and promote more efficient resource utilization across healthcare systems.\nWhat Key Factors Should Be Considered When Calculating Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity involves considering several key factors that influence patient placement and care efficiency.\nThe main factors to consider when calculating hospital bed capacity include:\nPatient Demographics: Patient demographics refer to the characteristics of the population served by the hospital. This includes age, gender, and health conditions. Hospitals must assess the age distribution, as geriatric patients often require longer stays. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) indicates that older patients tend to have more complex health needs, which can impact bed utilization.\nHospital Type and Specialty: Hospital type and specialty involve the nature of services provided. General hospitals have different bed needs compared to specialized facilities like pediatric or oncology hospitals. Specialized hospitals may experience fluctuating admission patterns based on regional disease prevalence. For example, a pediatric hospital must accommodate fluctuating demand during flu season.\nBed Occupancy Rates: Bed occupancy rates measure the percentage of occupied beds at a given time. High occupancy rates can indicate a need for additional beds. According to the American Hospital Association (AHA), maintaining an occupancy rate between 85% and 90% is ideal for operational efficiency. Rates above or below this range can signal potential issues in resource allocation.\nAverage Length of Stay: Average length of stay (ALOS) represents the typical duration a patient spends in the hospital. A high ALOS can reduce bed availability and increase demand for capacity. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that ALOS varies by country and health care system, influencing capacity calculations.\nSeasonal Fluctuations: Seasonal fluctuations in patient admissions occur due to various factors, such as flu seasons or public health emergencies. Hospitals must anticipate these changes to optimize bed use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented increased hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses during winter months, affecting capacity planning.\nStaffing Levels: Staffing levels influence bed capacity since sufficient healthcare workers are necessary for proper patient care. Staffing shortages can lead to restricted bed availability, particularly in critical care units. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospitals with adequate staffing ratios can provide better care and manage capacity effectively.\nLocal Health Care Regulations: Local health care regulations can impact bed capacity and hospital operations. Regulations may dictate minimum staffing levels, licensing requirements, or limits on bed expansion. An understanding of local laws is essential for accurate capacity calculations. The Joint Commission outlines regulations that must be followed to maintain operational compliance and patient safety.\nBy considering these factors, hospitals can more accurately calculate their bed capacity and ensure they meet the needs of their communities effectively.\nWhich Types of Beds Are Included in Hospital Bed Capacity Calculations?\nHospital bed capacity calculations typically include several types of beds. The main types are as follows:1. Acute Care Beds2. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds3. Rehabilitation Beds4. Long-Term Care Beds5. Observation Beds\nAcute Care Beds: Acute care beds are essential for patients who require immediate medical treatment. These beds accommodate individuals with severe health conditions or those recovering from surgeries. According to the American Hospital Association, acute care represents the majority of inpatient services, highlighting the importance of these beds in a hospital\u2019s capacity. An example is a post-operative patient who stays overnight for monitoring.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients. These beds feature advanced medical equipment and constant monitoring. The ratio of ICU beds varies worldwide, with a study in Europe showing an average of 6.5 ICU beds per 100,000 population. For example, a patient with severe respiratory failure may require an ICU bed for specialized care.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients.

Understanding each type helps optimize resource allocation in healthcare facilities.\nHow Do Patient Admissions Impact Hospital Bed Capacity?\nPatient admissions significantly affect hospital bed capacity by determining how many patients a hospital can accommodate at any given time. Increased admissions can lead to bed shortages, impacting care delivery efficiency.\nThe relationship between patient admissions and hospital bed capacity can be understood through several key points:\nPatient Flow: High admission rates increase the turnover of beds. For example, according to a study by Lemaire et al. (2020), hospitals with improved patient flow can reduce average length of stay and turnover time, enhancing bed availability.\nBed Occupancy Rates: When admissions exceed discharges, bed occupancy rates rise. Research from the American Hospital Association found that optimal occupancy should be around 85% to allow for new admissions while avoiding overcrowding (AHA, 2018). Rates above this can lead to delays in care and may force hospitals to divert patients to other facilities.\nSeasonal Variations: Certain seasons, such as winter, see increased respiratory illnesses leading to higher admission rates. A study from the Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019) indicated a 20% spike in admissions during flu season, stressing bed capacity further.\nCrisis Situations: Events like pandemics or natural disasters drastically inflate admission numbers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that hospitals reached critical capacity levels, as shown in data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020).\nElective Procedures: Scheduling and rescheduling of elective surgeries also directly impact bed availability. A report by the National Institute of Health highlighted that postponing elective surgeries can improve bed capacity for acute admissions (NIH, 2021).\nDischarge Planning: Effective discharge planning can minimize bed delays. According to healthcare guidelines from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, timely and organized discharge processes can lower the average length of stay, facilitating quicker admissions.\nOverall, effective management of patient admissions is essential for maintaining hospital bed capacity and ensuring that patient care remains optimal.\nWhat Methods Can Be Used to Accurately Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity accurately involves using several methods that assess various aspects of bed utilization, patient flow, and facility design.\nThe main methods for calculating hospital bed capacity are as follows:\nBed Occupancy Rate (BOR):\nThe Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) is a measure that indicates the percentage of total hospital beds occupied over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the number of occupied beds by the total number of available beds and multiplying by 100. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an optimal occupancy rate is generally between 85-90%. Higher rates may indicate overcrowding, while lower rates may signal underutilization. A case study from a study by B. C. R. Chan (2020) showed that maintaining an occupancy rate above 90% in acute care hospitals can lead to increased hospital-associated infections and lower patient satisfaction.\nPatient Days Method:\nPatient Days Method:\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed. This method requires keeping detailed records of patient admissions and discharges. The American Hospital Association indicates that an average hospital bed should ideally accommodate 2.5 patient days per bed each day. For example, if a hospital has 100 beds and is operating at the recommended rate, it should aim for 250 patient days daily. This method helps in understanding bed utilization trends over time.\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed.

This term encompasses both general and specialized beds, including those for intensive care and other critical needs.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospital capacity is a key component in assessing healthcare system functionality and responsiveness. The WHO emphasizes the need for adequate hospital bed capacity to ensure quality patient care.\nHospital bed capacity includes several aspects, such as the physical space, staff availability, and the types of services offered. It directly affects patient wait times, treatment outcomes, and the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also notes that bed capacity is crucial for managing public health emergencies and planning healthcare resources effectively. They define it as an essential metric for healthcare quality and operational management.\nSeveral factors influence hospital bed capacity. These factors include population demographics, disease prevalence, public health initiatives, and hospital financing. Resource allocation and administrative strategies also play significant roles.\nIn the United States, as of 2022, there were approximately 920,000 hospital beds available, according to the American Hospital Association. Projections suggest that this number may not meet increasing healthcare demands in the coming years due to an aging population.\nLimited hospital bed capacity can lead to overcrowding, longer wait times, and compromised patient care. These issues can impact patient satisfaction, recovery times, and healthcare system resilience during crises.\nThe implications extend beyond health, affecting economic stability and social equity. Delays in care can lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates, straining both families and healthcare systems.\nExamples include the COVID-19 pandemic, where hospitals faced significant bed shortages, resulting in adverse health outcomes and increased strain on healthcare workers.\nTo address bed capacity issues, the WHO recommends developing flexible healthcare models and increasing investment in hospital infrastructure. Strengthening primary care can also alleviate pressure on hospitals.\nTechnologies such as telemedicine and predictive analytics can help optimize bed management. These strategies improve patient flow and promote more efficient resource utilization across healthcare systems.\nWhat Key Factors Should Be Considered When Calculating Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity involves considering several key factors that influence patient placement and care efficiency.\nThe main factors to consider when calculating hospital bed capacity include:\nPatient Demographics: Patient demographics refer to the characteristics of the population served by the hospital. This includes age, gender, and health conditions. Hospitals must assess the age distribution, as geriatric patients often require longer stays. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) indicates that older patients tend to have more complex health needs, which can impact bed utilization.\nHospital Type and Specialty: Hospital type and specialty involve the nature of services provided. General hospitals have different bed needs compared to specialized facilities like pediatric or oncology hospitals. Specialized hospitals may experience fluctuating admission patterns based on regional disease prevalence. For example, a pediatric hospital must accommodate fluctuating demand during flu season.\nBed Occupancy Rates: Bed occupancy rates measure the percentage of occupied beds at a given time. High occupancy rates can indicate a need for additional beds. According to the American Hospital Association (AHA), maintaining an occupancy rate between 85% and 90% is ideal for operational efficiency. Rates above or below this range can signal potential issues in resource allocation.\nAverage Length of Stay: Average length of stay (ALOS) represents the typical duration a patient spends in the hospital. A high ALOS can reduce bed availability and increase demand for capacity. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that ALOS varies by country and health care system, influencing capacity calculations.\nSeasonal Fluctuations: Seasonal fluctuations in patient admissions occur due to various factors, such as flu seasons or public health emergencies. Hospitals must anticipate these changes to optimize bed use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented increased hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses during winter months, affecting capacity planning.\nStaffing Levels: Staffing levels influence bed capacity since sufficient healthcare workers are necessary for proper patient care. Staffing shortages can lead to restricted bed availability, particularly in critical care units. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospitals with adequate staffing ratios can provide better care and manage capacity effectively.\nLocal Health Care Regulations: Local health care regulations can impact bed capacity and hospital operations. Regulations may dictate minimum staffing levels, licensing requirements, or limits on bed expansion. An understanding of local laws is essential for accurate capacity calculations. The Joint Commission outlines regulations that must be followed to maintain operational compliance and patient safety.\nBy considering these factors, hospitals can more accurately calculate their bed capacity and ensure they meet the needs of their communities effectively.\nWhich Types of Beds Are Included in Hospital Bed Capacity Calculations?\nHospital bed capacity calculations typically include several types of beds. The main types are as follows:1. Acute Care Beds2. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds3. Rehabilitation Beds4. Long-Term Care Beds5. Observation Beds\nAcute Care Beds: Acute care beds are essential for patients who require immediate medical treatment. These beds accommodate individuals with severe health conditions or those recovering from surgeries. According to the American Hospital Association, acute care represents the majority of inpatient services, highlighting the importance of these beds in a hospital\u2019s capacity. An example is a post-operative patient who stays overnight for monitoring.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients. These beds feature advanced medical equipment and constant monitoring. The ratio of ICU beds varies worldwide, with a study in Europe showing an average of 6.5 ICU beds per 100,000 population. For example, a patient with severe respiratory failure may require an ICU bed for specialized care.\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Beds: Intensive care unit beds are reserved for critically ill patients.

Understanding each type helps optimize resource allocation in healthcare facilities.\nHow Do Patient Admissions Impact Hospital Bed Capacity?\nPatient admissions significantly affect hospital bed capacity by determining how many patients a hospital can accommodate at any given time. Increased admissions can lead to bed shortages, impacting care delivery efficiency.\nThe relationship between patient admissions and hospital bed capacity can be understood through several key points:\nPatient Flow: High admission rates increase the turnover of beds. For example, according to a study by Lemaire et al. (2020), hospitals with improved patient flow can reduce average length of stay and turnover time, enhancing bed availability.\nBed Occupancy Rates: When admissions exceed discharges, bed occupancy rates rise. Research from the American Hospital Association found that optimal occupancy should be around 85% to allow for new admissions while avoiding overcrowding (AHA, 2018). Rates above this can lead to delays in care and may force hospitals to divert patients to other facilities.\nSeasonal Variations: Certain seasons, such as winter, see increased respiratory illnesses leading to higher admission rates. A study from the Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019) indicated a 20% spike in admissions during flu season, stressing bed capacity further.\nCrisis Situations: Events like pandemics or natural disasters drastically inflate admission numbers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that hospitals reached critical capacity levels, as shown in data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020).\nElective Procedures: Scheduling and rescheduling of elective surgeries also directly impact bed availability. A report by the National Institute of Health highlighted that postponing elective surgeries can improve bed capacity for acute admissions (NIH, 2021).\nDischarge Planning: Effective discharge planning can minimize bed delays. According to healthcare guidelines from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, timely and organized discharge processes can lower the average length of stay, facilitating quicker admissions.\nOverall, effective management of patient admissions is essential for maintaining hospital bed capacity and ensuring that patient care remains optimal.\nWhat Methods Can Be Used to Accurately Calculate Hospital Bed Capacity?\nCalculating hospital bed capacity accurately involves using several methods that assess various aspects of bed utilization, patient flow, and facility design.\nThe main methods for calculating hospital bed capacity are as follows:\nBed Occupancy Rate (BOR):\nThe Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) is a measure that indicates the percentage of total hospital beds occupied over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the number of occupied beds by the total number of available beds and multiplying by 100. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an optimal occupancy rate is generally between 85-90%. Higher rates may indicate overcrowding, while lower rates may signal underutilization. A case study from a study by B. C. R. Chan (2020) showed that maintaining an occupancy rate above 90% in acute care hospitals can lead to increased hospital-associated infections and lower patient satisfaction.\nPatient Days Method:\nPatient Days Method:\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed. This method requires keeping detailed records of patient admissions and discharges. The American Hospital Association indicates that an average hospital bed should ideally accommodate 2.5 patient days per bed each day. For example, if a hospital has 100 beds and is operating at the recommended rate, it should aim for 250 patient days daily. This method helps in understanding bed utilization trends over time.\nThe Patient Days Method defines hospital bed capacity based on the total number of patient days\u2014each day a patient occupies a bed.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

      "\n\t\t\tCalifornia\u2019s intensive care nightmare: Which hospitals are full?\t\t\nShare this:\nIn summary\nIn the worst-hit counties, some hospitals are sending critically ill patients to other counties. Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired. We\u2019re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,\u201d said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county\u2019s two hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It\u2019s going to be exhausting, stretching.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\u00a0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\u00a0\n\u201cThat person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,\u201d Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\u00a0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. \u201cNumber one, she\u2019s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there\u2019s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it\u2019s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.\u201d\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\u00a0\n\u201cOur hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cWhen you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that\u2019s 500 to 1000 people that are out.\u201d\u00a0\nSome are out because they\u2019re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\u00a0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure \u2014 at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar\u2019s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\u00a0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn\u2019t been cleared to talk to the press, said she\u2019s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\u00a0\n\u201cI was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter\u2019s while doing everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a juggling act.\u201d\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\u00a0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\u00a0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county\u2019s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are full with patients coming to us through the front door,\u201d Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital\u2019s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. \u201cNothing about COVID-19 is typical.\u201d\u00a0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\u00a0\n\u201cICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThey are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.\u201d\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County \u2014 the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, \u201chospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,\u201d Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\u00a0\nSince October, Modoc County \u2014 wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet \u2014 has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county\u2019s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko. Typically, that includes hospitals in Modesto as well as Vohra\u2019s congested Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have the ability to do an improvised ICU should we have to hold patients but this is clearly not the preferred option,\u201d Sergienko said.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people, and has already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties.\nEven small counties that do have their own ICUs need to transfer patients who require a higher level of care than they can provide. Colusa County, for instance, has three ICU beds \u2014 none of which were occupied as of Monday, according to county counsel Marcos Kropf. (State data reports that zero ICU beds are available in Colusa. The state did not respond to a request for clarification.)\nBut Colusa County has nevertheless needed to transfer patients to hospitals elsewhere, including Chico, Roseville and Marysville. And in Marysville, the only ICU serving nearly 176,000 people in Sutter and Yuba counties is full, according to a health advisory released Friday.\u00a0\nPhuong Luu, health officer for both Sutter and Yuba counties, wrote that the surge has led hospitalizations at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville to almost triple.\u00a0\nMonica Arrowsmith, a spokesperson for the hospital, would not say Friday whether the ICU was at capacity or whether the hospital had enough staff, but she said the hospital has access to additional supplies, expertise and support from the rest of the Adventist Health system.\u00a0\nLuu, however, said the ICU \u201cis full because of the surge in COVID-19 patients needing ICU level care. There are not enough ICU nurses to expand for more ICU beds,\u201d according to the health advisory. \u201cThe current COVID-19 situation is dire in Yuba-Sutter.\u201d\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has requested 815 medical staffers, including 435 specifically for ICUs, from contractors and most are expected within a week, with Imperial County a high priority. The state has also asked the federal government for help staffing ICUs.\u00a0\nImperial County\u2019s El Centro Regional Medical Center plans to open 21 beds in a 50-bed parking lot tent facility today with staffing from the state, according to hospital CEO Edward. He also said the state will allow the hospital to increase the number of patients each nurse can care for. He hopes the changes will help the hospital increase its staffed ICU beds to 32 from 20.\nExhausted healthcare workers\nThe onslaught of cases after nine months of a pandemic are pushing healthcare workers to the brink. The word repeated by each healthcare worker CalMatters interviewed was \u201cexhausted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cExhausted. Oh man. Exhausted and frustrated,\u201d said one Northern California emergency medicine physician, who asked that her name and hospital not be named because she had not been cleared to speak to the press. \u201cAnd a little scared about what\u2019s going to happen soon.\u201d\u00a0\nAlready, she said, she\u2019s finding it increasingly difficult to transfer patients needing specialty care.\u00a0\n\u201cI called every single hospital in Northern California out to Reno and all the Bay Area hospitals, and they all refused to take this patient,\u201d the doctor said, adding that she found a local doctor who could help. \u201cFor those non-COVID patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\nEven at hospitals that still have room in their ICUs, healthcare workers are feeling the emotional toll of the prolonged pandemic.\u00a0\n\u201cFor those non-covid patients who still need speciality care, that\u2019s going to prove to be a big problem.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be dependent on this post-Thanksgiving surge,\u201d said Nick Sawyer, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health. \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we will overwhelm the system and people will end up in a hospital that is overwhelmed, that doesn\u2019t have the staffing that is necessary to provide that best care.\u201d\u00a0\nSawyer said that he traveled to New York to help the overwhelmed hospitals during the early days of the pandemic, and was shaken by what he saw there.\u00a0\n\u201cFamilies have to say goodbye to their loved ones over Facetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to the family.

      "\n\t\t\tCalifornia\u2019s intensive care nightmare: Which hospitals are full?\t\t\nShare this:\nIn summary\nIn the worst-hit counties, some hospitals are sending critically ill patients to other counties. Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\u00a0WhatMatters\u00a0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\u00a0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cThat really bottlenecks us right in the front door,\u201d said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno\u2019s Community Regional Medical Center and the county\u2019s interim health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried.\u201d\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\u00a0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n\u201cWe are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,\u201d said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. \u201cWe feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.\u201d\u00a0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\n\u0394\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\u00a0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\u00a0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\u00a0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\u00a0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired.

      "Open Access ISSN: 2573-0347 Advanced Practices in Nursing Mini Review Volume 09:03, 2024 Abstract The nurse-patient ratio is a critical factor influencing healthcare quality and patient safety. This review explores the relationship between nurse-patient ratios and various outcomes in healthcare settings, including patient morbidity and mortality, nurse job satisfaction, and overall care quality. By synthesizing current literature, the review highlights the impact of staffing levels on patient care and nurse well-being, and discusses potential strategies for optimizing nurse-patient ratios to enhance healthcare delivery. This involves regular assessment of healthcare outcomes, patient satisfaction, and compliance with clinical guidelines. Healthcare organizations often use quality improvement methodologies, such as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles and Six Sigma, to identify areas for improvement, implement changes, and measure the impact of those changes. These methodologies provide a structured approach to problem-solving and facilitate the systematic improvement of healthcare processes.\nKeywords: Healthcare quality \u2022 Patient safety \u2022 Nurse job satisfaction \u2022 Healthcare delivery *Address for Correspondence: Christmal Dela, Department of Health Sciences, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa; E-mail: christmal.\nchristmals23@nwu.ac.za Copyright: \u00a9 2024 Dela C.

Adequate staffing levels ensure that nurses can provide thorough and attentive care, which is essential for positive patient outcomes. Conversely, inadequate nurse-patient ratios can lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality, nurse burnout, and reduced quality of care. As healthcare systems globally grapple with resource constraints and increasing patient demands, understanding the impact of nurse-patient ratios is paramount for policy-making and healthcare management. This paper reviews existing literature on nurse-patient ratios, examining their influence on healthcare quality and patient safety. The goal is to identify the key outcomes associated with varying staffing levels and propose strategies for optimizing nurse-patient ratios to improve healthcare delivery [1].\nLiterature Review Research consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between nurse-patient ratios and patient outcomes. Studies have shown that lower nurse-patient ratios are associated with decreased patient morbidity and mortality. That improved nurse staffing levels significantly reduced the incidence of hospital-acquired infections, pressure ulcers, and patient falls. Nurse Job satisfaction and retention are also influenced by nurse-patient ratios. High patient loads can lead to increased stress, burnout, and job dissatisfaction among nurses. This not only affects the well-being of nurses but also impacts patient care, as high turnover rates can disrupt continuity and quality of care. Healthcare quality, as measured by patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, is closely tied to nurse staffing levels. Hospitals with adequate nurse-patient ratios tend to have higher patient satisfaction scores, as patients receive more personalized and timely care. Additionally, better-staffed units often experience fewer medical errors and higher adherence to clinical guidelines [2].\nDiscussion Optimizing nurse-patient ratios is essential for enhancing healthcare quality and patient safety. Several strategies can be employed to achieve this goal. First, implementing mandated staffing ratios, as seen in California, where legislation requires specific nurse-to-patient ratios in hospitals, can ensure a baseline standard for staffing levels. Research indicates that these regulations have led to improved patient outcomes and nurse satisfaction. Second, employing flexible staffing models that adjust to patient acuity and census can help manage workload more effectively. Utilizing data-driven tools to predict patient needs and adjust staffing accordingly ensures that resources are allocated efficiently. Third, investing in nurse workforce development is crucial. Providing ongoing education, career development opportunities, and supportive work environments can enhance nurse retention and attract new entrants to the profession. This, in turn, can help maintain adequate staffing levels [3].\nFinally, leveraging technology to support nursing practice can alleviate some of the burdens associated with high patient loads. Electronic Health Records (EHRs), telehealth, and other digital tools can streamline documentation, facilitate communication, and enhance care coordination, allowing nurses to focus more on direct patient care. Healthcare quality and safety are fundamental aspects of healthcare delivery that ensure patient well-being and optimal health outcomes. Quality in healthcare refers to the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes consistent with current professional knowledge. Safety, a crucial component of quality, involves minimizing risks, errors, and harm to patients during the provision of healthcare services. Together, healthcare quality and safety form the bedrock of effective medical practice and patient care. A key element of healthcare quality is the implementation of evidence-based practices. These practices are rooted in the best available scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values. By adhering to evidence-based guidelines, healthcare providers can ensure that the treatments and interventions they offer are both effective and efficient. For instance, the use of standardized protocols for managing chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension has been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce complications. Similarly, adherence to surgical checklists has been proven to significantly decrease surgical errors and infections [4].\nPatient safety initiatives aim to create a safe healthcare environment by preventing and reducing risks, errors, and harm that can occur during patient care. These initiatives encompass a range of strategies, including the development of safety protocols, the use of technology to prevent errors, and the promotion of a culture of safety within healthcare organizations. For example, the implementation of Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems has been instrumental in reducing medication errors by ensuring accurate and legible prescriptions. Additionally, the use of barcoding systems Adv Practice Nurs, Volume 09:03, 2024 Page 2 of 2 Dela C.\nfor medication administration ensures that patients receive the correct medications at the appropriate dosages. A critical aspect of healthcare quality and safety is the continuous monitoring and improvement of healthcare processes [5].\nAnother vital component of healthcare quality is patient-centered care. This approach involves respecting patients' preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that they guide all clinical decisions. Patient-centered care emphasizes the importance of effective communication, shared decision-making, and providing compassionate and respectful care. By involving patients in their care, healthcare providers can improve patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment plans, and overall health outcomes. Healthcare quality and safety are also influenced by the work environment and culture within healthcare organizations. A supportive work environment that promotes teamwork, open communication, and continuous learning is essential for ensuring high-quality and safe patient care. Organizations that prioritize staff well-being, provide ongoing education and training, and encourage reporting and learning from errors is better positioned to deliver safe and effective care. Moreover, regulatory bodies and accreditation organizations play a significant role in promoting healthcare quality and safety. These entities establish standards and guidelines that healthcare organizations must adhere to and conduct regular inspections and evaluations to ensure compliance. Accreditation by organizations such as The Joint Commission signifies that a healthcare facility meets high standards of care and safety [6]. Conclusion The nurse-patient ratio is a critical factor influencing healthcare quality and patient safety. Adequate staffing levels are associated with better patient outcomes, higher nurse job satisfaction, and overall improved healthcare delivery. By implementing mandated staffing ratios, employing flexible staffing models, investing in workforce development, and leveraging technology, healthcare organizations can optimize nurse-patient ratios to enhance patient care and nurse well-being. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, prioritizing adequate nurse staffing will remain essential for ensuring high-quality, safe, and effective patient care.\nAcknowledgement None.\nConflict of Interest None.\nHow to cite this article: Dela, Christmal. \u201cThe Impact of Nurse-patient Ratios on Healthcare Quality and Safety.\u201d Adv Practice Nurs 9 (2024): 387.\nReferences 1.

      "A Texas town is trying to solve the US physician shortage with 'homegrown' clinicians \u2014 a possible answer to the primary-care drought plaguing 100 million Americans\nEighteen-year-old Makena Pi\u00f1on had a first-hand view of the medical gaps in El Paso's healthcare system.\nBorn with a congenital heart defect, Pi\u00f1on underwent her first operation at 5 months old, followed by open-heart surgery at 11.\n\"El Paso is a very underserved community,\" she told Insider. \"Being a patient all my life in Houston and then having hospital visits here in El Paso, you can see the difference in the care and how advanced the medicine is,\" Pi\u00f1on said.\nThis year, Pi\u00f1on was one of five El Paso teenagers celebrating an unusual milestone for high-school seniors: She was effectively accepted into medical school, at least four years before most aspiring physicians find out whether they got in.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis nontraditional path to a white-coat ceremony is part of a new, local partnership that aims to combat its hometown's physician shortage with guaranteed spots in medical school, mentorship, Medical College Admission Test preparation, and summer internships. The hope is they will stay and practice medicine in El Paso after medical school and residency.\n\"I really hope to provide a perspective and knowledge to the community here and help to serve patients who might otherwise have to leave because there aren't as many doctors here and I'd like to slowly but surely help keep more patients here,\" Pi\u00f1on said.\nEl Paso County, which includes the city of the same name, is among the 95% of Texas counties that have a shortage of primary-care physicians. They're not alone \u2014 just shy of 100 million Americans live in an area with a shortage of primary-care physicians. And demand for medical care is growing as the American population ages, outstripping supply.\nThe shortages are especially dire in rural areas, where 20% of Americans live but only 10% of doctors practice. The program in Texas for high-school students is adding needed doctors to the primary-care-physician pipeline and could offer a model for other communities facing similar challenges.\nFederal funding could aid and expand the healthcare workforce, but it may not be enough to meet the demand among rural populations. One key to addressing the lack of physicians could be a \"homegrown\" approach to making \u2014 and keeping \u2014 more doctors, nurses, and other clinicians in the areas where they are needed most through mentorship opportunities and state- and privately funded scholarships.\nLimits to the industry's education system leave some medical students without jobs\u00a0\nThe number of students enrolled in medical school grew by 9% between 2010 and 2021, according to the National Center for Education Statistics \u2014 plus another 3% from 2021 to the 2022-23 academic year, according to data from the Association of American Medical Colleges. But the US is on track to have a shortage of around 48,200 to 73,700 doctors by 2024, according to the AAMC. That number could increase to as high as 124,000 by 2034.\n\n                                Related stories\n                              \nWhile the number of medical students and residents has risen, it's not fast enough to keep up with the increasing demand for care as record numbers of clinicians leave the workforce because of pandemic burnout or retirement.\nDr. Atul Grover, the executive director of the AAMC Research and Action Institute, told Insider this demand was because the federal government arbitrarily capped its share of the costs for medical training in the late '90s.\nFor example, federal funding for residency programs was largely capped in 1997 \u2014 on the heels of worries that the US would have a surplus of doctors \u2014 and has only recently been modestly increased.\nThere was a record 40,375 residency spots for the graduating class of 2023, but it still wasn't enough for all 42,952 graduate applicants to match, meaning nearly 2,600 prospective doctors were left without an opportunity.\nRural areas are prioritized for new residency spots but expected to struggle to bring in new talent, considering that 98% of residency positions in 2020 were at urban hospitals, a Government Accountability Office study found.\nAnd while diversity among medical students is improving, underserved patients of color are still far less likely to get to see a doctor who looks like them, which is linked to better care and outcomes.\nHit with drastic shortages, rural states are investing in medical students from early ages\nFor physicians, \"there is a bit of a geographic battle,\" Grover said, adding: \"We need to figure out how to serve the needs of rural populations \u2014 which we've been trying to do for the past 50 years and it hasn't worked \u2014 and we can't just diversify the healthcare workforce starting in medical school; even high school is almost too late.\"\nInvesting in and keeping the next generation of doctors is the mission of a partnership between the University of Texas at El Paso and the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso.\nThis first cohort is a proof-of-concept. Students will be guided through the process up until admission, which includes a guaranteed interview. If all goes well, they and future students in the program will have a sure path to medical school.\u00a0\nWith considerable sponsorship from local businesses, the pair of universities organize opportunities for El Paso kids to get hands-on exposure to the healthcare industry, starting in elementary school. As part of its new MedFuture program, five high-school students are given preliminary acceptance to medical school (as long as they maintain a qualifying grade-point average), access to summer research opportunities throughout their college years at the University of Texas at El Paso, and help preparing for the MCAT.\n\"Many of the students are first-generation immigrants; they have not had exposure to healthcare professions or how to get there,\" Dr. Richard Lange, the president of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso and dean of the Paul L. Foster School of Medicine, told Insider.\u00a0\nLange said the program selected students with an interest in supporting their community. The idea, he added, is that those participants will have a higher likelihood of staying after medical school and residency.\u00a0\nIt's up to the students to decide whether they want to go on to medical school, but there are plenty of incentives for them to attend a program in Texas. A large portion of the class at the Foster School of Medicine receives scholarships from a $50 million endowment, Lange said.\nAs of 2020, more than 80% of students who went to medical school and did their residencies in Texas stayed in state to practice medicine, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Lange told Insider he estimated that about 15% of graduates from the Foster School of Medicine were placed in residency programs in the El Paso area.\nAnd that benefits patients beyond an increase in the number of physicians in the region, Dr. Cynthia Perry, associate academic dean for admissions at the Foster School of Medicine told Insider. \"For us, it's about cultural competency,\" she said. \"The students that are from our region and go on to train and practice here relate to their patients and understand the obstacles these patients have to endure.\"\u00a0\nMedFuture students are uniquely suited to help patients navigate El Paso's particular system and take advantage of resources a physician from elsewhere might be unaware of, she added.\u00a0\nSome states bootstrap additional residency spots and medical-school scholarships\u00a0\nEven as medical-school graduates nationwide face the limits of residency-match spots, Texas is uniquely positioned. For each in-state medical-school graduate, the state has 1.1 residency spots per graduate, set by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. While there are technically 1.82 slots per graduate nationwide, according to the National Resident Matching Program, this number includes international applicants \u2014 so there are only 0.85 slots per American graduate.\nTexas hospitals have accomplished this by taking advantage of a Medicare policy that provides additional funds for new residency programs, while funded slots in existing programs are capped. The state does the same.\u00a0\nSince 2016, six medical schools have opened in Texas. The number of residency programs in Texas has increased by 49% in the past decade, outpacing the 41% national growth rate.\n\"The state has been very generous in funding these graduate-medical-education programs to make sure that if these students want to stay here, they can,\" Lange said.\nTexas' model is working, and Grover told Insider he saw similar local efforts produce \"homegrown\" doctors from a young age and incentivize them to practice in shortage areas across the country.\u00a0\nWhile about 20% of people in El Paso are estimated to live in poverty, the city benefits from medical-education funding provided by the state, which has the second-highest GDP in the country. But state funding won't go as far in poorer states with even-worse physician shortages and higher rates of premature deaths, heart disease, obesity, and overall poor health, including Mississippi or Louisiana.\u00a0\n\"We need to figure out how to fortify the pipeline of new physicians, and we need to figure out how to make full use of everyone in all the healthcare professionals,\" Grover said.\n\n                              Read next\n                            \nJump to\n",

California currently has the most number of active physicians of any U.S. state, with around 125,566 physicians. In California, the specialties with the most physicians are psychiatry, emergency medicine, and anesthesiology. \nSpecialty areas\nIn general, the most common specialty areas for physicians in the U.S. are emergency medicine, psychiatry, surgery, and anesthesiology. As of 2024, there were around 58,900 psychiatrists in the U.S. Concerning the gender distribution of specialty physicians, males out number females in almost every specialty, with exceptions found in mainly in various pediatric disciplines, and obstetrics and gynecology. \nCompensation\nThe specialty areas with the highest average annual compensation are plastic surgery, orthopedics, and cardiology. As of 2024, a physician in orthopedics earned an average of 558,000 U.S. dollars per year. Male physicians still earn more than their female counterparts in both primary care and specialty settings. This difference is especially large in specialty settings where male physicians earn more than 100,000 dollars more per year than female physicians.\n\n                        Leading 10 U.S. states with the most number of active physicians as of 2024\n                    \n\n                                    Additional Information\n                                \n\n                                Show sources information\n                            \n                                Show publisher information\n                            \n                                Use Ask Statista Research Service\n                            \nJuly 2024\nUnited States\nas of January 2024\nData includes currently active allopathic physicians (MDs) and osteopathic physicians (DOs).\r\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\r\n\nOther statistics on the topic\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nNumber of specialty physicians in the U.S. 2024, by field of specialty\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nNumber of physicians in the U.S. by specialty and gender 2021\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nTotal active physicians in the U.S. 2024, by state\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nAnnual compensation of U.S. physicians by specialty 2024\n* For commercial use only\n\n                            Basic Account\n                        \n\n                            Starter Account\n                        \n\n                            Professional Account\n                        \n1\n                        All prices do not include sales tax.

California currently has the most number of active physicians of any U.S. state, with around 125,566 physicians. In California, the specialties with the most physicians are psychiatry, emergency medicine, and anesthesiology. \nSpecialty areas\nIn general, the most common specialty areas for physicians in the U.S. are emergency medicine, psychiatry, surgery, and anesthesiology. As of 2024, there were around 58,900 psychiatrists in the U.S. Concerning the gender distribution of specialty physicians, males out number females in almost every specialty, with exceptions found in mainly in various pediatric disciplines, and obstetrics and gynecology. \nCompensation\nThe specialty areas with the highest average annual compensation are plastic surgery, orthopedics, and cardiology. As of 2024, a physician in orthopedics earned an average of 558,000 U.S. dollars per year. Male physicians still earn more than their female counterparts in both primary care and specialty settings. This difference is especially large in specialty settings where male physicians earn more than 100,000 dollars more per year than female physicians.\n\n                        Leading 10 U.S. states with the most number of active physicians as of 2024\n                    \n\n                                    Additional Information\n                                \n\n                                Show sources information\n                            \n                                Show publisher information\n                            \n                                Use Ask Statista Research Service\n                            \nJuly 2024\nUnited States\nas of January 2024\nData includes currently active allopathic physicians (MDs) and osteopathic physicians (DOs).\r\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\r\n\nOther statistics on the topic\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nNumber of specialty physicians in the U.S. 2024, by field of specialty\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nNumber of physicians in the U.S. by specialty and gender 2021\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nTotal active physicians in the U.S. 2024, by state\nHealth Professionals & Hospitals\nAnnual compensation of U.S. physicians by specialty 2024\n* For commercial use only\n\n                            Basic Account\n                        \n\n                            Starter Account\n                        \n\n                            Professional Account\n                        \n1\n                        All prices do not include sales tax.

      "Texas primary care doctor shortage spikes during the pandemic; rural Texans hit hardest\n\u201cThere\u2019s one family physician for 5,000 patients in the Big Bend area right now,\u201d says one rural doctor.\n\nBy Bonnie PetrieNovember 17, 2021\u00a05:00 pmHealth & Science, Partner Organizations, Texas Public Radio, The Texas Newsroom\n\n\n\n\nGO NAKAMURA\n/\nREUTERS\nDr. Mark Key walks into Medical Arts Hospital in Lamesa, Texas, on Dec. 16, 2020. \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nFrom TPR:\nTexas\u2019 primary care doctor shortage has taken a sharp turn for the worse during the pandemic, and one rural family doctor is imploring state lawmakers to do something about it.\nDr. Adrian Billings is chief medical officer for Preventative Care Health Services, a health center with clinics in Alpine, Marfa and Presidio. He\u2019s a primary care doctor and there aren\u2019t anywhere near enough of them in Big Bend.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one family physician for 5,000 patients in the Big Bend area right now. That\u2019s a delay of care,\u201d Billings told the House Public Health Committee of the Texas Legislature this fall. \u201cThat means sicker patients, that means more costly or care. That means less productivity. That means more death.\u201d\nThe federal government\u2019s Health Resources and Services Administration classifies areas with fewer than one primary care provider for every 3,500 residents as Health Professional Shortage Areas, or HPSA\u2019s.\nBig Bend is definitely an HPSA, but according to research done by American Public Media Research Lab, Big Bend is hardly unique in Texas \u2014 and the pandemic isn\u2019t helping.\n\u201cIn 2019, 129 of Texas\u2019s 254 counties identified as a shortage area for primary care providers. As of this July 2021, that number jumped up to 228. So it increased by 99 counties,\u201d said Katherine Sypher, a data journalism fellow with the APM research lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are only five counties in Texas that didn\u2019t have any significant number of primary care physician shortages, four of those were Metropolitan,\u201d Sypher said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s also important to note that a lot of the counties in Texas that are experiencing these shortages are rural and already were experiencing a lack of health care providers to begin with.\u201d\nBack in Alpine, Billings said the primary care doctor shortage was hard enough to manage back before COVID, but the pandemic has been a body blow.\n\u201cSince February of this year, this area has lost five physicians; four family physicians in the area\u2019s only pediatrician. We lost a nurse practitioner, and we lost a physician\u2019s assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s seven primary care providers in this area, which represents over 50% of our physician workforce that covers this vast 12,000 square mile area that we serve in a population of about 25,000.\u201d\nBillings said providing medical care to a region the size of Big Bend is a team effort, but they don\u2019t have a deep bench. They don\u2019t have anyone to sub in when the team is overwhelmed.\n\u201cAt times, we had to shut down our behavioral health service line, our dental service line and our primary care service line in order just to focus on mass vaccination days, because that bench was empty,\u201d he said.\nThat has implications for people who need to say a doctor for a COVID test \u2014 or anything.\n\u201cWe\u2019re booking out now three weeks as our next available appointment in our practice and there are patients that that need to be seen they need to be seen today. And you know we\u2019re doing our best to try and squeeze them in and we tend to be overbooking ourselves.\u201d\nOn July 5, Big Bend Regional Medical Center had to temporarily close the only labor and delivery unit between El Paso and Del Rio \u2014 which are over 400 miles apart \u2014 because of a shortage of labor and delivery nurses.\nBillings said it\u2019s that kind of stress that is driving some primary care doctors out of the field \u2014 the stress of working so hard and still not being able to provide the care a community needs.\n\u201cThe acute pressure right now on our primary care system in our healthcare system is trying to deal with COVID, but the unintended consequences, years down the road are likely a worsening in the prevalence of these chronic diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cNot to mention just the burnout of our healthcare workforce.\u201d\nRural Texans\u2019 access to healthcare is also reduced by lack of health coverage. According to APM research lab, Texas has the highest uninsured rate among all states, with nearly 1 in 5 residents living without insurance. One reason for that is Texas is one of only 12 states who rejected the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That has led to rural hospitals closures, and, Billings said, exacerbated the primary care doctor shortage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the lack of Texas expanding Medicaid, is one of the big reasons why physicians \u2014 especially your primary care (physicians) \u2014 have left the state or have just retired,\u201d he said.\nBillings proposes what he calls the Texas Center for Rural Health Education\n\u201cThis center would be a training center of excellence for educating rural healthcare students, nurses, physicians, advanced practice clinicians, pharmacists, social workers, behavioral health workers, and public health professionals that are so lacking in our rural communities,\u201d he said.\nIf something doesn\u2019t change, the outlook is bleak. In May of 2020, early in the pandemic, the Department of State Health Services projected that the shortage of family doctors was likely to increase from just over a thousand in 2018 to nearly 2,500 in 2032.\nBillings does not believe those numbers are written in stone, however. Or at least they shouldn\u2019t be, as he told the House Public Health Committee of the Texas Legislature in October.\n\u201cA Texans\u2019 rural zip code should not be a risk factor for their health, owing to an inability to access care in their own communities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIf you found the reporting above valuable, please consider making a donation to support it here.

Drug Shortages Prior to and During the COVID-19 Pandemic. JAMA Netw Open. 2024;7(4):e244246. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.4246\n\u00a9 2024 \nDrug Shortages Prior to and During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nQuestion\u00a0\r\n    What was the incidence of drug shortages in the US between 2017 and 2021?\nFindings\u00a0\r\n    In this cross-sectional study, a total of 571 drugs exposed to 731 supply chain issue reports were matched to 7296 comparison medications with no reports from 2017 to 2021. One in 7 reports (14%) were associated with drug shortages (decreases in sales of \u226533%); supply disruptions increased for drugs with and without reports at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and returned to prepandemic levels after May 2020.\nMeaning\u00a0\r\n    These findings suggest that ongoing policy work is needed to protect US drug supplies from future supply shocks.\nImportance\u00a0\r\n    Drug shortages are a chronic and worsening issue that compromises patient safety. Despite the destabilizing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pharmaceutical production, it remains unclear whether issues affecting the drug supply chain were more likely to result in meaningful shortages during the pandemic.\nObjective\u00a0\r\n    To estimate the proportion of supply chain issue reports associated with drug shortages overall and with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\u00a0\r\n    This longitudinal cross-sectional study used data from the IQVIA Multinational Integrated Data Analysis database, comprising more than 85% of drug purchases by US pharmacies from wholesalers and manufacturers, from 2017 to 2021. Data were analyzed from January to May 2023.\nExposure\u00a0\r\n    Presence of a supply chain issue report to the US Food and Drug Administration or the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP).\nMain Outcomes and Measures\u00a0\r\n    The main outcome was drug shortage, defined as at least 33% decrease in units purchased within 6 months of a supply chain issue report. Random-effects logistic regression models compared the marginal odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports. Interaction terms assessed heterogeneity prior to vs during the COVID-19 pandemic and by drug characteristics (formulation, age, essential medicine status, clinician- vs self-administered, sales volume, and number of manufacturers).\nResults\u00a0\r\n    A total of 571 drugs exposed to 731 supply chain issue reports were matched to 7296 comparison medications with no reports. After adjusting for drug characteristics, 13.7% (95% CI, 10.4%-17.8%) of supply chain issue reports were associated with subsequent drug shortages vs 4.1% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.8%) of comparators (marginal odds ratio [mOR], 3.7 [95% CI, 2.6-5.1]). Shortages increased among both drugs with and without reports in February to April 2020 (34.2% of drugs with supply chain issue reports and 9.5% of comparison drugs; mOR, 4.9 [95% CI, 2.1-11.6]), and then decreased after May 2020 (9.8% of drugs with reports and 3.6% of comparison drugs; mOR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.6-5.3]). Significant associations were identified by formulation (parenteral mOR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-3.2] vs oral mOR, 5.4 [95% CI, 3.3-8.8]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.008), WHO essential medicine status (essential mOR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.3-5.2] vs nonessential mOR, 4.6 [95% CI, 3.2-6.7]; P\u2009=\u2009.02), and for brand-name vs generic status (brand-name mOR, 8.1 [95% CI, 4.0-16.0] vs generic mOR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.7-3.6]; P\u2009=\u2009.002).\nConclusions and Relevance\u00a0\r\n    In this national cross-sectional study, supply chain issues associated with drug shortages increased at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing policy work is needed to protect US drug supplies from future shocks and to prioritize clinically valuable drugs at greatest shortage risk.\nDrug shortages have reached record highs.1 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a shortage as \u201ca period of time when the demand\u2026for the drug\u2026exceeds the supply.\u201d2 Shortages have been associated with missed or delayed dosages,3,4 medication errors,5,6 increased spending,7,8 and death.9 Shortages are caused by underreimbursement,10 quality concerns,11 and an overreliance on single-source production.12\nSince 2012, companies must report to the FDA known issues affecting the supply chain which could result in shortages (hereafter, supply chain issue reports).2 These reports are also tracked by the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP).13 Examples of supply chain issue reports include quality concerns (eg, microbial contamination) and unanticipated events that may impact production (eg, natural disasters).14 The FDA also publishes recalls and discontinuations. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with record numbers of supply chain issue reports.1,15 Despite these known risks, it is unknown how often supply chain issues were associated with subsequent shortages, ie, meaningful decreases in the national supply of a medication.\nAs the public health emergency ends, there is an imperative need for evidence regarding its impact on the drug supply chain to inform policies16-20 that protect patients from future, unanticipated shocks.21 The primary objective of our study was to quantify the proportion of all supply chain issue reports that were associated with drug shortages from 2017 to 2021. Our study adds to existing literature by comparing shortages during vs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and by drug characteristics. Our results provide evidence to inform policies to manage upstream events before they impact patients\u2019 access to life-saving treatments.\nWe conducted a population-based, longitudinal cross-sectional study of US prescription drug purchases from January 2017 to December 2021. Using public information from the FDA and ASHP, we identified medications with supply chain issue reports and matched them to drugs without reports. We selected supply chain characteristics based on a conceptual framework and compared the odds of shortages for each group. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved the study as not human participants research; therefore, the requirements for approval and informed consent were waived. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.\nDrug manufacturers are legally required to report known supply chain issues which could result in shortages (eg, inability to obtain raw ingredients) to the FDA; they report voluntarily to ASHP. However, supply chain reports may be incomplete indicators for meaningful decreases in national supplies (ie, shortages). As represented in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1, protective shields in supply chains,22,23 including opening more production lines, importing drugs from other countries, lengthening expiration dates,14,22 or using residual supplies,22 may address issues prior to the depletion of supplies held by manufacturers, wholesalers, and pharmacies. Therefore, not all reported issues necessarily result in drug shortages.\nGiven these complexities and the known limitations of reporting, the purpose of our study was to quantify the proportion of supply chain issue reports that were associated with subsequent population-level shortages, both prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Because there is no legal standard for meaningful decreases in supply, we defined shortages as decreases in purchased units of at least 33% within 6 months after the issuance of a new supply chain issue report. This threshold was chosen based on previous studies24 and is consistent with the FDA and ASHP\u2019s definitions of shortages, ie, significant decreases in national supply2 with the greatest potential to impact patient care.25 We accounted for non\u2013shortage-related supply chain factors by matching drugs exposed to reports to unexposed drugs without reports. We then compared subsequent odds of shortages (ie, \u226533% decreases in supply) for each group.\nOur study population comprised a longitudinal cross-section of drugs purchased in the US from 2017 to 2021 in IQVIA\u2019s Multinational Integrated Data Analysis (MIDAS) database. MIDAS comprises 85% of retail and 97% of nonretail purchases by pharmacies from wholesalers and manufacturers, based on unit volume.26 Data are reported in standardized units, defined as 1 pill, capsule, or vial or 5 mL oral liquid. We conducted our analyses on the drug formulation level. We excluded products with incomplete data, radiopharmaceuticals, unapproved products, allergens, antidotes, and over-the-counter products that are not fully captured in MIDAS. We also excluded topicals, since these may reflect different dosages that are difficult to compare with systemic formulations (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).\nOur exposed group comprised drugs with incident supply chain issue reports issued from January 2017 to September 2021 (3 months prior to data end). For each report, we defined the index date as the initial posting date by the FDA or ASHP. This included issues reported as being likely to result in shortages,2,13,27,28 FDA recalls,29 and discontinuations. Reports for the same drug-form were considered the same episode if they occurred within 90 days (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding recalls and discontinuations which may be indefinite.30\nWe performed exposure density sampling (EDS) to match each drug with a supply chain issue report (ie, exposed) with up to 10 comparison drugs with no reports at the time of exposure (ie, nonexposed).31,32 EDS is akin to sampling techniques for nested case-control studies,32-34 with the exception that matching is performed at the time of an exposure instead of the time of an outcome. This approach mitigated bias due to seasonality. When appropriately combined with multivariable adjustment for confounders, EDS leads to unbiased results.32 We did not match on baseline purchasing trends, since many reports were precipitated by abnormal demand increases.35 Drugs could appear more than once in either group. Drugs with reports could serve as at-risk comparators during any month without an active supply issue report.33\nMotivated by FDA\u2019s definition2 and based on previous studies,24 we defined meaningful shortages as at least 33% decreases in purchased units within 6 months after an incident supply chain issue report, compared with 3 months prior (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1). This decrease is greater than what would be expected based on seasonal trends. We conducted secondary analyses of severe shortages, defined as decreases of at least 66%, as in previous literature.24\nWe used random-effects logistic regression models followed by marginal estimation to compare the odds of shortages for drugs with vs without supply chain issue reports. We included a random intercept for each matched set to account for potential dependency induced by matching. Our main estimates were the mean marginal odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports.34,35 We estimated absolute incidence by comparing the estimated probabilities of shortages in each group. A type 1 error rate of .05 was assumed, all hypothesis tests were 2-sided, and no adjustments were made for multiplicity. Analyses were conducted from January to May 2023 in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute), Stata version 16.1 (StataCorp), and RStudio version 4.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing).\nTo determine the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with US drug supply shortages, we included interaction terms to assess differential changes in the odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports before the pandemic (January 2017 to January 2020), in the first few months after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 an emergency and when stockpiling occurred36 (February 2020 to April 2020), and in the first pandemic year (May 2020 to September 2021). We grouped issues based on their issuance date.\nTo assess the associations of supply chain characteristics with shortage incidence, we included interaction terms by formulation. We then used marginal estimation to compare odds of shortages for drugs with vs without reports, within each form, eg, parenteral drugs with reports vs parenteral comparators. Additional interaction terms were added for other characteristics, including years since market entry and generic availability from the FDA National Drug Code Directory (August 2022),37 WHO essential medicine status (June 2022),38 and clinician- vs self-administration, defined using J-codes.39 We proxied supply chain redundancy using the number of manufacturers in MIDAS in the 6 months prior to a supply chain issue report. To capture market size, we adjusted for total sales in MIDAS during the same period (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of methodological assumptions. Because some shortages take longer to develop (eg, due to residual supply), we redefined shortages as decreases in supply within 9 months after report issuance. We assessed 5 (vs 10) matched comparisons, FDA and ASHP reports separately, and excluded recalls and discontinuations.30 Finally, we used nearest-neighbor propensity score methods to match drugs on month, formulation, class, clinician- vs self-administration, WHO essential-medicine status, at least 20 years since market or generic availability, at least 5 manufacturers, and at least $5 million in sales.\nPrior to inclusion criteria, there were 4142 drugs. As shown in Figure 1, 2276 drugs met exclusion criteria, resulting in a final sample of 1866 drugs. Among these, 571 drugs (31%) had 731 incident supply chain issue reports. These were EDS-matched to 1597 unique drugs without concurrent exposures; 717 reports were matched to 10 comparators and 14 reports had 9 comparators, for a total sample size of 7296 comparators.\nPer the Table, generic drugs were overrepresented in supply chain issue reports (616 reports [84%] vs 4397 comparison drugs [60%]), as were products at least 20 years old (375 reports [51%] vs 2434 comparison drugs [33%]), drugs with at least 5 manufacturers (378 reports [52%] vs 2225 comparison drugs [30%]), WHO essential medicines (316 reports [43%] vs 2199 comparison drugs [30%]), and drugs with less than $5 million baseline sales (234 reports [32%] vs 2158 comparison drugs [30%]). Manufacturers did not provide a reason for 264 reports (36%); the percentage of reports with unknown or unspecified reasons increased to 42% from February to April 2020 and 47% after May 2020 (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Across the entire study period, more than half of reports were recalls or discontinuations (498 reports [68%]), mostly due to quality concerns (Table; eTable 4 in Supplement 1).\nWe observed 15 to 71 incident supply chain issue reports per quarter from 2017 to 2021 (Figure 2). Across the study period, the mean change in drug purchases was \u22125.1% (95% CI, \u22128.2% to \u22122.1%) in the first quarter and \u22127.0% (95% CI, \u221214.7 to 0.01%) in the second quarter after report-issuance (Table). Among all reports, 113 reports (16%) were associated with shortages (\u226533% decrease) within 6 months vs 491 of 7290 unexposed comparison drugs (7%) (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). We observed an increase in comparison drugs with shortages in the first quarter of 2020 (Figure 2). Severe shortages (\u226566% decrease) were less common, with 63 reports (9%) and 188 comparison drugs (3%) associated with severe shortages (eTable 5, eFigure 4, and eFigure 5 in Supplement 1). Nonrecall and nondiscontinuation reports were more likely to be associated with meaningful (83 reports [23%]) and severe (43 reports [12%]) shortages, compared with recalls (meaningful: 13 reports [10%]; severe: 4 reports [3%]) and discontinuations (meaningful: 48 reports [13%]; severe: 33 reports [9%]) (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1).\nMarginal odds ratios (mORs) and estimated probabilities from our logistic regression analysis are shown in Figure 3, with full regression output in eTable 6 in Supplement 1. Across baseline drug characteristics, the marginal estimated percentage of supply chain issue reports associated with shortages was 13.7% (95% CI, 10.4%-17.8%) of reports vs 4.1% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.8%) of comparators (Figure 3). Compared with drugs without reports, drugs with reports had greater marginal odds of shortages (mOR, 3.7 [95% CI, 2.9-5.1]). Results were similar for severe shortages (mOR, 6.3 [95% CI, 3.7-10.9]), although adjusted incidences were lower (6.0% [95% CI, 3.8%-9.2%] for supply chain issue reports and 1.0% [95% CI, 0.7%-1.4%] for comparison drugs) (eFigure 6 in Supplement 1).\nAs shown in Figure 3, the adjusted incidence of shortages for supply chain reports issued in the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to be associated with subsequent shortages than reports issued during the prepandemic period (34.2% [95% CI, 18.6%-54.1%] vs 13.7% [95% CI, 10.0%-18.5%]). However, we also observed increases in the adjusted proportion of comparison drugs without reports with shortages at or above our 33% cutoff compared with the prepandemic period (9.5% [95% CI, 7.2%-12.5%] vs 4.0% [95% CI, 3.3%-4.7%]). There were no significant interactions by COVID-19 pandemic period. The 95% CIs of the mORs comparing drugs with vs without reports issued from February to April 2020 overlapped with the prepandemic period (prepandemic mOR, 3.9 [95% CI, 2.6-5.6] vs February to April 2020 mOR, 4.9 [95% CI, 2.1-11.6]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.60). The mOR for drugs with vs without reports issued during or after May 2020 also did not significantly differ from the prepandemic period (mOR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.6-5.3]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.38) (Figure 3). The association between report status and severe shortages did not significantly differ during the prepandemic period (mOR, 6.8 [95% CI, 3.6-12.4]) vs during the early stage of the pandemic (February to April 2020: mOR, 5.9 [95% CI, 1.3-26.3]) or after May 2020 (mOR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.4-11.8]) (eFigure 6 in Supplement 1).\nFigure 4 summarizes our assessment of heterogeneity by drug characteristics. Across other characteristics, we observed a significant interaction for parenteral drugs with vs without reports, compared with oral drugs (parenteral mOR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-3.2] vs oral mOR, 5.4 [95% CI, 3.3-8.8]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.008). There were also significant interactions by WHO essential medicine status (essential mOR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.3-5.2] vs nonessential mOR, 4.6 [95% CI, 3.2-6.7]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.02), and for brand-name vs generic drugs (brand-name mOR, 8.1 [95% CI, 4.0-16.0] vs generic mOR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.7-3.6]; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.002). We observed similar heterogeneity for severe shortages  (eFigure 7 in Supplement 1).\nAs shown in eFigure 8 and eTables 7 to 11 in Supplement 1, sensitivity analyses were consistent with our main findings. Excluding recalls and discontinuations resulted in a slightly higher adjusted incidence of shortages (16.7% [95% CI, 12.9%-21.4%]); however, the marginal odds of shortage were similar (mOR, 3.9 [95% CI, 2.8-5.4]).\nIn this national cross-sectional study, approximately 1 in 7 supply chain issue reports (14%) were associated with drug shortages within 6 months, and 1 in 15 supply chain issue reports (6%) were associated with severe shortages. The incidence of shortages increased to 1 in 3 reports (34%) from February to April 2020 and then reduced to prepandemic levels after May 2020. However, we also observed increases in shortages in drugs with no supply chain issues during the early pandemic. WHO essential and parenteral medicines were less likely to be associated with shortages, and brand name drugs were more likely to be associated with shortages.\nOur findings are mostly consistent with a similar RAND study in MIDAS from 2016 to 2019.30 In that study, utilization decreased by a mean of 8.4% in the quarter after a supply chain issue report vs 5.1% in our study. Our smaller absolute estimate may be due to a lower incidence of shortages after May 2020. Nevertheless, our study is an important contribution to the literature because we included recalls and discontinuations, which were less likely to be associated with shortages. We also tested whether shortages changed after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn our study, drugs with and without reports from February to April 2020 were more likely to be associated with subsequent shortages, compared with prepandemic rates. These findings are consistent with the known destabilizing impact of COVID-19 on supply chains. We observed a return to prepandemic levels after May 2020. This finding may be explained by the implementation of new policies that empowered the FDA to take more direct action.16,40,41 Despite these improvements, ongoing vulnerabilities in drug supply chains are in need of policy action,17 including greater supply chain transparency19,21 and addressing root economic causes of shortages.42\nIt is also possible that issuance of an FDA or ASHP report, while consistently associated with higher odds of shortages, may have underestimated relevant upstream issues at pandemic start. Before the pandemic, 4% of drugs with no report were associated with shortages at or above our 33% decrease cutoff; this increased to 10% from February to April 2020. We also observed a greater proportion of supply chain issues with no or unspecified reasons during the pandemic vs the prepandemic period. Temporary pauses in quality assurance reviews during COVID-19 lockdowns may have been associated with underreporting. There are no penalties for failure to report.22 Our wide 95% CIs for February to April 2020 should be interpreted with caution, given the small sample size (57 reports) and potential underreporting.\nWhen examining variation across drugs, we observed a higher mOR for the association between having a report and subsequent shortage among branded medications. This finding is not unexpected, given that branded markets usually have 1 supplier. The higher mOR among branded medications may therefore be explained by the unavailability of alternative manufacturers to supply product. Shortages of branded drugs may also respond to different underlying reasons, such as increased demand, quotas, or manufacturer capacity.43,44 In contrast, approximately 4 in 5 supply chain issue reports in our study were for generic medications, and one-third were for drugs with prereport sales less than $5 million. Generic supply chain issues likely involve insufficient incentives for manufacturers to invest in resilient supply chains for products of limited profitability.11,41 In this context, recent policy proposals suggest the implementation of reimbursement models which would provide add-on payments for generics manufactured in more resilient supply chains.42,45 Our findings of differing shortage risk by supply chain characteristics could be used to develop lists of high-priority generic drugs for the application of these novel reimbursement models. Our findings may also be informative for the development of shortage-critical lists to prioritize medications for other drug shortage policies,22,46 like those in Canada and Europe.47,48 Similar frameworks have not yet been adopted in the US but would be useful in the prioritization of national drug shortage policy.49\nInterestingly, we observed a lower mOR for the association between having a report and subsequent shortage for parenteral vs oral drugs. Changes in demand for these products, eg, cancellation of elective surgeries, may have resulted in residual supply during the pandemic. A higher proportion of parenteral drugs without supply chain reports were also associated with meaningful decreases in supply at or above our 33% cutoff, eg, 7% of parenteral vs 3% of oral drugs, suggesting that it is also possible all parenteral products were more vulnerable to disruption, lessening the difference between exposed vs unexposed drugs.11,41 Generic sterile injectables have therefore been prioritized in several recent drug shortage policy proposals.42,45\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, the observed increase in drugs without supply chain issue reports that experienced shortages from February to April 2020 suggests potential for underreporting during the COVID-19 shutdown. Our mORs comparing drugs with vs without reports from February to April 2020 should be interpreted with caution. Our dataset was also time-limited (2017-2021). Many pandemic-related policies were not yet fully implemented, and we could not assess the association of the end of the public health emergency in May 2023.50 Second, although MIDAS is the most comprehensive dataset available, it does not fully capture over-the-counter and topical products, many of which have recently been experiencing shortages. Third, we do not know the downstream impact of the identified shortages on patients. Bedside efforts and availability of therapeutic alternatives may maintain standards of care, even when shortages occur.22 ASHP includes information on equivalents for some drugs; however, this information was lacking in FDA databases.\nThis cross-sectional study found that 1 in 7 supply chain issue reports were associated with drug shortages. Although the shortages increased early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a return to prepandemic levels after May 2020. As the public health emergency ends, continued policy effort is needed to mitigate shortages and to prepare pharmaceutical supply chains for future, unanticipated shocks.\nAccepted for Publication: January 29, 2024.\nPublished: April 5, 2024. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.4246\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2024 Callaway Kim K et al.

      "Drug Shortages Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic\nChristina M. Bookwalter, PharmD, BCPSClinical PharmacistWomack Army Medical CenterFort Bragg, North Carolina\n\nUS Pharm. 2021;46(2):25-28.\nABSTRACT: The uncertainty of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused anticipatory purchasing of medications around the world, driving demand to an unprecedented high. Meanwhile, drug factories shut down in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the drug-supply chain was disrupted, and drug shortages resulted. In the face of these drug shortages, pharmacy personnel responded by initiating local policy changes, implementing detailed antibiotic stewardship, and enacting quantity limits for in-demand medications. Pharmacists are indispensable during a drug shortage because of their unique skills and ability to bridge shortage gaps with effective action plans that will not imperil patient safety.\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s a shortage of everything\u2019: Pharmacies in New York City struggle to keep key medications stocked amid coronavirus outbreak.\u201d1 \u201cCoronavirus pandemic is causing \u2018unacceptable\u2019 shortages in US drug supplies.\u201d2 These headlines and many others have overwhelmed news outlets, social media, and general conversation among the American public for months. When pharmacy personnel hear about drug shortages, panic, fear, and frustration begin to set in. Pharmacy\u2019s primary responsibility is to supply patients with life-saving medications. When drugs run out, pharmacy personnel may feel responsible for failing to supply the patient with a life-saving pharmaceutical. Accordingly, when pharmacy professionals encounter drug shortages, there is a call to action to be prepared. Pharmacies prepare by purchasing available product, looking for alternatives, implementing protocols to save stock, and finding creative solutions to conserve valuable resources. The uncertainty of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has highlighted the difficulties inherent in having a global drug-supply chain and has caused an increase in global demand for certain medications. It is imperative for pharmacists to understand the causes of drug shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, key medications affected at this time, and how to ensure patient safety during a shortage.\nCauses of Drug Shortages\nDrug shortages have been an ongoing problem for the medical community for decades; however, drug-shortage concerns have been exacerbated by this worldwide pandemic. Drug manufacturing follows standard business practices in order to make a profit. Excess stock in the warehouse is risky from a business standpoint. It costs money to store and maintain product in anticipation of sales and profit. Therefore, businesses may operate on a just-in-time model by manufacturing the product when it is needed in order to keep costs down and maintain efficiency. With no on-hand reserve, if anything alters supply or increases demand, a shortage can occur.3\nThe supply of goods to the market directly relates to the quantity of goods coming off the production lines over a given time. In order to produce a drug, raw materials must be acquired. The drug-manufacturing process is wholly dependent on the supplier of the raw materials. Often, there are multiple manufacturers for a drug, but there may be only one producer of the raw material. Therefore, any interruption in the supply of the raw material will affect all manufacturers of the drug.4 Currently, about 80% of the raw materials for drugs are imported from abroad, making the American drug supply highly dependent on other countries.4\nEven when adequate raw materials are available, there is a maximum capacity or a limited number of units that can be manufactured at a given time. Because the FDA approves a specific manufacturing line to produce a specific drug at a specific facility, a manufacturer cannot set up additional production of a drug in short supply elsewhere in the facility.4 Further limitations to production include the good manufacturing practices, chemical reactions, and in-process controls that must be in place to turn out a quality product.5\nThe spread of COVID-19 to the level of a global pandemic impacted the acquisition of raw material and caused manufacturing shutdowns around the world. China is a major source of active pharmaceutical ingredients, finished dosage forms, and raw materials.6 In response to COVID-19, roughly 37 pharmaceutical factories in China that manufactured active ingredients for U.S. drug products were shut down.7 Consequently, manufacturers in other parts of the world were forced to depend on current stock or find alternative supply sources. India, which imports roughly 70% of its raw materials from China and is the world\u2019s largest producer of generic drugs, began to experience delays in receiving ingredients and could not keep up with global demand under these conditions.7 In anticipation of drug shortages, the Indian government restricted the exportation of medications to other parts of the world in order to prevent a potential shortage in its own country.7 The limiting of drug exports from India amplified shortages in other areas of the world that depend on that supply.\nWith factory doors closed and COVID-19 a global threat, supplies start to run low. Not knowing when and where the next COVID-19 surge will occur, everyone is trying to be prepared. Pharmacies prepare by managing the inventory of critical drugs required for providers to adequately treat the virus. As soon as evidence surfaces to support a potential treatment, pharmacies begin procuring the drug, and global demand starts to increase. Some drugs that have been in high demand in association with COVID-19 include albuterol metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and sedation medications.\nDrugs in Demand for COVID-19 Treatment\nAlbuterol MDIs: Treatment of COVID-19 often involves the use of bronchodilators owing to the specific lung cells targeted by the virus. Given that nebulizers increase the generation of aerosolized virus in COVID-19 patients and potentially escalate the spread of the virus, MDI use is preferred. Inhaler shortages are occurring because of increased demand by hospitals for treatment of COVID-19.8 To combat potential shortages, hospitals can conserve supply by creating local policies that would allow patients to bring their inhaler supply from home to use during their inpatient stay.9 Another way to conserve supply is when an inpatient pharmacy dispenses an inhaler for hospital use, then gives it to the patient upon discharge, eliminating the need for the patient to obtain a new prescription from the outpatient pharmacy.9 The possibility of using one MDI for multiple patients has been discussed. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) currently recommends against a common MDI-canister protocol.9 Common canister protocol involves using the same MDI for multiple patients by disinfecting the MDI mouthpiece with an alcohol pad before inserting it into a patient-specific spacer with a one-way valve, administering the medication, and disinfecting the MDI mouthpiece after use.9 Studies have found rates of bacterial contamination on the disinfected mouthpiece of up to 5%.9 The ISMP states that using a common canister for patients on isolation or those who are immunocompromised may not be appropriate and that the methods in previous studies have been aimed at preventing bacterial contamination, which would not be applicable to COVID-19.9 Given the elevated demand for MDIs because of COVID-19, it is imperative that pharmacists consider their current inventory and plan to conserve supplies if needed.\nAzithromycin: Azithromycin has been used as adjunctive therapy to provide antibacterial coverage and potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of some viral respiratory tract infections.10 Many trials are testing the effect of azithromycin in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients.10 The increasing number of reports on azithromycin has led to an increased demand for the drug. On April 14, 2020, the FDA reported that there was currently a shortage of azithromycin owing to high demand.11 Although the intention to acquire supplies to keep on hand in case of a COVID-19 surge is laudable, it is important to remember that in 2018 the United States dispensed 38.5 million azithromycin prescriptions for conditions other than COVID-19.12 In order to reserve a supply of azithromycin, it is imperative that pharmacists practice good antibiotic stewardship and ensure that patients who receive azithromycin have an appropriate indication. In the U.S. alone, the CDC estimates that at least 30% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, commonly being written for viral respiratory infections when therapy is not indicated.13 Some other examples of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing include the use of non\u2013first-line antibiotics and the use of an antibiotic with excessively broad-spectrum activity for which a narrow-spectrum drug could be substituted.13 Pharmacists should review all azithromycin prescriptions to ensure that there is a proper indication and, when appropriate, recommend other proven therapy alternatives in order to help conserve the azithromycin supply.\nHydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are indicated for a very small population of patients with uncommon conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria. Therefore, typical purchasing quantities are minimal. However, COVID-19 research involving hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine has heightened the demand for these drugs. Many small trials began testing the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients because their mechanisms of action include targeting of lysosome, which can control graft-versus-host disease; inhibition of entry of the virus; prevention of virus cell fusion; anti-inflammatory effects; and reduction of cytokine storm.10 On March 20, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile to be used by licensed healthcare providers to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19.14 An analysis of outpatient retail pharmacy transaction data found that the prescribing of these drugs increased from 383,435 prescriptions in February 2020 to 759,186 prescriptions in March 2020.14 With demand doubling over 1 month, shortages followed, and the FDA published information on the shortages on March 31, 2020.15 In response, certain state boards of pharmacy established new rules to control use by requiring a diagnosis for the indicated disease to be written on the prescription, placing quantity limits for COVID-19 prescriptions, and restricting refills.16 On June 15, 2020, the FDA rescinded its EUA because the federal COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel issued recommendations against the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 and noted that, at the time, no medication could be recommended for COVID-19 preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis outside the clinical-trial setting.14 Following the release of this information, dispensing trends began to return to prepandemic levels, and the shortage resolved in late June 2020.14\nSedation Medications: COVID-19 can result in acute respiratory distress, and in extreme cases it requires the use of mechanical ventilation. Anticipation of an increase in mechanically ventilated patients and heightened demand for analgesics, sedatives, and paralytics created the perfect conditions for drug shortages. One way to save drug product is to minimize waste. Inpatient pharmacies should consider purchasing or compounding smaller drug volumes, when applicable, in order to minimize waste. Pharmacists should also review current hospital protocols and work with key stakeholders to make contingency plans for shortages of sedation medications. Traditionally, IV administration of opioids is preferred in mechanically ventilated patients; however, to conserve resources and keep opioid use to a minimum, hospitals can establish protocols for intermittent bolus analgesia, enteral administration of opioids, or implementation of adjuvant therapies.17 In ventilated patients, light sedation\u2014which helps conserve drug supply\u2014is preferred over deep sedation.17 Nonbenzodiazepine sedatives such as propofol and dexmedetomidine are preferred, but contingencies should be put in place to use other agents, such as ketamine, benzodiazepines, and pentobarbital.17 Awakening trials with reassessment of sedation needs should be performed daily. This practice may result in a reduction in sedation requirements while effectively conserving drug supply.17 In addition to analgesics and sedatives, some patients with COVID-19 will require paralytics. In order to conserve resources, hospital guidelines should be established for the use of continuous infusion versus intermittent bolus use of paralytic agents.17 In general, when a drug shortage arises, it is imperative that pharmacists familiarize themselves with all alternative products and assist in creating contingency plans.\nPatient Safety During a Drug Shortage\nA drug shortage commonly requires the substitution of an item that is ordered, prepared, or dispensed differently than the standard product. When prescribing practices switch to less-familiar alternative agents\u2014especially those that are less efficacious, have a worse adverse-effect profile, or require an unusual or difficult dosing regimen\u2014medication errors are more likely to occur.18 To minimize medication errors and maximize patient safety, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) guidelines on managing drug-product shortages recommend implementing a drug-product shortage team, creating a resource-allocation committee, and establishing a process for approving alternative therapies and addressing ethical considerations.18 The product-shortage team would have multiple responsibilities, including the purchasing of alternative agents, decisions on conserving or rationing supplies, implementation of technology updates, and communication of changes.18 The resource-allocation committee would create a framework for rationing drug resources in advance, thereby eliminating the need for bedside decisions during a shortage.18 The final ASHP recommendation is to have a process in place for approving alternative therapies and addressing ethical considerations. A multidisciplinary team would be responsible for establishing ethical procedures and protocols before they are needed in order to ensure that the rationing of life-saving drugs reflects the fundamental healthcare principles of justice, beneficence, and nonmaleficence.18\nThe overarching recommendation for preventing medication errors and ensuring patient safety is to focus on communicating information about the drug shortage. Communication updates should include all pertinent information about the shortage, such as the drug affected and the substitution or rationing plan.18 If a new drug is being selected, educational references about prescribing differences should be distributed, and pharmacists should be prepared to answer questions about the new agent. When information is being disseminated, it is important to include all potential stakeholders across all shifts. With drug shortages on the rise during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that the pharmacy profession take a proactive leadership role in developing and implementing processes to address drug shortages and ensure patient safety.\nConclusion\nThe pharmacy profession has been dealing with drug shortages for years. However, no past experience could have adequately prepared pharmacists for the drug shortages and unprecedented high demand resulting from the extensive disruptions caused by COVID-19. The pandemic crippled the global drug-supply chain by leading to factory closings, limited access to raw materials, and altered import and export rates of final dosage forms. With an inadequate supply chain and high demand worldwide, prescription drug shortages became a common topic in the pharmacy realm. Fear of not having enough supplies to battle the virus motivated pharmacy personnel to change current practices by initiating local policy changes, focusing on antibiotic stewardship, and implementing quantity limits in order to conserve drug stock. Overall, the need to combat historic drug shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to innovation and critical thinking in an effort to conserve valuable supplies without sacrificing patient safety under less-than-ideal circumstances. Pharmacists are indispensable during a drug shortage because of their unique skills and ability to bridge shortage gaps with effective action plans that will not imperil patient safety.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Even the \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008, which affected trade in many other products, did not cause a fall in exports or imports. With exports increasing more than imports, the trade surplus increased from C 18 billion in 2002 to a record high of C 174 billion in 2022 but fell to C 158 billion in 2023.\nFigure 1: EU trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Increasing share in total trade In 2023, the share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade was 7.8% with the share for imports (4.7%) much smaller than the share for exports (10.8%). Between 2002 and 2008 these shares remained fairly stable (Figure 2). In 2009, the share of imports increased by 1.3 percentage points (pp) and exports by 1.6 pp.\nThis was not caused by an increase in trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products but rather by the decline in total trade. Since 2009, the shares have been \ufb02uctuating but there is a clear overall growth.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 2 Figure 2: Share of medicinal and pharmaceutical products in total extra-EU trade, 2002-2023 (% in total trade) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) United States and Switzerland remain the top EU partners The United States stands out as the EU\u2019s main trading partner for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in 2023 (Figure 3). Exports to the United States (33 %) were almost a third of all EU exports and were followed at some distance by Switzerland (15 %) and China (8 %). Imports to the EU were dominated even more by the United States (39 %) and Switzerland (32 %) followed by the United Kingdom (7 %). Since the United States and Switzerland are by far the two largest trade partners, the development of their trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products with the EU is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 3 Figure 3: Main EU partners for trade of medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2023 (%) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade with the United States and Switzerland between 2002 and 2023 Figure 4 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and the United States from 2002 to 2023. Between 2022 and 2023, imports from the United States increased by 19.3% while exports decreased by 1.5%. This caused the trade balance to fall from C 54 billion in 2022 to C 45 billion in 2023.\nMeasured as average annual growth between 2002 and 2023, exports increased by 8.8 % per year and imports increased by 7.2 % per year. During the whole period the EU has had a trade surplus with the United States, peaking at C 54 billion in 2022.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 4 Figure 4: EU trade with the United States in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Figure 5 shows the development of trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products between the EU and Switzerland from 2002 to 2023. In 2023, for the \ufb01rst time in the period under investigation, exports (C 43 billion) were larger than imports (C 38 billion), causing the trade de\ufb01cit of C 1 billion in 2022 to turn into a surplus of C 4 billion in 2023. Over the whole period between 2002 and 2023, measured as average annual growth, exports increased by 10.0 % per year, while imports increased by 7.3 % per year.\nInternational trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 5 Figure 5: EU trade with Switzerland in medicinal and pharmaceutical products, 2002-2023 (C billion) Source: Eurostat (online data code: DS-018995) Trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products by EU Member State The share of intra EU imports in total (intra + extra) imports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products varied greatly between EU countries in 2023 (Figure 6).

Four countries had shares higher than 20 % for medicinal and pharmaceutical products in their total extra-EU exports. These were Slovenia (59 %), Ireland (33 %), Denmark (27 %) and Belgium (25 %).\nBelgium (C 26 billion), Germany (C 20 billion) and the Netherlands (C 16 billion) were the largest importers of medicinal and pharmaceutical products from countries outside the EU, in 20231.

This code allows the reader to easily access the most recent EU data on the Eurostat website. Note that data on the website is frequently updated and may also be more detailed or have a different measurement unit. It should also be noted that European statistics on international trade in goods are compiled according to the EU concepts and de\ufb01nitions and may, therefore, differ from national data published by EU countries.\nProduct classi\ufb01cation Division 54 \u2019Medicinal and pharmaceutical products\u2019 of the Standard international trade classi\ufb01cation revision 4 (SITC Rev. 4), is made up of the sub-groups: \u2022 5411 \u2019Provitamins and vitamins (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5413 \u2019Antibiotics (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5414 \u2019Vegetable alkaloids (not put up as medicaments)\u2019; \u2022 5415 \u2019Hormones, prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes\u2019; \u2022 5416 \u2019Glycosides; glands or other organs; antisera, vaccines; International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 9 \u2022 5419 \u2019Pharmaceutical goods, other than medicaments\u2019; \u2022 5421 \u2019Medicaments containing antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5422 \u2019Medicaments containing hormones, etc., but not antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5423 \u2019Medicaments containing alkaloids, but not containing hormones etc. or antibiotics\u2019; \u2022 5429 \u2019Medicaments not elsewhere speci\ufb01ed\u2019.\nUnit of measure Trade values are expressed in millions (106) or billions (109) of euros. They correspond to the statistical value, i.e.\nto the amount which would be invoiced in case of sale or purchase at the national border of the reporting country. It is called a FOB value (free on board) for exports and a CIF value (cost, insurance, freight) for imports.\nA bias in the geographical allocation of extra-EU \ufb02ows Extra-EU imports and exports are reported by the Member State where the customs declaration is lodged, usually the place where the goods cross the EU external frontier (here referred to as the exit/entry Member State). This is not necessarily the Member State of actual import or export. The geographical allocation of an extra-EU \ufb02ow is biased in the case where the entry/exit Member State is not the actual importing/exporting Member State. In such a case, the extra-EU trade will be allocated to the entry/exit Member State and the actual importing/exporting Member State will report only intra-EU \ufb02ows with the exit/entry Member State. This issue particularly impacts the extra-EU imports of EU countries having important ports for transshipment of goods like Antwerp in Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. This is why it is known as the \u2019Rotterdam effect\u2019.\nThe United Kingdom is considered as an extra-EU partner country for the EU for the whole period covered by this article. However, the United Kingdom was still part of the internal market until the end of the transitory period (31 December 2020), meaning that data on trade with the United Kingdom are still based on statistical concepts applicable to trade between the EU countries. Consequently, while imports from any other extra-EU trade partner are grouped by country of origin, the United Kingdom data re\ufb02ect the country of consignment. In practice this means that the goods imported by the EU from the United Kingdom were physically transported from the United Kingdom but part of these goods could have been of other origin than the United Kingdom. For this reason, data on trade with the United Kingdom are not fully comparable with data on trade with other extra-EU trade partners.\nContext Pharmaceutical products are among the most important products within the chemicals sector (SITC section 5).\nToday, the pharmaceutical sector is extensively regulated at EU level in the dual interest of ensuring the highest possible level of public health and patient con\ufb01dence in safe, effective and high-quality medicinal products, while continuing to develop a single EU market for pharmaceuticals in order to strengthen the European pharmaceutical industry\u2019s competitiveness and research capability.\nThe most common trade impediments faced by pharmaceutical exporters are a range of burdensome and costly registration, licensing and certi\ufb01cation procedures. The EU aims to redress these through its bilateral trade agreements or by tackling individual barriers as part of its market access partnership.\nOther articles \u2022 International trade in goods - other articles International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 10 Dedicated section International trade in goods - dedicated section Database International trade in goods - database Data visualisations \u2022 International trade in goods - visualisations Methodology International trade in goods - methodology Legislation \u2022 International trade in goods - legislation External links \u2022 European Commission - DG Trade Notes International trade in medicinal and pharmaceutical products 11",

Collectively, that leading cohort of international buyers paid for 43.9% of globally imported drugs and medicines during 2023. That percentage indicates a relatively concentrated market of buyers worldwide.From a continental perspective, European countries were responsible for over half (53.8%) of spending on drugs and medicines imported during 2023 with pharmaceutical purchases valued at $268 billion. In second place were North American importers at 20.7% while another 17.4% of imported pharmaceuticals was delivered to customers in Asia.Smaller percentages were delivered to Latin America (3.9%) excluding Mexico but including the Caribbean, Africa (2.7%), then Oceania (1.5%) led by Australia and New Zealand.The metrics below combine subtotals for two 4-digit Harmonized Tariff System code prefixes for drugs and medicine subcategories, specifically prefixes 3003 (consisting of 2 or more constituents mixed together) and 3004 (other).Drugs and Medicines: Top 15 Importer CountriesBelow are the 15 countries that imported the highest dollar value worth of drugs and medicines during 2023.United States: US$89.8 billion (18% of imported prescription drugs and medicines)Switzerland: $40.5 billion (8.1%)Germany: $32.5 billion (6.5%)Belgium: $31.3 billion (6.3%)mainland China: $24.5 billion (4.9%)Italy: $20.6 billion (4.1%)France: $18.4 billion (3.7%)United Kingdom: $16.8 billion (3.4%)Japan: $15.9 billion (3.2%)Netherlands: $15.8 billion (3.2%)Spain: $14.9 billion (3%)Canada: $11.5 billion (2.3%)Russia: $8.7 billion (1.7%)Slovenia: $7.5 billion (1.5%)Poland: $6.9 billion (1.4%)By value, the listed 15 countries purchased 71.4% of all prescription drugs and medicines imports in 2023.Among the above countries, the fastest-growing markets for prescription drugs and medicines since 2019 were: Slovenia (up 92.6%), Switzerland (up 90.4%), Netherlands (up 55.9%) and Spain (up 38.5%).Three major markets that posted declines in their imported prescription drugs and medicines purchases were: Russia (down -16.9% from 2022), United Kingdom (down -10.6%) and Japan (down -6.4%).Drugs and Medicines: All Importer Countries in 2023By value, the 100 key countries showcased in the following automated database bought 98.5% of imported pharmaceutical drugs and medicines purchased in 2023.RankImporterDrugs & Medicines%2019-231.United States$89,784,868,000+13.3%2.Switzerland$40,508,742,000+90.4%3.Germany$32,470,160,000+4.7%4.Belgium$31,341,161,000+33%5.mainland China$24,543,916,000+14.1%6.Italy$20,578,736,000+20.4%7.France$18,352,469,000+15.5%8.United Kingdom$16,789,558,000-10.6%9.Japan$15,874,455,000-6.4%10.Netherlands$15,846,137,000+55.9%11.Spain$14,915,496,000+38.5%12.Canada$11,528,660,000+35.5%13.Russia$8,677,211,000-16.9%14.Slovenia$7,547,471,000+92.6%15.Poland$6,943,402,000+33.5%16.Australia$6,060,842,000+13.3%17.Ireland$5,971,430,000+39.2%18.Czech Republic$5,412,484,000+26.1%19.South Korea$5,334,372,000+30.1%20.Brazil$5,073,335,000+31.7%21.Austria$4,648,764,000+22.6%22.Mexico$4,533,840,000+60.3%23.Romania$4,300,172,000+40.3%24.Taiwan$4,166,141,000+35%25.Denmark$3,872,409,000+17.6%26.Saudi Arabia$3,666,414,000-11.9%27.Sweden$3,346,424,000+17.1%28.Egypt$3,275,554,000+51.4%29.Hungary$3,074,217,000+6.7%30.Greece$2,987,559,000+35.3%31.Hong Kong$2,983,988,000+34.1%32.Portugal$2,755,852,000+20.3%33.United Arab Emirates$2,429,182,000-25.6%34.T\u00fcrkiye$2,344,378,000-13.2%35.Colombia$2,301,768,000+46.5%36.Panama$2,119,079,000+26%37.Thailand$2,088,829,000+20.6%38.Slovakia$2,068,323,000+29.7%39.Singapore$1,923,068,000+20%40.Israel$1,897,285,000+9.4%41.Finland$1,870,201,000+17.1%42.Vietnam$1,819,464,000-32.6%43.Bulgaria$1,763,585,000+37.7%44.Ukraine$1,733,174,000+1%45.South Africa$1,731,505,000-3%46.Norway$1,705,741,000+10.1%47.Philippines$1,705,359,000+23.8%48.Kazakhstan$1,447,313,000+63.6%49.Chile$1,444,123,000+33.2%50.Lithuania$1,375,341,000+32.5%51.India$1,360,321,000-0.6%52.Argentina$1,266,289,000+10.1%53.Serbia$1,258,935,000+56.6%54.Malaysia$1,236,736,000-10.2%55.Croatia$1,157,943,000+30.7%56.New Zealand$1,021,456,000+58.8%57.Ecuador$1,009,529,000+40.5%58.Dominican Republic$903,093,000+50.5%59.Algeria$890,666,000-26.8%60.Indonesia$824,449,000+32.5%61.Guatemala$823,646,000+50.9%62.Latvia$793,096,000+30%63.Iraq$781,840,000-22.3%64.Uzbekistan$725,626,000-12.1%65.Costa Rica$676,671,000+16%66.Peru$670,747,000+15.8%67.Estonia$653,465,000+34.8%68.Luxembourg$627,835,000+39.8%69.Nigeria$616,888,000-31%70.Morocco$590,242,000+28.4%71.Jordan$549,354,000+23.2%72.Kuwait$524,991,000-49.5%73.Honduras$524,968,000+20.4%74.Sri Lanka$518,445,000+32.9%75.El Salvador$503,492,000+28.6%76.Tunisia$480,237,000+9.7%77.Iran$472,615,000-46.3%78.Azerbaijan$461,973,000+76.6%79.Ethiopia$460,848,000-17.4%80.Kenya$452,729,000-4.2%81.Belarus$448,584,000-24.7%82.Cyprus$431,955,000+61%83.Georgia$427,490,000+32.2%84.Nicaragua$419,879,000+30%85.Ivory Coast$403,719,000+16.7%86.Macao$378,970,000+63.3%87.Malta$371,918,000+50.8%88.Pakistan$365,901,000-22.4%89.Bosnia/Herzegovina$363,769,000+26.8%90.Myanmar$353,747,000-21.1%91.Qatar$352,935,000-23.8%92.Tanzania$328,493,000+31.2%93.Cambodia$268,915,000+39.6%94.Democratic Rep.

      "Skip links\nWorld's Top ExportsTrade metrics that inspire global thinking\nTrade metrics that inspire global thinking\nHeader Right\nImports of Drugs and Medicines by Country\nby Daniel Workman \nPharmaceuticals closeupWorldwide purchases of imported pharmaceutical drugs and medicines cost a total US$498 billion in 2023.Overall spending on pharmaceutical drugs and medicine imports increased by an average 19.1% for all importer countries since 2019 when import purchases of drugs and medicines were valued at $418.1 billion.Year over year, international purchases of exported drugs and medicines flatlined via a 0.2% compared to $497.1 billion in 2022.The world\u2019s 5 biggest importers of pharmaceutical medicines are the United States of America, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and mainland China.

      "Medicare Drug Prices Are Changing: What to Know\nMedicare released its new drug prices for 2026, and many of the costliest prescriptions are set to be lowered for Americans who rely on the government health insurance.\nPresident Joe Biden has approved deals with drug companies to lower the costs of 10 of Medicare's most common and expensive drugs.\nThe Biden administration said that the new prices would save taxpayers about $6 billion, while the seniors on Medicare could save $1.5 billion on their prescriptions.\n\"For years, millions of Americans were forced to choose between paying for medications or putting food on the table, while Big Pharma blocked Medicare from being able to negotiate prices on behalf of seniors and people with disabilities. But we fought back\u2014and won,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\"Today, for the first time in history, my Administration is announcing that Medicare has reached agreements on new, lower prices with the manufacturers of all 10 drugs selected for the first round of drug price negotiation.\"\nThe affected medications include those Americans use to manage diabetes, cancer and heart disease, which affect millions each year.\nFor the 10 medications, Medicare recipients will save between 38 and 79 percent starting in 2026. The drugs include Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp.\nBlood clot medications Eliquis and Xarelto went down to $231 and $197, while diabetes medications got major savings too.\nJardiance, Januvia, Farxiga and Fiasp shaved hundreds off their list prices for 2026, now costing between $100 and $200 compared to previous costs above $500 for a 30-day supply.\nThe full list of price changes was announced on the White House website.\nAltogether, more than 67 million Americans rely on Medicare for their health coverage, but high drug prices and premiums have made health care unaffordable for many.\n\"It's a relief for the millions of seniors that take these drugs to treat everything from heart failure, blood clots, diabetes, arthritis, Crohn's disease, and more\u2014and it's a relief for American taxpayers,\" Biden said.\nMedicare previously said blood thinners Xarelto and Eliquis would see lower prices because of the new deals, alongside diabetes medications Jardiance and Januvia.\nPreviously, the U.S. government was not permitted to negotiate with Big Pharma over drug prices, though private insurers always had this ability.\n\"This meant that drug companies could basically charge whatever they want for lifesaving treatments people rely on, and all Americans paid the price,\" White House adviser Neera Tanden said in a media call on Wednesday evening.\nPharmaceutical companies have not been pleased with Biden's price negotiations and pushed against the Inflation Reduction Act, which made the negotiations law.\nWhile the first 10 selected drug prices aren't set to change until 2026, the U.S. government can pick another 15 medications to negotiate on next year.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the negotiations would save the government $25 billion in the next seven years.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act also instituted a cap on out-of-pocket drug costs, which is set to start in 2025. Next year, seniors can expect to pay a maximum of $2,000 for their prescriptions.\n\"As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare Part D has become a stronger safety net for Medicare beneficiaries who need expensive medications,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst for medicareresources.org, told Newsweek. \"This will provide significant financial relief to enrollees who used to spend far more than that for their medications.\"\nWith the lower costs on prescriptions, there is some concern that those costs could be passed on to Medicare premium prices. Likely in an effort to mitigate some of those issues, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is paying an extra $15 per member per month to insurers.\n\"Some Republican lawmakers are challenging the premium stabilization program, alleging that it should have required congressional approval,\" Norris said. \"But the implementation of this program should ensure that people with Medicare Part D continue to have multiple affordable options for 2025.\"\nOpen enrollment for Medicare begins October 15 and runs to December 7, with all plan selections taking effect in January.\n\"It's a big win for Medicare recipients. One of the concerns going into these negotiations was that a deal wouldn't be reached, and a few of these drugs wouldn't have the same amount of coverage many need,\" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek.\n\"Even if you don't use one of the drugs covered, it's an encouraging sign,\" he added. \"With an increasing older population in America, more taxpayers are going to join Medicare in the coming years. The government taking a more proactive approach to negotiations to cover drug prices is one current and future recipients will be thankful for.\"\nUpdate 8/15/24, 10:18 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nTop stories\n\nTrump Is Picking the 'Avenger Squad' for Cabinet, Charlie Kirk Says\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nTrump Allies React to Biden Allowing Ukraine to Hit Russia With US ATACMS\n\nTrump Picks FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr To Lead the Agency\nAbout the writer\nSuzanne Blake is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

JAMA Netw Open. 2024;7(5):e2411006. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.11006\n\u00a9 2024 \nTelehealth Expansion and Medicare Beneficiaries\u2019 Care Quality and Access\nQuestion\u00a0\r\n    Was telehealth use associated with quality, access, and cost of care outcomes for fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries during the COVID-19 telehealth expansion?\nFindings\u00a0\r\n    This cohort study compared 3436 hospital service areas (including approximately 30 million Medicare beneficiaries) with different levels of telehealth use in a difference-in-differences analysis framework. Compared with areas with low telehealth use, high telehealth use was associated with more ambulatory care\u2013sensitive (ACS) hospitalizations (1.63 additional hospitalizations per 1000 beneficiaries per semester), no additional emergency department visits, more clinician encounters (0.30 additional clinician encounters per beneficiary per semester), and higher total cost of care ($164.99 higher cost per beneficiary per semester).\nMeaning\u00a0\r\n    Data from the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that higher levels of telehealth use may be associated with increased access to care and potentially lower quality of care (evidenced by increases in ACS hospitalizations); replication of this analysis with post\u2013COVID-19 data is needed to fully understand the impacts of the telehealth expansion.\nImportance\u00a0\r\n    Understanding the association of telehealth use with health care outcomes is fundamental to determining whether telehealth waivers implemented during the COVID-19 public health emergency should be made permanent. The current literature has yielded inconclusive findings owing to its focus on select states, practices, or health care systems.\nObjective\u00a0\r\n    To estimate the association of telehealth use with outcomes for all Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries by comparing hospital service areas (HSAs) with different levels of telehealth use.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\u00a0\r\n    This US population-based, retrospective cohort study was conducted from July 2022 to April 2023. Participants included Medicare claims of beneficiaries attributed to HSAs with FFS enrollment in Parts A and B.\nExposures\u00a0\r\n    Low, medium, or high tercile of telehealth use created by ranking HSAs according to the number of telehealth visits per 1000 beneficiaries.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\u00a0\r\n    The primary outcomes were quality (ambulatory care\u2013sensitive [ACS] hospitalizations and emergency department [ED] visits per 1000 FFS beneficiaries), access to care (clinician encounters per FFS beneficiary), and cost (total cost of care for Part A and/or B services per FFS Medicare beneficiary) determined with a difference-in-difference analysis.\nResults\u00a0\r\n    In this cohort study of claims from approximately 30 million Medicare beneficiaries (mean [SD] age in 2019, 71.04 [1.67] years; mean [SD] percentage female in 2019, 53.83% [2.14%]) within 3436 HSAs, between the second half of 2019 and the second half of 2021, mean ACS hospitalizations and ED visits declined sharply, mean clinician encounters per beneficiary declined slightly, and mean total cost of care per beneficiary per semester increased slightly. Compared with the low group, the high group had more ACS hospitalizations (1.63 additional hospitalizations per 1000 beneficiaries; 95% CI, 1.03-2.22 hospitalizations), more clinician encounters (0.30 additional encounters per beneficiary per semester; 95% CI, 0.23-0.38 encounters), and higher total cost of care ($164.99 higher cost per beneficiary per semester; 95% CI, $101.03-$228.96). There was no statistically significant difference in ACS ED visits between the low and high groups.\nConclusions and Relevance\u00a0\r\n    In this cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries across all 3436 HSAs, high levels of telehealth use were associated with more clinician encounters, more ACS hospitalizations, and higher total health care costs. COVID-19 cases were still high during the period of study, which suggests that these findings partially reflect a higher capacity for providing health services in HSAs with higher telehealth intensity than other HSAs.\nMedicare\u2019s expansion of coverage for telehealth during the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE)1 led to sharply increased use of these services.2,3 Telehealth visits for Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries increased 63-fold in 2020, from approximately 840\u202f000 visits in 2019 to nearly 52.7 million visits in 2020.4 Telehealth use peaked in the second quarter of 2020 (47% of Medicare users with a telehealth service) and leveled off by the end of 2022 (15%).5 Nevertheless, compared with prepandemic levels, telehealth use remains remarkably high. Even though the PHE ended in May 2023, Congress extended many Medicare telehealth expansions through December 2024 to assess telehealth\u2019s impact on health care outcomes more thoroughly and to inform potential permanent changes to telehealth coverage policy.6\nThe current literature on the association of telehealth use with outcomes such as health care utilization and quality is small and has yielded mixed results. Depending on which health care system was analyzed, telehealth has been found to be associated with both no increase in utilization (with telehealth substituting for in-person visits)7 and increased primary care utilization.8 Similarly, some studies have found telehealth use to be associated with lower health care quality, whereas others have found the opposite. A study9 using data from 1 urban integrated academic health system in California found that telehealth encounters were associated with higher repeat hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits than in-person encounters, and another study10 using data from a single commercial payer found that telehealth visits require more follow-up for acute conditions than in-person encounters. However, a recent study11 of Medicare patients aged 65 years or older from an accountable care organization in the Midwest found no significant difference between telehealth and in-person encounters in terms of the number of days until the next visit or the probabilities of 3-day and 7-day follow-up visits. Another study12 documented a largely favorable association between telehealth exposure and the quality of primary care using electronic medical record data of commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid beneficiaries from more than 200 outpatient care sites in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Differences in telehealth protocols across health care systems may have contributed to the inconclusive findings.13 In addition, most published studies compare telehealth users with nonusers, attempting to control for confounders but acknowledging the inherent bias. As an exception, Li et al14 categorized practice-level telehealth into terciles using Michigan commercial payer data; they found that patients from practices with higher telehealth use had a higher rate of ambulatory care\u2013sensitive (ACS) hospitalizations and ED visits.\nThe objective of our study is to assess the association of telehealth expansion with health care outcomes among all Medicare FFS beneficiaries. This is an important contribution to the literature given the various methodological limitations of previous studies, which were generally small; focused on select states, practices, or health systems; and compared telehealth users with nonusers. We use a population-based difference-in-differences (DID) method to test whether the telehealth expansion is associated with improved quality and access to care, as well as lower health care costs. Some of the results of this analysis were included in the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) June 2023 Report to Congress.6\nIn this cohort study, we used a DID design to estimate the association of telehealth use with quality of care, access to care, and cost of care for FFS Medicare beneficiaries. The baseline period is the second semester of 2019 (before the PHE and the expansion of telehealth), and the treatment period is the second semester of 2021 (after COVID-19 vaccines were widely available and the expansion of telehealth). The study population includes all Medicare FFS beneficiaries who had Part A and B enrollment during the entire semester and were alive as of the first day of that semester. Data are aggregated at the hospital service area (HSA) level, which is the unit of analysis. HSAs are local health care markets that satisfy most of the residents\u2019 health care needs, including hospitalizations, and the outcomes we analyze are intended to assess quality and access provided by local health care systems.15 Aggregating to the HSA level also lessens concerns about selection bias from comparing telehealth users and nonusers. Beneficiaries are attributed to an HSA using the first zip code for that year and semester. Informed consent was not sought because the data used in this study do not involve human research participants, as defined in 45 CFR \u00a746.102(e). Because the study did not use identifiable private data, nor was there any intervention or interaction with participants, the study was determined to be exempt from institutional review board oversight by the American Institute for Research\u2019s institutional review board. This study conforms to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.16\nWe created 3 levels of intensity for the usage of telehealth services, our exposure variable, by ranking HSAs according to the number of telehealth visits per 1000 beneficiaries in the second half of 2021 (telehealth was restricted before the PHE). The outcomes are quality of care, including ACS hospitalizations and ED visits per 1000 FFS Medicare beneficiaries; access to care, including clinician encounters per FFS Medicare beneficiary, with a breakdown by clinician type; and total cost of care for Part A and Part B services per FFS Medicare beneficiary with a breakdown of cost by service type. Clinician encounters are office visits identified using the Carrier claim file (excluding ambulatory surgery center services). Each encounter is a unique combination of beneficiary identification, claim identification, and National Provider Identifier.\nWe controlled for the following HSA Medicare population characteristics: share of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in FFS Medicare; share of Medicare FFS beneficiaries by age, sex, race, and Medicaid eligibility; mean hierarchical condition category risk score (and its square); share of FFS beneficiaries attributed to alternative payment models; and mean Area Deprivation Index (ADI) for FFS Medicare beneficiaries. We also controlled for HSA market characteristics: population size and new (in a given semester) and cumulative (from the start of the PHE) COVID-19 cases per 10\u202f000 people.\nWe identified telehealth visits using the Carrier physician and outpatient claims Standard Analytic Files. Outcome variables were calculated using FFS Medicare claims and the Common Medicare Environment custom enrollment file. Beneficiary covariates were calculated using the Common Medicare Environment custom enrollment file, Risk Adjustment System data, and Master Data Management beneficiary extract. We obtained the ADI from the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health,17 population data from the US Census Bureau,18-20 and the number of COVID-19 cases from the New York Times database.21 For population size and COVID-19 cases, which are at the county level, we created a crosswalk between counties and HSAs. Data on race and ethnicity (Asian, Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White, unknown race, and any other race not otherwise specified) were obtained from Medicare enrollment files and are included in this study along with other demographic characteristics to control for changes over time within geographic areas that could confound the findings.\nThe analyses were conducted from July 2022 to April 2023 using StataMP version 16.1 (StataCorp). The Figure illustrates whether trends were parallel across groups by visually comparing outcome pretrends for the 3 treatment groups for 2018 and 2019. We analyzed descriptive statistics of demographic characteristics, comparing the second semester of 2019 and 2021, as well as across the 3 groups in the second semester of 2019. We conducted a linear regression with fixed-effects DID analysis that identifies the association of telehealth intensity by comparing the mean change in an outcome between 2019 and 2021 for HSAs with medium or high telehealth intensity with the mean change in that outcome for HSAs with low telehealth intensity during the same period. We adjusted for time-varying confounders using the covariates described earlier for 2019 and 2021. We estimated heteroskedastic robust SEs and clustered them at the HSA level. Statistical significance was defined as a 2-sided P\u2009<\u2009.05.\nWe conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, we controlled for geographic adjustment factors using the hospital wage index from the Inpatient Prospective Payment System and measures of geographic practice cost indexes, because Medicare payments change from year to year as a result of changes in geographic adjustment factors. Second, we controlled for in-person utilization because the association of telehealth usage may be confounded with that of general health care utilization. Third, we excluded small HSAs (with <500 beneficiaries) because ACS hospitalizations and ED visit rates calculated using a denominator with fewer than 500 beneficiaries have low reliability. Fourth, we used quartiles of telehealth usage to define treatment. Fifth, we ran separate estimates for rural and urban HSAs because the high telehealth intensity group has higher levels of urbanicity and because differences in outcomes could, thus, be due to differences in urbanicity levels rather than telehealth usage. In addition, we estimated a propensity score\u2013weighted DID, where weights were obtained using multinomial logistic regression that estimated the probability of an HSA having low, medium, or high telehealth intensity on the basis of its observed characteristics during the second semester of 2019. Propensity score weighting makes low, medium, and high groups more comparable on observed characteristics and, presumably, on unobserved confounders as well.\nIn the 3436 HSAs analyzed, the sample declined from 31\u202f625\u202f338 beneficiaries in 2019 to 29\u202f335\u202f407 beneficiaries in 2021, mostly owing to increasing Medicare Advantage enrollment (mean [SD] age in 2019, 71.04 [1.67] years; mean [SD] percentage female in 2019, 53.83% [2.14%]). Nonetheless, the characteristics of beneficiaries in the sample were largely unchanged (Table 1).\nThe mean telehealth visits per 1000 FFS Medicare beneficiaries were 174 visits in the low intensity group, 311 in the medium intensity group, and 679 in the high telehealth intensity groups. The terciles were similar in terms of age and gender, but urbanicity and the ADI differed across groups. The high group was also more ethnically diverse and included a higher number of low-income beneficiaries (Table 2).\nBetween the second semester of 2019 and the second semester of 2021, mean ACS hospitalizations (\u22128.14 ACS hospitalizations per 1000 beneficiaries, 32.05% of the baseline rate) and ED visits (\u221212.12 ACS ED visits per 1000 beneficiaries per semester, 26.22% of the baseline rate) declined sharply, whereas the mean total cost of care per beneficiary per semester increased slightly ($424.54; 6.92% of the baseline rate). Mean clinician encounters per beneficiary declined slightly (\u22120.23 clinician encounters per beneficiary per semester; 2.72% of the baseline rate). The trends by tercile are shown in the Figure.\nTable 3 presents the DID regression results adjusted for covariates. Without adjusting for covariates, the high group had 1.39 additional ACS hospitalizations per 1000 beneficiaries (95% CI, 0.84-1.94 hospitalizations) compared with the low group. This difference remained mostly unchanged (1.63 additional hospitalizations; 95% CI, 1.03-2.22 hospitalizations) when we controlled for covariates (Table 3). Given the decline in ACS hospitalizations (Figure), this implies that mean ACS hospitalizations decreased in the high group but at a slower rate than in the low group. There was no statistically significant difference in ACS ED visits between the low and high groups, or between the low and medium groups for ACS hospitalizations or ED visits (Table 3).\nThe unadjusted difference between the medium and low groups in mean total clinician encounters per beneficiary per semester was not statistically significantly different from 0 (0.00; 95% CI, \u22120.04 to 0.04). After adjusting for covariates, there was still no statistically significant difference between the medium and low groups in total clinician encounters (Table 3). However, the medium group had a 0.04 increase in encounters (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.05 encounters) with advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) and physician assistants (PAs) compared with the low group. This was offset by a 0.03 decrease in encounters with specialists (95% CI, \u22120.07 to 0.00 encounters), which likely explains the absence of a statistically significant association for encounters with all types of clinicians.\nUnadjusted, the high group had an additional 0.10 mean total clinician encounters per beneficiary per semester (95% CI, 0.06-0.14 encounters) than the low group. After controlling for covariates, the high group had an increase of 0.30 clinician encounters per beneficiary per semester (95% CI, 0.23-0.38 encounters), which is 2.67% of the baseline rate. Although the analysis shows that the largest increases in the level of clinician encounters occurred among specialists, for whom encounters increased by 0.09 per beneficiary (95% CI, 0.05-0.13 encounters), this was the smallest change relative to the baseline rate (1.49%). The largest increases for the high telehealth intensity HSAs come from hospitalist encounters, which increased by 0.03 (95% CI, 0.02-0.04 encounters; 7.11% of the baseline rate). Similarly, encounters with APRNs and PAs, primary care physicians, and other practitioners (including psychologists and social workers) all increased: 6.60% for APRNs and PAs and 4.00% for other practitioners (Table 3).\nThere was no statistically significant difference in total cost of care per beneficiary per semester whether or not we adjusted for covariates (\u2212$5.79; 95% CI, \u2212$64.59 to $53.00), but there were 2 significant changes to specific categories of costs (adjusted for covariates) that approximately offset one another. Home health costs decreased compared with the low group by $7.44 (95% CI, \u2212$12.31 to \u2212$2.56), whereas durable medical equipment (DME) costs increased by $3.35 (95% CI, \u2212$0.02 to $6.73). Although these estimates do not exactly offset one another, the resulting difference is not statistically significantly different from 0. The analysis shows no statistically significant difference between the medium and low groups for the cost of inpatient care, outpatient care, skilled nursing facility (SNF) care, hospice care, or physician services (Table 3).\nWithout adjusting for covariates, the difference in total cost of care between the high and low group was not statistically significantly different from 0 ($30.16; 95% CI, \u2212$22.64 to $82.97). After adjustment, the high group showed a statistically significant increase ($164.99 overall; 95% CI, $101.03 to $228.96; 2.47% of baseline) in total cost of care per beneficiary per semester. There were statistically significant increases in SNF care, DME, physician services, and inpatient care, whereas costs decreased for home health and outpatient care (Table 3). The analysis showed no statistically significant association with hospice care.\nThe statistically significant results were robust to all sensitivity analyses described in the Methods section, with only marginal differences (see eAppendixes 1 and 2 in Supplement 1 and eTables 1-12 in Supplement 2). The parallel trends assumption is satisfied for most, but not all, outcomes and/or preperiods. Full details are shown in eAppendix 3 in Supplement 1 and eTable 13 in Supplement 2. Means by HSA over time can be found in eTable 14 in Supplement 2.\nThis cohort study compared quality, access, and costs between the second half of 2019 and second half of 2021 for HSAs with different levels of telehealth intensity using Medicare administrative data for all FFS beneficiaries. We found mixed results.\nDuring the study period, there were large decreases in ACS hospitalizations overall, but less so in areas with high telehealth intensity compared with the low telehealth intensity areas. We found no association with ED visits. The finding for ACS hospitalizations necessitates a nuanced interpretation. In general, reduced ACS hospitalizations are considered evidence of improved quality; however, during the PHE, less reduction may have been a marker of hospital capacity. Our measures of ACS hospitalizations and ED visits may have been directly affected by the PHE. One study22 found that respiratory-related ACS hospitalizations declined substantially starting early in the pandemic (around March 2020) and continuing until the end of that study (March 2021), potentially confounding our results.\nWe found that HSAs with high telehealth intensity had increases in clinician encounters for all clinician types compared with the low telehealth intensity areas. Telehealth may have increased accessibility by enabling visits even if patients were unable or unwilling to go in person. The clinicians with the largest relative increases in the number of encounters were hospitalists (7.11%), APRNs and PAs (6.60%), and other practitioners (4.00%). HSAs with medium telehealth intensity saw no significant change in clinician encounters, except for increasing visits with APRNs and PAs. These findings suggest that telehealth maintained or increased access to care, but differentially by specialty. The relative increase in hospitalist visit rates in high telehealth areas may reflect the growth of this specialty.23 The other practitioners category includes clinicians such as psychologists, social workers, physical therapists, and podiatrists. Increased encounters with clinicians in this category in high telehealth areas likely relates to telehealth-associated mental health care access, especially in urban areas.24\nConsistent with increased clinician encounters, the high telehealth HSAs saw statistically significant increases in physician services cost. These HSAs also had statistically significant increases in SNF, DME, and inpatient care cost and statistically significant decreases in home health and outpatient care cost. Although increasing costs in more intensive inpatient care during the height of the pandemic makes sense, in medium HSAs, only DME costs increased significantly. The observed increase in inpatient care cost in high HSAs is consistent with the relative increase in ACS hospitalizations in those areas and may be another sign of higher capacity in these areas.\nThis study has limitations that should be mentioned. The use of data from the second half of 2021 prevents the measurement of postpandemic outcomes. This period overlapped with the surge in COVID-19 cases due to the Delta variant, which peaked in September 2021, and the beginning of the surge due to the Omicron variant. Therefore, we cannot determine the associations of telehealth with quality, access, and cost independently of the PHE. In particular, the finding that telehealth intensity was associated with more hospitalizations but not ED visits is likely affected by the PHE. For example, if a patient delayed care because of concerns about COVID-19 but then had a telehealth encounter because of an acute concern, they may have then sought and been admitted for inpatient care rather than further delaying care, adding to the ACS hospitalizations for the high telehealth intensity HSAs. The overall pattern during a period when there were fewer concerns and capacity limits to in-person care could look very different.\nIn this cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries within 3436 HSAs near the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency in the US, HSAs with the most telehealth usage improved access to care (as measured by clinician encounters at the HSA level) and attenuated the decline in ACS hospitalizations compared with other areas. Additional analysis using data from after the PHE and with alternative outcome measures could help produce estimates that, being subject to fewer confounding factors, better capture the potential beneficial effects of telehealth on the quality of care.\nAccepted for Publication: March 10, 2024.\nPublished: May 13, 2024. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.11006\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2024 Saharkhiz M et al.

      "Telemedicine Statistics \u2013 The Latest Telehealth Statistics in 2024\nIn this guide, we cover the main regional telemedicine markets, the most important telehealth use cases, and the key current and future trends in the field.\nTelemedicine statistics give us information about providing support and healthcare through electronic communication channels, like telephones and the internet. It\u2019s part of the digital transformation of healthcare and has been on the rise for the last few decades.\nIt was COVID-19, however, that really pushed telemedicine and remote clinical services into the spotlight. Around the world, medical professionals and patients relied on telehealth and virtual care to mitigate the risks of infection and optimize the resources of healthcare systems.\nAfter the pandemic, many facilities continued to offer remote healthcare services, and the market has been growing ever since.\nGiven these advancements and the considerable potential impact of telemedicine on healthcare, it\u2019s important to pay attention to telemedicine statistics and trends. Let\u2019s dive in.\nKey Telemedicine Statistics\nTelemedicine Market Size & Forecast\nAccording to Grand View Research, the telemedicine market was valued at almost $115 billion in 2023. The report forecasts it to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.96% between 2023 and 2030. Fortune Business Insights concurs with that assessment, predicting that the telemedicine market will reach $286.22 billion by 2030.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly contributed to the growth of the telemedicine market and the popularity of digital health solutions. Social distancing measures and the overwhelming impact on medical personnel meant that many routine appointments were canceled. Here\u2019s a quick overview of COVID-19\u2019s impact on telemedicine.\nTelemedicine and Covid-19\nA 2022 study by Kaiser Permanente tells us that before the start of the pandemic, telemedicine integration in the US was rudimentary, although 76% of American hospital systems did have some form of telehealth. However, in the first three months of the pandemic, telehealth insurance claims grew by 766%, and over 20% of all US medical appointments in 2020 were remote.\nMoreover, before COVID-19, 65% of American medical professionals had never used telemedicine, and 23% used it rarely.\nDuring the pandemic\u2019s peak, more than 97% of healthcare experts were using telemedicine. For 43%, half of their appointments were telehealth appointments. In terms of outlook, 44% of US doctors predict that between 10% and 49% of their future appointments will be through telehealth.\nTelemedicine Statistics by Region\nAs with most emerging technologies, regions use and develop telemedicine at different rates. In this section, we look at key telemedicine statistics in different parts of the world, including popularity and uptake, number of users, and consumer attitudes.\nNorth America\nNorth America is the largest telemedicine market in the world, with a share of 33.5%. That\u2019s hardly surprising since many telehealth companies have a presence in the region. Moreover, as of 2022, 22% of global telemedicine companies were looking to expand to Canada and 17% to the US.\nIn 2023, Canada\u2019s telehealth market revenue (including digital treatment and digital wellbeing) reached $2.42 billion,\u00a0roughly ~$100 million more than the year before. That revenue is forecast to hit $3.58 billion by 2028, as the significant growth is largely due to Canada\u2019s high telehealth literacy.\nAs of 2021, over 80% of physicians in the country had the expertise to provide virtual care, and 78% were satisfied by the level of patient support they could provide through this channel.\nIn the US, the telemedicine market was valued at $38.04 billion in 2022\u00a0and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15.1% until 2030. In 2023, 44% of physicians used it at least weekly\u00a0and 40% daily. For 65% of American physicians, 25% of all their appointments in 2022 were telehealth appointments.\nEurope\nThe European telemedicine market is almost on par with North America in terms of development and growth. As of 2022, 77% of European countries frequently used telemedicine, with COVID-19 contributing to its use. As our infographic shows, the Spanish telemedicine market had a significant boost during COVID-19.\nSpain is the largest telemedicine market in the EU. Almost 72% of Spanish residents had a telemedicine appointment during the pandemic. The market revenue was $270.2 million in 2022 and is projected to grow to $351.5 million by 2027.\nGiven that the number of telemedicine users in the country increased from 1.18 million in 2020 to 1.32 million in 2021 and is forecast to reach 1.41 million in 2027, such exponential growth isn\u2019t surprising. The average revenue per user (ARPU) in telemedicine is also forecast to grow from $209.5 in 2022 to $250 by 2027.\nThe UK isn\u2019t far behind. For instance, over 80% of patients in the UK\u00a0 had a telephone (22%) or a video consultation (59%) with their doctor during COVID-19. And in 2022, 28% of physicians saw at least 75% of their patients via telemedicine. In comparison, this was 2% in Germany and Sweden, and 1% in France.\nIn 2022, the British telehealth market was valued at $1.58 billion and is forecast to reach $16.2 billion by 2030. The main reasons are the ongoing healthcare crisis in the UK and the government\u2019s digitization efforts.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America (LATAM), Brazil has the largest telehealth market, which is not surprising, considering it\u2019s one of the most populated countries in the world. In 2020, there were around 2.46 million users of online medical consultations.\nThe number grew to 3.49 million in 2023 and is forecast to reach 4.25 million by 2028. The ARPU has been growing steadily since 2021 and is predicted to reach $292.81 in 2028.\nOther LATAM countries have somewhat smaller telemedicine markets. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the region\u2019s 2023 telemedicine market revenue and its forecast growth.\nAsia-Pacific\nThe Asia-Pacific (APAC) telemedicine market is experiencing significant growth. Before the pandemic, the region\u2019s telemedicine adoption rate was low: 5% in Australia, 29% in India, and non-existent in Malaysia. However, in 2024, the adoption rate is predicted to grow exponentially: 70% in Malaysia, 76% in China, and 56% in Australia.\nAPAC\u2019s telemedicine market size was approximately $16.8 billion in 2020, and it\u2019s forecast to more than double by 2025 ($37.1 billion). Japan is expected to see some of the largest growth, from $5.1 billion in 2023 to $7.1 billion in 2028.\nTelemedicine Statistics by Audience\nNow, let\u2019s look at two user groups in these global telemedicine markets: the patients and the medical professionals.\nWho Uses Telemedicine?\nAccording to 2021 research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US, 37% of adults used telemedicine, with slightly more females using it (42%) than males (31.7%). Regarding age, patients aged 65 and over used telemedicine the most (43.3%) and\u00a0Gen Z (18\u201325-year-olds) the least (29.4%) in 2021 .\nAn ASPE (a division of the US Department of Health and Human Services) study conducted a year later\u00a0shed more light on telemedicine users in 2022. It shows that 22.5% of adults and 18.1% of children in the US used telemedicine that year.\nLike the CDC study, the ASPE report found that Gen Z use telemedicine the least (17.6%)\u00a0and baby boomers (those aged 65+) the most (24.6%). In terms of income split, the highest percentage of telemedicine users in 2022 had an annual income of less than $25,000 (26.4%).\nBut what about other countries?\nIn Spain\u00a0more women used telemedicine (63.2%) than men (47.4%) in 2022, like the US. Again, similar to the US, Gen Z had the lowest rate of telemedicine use (49.1%). However, it was the millennials (aged 26\u201340) who used telemedicine most frequently (58%). For\u00a0baby boomers, the rate was 54.1%.\nAttitudes Towards Telemedicine\nAs with all innovations, people have varying opinions about telemedicine. In this section, we look at the statistics related to the opinions and attitudes of medical professionals and patients towards telemedicine.\nAs the above graph shows,\u00a0Australia had the highest percentage of physicians worldwide who were satisfied with telehealth in 2022. The potential for time saved using telemedicine was also highest in Australia in 2023 \u2013 up to six hours each year.\nIn fact, many physicians worldwide consider telemedicine a convenient solution. Almost 70% of American healthcare professionals perceived telemedicine as \u2018convenient\u2019 in 2021, and 35% as \u2018efficient.\u2019 Moreover, the lion\u2019s share of these physicians believe that ease of use is the key to ensuring patients\u2019 access to telemedicine.\nConvenience is also the prevalent factor among physicians in other countries. For instance, in Canada, 70% of healthcare professionals found providing video appointments very convenient, and 77% had the same opinion about telephone appointments. And 84% of physicians confirmed that telehealth made it easier for patients to access their care.\nPatients\u2019 attitudes towards telemedicine is moving in a positive direction. Before COVID-19, 66% of adults in the US had concerns about the quality of telemedicine. However, this changed after the pandemic, and as of 2021, 88% preferred to use telemedicine.\nMoreover, studies tell us that during COVID-19, patients\u2019 experiences with telehealth appointments were just as positive as or more positive than face-to-face healthcare appointments in the US.\nOf these appointments, patients tended to prefer video calls to telephone appointments. One study found that women preferred telehealth appointments for certain reproductive health issues.\nPatients in Mexico seem to concur. According to statistics from 2021, almost 80% of telemedicine users said telehealth appointments were just as good as in-person appointments. About one-third of people (27%) in Great Britain were skeptical of telemedicine before trying it.\nTop Telemedicine Use Case Statistics\nNow, let\u2019s take a closer look at why people use telemedicine. In this section, we\u2019ll delve into the most common use cases for telehealth appointments.\nDiagnostics & Follow-up Appointments\nThe most common reason people in the US used telemedicine in 2023 was follow-up appointments, which made up around 47% of all US telehealth appointments. It seems to be the convenience that people find attractive.\nIndeed, in a paper published in The American Journal of Managed Care, researchers stipulate that 52.5% of follow-up patients found telemedicine appointments more efficient.\nMental Health Support\nAnother common purpose of telehealth appointments is mental health support, used by over one-third of American telemedicine users between 2021 and 2023. These telemental health services improve access to mental healthcare for certain groups of people, but it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all solution, as it requires some technological literacy.\nChronic Conditions Support\nTelemedicine has been a game-changer for patients with chronic conditions. During COVID-19, telehealth was used by almost 50% of Europeans living with such conditions. In the US, physicians reported that 72% of their telehealth appointments were related to chronic care in 2021.\nIn addition to improving patients\u2019 quality of life, telemedicine is a significant time-saver for people with chronic illnesses. For instance, Italians with chronic pain could save up to 9.5 hours per year with telemedicine, more than in any other country. Germans and Australians with chronic conditions could save up to 7.4 hours.\nFuture Telemedicine Trends\nWhat is the future of telemedicine? Given that it\u2019s already making a huge difference to millions of people\u2019s lives, it\u2019s no surprise that the only way for telehealth is up.\nBut what are the trends shaping its development?\nIntegration With AI\nThe applications of AI in healthcare are boundless, and telemedicine is no exception. AI-powered apps can analyze huge amounts of patient data to help identify patterns and offer invaluable insights.\nChatbots and virtual assistants can enhance patient engagement by providing real-time responses to queries, helping schedule appointments, and setting reminders to take medication. Also, the diagnostics applications of AI can help save time and optimize physicians\u2019 workload.\nAugmented Reality & Virtual Reality\nTelemedicine doesn\u2019t just support patients, it can transform the day-to-day work of medical professionals. AR and VR can help professionals, especially those being trained, to engage in realistic medical simulations, such as surgeries and procedures.\nThese simulations can provide a valuable learning experience, boosting physicians\u2019 competence.\nRemote Patient Monitoring\nRemote patient monitoring (RPM) is a big deal in telemedicine, especially for patients with chronic illnesses. For example, integrating RPM with wearable technologies allows healthcare providers to monitor patients remotely and access up-to-date data, enabling them to provide the best patient care. It also allows real-time responses to help prevent complications.\nClosing Thoughts\nLike any other medtech innovation, telehealth\u2019s primary goal is to help people. During COVID-19, we were shown how well telemedicine can work on an unprecedented scale, leading to accelerated digital transformation in medical technologies. As of 2023, that market was worth more than $100 billion, and it continues to grow.\nIn this guide, we reviewed the key telemedicine markets, how they are growing, how patients and medical professionals perceive telemedicine, and the most common use cases.\nWe feel optimistic about the future of telemedicine, telehealth, and other medtech advancements. However, we also know that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution, and we look forward to seeing how innovators will bridge the gap that restricts access to telemedicine and other healthcare to various population groups.\nSources\nQuestion & Answers (0)\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

      "Telemedicine Statistics \u2013 The Latest Telehealth Statistics in 2024\nIn this guide, we cover the main regional telemedicine markets, the most important telehealth use cases, and the key current and future trends in the field.\nTelemedicine statistics give us information about providing support and healthcare through electronic communication channels, like telephones and the internet. It\u2019s part of the digital transformation of healthcare and has been on the rise for the last few decades.\nIt was COVID-19, however, that really pushed telemedicine and remote clinical services into the spotlight. Around the world, medical professionals and patients relied on telehealth and virtual care to mitigate the risks of infection and optimize the resources of healthcare systems.\nAfter the pandemic, many facilities continued to offer remote healthcare services, and the market has been growing ever since.\nGiven these advancements and the considerable potential impact of telemedicine on healthcare, it\u2019s important to pay attention to telemedicine statistics and trends. Let\u2019s dive in.\nKey Telemedicine Statistics\nTelemedicine Market Size & Forecast\nAccording to Grand View Research, the telemedicine market was valued at almost $115 billion in 2023. The report forecasts it to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.96% between 2023 and 2030. Fortune Business Insights concurs with that assessment, predicting that the telemedicine market will reach $286.22 billion by 2030.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly contributed to the growth of the telemedicine market and the popularity of digital health solutions. Social distancing measures and the overwhelming impact on medical personnel meant that many routine appointments were canceled. Here\u2019s a quick overview of COVID-19\u2019s impact on telemedicine.\nTelemedicine and Covid-19\nA 2022 study by Kaiser Permanente tells us that before the start of the pandemic, telemedicine integration in the US was rudimentary, although 76% of American hospital systems did have some form of telehealth. However, in the first three months of the pandemic, telehealth insurance claims grew by 766%, and over 20% of all US medical appointments in 2020 were remote.\nMoreover, before COVID-19, 65% of American medical professionals had never used telemedicine, and 23% used it rarely.\nDuring the pandemic\u2019s peak, more than 97% of healthcare experts were using telemedicine. For 43%, half of their appointments were telehealth appointments. In terms of outlook, 44% of US doctors predict that between 10% and 49% of their future appointments will be through telehealth.\nTelemedicine Statistics by Region\nAs with most emerging technologies, regions use and develop telemedicine at different rates. In this section, we look at key telemedicine statistics in different parts of the world, including popularity and uptake, number of users, and consumer attitudes.\nNorth America\nNorth America is the largest telemedicine market in the world, with a share of 33.5%. That\u2019s hardly surprising since many telehealth companies have a presence in the region. Moreover, as of 2022, 22% of global telemedicine companies were looking to expand to Canada and 17% to the US.\nIn 2023, Canada\u2019s telehealth market revenue (including digital treatment and digital wellbeing) reached $2.42 billion,\u00a0roughly ~$100 million more than the year before. That revenue is forecast to hit $3.58 billion by 2028, as the significant growth is largely due to Canada\u2019s high telehealth literacy.\nAs of 2021, over 80% of physicians in the country had the expertise to provide virtual care, and 78% were satisfied by the level of patient support they could provide through this channel.\nIn the US, the telemedicine market was valued at $38.04 billion in 2022\u00a0and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15.1% until 2030. In 2023, 44% of physicians used it at least weekly\u00a0and 40% daily. For 65% of American physicians, 25% of all their appointments in 2022 were telehealth appointments.\nEurope\nThe European telemedicine market is almost on par with North America in terms of development and growth. As of 2022, 77% of European countries frequently used telemedicine, with COVID-19 contributing to its use. As our infographic shows, the Spanish telemedicine market had a significant boost during COVID-19.\nSpain is the largest telemedicine market in the EU. Almost 72% of Spanish residents had a telemedicine appointment during the pandemic. The market revenue was $270.2 million in 2022 and is projected to grow to $351.5 million by 2027.\nGiven that the number of telemedicine users in the country increased from 1.18 million in 2020 to 1.32 million in 2021 and is forecast to reach 1.41 million in 2027, such exponential growth isn\u2019t surprising. The average revenue per user (ARPU) in telemedicine is also forecast to grow from $209.5 in 2022 to $250 by 2027.\nThe UK isn\u2019t far behind. For instance, over 80% of patients in the UK\u00a0 had a telephone (22%) or a video consultation (59%) with their doctor during COVID-19. And in 2022, 28% of physicians saw at least 75% of their patients via telemedicine. In comparison, this was 2% in Germany and Sweden, and 1% in France.\nIn 2022, the British telehealth market was valued at $1.58 billion and is forecast to reach $16.2 billion by 2030. The main reasons are the ongoing healthcare crisis in the UK and the government\u2019s digitization efforts.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America (LATAM), Brazil has the largest telehealth market, which is not surprising, considering it\u2019s one of the most populated countries in the world. In 2020, there were around 2.46 million users of online medical consultations.\nThe number grew to 3.49 million in 2023 and is forecast to reach 4.25 million by 2028. The ARPU has been growing steadily since 2021 and is predicted to reach $292.81 in 2028.\nOther LATAM countries have somewhat smaller telemedicine markets. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the region\u2019s 2023 telemedicine market revenue and its forecast growth.\nAsia-Pacific\nThe Asia-Pacific (APAC) telemedicine market is experiencing significant growth. Before the pandemic, the region\u2019s telemedicine adoption rate was low: 5% in Australia, 29% in India, and non-existent in Malaysia. However, in 2024, the adoption rate is predicted to grow exponentially: 70% in Malaysia, 76% in China, and 56% in Australia.\nAPAC\u2019s telemedicine market size was approximately $16.8 billion in 2020, and it\u2019s forecast to more than double by 2025 ($37.1 billion). Japan is expected to see some of the largest growth, from $5.1 billion in 2023 to $7.1 billion in 2028.\nTelemedicine Statistics by Audience\nNow, let\u2019s look at two user groups in these global telemedicine markets: the patients and the medical professionals.\nWho Uses Telemedicine?\nAccording to 2021 research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US, 37% of adults used telemedicine, with slightly more females using it (42%) than males (31.7%).

AI-powered apps can analyze huge amounts of patient data to help identify patterns and offer invaluable insights.\nChatbots and virtual assistants can enhance patient engagement by providing real-time responses to queries, helping schedule appointments, and setting reminders to take medication. Also, the diagnostics applications of AI can help save time and optimize physicians\u2019 workload.\nAugmented Reality & Virtual Reality\nTelemedicine doesn\u2019t just support patients, it can transform the day-to-day work of medical professionals.

      "\n    California Health Care Foundation\n  \n\n    Utility menu\n  \nThe Prognosis for Telehealth\nThe future of primary care could be a hybrid model of in-person and telehealth care, including both phone and video visits\nOne of the biggest shifts in health care that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic wasn\u2019t about vaccines or masks or monoclonal antibodies. In fact, it wasn\u2019t really about the SARS-CoV-2 virus at all. It was the dramatic growth of telehealth.\nBetween February and April 2020, telehealth visits for primary care, conducted either by phone or video, increased from zero to 148 visits per 1,000 patients at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in California, according to new research from the Santa Monica\u2013based RAND Corporation. In contrast, in-person care dropped from about 230 to 65 visits per 1,000 patients during that time, RAND found.\nBy the summer of 2021, the number of in-person visits at California FQHCs had rebounded to 66% of primary care appointments, but telehealth still composed about one-third of visits. Telehealth is even more prevalent in the behavioral health care realm, with 72% of appointments conducted either by phone or video as of August 2021.\n\u201cWe joke that a decade of telemedicine implementation happened in a week or two,\u201d said Lori Uscher-Pines, a RAND senior policy researcher. \u201cIt was amazing how quickly health systems and individual providers were able to start offering telehealth visits.\u201d\nThis rapid shift to telehealth is unsurprising, given the urgency of keeping patients and staff members safe during the pandemic. What remains to be seen is whether, once the dust settles and COVID-19 is deemed less of a threat, telehealth will be here to stay.\nThe findings of the RAND report suggest that while telehealth has a valuable role in increasing access to care, it should not serve as a blanket replacement for in-person visits. There were concerns over the efficacy of audio-only appointments, the difficulties in implementing video visits, and whether patients might be at risk of receiving inadequate care because of these technological challenges. As a result, a hybrid model, including in-person, video, and occasionally audio visits that caters to patients\u2019 individual needs, would likely be the best approach, the researchers said.\nOvercoming Barriers to Care\nA strong argument in favor of telehealth is that virtual visits, both audio and video, enhance equity by increasing accessibility and flexibility for patients. \u201cWe look at the many barriers that patients face in getting care \u2014 geography, transportation, childcare, getting time off work, language,\u201d said Chris Perrone, director of CHCF\u2019s Improving Access team, which funded RAND\u2019s research. \u201cTelehealth makes it easier to see or talk with a physician without having to find childcare, take a day off work, or travel long distances.\u201d\nThat expands access to care, Perrone said.\nHowever, there are questions about whether the level of care offered in telehealth visits is as effective and as high quality as in-person visits. Also, some visits must be conducted in person because of the need for a physical examination or the collection of lab samples and biometric information.\nBefore the pandemic, one of the biggest concerns about telehealth services was the rising costs of that approach to providing care. \u201cTelemedicine use was very restricted prior to the pandemic, both at the federal level and at the state level across the US,\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cA big concern was that offering telehealth would increase costs without necessarily improving population health. That\u2019s because telehealth is so easy to access and it\u2019s so convenient that it would lead to extra utilization that was not necessary.\u201d\nBefore the pandemic, Medicare and state Medicaid programs did not pay for telehealth visits except in specified situations. In March 2020, that policy quickly changed out of necessity. In March of this year, federal reimbursements for telehealth services were extended until at least the end of 2022 \u2014 and possibly longer \u2014 with the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In California, the Department of Health Care Services is committed to continue paying FQHCs for video and audio telehealth visits after the pandemic \u2014 covering all Medi-Cal covered benefits and services.\nPerceptions of Telehealth\nFacing this inflection point, CHCF commissioned several reports to assess the state of telehealth during the pandemic at California FQHCs, which serve people with low incomes and are primarily funded through reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid.\nAn assessment (PDF)\u00a0of 23 FQHCs\u2019 implementation of telehealth during the height of COVID-19, found that 86% of providers were satisfied with the work they performed via telehealth and 84% would continue providing telehealth after the pandemic subsides.\nA second report from RAND surveyed staff and providers at 45 FQHCs, public hospitals, and community health centers across the state, which serve a combined 1.7 million patients. It found that, overall, \u201cPerceptions of whether telehealth provided an acceptable level of care were relatively positive, but perceptions of its sustainability \u2014 as well as perceptions of equity and quality of care \u2014 were nuanced.\u201d\nWith hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.\n\u2014Lori Uscher-Pines, RAND Corporation\nTelehealth provided important access to care during the pandemic and helped patients overcome \u201cbarriers to in-person care, such as transportation,\u201d the report found. However, there were concerns about \u201cinequities in access, particularly for patients who were most affected by the digital divide.\u201d\nCHCF also funded other research that documents patient views on telehealth. A 2020 CHCF survey of people with low incomes found their telehealth visits compared favorably to in-person visits. Seventy-two percent of respondents who received care by phone were as satisfied or more satisfied. Of those who received care by video, 65% were as satisfied or more satisfied than with their last in-person visit.\nAudio-Only Versus Video Visits\nHealth care workers\u2019 biggest worry centered around phone versus video visits. Among the FQHCs that were part of RAND\u2019s recent analysis, less than 5% of telehealth visits were conducted via video, despite their advantages over audio-only visits in many cases. As a result, a major emphasis has been on how clinics can expand access to video visits for their patients.\n\u201cSurveys suggest that providers generally prefer video visits,\u201d said Uscher-Pines. \u201cThey get additional information \u2014 for example, just being able to see and visually examine the patient. Providers say they really like being able to see a patient\u2019s home environment and for the patient to open up their medicine cabinet and show what\u2019s in it.\u201d\nHowever, it\u2019s also true that many patients don\u2019t like video for this very reason \u2014 they don\u2019t want to let providers into their homes, particularly if they haven\u2019t developed a trusting relationship with the provider.\nNeighborhood Healthcare in San Diego County and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) were two FQHCs that invested in video telehealth early in the pandemic. They reported that there were considerable growing pains in getting both patients and physicians to use the technology.\nIt\u2019s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don\u2019t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is.\n\u2014Amanda Churape, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital\n\u201cWhat comes with integrating a new workflow is a lot of hesitancy, so our numbers were pretty low in the beginning,\u201d said Amanda Churape, a specialty care program manager at ZSFG. \u201cA lot of our providers and staff had actually never used Zoom or had never really had experience doing video, so there was a lot of training that needed to be done.\u201d\nSignificant numbers of patients and providers did not have a Zoom-compatible device at all, she said.\n\u201cWe started pushing very early on to go to video, and that was a challenge simply because those platforms, at that time, were just poorly developed,\u201d said Jeffrey Glenn, chief operating officer at Neighborhood. \u201cOur visits are 15 minutes apiece, so the providers would tell us, \u2018I can\u2019t spend 10 minutes trying to figure out how to connect the patient.\u2019 And so early on, they would give up quickly and they would say, \u2018I\u2019m just going to call you.\u2019\u201d\nRamping Up Capabilities\nTo assist with the transition to remote provider visits, CHCF \u2014 which had funded projects working to expand use of the model even before the pandemic \u2014 launched the $6 million Tipping Point for Telehealth Initiative to help FQHCs ramp up their digital capabilities. The initiative included a learning collaborative on how to provide telehealth most effectively, dubbed the Connected Care Accelerator, as well as grants to enable clinics to invest in training and equipment.\nClinics were given flexibility in how they used the money as long as they applied it to expanding their telehealth capacity. Some of the clinics used the money to hire a specialized coordinator, like Churape, who oversees a team of telehealth ambassadors who help set up patients for video visits. First, the ambassadors screen patients to see if they have a device with a camera and access to Wi-Fi or an unlimited data plan. Then the ambassadors teach the patient how to download the application, join the meeting, and troubleshoot audio and video issues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don\u2019t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is,\u201d Churape said. \u201cWhat took the most time is actually getting the patient onto the application, teaching them how to download the application, teaching them how to join a meeting.\u201d\nOther FQHCs, including Neighborhood, used the grant money to buy equipment like iPads and rolling workstations to provide virtual visits at their clinics. Medical assistants move the rolling video displays between exam rooms and queue up patient calls, allowing physicians to transition seamlessly back and forth between in-person and telehealth visits.\n\u201cA provider may be in Exam Room A seeing a patient in person, but then when they get done and walk into the next room, there may be a virtual patient sitting on the iPad,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cIn the very beginning we felt like we need to have dedicated providers, like 100% telehealth or 100% in-person. Then we graduated to this hybrid model, which we are still employing today.\u201d\nLooking Ahead: A Hybrid Model of Care\nEven with all the work they\u2019ve put in, Neighborhood and ZSFG say most of their telehealth visits are still conducted via telephone. That may be because many of the populations the clinics serve face the greatest barriers to accessing care: the elderly, people experiencing homelessness, and people with limited English proficiency. Uscher-Pines worries that those patients, who are only able to obtain audio telehealth services, may be receiving lower quality care as a result.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a little bit concerning is that [these] patients are getting an untested service,\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cIt may be that audio-only visits are appropriate for many different use cases, but the literature just isn\u2019t there yet to support when it\u2019s appropriate and when it\u2019s not.\u201d\nGiven the advantages and drawbacks of telehealth, audio, and video, many providers are now calling for a hybrid model of care, offering a mix of in-person and virtual appointments depending on the patient and purpose of the visit.\n\u201cTelehealth quality is really complicated. The question is not \u2018Does telehealth work?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018Does telehealth work for this patient population with this condition served in this setting?\u2019\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cWith hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s clear from the RAND report is that the flexibility of telehealth is valuable for many patients and providers, with one-third of visits conducted virtually over a year into the pandemic. Making sure that these appointments, whether they are conducted by phone or video, are accessible, and are of the highest quality, will be critical in ensuring equitable care for patients who face barriers to in-person visits, even after the COVID-19 public health emergency is over.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDana G.

Some of the clinics used the money to hire a specialized coordinator, like Churape, who oversees a team of telehealth ambassadors who help set up patients for video visits. First, the ambassadors screen patients to see if they have a device with a camera and access to Wi-Fi or an unlimited data plan. Then the ambassadors teach the patient how to download the application, join the meeting, and troubleshoot audio and video issues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don\u2019t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is,\u201d Churape said. \u201cWhat took the most time is actually getting the patient onto the application, teaching them how to download the application, teaching them how to join a meeting.\u201d\nOther FQHCs, including Neighborhood, used the grant money to buy equipment like iPads and rolling workstations to provide virtual visits at their clinics. Medical assistants move the rolling video displays between exam rooms and queue up patient calls, allowing physicians to transition seamlessly back and forth between in-person and telehealth visits.\n\u201cA provider may be in Exam Room A seeing a patient in person, but then when they get done and walk into the next room, there may be a virtual patient sitting on the iPad,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cIn the very beginning we felt like we need to have dedicated providers, like 100% telehealth or 100% in-person. Then we graduated to this hybrid model, which we are still employing today.\u201d\nLooking Ahead: A Hybrid Model of Care\nEven with all the work they\u2019ve put in, Neighborhood and ZSFG say most of their telehealth visits are still conducted via telephone. That may be because many of the populations the clinics serve face the greatest barriers to accessing care: the elderly, people experiencing homelessness, and people with limited English proficiency. Uscher-Pines worries that those patients, who are only able to obtain audio telehealth services, may be receiving lower quality care as a result.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a little bit concerning is that [these] patients are getting an untested service,\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cIt may be that audio-only visits are appropriate for many different use cases, but the literature just isn\u2019t there yet to support when it\u2019s appropriate and when it\u2019s not.\u201d\nGiven the advantages and drawbacks of telehealth, audio, and video, many providers are now calling for a hybrid model of care, offering a mix of in-person and virtual appointments depending on the patient and purpose of the visit.\n\u201cTelehealth quality is really complicated. The question is not \u2018Does telehealth work?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018Does telehealth work for this patient population with this condition served in this setting?\u2019\u201d Uscher-Pines said. \u201cWith hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s clear from the RAND report is that the flexibility of telehealth is valuable for many patients and providers, with one-third of visits conducted virtually over a year into the pandemic. Making sure that these appointments, whether they are conducted by phone or video, are accessible, and are of the highest quality, will be critical in ensuring equitable care for patients who face barriers to in-person visits, even after the COVID-19 public health emergency is over.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDana G.

With telemedicine, patients can now receive medical advice, diagnosis, disease management and treatment from the comfort of their homes, increasing their access to care and eliminating physical barriers created by hospital capacity, distance or transportation.\nThis report examines the continued adoption of telemedicine, its applications across various specialties and health care services, and its effects on physician well-being, patient access, and continuity of care. Study findings show that 88% of physicians surveyed believe telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, with many reporting reduced wait times, improved adherence to treatment plans, and decreased no-show rates. Additionally, a consider- able portion of physicians surveyed reported that telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules and positively impacted their feelings of autonomy and work-life balance. Beyond expanding access to health care, telemedicine may also be increasing patients\u2019 willingness to seek medical attention. The majority of all patients surveyed (70%) said they may be more likely to consult with a doctor if they can do so virtually, with convenience and efficiency being primary drivers of adoption. Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year, 85% said it resulted in equivalent or superior quality of care, with the majority reporting increased satisfaction. As the digitization of health care continues, telemedicine is poised to main- tain a pivotal role in health care delivery. Telemedicine and in-person care are not mutually exclusive, and uniting both can help reduce costs, expand access, and improve care for everyone. With further identification and im- plementation of best practices, telemedicine\u2019s capacity to personalize care models, promote continuity of care, and improve patient outcomes will only get stronger.\nReport Introduction 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Introduction 03 Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 04 An analysis of fee-for-service Medicare telemedicine claims throughout 2022 revealed that nearly 47% of billing physicians were users of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform. In the last quarter of 2022 (October to December) alone, Doximity's telemedicine tools were used by over 375,000 unique clinicians.* To gain a deeper understanding of the progression and sustained utilization of telemedicine, Doximity conducted an analysis of how its physician members, across all specialties and practice areas, used its telemedicine tools throughout 2022. To supplement this data, Doximity conducted a survey of over 1,200 of its physician telemedicine users across nine specialties: cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology, endocrinology, rheumatology, pulmonology, and psychiatry.\n*As reported on February 9, 2023 during Doximity\u2019s Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter earnings call 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 05 Physician Insights Telemedicine Insights from Doximity's Physician Membership 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 06 The metro areas with the highest physician adoption of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform in 2022 ranged across all regions of the U.S. New York had the highest overall adoption of telemedicine among physicians, followed by Chicago and Boston.\nMetro Areas with the HIGHEST HIGHEST Adoption 1.

This trend may be attributed to telemedicine\u2019s ability to promote continuity of care and long-term patient-physician relationships. Among all physicians surveyed, over 83% reported they found telemedicine useful in enhancing continuity of care for patients with complex or chronic conditions, and nearly two-thirds (65%) said telemedicine improved communication with their patients. 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 08 Adoption by Specialty Adoption of Telemedicine Highest in Specialties that Manage Chronic Illness 1.

Psychiatry Top Specialty by Adoption Rate \"I\u2019m an advanced heart failure cardiologist, and there are not many of us in the state. With telemedicine, patients now have access to subspecialists which may not be available in their area. In addition, follow ups for things like adjusting a heart failure therapy can be done via telemedicine, eliminating the need for patients to drive long distances for a short office visit. Over the past few years, we\u2019ve learned telemedicine is not a replacement, but a complement to our practices. \u2013 Munir Janmohamed, MD, Medical Director Heart Failure, Dignity Health Medical Foundation 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 09 As health care becomes more digitized, physicians across specialties are integrating telemedicine into their practices. In a survey of Doximity's telemedicine users, nearly 84% of physicians reported using telemedicine at least weekly, with 40% incorporating it into their daily clinical practice. The highest reports of daily use were among psych- iatrists at 84%, followed by endocrinologists at 57%. Looking ahead, the increasing popularity of mobile medicine and remote patient monitoring devices \u2014 estimated to reach 60.6 million U.S. patients by 20243 \u2014\u00ad is likely to drive further demand for reliable and complementary telemedicine solutions.\nFrequency of Use Many Physicians Incorporating Telemedicine into Daily, Weekly Practice *May not sum to 100 due to rounding numbers.\nHow often do you use telemedicine (via voice, video, text, etc.) in your practice?* Monthly 11% Quarterly 3% None of the Above 3% Participant None of the Ab Quarterly Monthly Daily Weekly 44% 40% 11% 3% 3% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 1 Daily 40% Weekly 44% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine As physicians lean into digital, they are embracing multiple telemedicine modalities, with video emerging as the most predominant among physicians surveyed. Audio-only phone visits are also widely employed, demonstrating the need for telemedicine tools that are versatile and adaptable to patients\u2019 needs. According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, Medicare patients with less technology access, lack of video experience, Latinx ethnicity, or limited English pro- ficiency, were all more likely to be offered telephone visits compared to video visits.4 These findings underscore the importance of audio-only options and the ongoing need for inclusive, flexible, and accessible telemedicine and product features that meet the needs of an increasingly diverse patient population.

While one of the most predominant applications among physicians is routine follow-up visits (92% of physicians surveyed), the majority of physicians surveyed (57%) use telemedicine to discuss lab and test results and treatment options with their patients, and this is even higher among oncologists (70%). Telemedicine also offers an important channel for prescription refills and timely follow-ups after a missed in-person visit, while playing a non-trivial role in remote patient monitoring, patient triage and urgent care. Notably, a recent study conducted by Epic Research found that most patients who had a telemedicine visit did not require an in-person follow-up appointment within the same specialty for three months. These findings suggest that telemedicine can provide effective medical attention without the need for additional in-person visits.5 Adoption by Use Case Telemedicine's Role Extends Beyond Routine Care How Physicians Apply Telemedicine in Clinical Practice: Routine Follow-Up Patient Visits Patient Consults Patient Triage Remote Patient Monitoring Test Results and Treatment Options Follow-Ups After Missed In-Person Visits Medication Management Urgent Care 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 12 While the pandemic certainly increased telemedicine use, the opportunity for better time management could help explain its continued adoption. Two-thirds of all physicians surveyed (66%) reported at least one time management benefit, such as greater autonomy and work-life balance, increased productivity, and easier schedule management. In fact, the majority of physicians surveyed reported telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules. As physicians continue to navigate burnout and overwork, these benefits could drive even greater adoption of telemedicine in the future.\nEffects on Productivity, Work-Life Balance Physicians Report Better Time Management \"Telemedicine has made it easier to manage my schedule.\" \"Telemedicine helps me be more productive and better serve my patients.\" \"Telemedicine has provided me with greater autonomy and work-life balance.\" \"Telemedicine helps me to provide care to more patients per day.\" Physician-Reported Benefits of Telemedicine Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 13 Telemedicine is also instrumental in addressing the costly and disruptive issue of patient no-shows for doctor visits. Approximately 61% of physicians surveyed reported a reduction in their patient no-show rates as a result of telemedicine, likely due to the increased convenience, accessibility, and flexibility of virtual care visits. Importantly, 77% of physicians said they have observed either equivalent or improved patient adherence to treatment plans through telemedicine, with less than 2% reporting decreased adherence.\nEffects on Patient Visit, Treatment Adherence Reduces No-Show Rates, Improves or Maintains Adherence to Treatment Plans How has telemedicine affected your patients' adherence to treatment plans?* Not applicable 1 Not applicable 1% Decreased adherence 2% Unsure 21% Increased adherence 37% No change 40% 1 Decreased adherence 2% No change in adherence 40% Increased adherence 37% *May not sum to 100, due to rounding numbers.\nUnsure 21% Not applicable 1% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 14 Patient access also appears to be a leading contributor to telemedicine adoption. Nearly 88% of physicians surveyed said telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, particularly among populations that may have faced barriers to care previously. Similarly, 87% of physicians reported telemedicine has enabled them to provide care to patients who face obstacles visiting their office in person. As additional benefits, nearly 44% of physicians found that telemedicine has actually reduced wait times for their patients, while 41% said telemedicine has expanded their community reach and referral networks.\nEffects on Patient Access Physicians Report Improved Access, Reduced Wait Times for Patients Physicians Who Agree Telemedicine Has Increased Patient Access to Health Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree 88 Neutral 10 Disagree 3 Disagree 3% Neutral 10% Agree 87% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Notably, the majority of physicians surveyed identified the ability to avoid application downloads and login-protected patient portals as important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine.\nFactors Influencing Patient Access Ease of Use, Cross-Device Compatibility Key Attributes for Patient Access Which of the following features are important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine?\nEase of use Accessibility across desktop and mobile No application download required No patient portal log-in required Ability to add family member or care partner Language support (translation or interpreter service) 0 100 75 50 25 92% 81% 71% 56% 55% 42% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 16 As telemedicine\u2019s role in U.S. health care continues to evolve, pay parity and the ability to offer telemedicine services across state lines will continue to be two issues that can greatly impact patient access. Among all physicians surveyed, over 78% indicated they believe there should be pay parity between telemedicine and in-person visits, and nearly 84% said the ability to practice telemedicine across state lines is critical to improving patient access to specialists and other timely care. With a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034,1 telemedicine is likely to play a significant role in promoting patient access to care, particularly in rural or underserved areas.\nPolicies to Preserve Patient Access Pay Parity, Licensing Across State Lines Critical to Patient Access Percentage of Physicians Who Agree There Should Be Pay Parity Between Telemedicine and In-Person Visits Percentage of Physicians Who Agree Ability to Practice Telemedicine Across State Lines is Critical to Improving Patient Access to Specialists, Other Timely Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree Neutral Disagree Disagree 4% Neutral 12% Agree 84% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Survey respondents included 1,200 patients who identified as having a chronic illness and 1,200 patients who did not. Among all respondents surveyed, the majority reported participating in a telemedicine visit within the last year (between March 2022 to March 2023). The following analyses examine these patients' direct experiences with telemedicine, as well as broader trends and preferences among the full patient cohort.\nPatient Insights Tracking Patient Perception and Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 19 In 2022, telemedicine reached the 80% adoption mark overall, becoming the preferred channel for prescription care and minor illness.6 While this is a significant milestone, the frequency of telemedicine use is also noteworthy. Based on survey results, nearly 60% of patients who had a telemedicine visit in the past year participated in a minimum of three virtual visits. Over one in five (21%) participated in six or more visits, and this frequency was similar among patients with and without chronic illnesses. Further, nearly 76% of patients who had a telemedicine visit reported it improved their access to health care services.\nTelemedicine Use Among Patients Patients Report Recurring Use of Telemedicine Within One-Year Period In the past year, how many times did you meet with a doctor virtually?* Has virtual care improved your access to health care services?* *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nFundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold 6+ times 21 3-5 times 38 1-2 times 41 41% 38% 21% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Fundrais Participant Unsure No No Change Yes 76% 17% 5% 2% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 3-5 Times 38% No 5% Unsure 2% 1-2 Times 41% Yes 76% 6+ Times 21% No Change 17% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 20 Patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year identified a number of reasons for adoption, with efficiency and convenience being primary drivers. Telemedicine enables patients to consult with their doctors from the comfort of their homes, eliminating the need to interrupt their daily routines or commute to a doctor's office. Importantly, more than one in four patients with a telemedicine visit in the past year reported opting for a virtual visit because they did not believe their situation warranted an in-person appointment. This suggests that telemedicine could play a vital role in ensuring patients less inclined to visit a doctor's office still receive timely medical evaluation. In fact, the majority of all patients surveyed (70%) indicated they may be more likely to consult with a doctor in a non-emergency situation if the visit could be conducted virtually.\nFactors Driving Telemedicine Adoption Efficiency, Convenience Leading Drivers of Patient Adoption *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nWhy did you see your doctor virtually within the past year?* Easier than in-person visit (more convenient) Faster than in-person visit Concerns about COVID-19 and other infections Didn't feel in-person was needed (didn't feel bad enough) Difficulty getting to doctors office Couldn't miss work 0 60 45 30 15 53% 43% 31% 27% 26% 16% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 21 Over the past year, patients participated in telemedicine visits to receive a number of health care services, ranging from routine check-ups to appointments to discuss test results and treatment options. While follow-up appointments appear to be one of the primary applications of telemedicine use, this is likely due to the comprehensive nature of these visits, which can encompass various health care services. Among all patients who had a virtual care visit in the past year, approximately one in three patients (34%) used telemedicine to discuss their medications with their doctor or to refill their prescriptions, while roughly one in five used telemedicine to review test or treatment options. Notably, some of the highest use of telemedicine for these services was among patients with chronic illnesses.\nAdoption by Health Care Service Strong Telemedicine Adoption for Routine Visits, Medication Management What type(s) of care have you received virtually in the past year?\nFollow-ups after an in-person visit Regular check-ups Medication management and refills Review of test or lab results Mental health appointments Review of test or treatment options Same-day appointments (non-emergency) Urgent or emergency care Remote monitoring device check-up 0 50 38 25 13 46% 36% 34% 32% 25% 20% 17% 11% 9% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 22 Patients are also embracing a variety of telemedicine modalities to cater to their diverse needs and preferences. These modalities include video consultations, audio-only phone calls, and chat or text messaging. Among all patients surveyed, video emerged as the most preferred modality, with audio- only phone visits closely behind. These relatively strong preferences across modalities underscore the need for adaptable and flexible telemedicine solutions that can promote a positive patient experience for all.\nPreferences by Modality Patients Report Similar Preferences for Video, Audio-Only Visits Which types of virtual care formats do you prefer?\nAll Patients Patients with Telemedicine Visit in Past Year Video Phone (audio only) Chat or text messaging I prefer to meet with my doctor in person 15 0 30 45 60 42% 56% 39% 46% 27% 31% 27% 13% Computer (laptop/desktop) 51% Tablet or iPad 38% Home phone or basic cell phone 20% Wi-Fi or Internet 54% Among all patients surveyed, the majority (77%) reported having regular access to a smartphone, making it the most commonly available device for virtual health care visits. This was followed by computers at 51% and tablets at 38%. Importantly, only 54% of respondents reported having reg- ular access to Wi-Fi, underscoring the need for flexible telemedicine solutions that can easily adapt to meet individual patients\u2019 needs, including adjusting for no or low internet connection. In terms of patient preferences, 60% of respondents indicated a strong preference for using mobile devices for telemedicine visits, with less than one-fourth (24%) reporting a preference for computers.\n2023 State of Telemedicine Report 23 Device Access and Preferences Patients Continue to Favor, Depend on Smartphones Which of the following resources do you have regular access to for virtual health care visits?\nSmartphone 0 20 40 60 80 77% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 24 Consistent with prior year findings, patients continue to report equivalent or superior quality of care as the result of their experience with telemedicine.

Moving forward, uniting telemedicine with in-person care will help personalize care models, promote more equitable access to care, and strengthen the overall health care system for all. By leveraging the advantages of both telemedicine and in-person care, physicians as well as care teams can create flexible and adaptable models that better meet the diverse needs of their patients. This flexibility could also provide much- needed support for physicians and other medical professionals, as they continue to navigate a complex and evolving health care landscape.\nConclusion, Methodology & Sources Conclusion 27 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Conclusion, Methodology & Sources 28 Physician Insights Medicare Telemedicine Insights: Doximity partnered with CareJourney, a health analytics organization, to measure the number of physicians billing a set of Medicare telemedicine codes throughout 2022.

COVID-19 patients who were isolated and received HBIC were monitored through telephone consultations (TC), in-person TC visits, and a self-reporting application. By evaluating patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC, healthcare providers could gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of the HBIC program.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study design enrolled 444 HBIC patients who answered a structured questionnaire. A binary logistic regression model assessed the association between independent variables and patient satisfaction. The length of stay in HBIC was analyzed using Cox regression analysis. The data collection started on April (1\u201330), 2022, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\nResults: The median age was 34, and 247 (55.6%) were females. A greater proportion (313, 70.5%) of the participants had high satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AOR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those who were symptomatic (AOR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were found to be significant factors for high user satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and more in-person visits (>1 visit) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001) had greater chances to reduce the length of stay in the COVID-19 HBIC.\nConclusion: 70.5% of the participants had high satisfaction with the system, and frequent phone call follow-ups on patients\u2019 clinical status can significantly improve their satisfaction and length of recovery. An in-person visit is also an invaluable factor in a patient\u2019s recovery.\n1 Introduction\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on numerous countries, resulting in a staggering number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide. Specifically, 774,771,942 confirmed cases and 7,035,337 deaths were reported globally. In Africa, approximately 9,576,309 confirmed cases and 175,500 deaths have been recorded, whereas Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths (1). Given the outbreak\u2019s severity and the prevailing epidemiological situation, the Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia has taken swift action by developing, approving, and implementing a national guide on home-based isolation and care (HBIC). This guide is tailored for asymptomatic and mildly confirmed COVID-19 cases (2). Consequently, many patients have enrolled in the system, establishing a comprehensive telephone consultation (TC) service. Healthcare workers from health centers have been diligently monitoring the clinical condition of these patients through regular phone calls or in-person visits (2). The national or regional COVID-19 emergency centers are available for assistance to ensure that patients receive the necessary support and information. Patients facing challenges or requiring guidance on the system\u2019s functioning, worsening symptoms, medication advice, or ambulance requests can reach these centers (2). This approach provides comprehensive care and support to individuals affected by COVID-19 in Ethiopia.\nSeveral studies have emphasized the utilization of teleconsultations (TC) in Sub-Saharan Africa amid the COVID-19 outbreak. For instance, a study conducted at the Aga Khan Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, revealed varying frequencies of TC calls over 3\u2009months, with peaks observed at 7\u2009weeks and lows at 13\u2009weeks (3). In Uganda, the Ministry of Health rolled out TC services across multiple health centers simultaneously (4). Similarly, in Cameroon, many physicians resorted to TC consultations during the pandemic, often using WhatsApp applications (5). Despite the progress in telemedicine practices, assessing the quality of care provided through these methods is crucial. Quality indicators for telemedicine outcomes include mortality rates, average length of stay, and complication rates (6). The adoption of telemedicine has played a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of diagnosis and treatment in primary public hospitals (7). This is evident in the reduction of treatment duration, decrease in the average length of hospital stays, and decline in the percentage of critically ill patients (8). Moreover, telemedicine aids in improving personalized care and broadening the accessibility of medical services. Healthcare providers can deliver more efficient and effective patient care by harnessing telemedicine, particularly during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic (9, 10). Patient satisfaction is a significant indicator of the societal perception of healthcare services, particularly in telemedicine. The practical advantages of telemedicine further underscore its social reputation within primary healthcare facilities. First, Telemedicine plays a crucial role in alleviating the financial burden on patients and their families by eliminating expenses associated with transportation and accommodation (11). Second, the efficient nature of telemedicine expedites disease diagnosis and treatment, thereby mitigating patients\u2019 suffering (11). Lastly, telemedicine\u2019s unique \u201cface-to-face\u201d communication system fosters a novel connection between medical professionals and patients, ultimately enhancing the healthcare experience (12, 13). Despite numerous studies, the findings remain inconclusive and conflicting. Some researchers suggested recruiting adaptable patients who embrace this new technology\u2019s convenience (14). Conversely, others highlight limitations, such as the relative novelty of telehealth in medicine, which makes it challenging to compare its outcomes with those of more traditional interventions (15). In addition, patient satisfaction is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors. However, the factors influencing patient satisfaction in different settings or conditions remain debated (15).\nPatient satisfaction and length of stay are crucial metrics for assessing the quality of healthcare programs. This study aimed to provide insights into the factors influencing the satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC of COVID-19 patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This study uses traditional care (TC) and hybrid (in-person-TC) approaches in different sub-city areas. By understanding these factors, policymakers can develop strategic plans to improve the quality of healthcare services, thereby ensuring high satisfaction levels and shorter medical residence stays. The findings of this study can also inform the National Public Health Emergency Operation Center and the Federal Ministry of Health in Ethiopia on how to intervene and strengthen the healthcare system. In addition, the results can contribute to expanding telemedicine services and adopting digital health technologies in the country\u2019s healthcare sector.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Study area\nThis study focuses on Addis Ababa, primarily because of the significant burden of COVID-19 cases. Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths, with nearly 67% of these cases originating in Addis Ababa (1). Moreover, implementing the COVID-19 HBIC model in Addis Ababa surpasses other regions. Furthermore, the HBIC\u2019s self-reporting and follow-up application is exclusively available in Addis Ababa, making it an ideal location for research. Addis Ababa is divided into 11 sub-cities [Addis Ketema, Akaky Kaliti, Arada, Bole, Gullele, Kirkos, Kolfe Keranio, Lideta, Nefas Silk-Lafto, Yeka, Lemi Kura (New)], all of which have adopted the HBIC system for COVID-19 patients since the initial case was identified. The digital follow-up tool was specifically launched in the Bole sub-city (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Addis Ababa district locations. This map of the 11 Addis Ababa sub-cities is included in this study. Lemi Kura is a new district and is not included in this map.\n2.2 Study period\nThe study was conducted from 1 to 30 April 2022 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.3 Telemedicine medical team and technology\nEach sub-city is equipped with two to four health centers that serve as the base for the telemedicine medical team. A well-established system ensures that patient data is promptly transmitted to follow-up teams, enabling healthcare workers to initiate their follow-up procedures without delay. To support this initiative, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Addis Ababa Health Bureau allocated a tablet with complimentary airtime to each sub-city proportionate to the needs of the telemedicine medical team.\n2.4 Population studied\nThis study encompasses all individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who were isolated, received care at home, and met the criteria for inclusion. The study population consisted of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to HBIC from its inception, aged between 18 and 60, individuals who underwent regular follow-up assessments while at HBIC, and those whose contact information was documented in the registry.\n2.5 Patient\u2019s independent variables\nPatients were classified based on the following criteria: Gender (male, female), Age (<30, 31\u201340, 41\u201350, 51\u201360\u2009years), city of residence, education level (no education and elementary, secondary and diploma, degree and above), occupation (government employee, private employee, self-employee, not working), symptoms (asymptomatic, symptomatic), type of attention (only telephone call\u2014TC, telephone call with in-person visits - in-person-TC), frequency of calls (\u22642 calls, \u22653 calls), and frequency of in-person visits (no visits, \u22642 visits, \u22653 visits).\n2.6 Study design\nA cross-sectional research design assessed two primary variables: patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC in days. The formula for a single population proportion was applied to determine the required population size of 385 (with a Z-score of 1.96, an outcome proportion of 50%, and a marginal error of 5%). The technique of proportionate stratified sampling involved dividing the entire population into 11 strata or sub-cities. The total sample size was then distributed proportionally among each sub-city based on the burden of the disease. Study participants were selected from each stratum or sub-city using systematic probability sampling (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Data collection. Sampling technique from each sub-city in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.7 Data collection tools, techniques, and quality assurance\nA validated patient satisfaction survey from the teleneurology program in Chile (13) employed a Likert scale to assess the extent of patient satisfaction. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collected, a pretest was conducted on a random sample of 23 (5%) patients. Based on the findings from the pretest, necessary amendments were made to the data collection tool. Additionally, the collected data underwent daily reviews for clarity and completeness checks. Before analysis, the internal consistency of the questionnaire was evaluated using Cronbach\u2019s alpha test (13). The local language was used during data collection to ensure the required information was collected with greater understanding. To facilitate this, the data collection questionnaire was first developed in English and then translated into Amharic, and the data collected were back-translated to English for consistency. The data collectors administered the questionnaire over the telephone, and responses were recorded on the individual datasheets. Training on the basics of the questionnaire and how to use it appropriately was given by the principal investigator for two BSc nurses for 2\u2009days.\n2.8 Patient satisfaction survey\nThe final questionnaire consisted of 17 closed-response questions, each assigned a numerical value ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree). The questions were categorized into four contextualized areas. The overall score on the questionnaire, with a maximum of 85 points, served as an indicator of patient satisfaction. The scoring system classified satisfaction levels as follows: very low (17 points or below), low (18\u201334 points), moderate (35\u201351 points), high (52\u201368 points), and very high (69\u201385 points). Following completion of the survey, patients were divided into two main groups based on their scores: (i) those with a score below 51 points, indicating moderate or low patient satisfaction, and (ii) those with a score over 52 points, indicating high or very high patient satisfaction (Table 1).\nTable 1. Study questionnaire.\r\n\n2.9 Data and outcomes analysis\nSummary statistics, including frequency, percentage, median, and interquartile range, were utilized to summarize the characteristics of patients and other relevant information. This research aimed to assess the relationship between the independent variables and two primary outcomes: (i) the level of patient satisfaction and (ii) the length of stay in the HBIC. The binary logistic regression (Backwald) model was employed to examine the independent variables associated with patient satisfaction, and the findings were presented as odds ratios (OR). Cox regression (Backwald) analysis was conducted to evaluate the independent variables linked to the length of stay in HBIC, and the results were reported as hazard ratios (HR). To compare the means of length of stay in HBIC, a non-normal distribution, the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for independent samples was employed, while the chi-square test was used for categorical variables. The significance level was set at p\u2009<\u20090.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 26.\n2.10 Ethical considerations\nThe study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee. Oral informed consent was obtained from the participants before any form of data collection. Participants\u2019 contact information was obtained after a formal request was made to the Addis Ababa Health Bureau. Demographic data of all participants and survey responses were anonymously collected and entered. Access to the collected information was limited to the authors, and confidentiality was maintained throughout the project.\n3 Results\n3.1 Data collection\nA 17-question structured questionnaire was developed by reviewing similar studies (Table 1) (13). Upon completing a reliability assessment of the survey, the internal reliability of the survey was robust, as evidenced by a Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of 0.96 (data not shown). The study included 509 patients, yielding a response rate of 87.2% (n\u2009=\u2009444). Among the non-respondents (n\u2009=\u200965, 12.8%), the reasons provided for their lack of participation were as follows: 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) had incorrect contact information, and another 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) did not receive any follow-up, either in-person or through phone communication. The remaining 60% (n\u2009=\u200939) of participants displayed uncooperative behavior, as their phones were inactive, unreachable, or did not answer (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Patient\u2019s response from telephone calls. Response rate and reasons for non-response include: (i) wrong phone number, (ii) no follow-up, and (iii) other.\n3.2 Population description, patient satisfaction, and length of stay in HBIC\nThe descriptive statistics of the 444 patients who participated in the study are below. The median age was 34\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u2009years, with an age distribution as follows: Age:<30 (n\u2009=\u2009164, 36.9%); 31\u201340 (n\u2009=\u2009141, 31.8%); 41\u201350 (n\u2009=\u200987, 19.6%); and 51\u201360 (n\u2009=\u200952, 11.7%). The gender distribution of the patients was as follows: Female 247 (55.6%) (Table 2). We outline the performance of the HBIC system according to the patient satisfaction parameter. Due to the low frequency obtained in the lower user satisfaction groups (very low, low, and moderate), we grouped patients into two major groups according to the degree of user satisfaction: low or moderate and high or very high. patients with high or very high user satisfaction represent 313 (70.5%). When we break down this group by gender, we see that women have a slightly higher percentage of high or very high user satisfaction than men, with 177 (56.9%) females. However, no statistically significant differences are observed. Analyzing the distribution of patients with high and very high user satisfaction by age, we observe that more than 50% of patients are concentrated in a population under 40\u2009years old (Table 2). The length of stay for patients with high or very high satisfaction varied depending on certain variables. The average length of stay for females was 15\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009days, while for males, it was 16\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009days, and in terms of age groups, patients showed similar lengths between 14 and 16 days (Table 2).\nTable 2. Patient\u2019s demographic variables.\r\n\nThe distribution of patients according to sub-city of residence was found to be quite homogeneous, with some exceptions as detailed below: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200962, 14.0%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Arada (n\u2009=\u200943, 9.7%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200977, 17.3%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200959, 13.3%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u200911, 2.5%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200936, 8.1%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200922, 5.0%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u200916, 3.6%). Patients with high or very high satisfaction were distributed according to sub-city of residence as follows: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200948, 10.8%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200935), Arada (n\u2009=\u200932, 7.2%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200957, 12.8%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%, 7.9%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u20096, 1.4%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200923, 5.2%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200920, 4.5%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200918, 4.1%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u20098, 1.8%) (Table 2). Regarding the city of origin, the average length of stay varied as follows: Addis Ketema (17\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Akaki Kality (16\u2009\u00b1\u20098), Arada (16\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Bole (14\u2009\u00b1\u20093), Gulele (17\u2009\u00b1\u20094), Kirkos (17\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Kolfe Keranyo (16\u2009\u00b1\u20096), Lideta (14\u2009\u00b1\u20094), Nefas Silk Lafto (20\u2009\u00b1\u20097), Yeka (15\u2009\u00b1\u20097), and Lemi Kura (14\u2009\u00b1\u20097) (Table 2).\nThe patient\u2019s satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC can be influenced by various factors, including the patient\u2019s level of education and occupation. The distribution of patients\u2019 education level is as follows: 79 patients (17.8%) had no education or only completed elementary school, 174 patients (39.2%) had completed secondary school or obtained a diploma, and 191 patients (43.0%) had a degree or higher education. The distribution of patients\u2019 occupation is as follows: 121 patients (27.3%) were government employees, 114 patients (25.7%) were private employees, 120 patients (25.0%) were self-employed, and 89 patients (20.0%) were not working (Table 2). The majority of patients who showed high or very high user satisfaction have higher levels of education: Education: No Educ and Elementary (n\u2009=\u200945, 10.1%), Secondary and Diploma (n\u2009=\u2009125, 28.2%), Degree and above (n\u2009=\u2009143, 32.2%); however, the distribution was found to be more symmetrical according to the occupational level of these patients: Government employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.0%), Private employee (n\u2009=\u200985, 19.1%), Self-employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.1%), Not working (n\u2009=\u200968, 15.3%) (Table 2). No significant differences were found in the duration length of stay in HBIC among patients concerning their level of education and occupation type. The respective data for education are as follows: No Education and Elementary 14\u2009\u00b1\u20097, Secondary and Diploma 15\u2009\u00b1\u20094, Degree and above 17\u2009\u00b1\u20095. Similarly, the data for occupation type were: Government employee 14\u2009\u00b1\u20095, Private employee 15\u2009\u00b1\u20095, Self-employee 16\u2009\u00b1\u20094, Not working 18\u2009\u00b1\u20097 (Table 2).\nMost patients who participated in this study were symptomatic, accounting for 275 (61.9%) with an average length of stay for HBIC of 16 (\u00b16). Patients who displayed symptoms were more satisfied (n\u2009=\u2009215, 48.5%) than those who were asymptomatic (n\u2009=\u200998, 22.1%). The length of stay in HBIC for asymptomatic patients (14\u2009\u00b1\u20095), was slightly lower than that of Symptomatic patients (16\u2009\u00b1\u20095). However, no statistically significant differences were observed (data not shown).\nNext, we described the frequency of phone call follow-ups for patients during their stay at HBIC. The most common type of care was TC, with 330 patients (74.3%), followed by in-person and TC visits, with 114 patients (25.7%). The overall frequency of in-person visits was 1\u2009\u00b1\u20092 visits, and it can be further broken down as follows: no visits (n\u2009=\u2009330, 48.9%), \u22642 visits (n\u2009=\u200984, 18.9%), and\u2009\u2265\u20093 visits (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%). The average frequency of phone call follow-ups was 3\u2009\u00b1\u20096 calls, and we observe that the distribution of calls appears to be symmetrical: TC was \u22642 calls (n\u2009=\u2009221, 49.8%) and\u2009\u2265\u20093 calls (n\u2009=\u2009223, 50.2%).\nIn terms of the mode of care, patients who were exclusively contacted through teleconsultation (TC) 217 (48.9%) were more satisfied than those receiving hybrid care with both TC and in-person visits 96 (21.6%). Consistent with the findings, patients exhibited higher user satisfaction with an increased frequency of calls in TC, as those patients with more than \u22653 calls (n\u2009=\u2009184, 41.4%) expressed greater satisfaction compared to patients with less than or equal to \u22642 calls (n\u2009=\u2009129, 29.1%) (Table 2). Upon analyzing the frequency of in-person visits, patients with fewer visits reported higher user satisfaction: No visits (n\u2009=\u2009217, 69.3%), 1 visit (n\u2009=\u200970, 22.0%), and\u2009\u2265\u20092 visits (n\u2009=\u200926, 8.3%).\nIt is important to mention that differences in patient length of stay were observed according to the type of care, as patients treated through the TC system 14\u2009\u00b1\u20095 stayed for a shorter period than those receiving hybrid care through TC and in-person visits 18\u2009\u00b1\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). As expected, patients with more calls stayed longer in the HBIC system as described below: Frequency of calls in TC: \u22642 calls 13\u2009\u00b1\u20093, and\u2009\u2265\u20093 calls 18\u2009\u00b1\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Table 2).\n3.3 Statistical analysis associated with patient satisfaction\nA binary logistic regression analysis was utilized to explore the variables associated with high or very high patient satisfaction levels. The results revealed that individuals who placed more than three calls (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those displaying symptoms (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were more inclined to report increased satisfaction. Nevertheless, no statistically significant relationships were found between user satisfaction and the other independent variables investigated (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 3).\nTable 3. Relevant demographic variables that influence patient satisfaction.\r\n\n3.4 Statistical analysis associated with patient length of stay in HBIC\nA Cox regression analysis was employed to examine the factors influencing the duration of hospital stays in patients who reported high levels of satisfaction. The findings revealed that patients who made more than three phone calls had a significantly lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000), indicating a greater likelihood of reducing their length of stay. Similarly, patients with more in-person visits also exhibited a lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). However, no statistically significant associations were observed between the length of stay and the other independent variables analyzed (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 4).\nTable 4. Cox regression analysis to elucidate the demographic variables associated with the length of stay in HBIC and patients\u2019 satisfaction.\r\n\n3.5 Statistical analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC\nPreviously, we identified the following variables that significantly influence patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC: the presence of symptoms, the number of phone calls, and in-person follow-ups. Subsequently, we examined the relationship between symptoms and patient satisfaction with the number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups (Table 5). It was noted that symptomatic patients with low or moderate satisfaction levels have an OR\u2009=\u20095.7 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and 7.6 times higher likelihood of having in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was notably longer for those with a higher number of phone calls. Conversely, patients with high or very high satisfaction levels have a 2.3 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was significantly longer for those with in-person follow-up. Sig p\u2009<\u20090.05 (Table 5).\nTable 5. Analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC.\r\n\n4 Discussion\nThis study aimed to evaluate the levels of patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC among COVID-19 patients while also examining the different factors that may impact these outcomes. Given the considerable number of COVID-19-positive instances and the limited bed availability at COVID-19-specific hospitals, the HBIC endorsed the practice of home isolation for COVID-19-affected persons. This directive was instituted because most COVID-19 patients were either asymptomatic or displayed mild symptoms. Such cases generally do not necessitate hospitalization at COVID-19-designated medical facilities and can be adequately managed at home with appropriate medical guidance and monitoring. The heightened level of patient satisfaction observed in symptomatic individuals treated by HBIC is supported by an associated investigation conducted through a survey-based study (10, 16\u201318).\nWe identified a noteworthy connection between a high or very high satisfaction level and the frequency of phone call follow-ups in patients with COVID-19 symptoms. Essentially, for each increment of one in the frequency of phone call follow-ups, the chances of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction rose by a factor of 2.8 (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000). This tendency may be attributed to patients encountering difficulties during their healthcare facility stay, and regular communication with the follow-up team assists in addressing some of these challenges. As per the National HBIC Guideline, the frequency of phone call follow-ups escalates as the severity of the COVID-19 illness worsens, with follow-ups occurring once a week, every 3\u2009days until discharge, and daily until discharge (19). Correspondingly, individuals exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms had 2.0 times greater odds of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction than those with asymptomatic disease (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Cox regression analysis uncovered a negative correlation between the length of stay in HBIC patients with high or very high satisfaction and the frequency of phone calls, follow-ups, and in-person visits. Specifically, the number of phone calls and in-person visits (with a minimum of two visits) emerged as significant factors impacting the length of stay. Upon adjusting for other variables, it was observed that with each additional phone call, the length of stay in the hospital-based isolation center (HBIC) decreased by 46.3% (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000). Similarly, after accounting for other covariates, the length of stay among COVID-19 patients who had more than one in-person visit was 50.5% lower compared to patients with no in-person visits (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Finally, this investigation determined that symptomatic patients with Low or Moderate satisfaction had a greater likelihood of experiencing a larger Number of Phone Calls, In-Person follow-ups, and a longer stay at HBIC compared to patients with high or very high satisfaction.\nUser satisfaction and length of stay have shown dissimilar results in different latitudes. A study conducted in general and university hospitals in the Netherlands found no evidence of a correlation between the average length of stay in hospital wards and patient satisfaction (20). Several studies conducted at the Nancy University Hospital Center in France and in training hospitals in Turkey and Japan (21\u201323) have found a connection between prolonged lengths of stay and decreased patient satisfaction. These studies have highlighted the importance of environmental factors in influencing patient satisfaction (24). However, a distinct study carried out in teaching hospitals in Turkey discovered that patients who stayed longer expressed higher satisfaction levels than those with shorter stays (25). Despite these variations, one can speculate about the reasons for higher user satisfaction in patients with greater follow-ups. Among these reasons, it can be argued that it is well-documented that telemedicine technology has the potential to enhance the quality of primary medical care, shorten the duration of treatment, and decrease the number of severe hospitalization cases (17). Telemedicine expands the availability of medical services and broadens the range of medical care, which is particularly crucial in Ethiopia, with a fragmented healthcare system and limited coverage (26, 27). The sharing of medical resources is especially significant for rural or isolated areas, and telemedicine offers a greater abundance of advanced medical resources for primary hospital consultations in these vast rural regions, thereby enhancing the quality of medical and healthcare services (10, 28, 29).\nThe incorporation of telemedicine into the healthcare systems of low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as Ethiopia, has the potential to bring about cost savings and resource conservation in the long run. Consequently, this could alleviate the financial burden on individuals and enhance their access to affordable healthcare services (17). It is important to note that in many LMICs, a significant portion of overall health spending comes from out-of-pocket payments, as there is often no general health insurance available (30). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has further strained the already fragile healthcare systems in LMICs (10, 31). In this regard, telemedicine services could be crucial in relieving pressure on the healthcare system by saving time and resources and enhancing efficiency and accessibility. Additionally, telemedicine can facilitate social distancing measures and reduce the need for face-to-face interactions in hospitals and clinics, helping prevent the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 through physical contact (10, 32). Furthermore, telemedicine can also be instrumental in providing counseling and specific advice to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as guidance on prevention measures. Overall, the adoption of telemedicine in LMICs holds great potential for addressing healthcare challenges, reducing costs, and improving access to quality care. It can serve as a valuable tool in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthening healthcare systems in these countries (33).\nThroughout the initial three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, most patients seeking medical care were directed to the HBIC. This strategic decision is believed to have effectively alleviated the potential burden of cases and prevented burnout among the existing treatment facilities (2). The HBIC specifically caters to COVID-19 patients and represents our country\u2019s pioneering national telehealth service. Therefore, it is crucial to examine its operational experiences thoroughly. The focus should be on integrating functionalities that encourage community acceptance of this telehealth modality. As COVID-19 patients continue to be enrolled in the HBIC, the findings from this study will serve as a valuable resource for the Ministry of Health and COVID-19 response teams in their efforts to enhance the healthcare system. The HBIC framework offers a practical solution for healthcare providers who aim to extend their services to patients residing in remote areas. Moreover, the growing acceptance and familiarity with telemedicine visits, driven by the pandemic, are likely to shape the future landscape of healthcare delivery for both patients and providers.\nThe study\u2019s findings should be evaluated considering the strengths and limitations identified. The study\u2019s strength lies in the thorough selection process of participants from various sub-cities throughout the entire duration of the service. The research questions were also carefully developed using a validated tool and assessed for internal consistency, ensuring their comprehensibility.\n4.1 Limitations\nIt is important to acknowledge a limitation of the study, which is the potential recall bias introduced by enrolling most patients during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this limitation, this study is expected to pave the way for advancements in telemedical services in Ethiopia. Furthermore, it can potentially expand and incorporate other telemedicine care modalities, such as videoconferencing, in the future.\n5 Conclusion\nThe investigation evaluated patient satisfaction and length of stay in telemedicine services. The findings revealed that most patients, accounting for over 70.5%, reported high or very high satisfaction with these services. Notably, patients who received frequent follow-up phone calls and exhibited symptomatic COVID-19 disease expressed higher satisfaction. Additionally, it was observed that a higher frequency of phone calls and in-person visits resulted in a shorter stay in the Hospital-Based Isolation Center (HBIC). Consequently, it is crucial to consider the aforementioned factors to enhance patient satisfaction and reduce the length of stay in HBIC or other telemedicine services. It is worth mentioning that the HBIC, which caters specifically to COVID-19 patients, represents the first large-scale national telemedicine service implemented in our country. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly examine the experiences gained from this service, with particular attention given to incorporating features that facilitate community acceptance and reimbursement of this mode of healthcare delivery. Meanwhile, as the enrollment of COVID-19 patients in the HBIC continues, the findings of this study will serve as a valuable resource for guiding the Ministry of Health, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, and the COVID-19 response team in their efforts to improve the system.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving humans were approved by the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee.

      "Top bar navigation\nORIGINAL RESEARCH article\nCOVID-19 patient satisfaction and associated factors in telemedicine and hybrid system\nBackground: The quality assessment of the home-based isolation and care program (HBIC) relies heavily on patient satisfaction and length of stay. COVID-19 patients who were isolated and received HBIC were monitored through telephone consultations (TC), in-person TC visits, and a self-reporting application. By evaluating patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC, healthcare providers could gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of the HBIC program.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study design enrolled 444 HBIC patients who answered a structured questionnaire. A binary logistic regression model assessed the association between independent variables and patient satisfaction. The length of stay in HBIC was analyzed using Cox regression analysis. The data collection started on April (1\u201330), 2022, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\nResults: The median age was 34, and 247 (55.6%) were females. A greater proportion (313, 70.5%) of the participants had high satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AOR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those who were symptomatic (AOR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were found to be significant factors for high user satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and more in-person visits (>1 visit) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001) had greater chances to reduce the length of stay in the COVID-19 HBIC.\nConclusion: 70.5% of the participants had high satisfaction with the system, and frequent phone call follow-ups on patients\u2019 clinical status can significantly improve their satisfaction and length of recovery. An in-person visit is also an invaluable factor in a patient\u2019s recovery.\n1 Introduction\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on numerous countries, resulting in a staggering number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide. Specifically, 774,771,942 confirmed cases and 7,035,337 deaths were reported globally. In Africa, approximately 9,576,309 confirmed cases and 175,500 deaths have been recorded, whereas Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths (1). Given the outbreak\u2019s severity and the prevailing epidemiological situation, the Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia has taken swift action by developing, approving, and implementing a national guide on home-based isolation and care (HBIC). This guide is tailored for asymptomatic and mildly confirmed COVID-19 cases (2). Consequently, many patients have enrolled in the system, establishing a comprehensive telephone consultation (TC) service. Healthcare workers from health centers have been diligently monitoring the clinical condition of these patients through regular phone calls or in-person visits (2). The national or regional COVID-19 emergency centers are available for assistance to ensure that patients receive the necessary support and information. Patients facing challenges or requiring guidance on the system\u2019s functioning, worsening symptoms, medication advice, or ambulance requests can reach these centers (2). This approach provides comprehensive care and support to individuals affected by COVID-19 in Ethiopia.\nSeveral studies have emphasized the utilization of teleconsultations (TC) in Sub-Saharan Africa amid the COVID-19 outbreak. For instance, a study conducted at the Aga Khan Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, revealed varying frequencies of TC calls over 3\u2009months, with peaks observed at 7\u2009weeks and lows at 13\u2009weeks (3). In Uganda, the Ministry of Health rolled out TC services across multiple health centers simultaneously (4). Similarly, in Cameroon, many physicians resorted to TC consultations during the pandemic, often using WhatsApp applications (5). Despite the progress in telemedicine practices, assessing the quality of care provided through these methods is crucial. Quality indicators for telemedicine outcomes include mortality rates, average length of stay, and complication rates (6). The adoption of telemedicine has played a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of diagnosis and treatment in primary public hospitals (7). This is evident in the reduction of treatment duration, decrease in the average length of hospital stays, and decline in the percentage of critically ill patients (8). Moreover, telemedicine aids in improving personalized care and broadening the accessibility of medical services. Healthcare providers can deliver more efficient and effective patient care by harnessing telemedicine, particularly during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic (9, 10). Patient satisfaction is a significant indicator of the societal perception of healthcare services, particularly in telemedicine. The practical advantages of telemedicine further underscore its social reputation within primary healthcare facilities. First, Telemedicine plays a crucial role in alleviating the financial burden on patients and their families by eliminating expenses associated with transportation and accommodation (11). Second, the efficient nature of telemedicine expedites disease diagnosis and treatment, thereby mitigating patients\u2019 suffering (11). Lastly, telemedicine\u2019s unique \u201cface-to-face\u201d communication system fosters a novel connection between medical professionals and patients, ultimately enhancing the healthcare experience (12, 13). Despite numerous studies, the findings remain inconclusive and conflicting. Some researchers suggested recruiting adaptable patients who embrace this new technology\u2019s convenience (14). Conversely, others highlight limitations, such as the relative novelty of telehealth in medicine, which makes it challenging to compare its outcomes with those of more traditional interventions (15). In addition, patient satisfaction is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors. However, the factors influencing patient satisfaction in different settings or conditions remain debated (15).\nPatient satisfaction and length of stay are crucial metrics for assessing the quality of healthcare programs. This study aimed to provide insights into the factors influencing the satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC of COVID-19 patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This study uses traditional care (TC) and hybrid (in-person-TC) approaches in different sub-city areas. By understanding these factors, policymakers can develop strategic plans to improve the quality of healthcare services, thereby ensuring high satisfaction levels and shorter medical residence stays. The findings of this study can also inform the National Public Health Emergency Operation Center and the Federal Ministry of Health in Ethiopia on how to intervene and strengthen the healthcare system. In addition, the results can contribute to expanding telemedicine services and adopting digital health technologies in the country\u2019s healthcare sector.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Study area\nThis study focuses on Addis Ababa, primarily because of the significant burden of COVID-19 cases. Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths, with nearly 67% of these cases originating in Addis Ababa (1). Moreover, implementing the COVID-19 HBIC model in Addis Ababa surpasses other regions. Furthermore, the HBIC\u2019s self-reporting and follow-up application is exclusively available in Addis Ababa, making it an ideal location for research. Addis Ababa is divided into 11 sub-cities [Addis Ketema, Akaky Kaliti, Arada, Bole, Gullele, Kirkos, Kolfe Keranio, Lideta, Nefas Silk-Lafto, Yeka, Lemi Kura (New)], all of which have adopted the HBIC system for COVID-19 patients since the initial case was identified. The digital follow-up tool was specifically launched in the Bole sub-city (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Addis Ababa district locations. This map of the 11 Addis Ababa sub-cities is included in this study. Lemi Kura is a new district and is not included in this map.\n2.2 Study period\nThe study was conducted from 1 to 30 April 2022 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.3 Telemedicine medical team and technology\nEach sub-city is equipped with two to four health centers that serve as the base for the telemedicine medical team. A well-established system ensures that patient data is promptly transmitted to follow-up teams, enabling healthcare workers to initiate their follow-up procedures without delay. To support this initiative, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Addis Ababa Health Bureau allocated a tablet with complimentary airtime to each sub-city proportionate to the needs of the telemedicine medical team.\n2.4 Population studied\nThis study encompasses all individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who were isolated, received care at home, and met the criteria for inclusion. The study population consisted of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to HBIC from its inception, aged between 18 and 60, individuals who underwent regular follow-up assessments while at HBIC, and those whose contact information was documented in the registry.\n2.5 Patient\u2019s independent variables\nPatients were classified based on the following criteria: Gender (male, female), Age (<30, 31\u201340, 41\u201350, 51\u201360\u2009years), city of residence, education level (no education and elementary, secondary and diploma, degree and above), occupation (government employee, private employee, self-employee, not working), symptoms (asymptomatic, symptomatic), type of attention (only telephone call\u2014TC, telephone call with in-person visits - in-person-TC), frequency of calls (\u22642 calls, \u22653 calls), and frequency of in-person visits (no visits, \u22642 visits, \u22653 visits).\n2.6 Study design\nA cross-sectional research design assessed two primary variables: patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC in days. The formula for a single population proportion was applied to determine the required population size of 385 (with a Z-score of 1.96, an outcome proportion of 50%, and a marginal error of 5%). The technique of proportionate stratified sampling involved dividing the entire population into 11 strata or sub-cities. The total sample size was then distributed proportionally among each sub-city based on the burden of the disease. Study participants were selected from each stratum or sub-city using systematic probability sampling (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Data collection. Sampling technique from each sub-city in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.7 Data collection tools, techniques, and quality assurance\nA validated patient satisfaction survey from the teleneurology program in Chile (13) employed a Likert scale to assess the extent of patient satisfaction. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collected, a pretest was conducted on a random sample of 23 (5%) patients. Based on the findings from the pretest, necessary amendments were made to the data collection tool. Additionally, the collected data underwent daily reviews for clarity and completeness checks. Before analysis, the internal consistency of the questionnaire was evaluated using Cronbach\u2019s alpha test (13). The local language was used during data collection to ensure the required information was collected with greater understanding. To facilitate this, the data collection questionnaire was first developed in English and then translated into Amharic, and the data collected were back-translated to English for consistency. The data collectors administered the questionnaire over the telephone, and responses were recorded on the individual datasheets. Training on the basics of the questionnaire and how to use it appropriately was given by the principal investigator for two BSc nurses for 2\u2009days.\n2.8 Patient satisfaction survey\nThe final questionnaire consisted of 17 closed-response questions, each assigned a numerical value ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree). The questions were categorized into four contextualized areas. The overall score on the questionnaire, with a maximum of 85 points, served as an indicator of patient satisfaction. The scoring system classified satisfaction levels as follows: very low (17 points or below), low (18\u201334 points), moderate (35\u201351 points), high (52\u201368 points), and very high (69\u201385 points). Following completion of the survey, patients were divided into two main groups based on their scores: (i) those with a score below 51 points, indicating moderate or low patient satisfaction, and (ii) those with a score over 52 points, indicating high or very high patient satisfaction (Table 1).\nTable 1. Study questionnaire.\r\n\n2.9 Data and outcomes analysis\nSummary statistics, including frequency, percentage, median, and interquartile range, were utilized to summarize the characteristics of patients and other relevant information. This research aimed to assess the relationship between the independent variables and two primary outcomes: (i) the level of patient satisfaction and (ii) the length of stay in the HBIC. The binary logistic regression (Backwald) model was employed to examine the independent variables associated with patient satisfaction, and the findings were presented as odds ratios (OR). Cox regression (Backwald) analysis was conducted to evaluate the independent variables linked to the length of stay in HBIC, and the results were reported as hazard ratios (HR). To compare the means of length of stay in HBIC, a non-normal distribution, the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for independent samples was employed, while the chi-square test was used for categorical variables. The significance level was set at p\u2009<\u20090.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 26.\n2.10 Ethical considerations\nThe study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee. Oral informed consent was obtained from the participants before any form of data collection. Participants\u2019 contact information was obtained after a formal request was made to the Addis Ababa Health Bureau. Demographic data of all participants and survey responses were anonymously collected and entered. Access to the collected information was limited to the authors, and confidentiality was maintained throughout the project.\n3 Results\n3.1 Data collection\nA 17-question structured questionnaire was developed by reviewing similar studies (Table 1) (13). Upon completing a reliability assessment of the survey, the internal reliability of the survey was robust, as evidenced by a Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of 0.96 (data not shown). The study included 509 patients, yielding a response rate of 87.2% (n\u2009=\u2009444). Among the non-respondents (n\u2009=\u200965, 12.8%), the reasons provided for their lack of participation were as follows: 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) had incorrect contact information, and another 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) did not receive any follow-up, either in-person or through phone communication. The remaining 60% (n\u2009=\u200939) of participants displayed uncooperative behavior, as their phones were inactive, unreachable, or did not answer (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Patient\u2019s response from telephone calls. Response rate and reasons for non-response include: (i) wrong phone number, (ii) no follow-up, and (iii) other.\n3.2 Population description, patient satisfaction, and length of stay in HBIC\nThe descriptive statistics of the 444 patients who participated in the study are below. The median age was 34\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u2009years, with an age distribution as follows: Age:<30 (n\u2009=\u2009164, 36.9%); 31\u201340 (n\u2009=\u2009141, 31.8%); 41\u201350 (n\u2009=\u200987, 19.6%); and 51\u201360 (n\u2009=\u200952, 11.7%). The gender distribution of the patients was as follows: Female 247 (55.6%) (Table 2). We outline the performance of the HBIC system according to the patient satisfaction parameter. Due to the low frequency obtained in the lower user satisfaction groups (very low, low, and moderate), we grouped patients into two major groups according to the degree of user satisfaction: low or moderate and high or very high. patients with high or very high user satisfaction represent 313 (70.5%). When we break down this group by gender, we see that women have a slightly higher percentage of high or very high user satisfaction than men, with 177 (56.9%) females. However, no statistically significant differences are observed. Analyzing the distribution of patients with high and very high user satisfaction by age, we observe that more than 50% of patients are concentrated in a population under 40\u2009years old (Table 2). The length of stay for patients with high or very high satisfaction varied depending on certain variables. The average length of stay for females was 15\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009days, while for males, it was 16\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009days, and in terms of age groups, patients showed similar lengths between 14 and 16 days (Table 2).\nTable 2. Patient\u2019s demographic variables.\r\n\nThe distribution of patients according to sub-city of residence was found to be quite homogeneous, with some exceptions as detailed below: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200962, 14.0%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Arada (n\u2009=\u200943, 9.7%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200977, 17.3%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200959, 13.3%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u200911, 2.5%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200936, 8.1%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200922, 5.0%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u200916, 3.6%). Patients with high or very high satisfaction were distributed according to sub-city of residence as follows: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200948, 10.8%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200935), Arada (n\u2009=\u200932, 7.2%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200957, 12.8%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%, 7.9%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u20096, 1.4%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200923, 5.2%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200920, 4.5%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200918, 4.1%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u20098, 1.8%) (Table 2). Regarding the city of origin, the average length of stay varied as follows: Addis Ketema (17\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Akaki Kality (16\u2009\u00b1\u20098), Arada (16\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Bole (14\u2009\u00b1\u20093), Gulele (17\u2009\u00b1\u20094), Kirkos (17\u2009\u00b1\u20095), Kolfe Keranyo (16\u2009\u00b1\u20096), Lideta (14\u2009\u00b1\u20094), Nefas Silk Lafto (20\u2009\u00b1\u20097), Yeka (15\u2009\u00b1\u20097), and Lemi Kura (14\u2009\u00b1\u20097) (Table 2).\nThe patient\u2019s satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC can be influenced by various factors, including the patient\u2019s level of education and occupation. The distribution of patients\u2019 education level is as follows: 79 patients (17.8%) had no education or only completed elementary school, 174 patients (39.2%) had completed secondary school or obtained a diploma, and 191 patients (43.0%) had a degree or higher education. The distribution of patients\u2019 occupation is as follows: 121 patients (27.3%) were government employees, 114 patients (25.7%) were private employees, 120 patients (25.0%) were self-employed, and 89 patients (20.0%) were not working (Table 2). The majority of patients who showed high or very high user satisfaction have higher levels of education: Education: No Educ and Elementary (n\u2009=\u200945, 10.1%), Secondary and Diploma (n\u2009=\u2009125, 28.2%), Degree and above (n\u2009=\u2009143, 32.2%); however, the distribution was found to be more symmetrical according to the occupational level of these patients: Government employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.0%), Private employee (n\u2009=\u200985, 19.1%), Self-employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.1%), Not working (n\u2009=\u200968, 15.3%) (Table 2). No significant differences were found in the duration length of stay in HBIC among patients concerning their level of education and occupation type. The respective data for education are as follows: No Education and Elementary 14\u2009\u00b1\u20097, Secondary and Diploma 15\u2009\u00b1\u20094, Degree and above 17\u2009\u00b1\u20095. Similarly, the data for occupation type were: Government employee 14\u2009\u00b1\u20095, Private employee 15\u2009\u00b1\u20095, Self-employee 16\u2009\u00b1\u20094, Not working 18\u2009\u00b1\u20097 (Table 2).\nMost patients who participated in this study were symptomatic, accounting for 275 (61.9%) with an average length of stay for HBIC of 16 (\u00b16). Patients who displayed symptoms were more satisfied (n\u2009=\u2009215, 48.5%) than those who were asymptomatic (n\u2009=\u200998, 22.1%). The length of stay in HBIC for asymptomatic patients (14\u2009\u00b1\u20095), was slightly lower than that of Symptomatic patients (16\u2009\u00b1\u20095). However, no statistically significant differences were observed (data not shown).\nNext, we described the frequency of phone call follow-ups for patients during their stay at HBIC. The most common type of care was TC, with 330 patients (74.3%), followed by in-person and TC visits, with 114 patients (25.7%). The overall frequency of in-person visits was 1\u2009\u00b1\u20092 visits, and it can be further broken down as follows: no visits (n\u2009=\u2009330, 48.9%), \u22642 visits (n\u2009=\u200984, 18.9%), and\u2009\u2265\u20093 visits (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%). The average frequency of phone call follow-ups was 3\u2009\u00b1\u20096 calls, and we observe that the distribution of calls appears to be symmetrical: TC was \u22642 calls (n\u2009=\u2009221, 49.8%) and\u2009\u2265\u20093 calls (n\u2009=\u2009223, 50.2%).\nIn terms of the mode of care, patients who were exclusively contacted through teleconsultation (TC) 217 (48.9%) were more satisfied than those receiving hybrid care with both TC and in-person visits 96 (21.6%). Consistent with the findings, patients exhibited higher user satisfaction with an increased frequency of calls in TC, as those patients with more than \u22653 calls (n\u2009=\u2009184, 41.4%) expressed greater satisfaction compared to patients with less than or equal to \u22642 calls (n\u2009=\u2009129, 29.1%) (Table 2). Upon analyzing the frequency of in-person visits, patients with fewer visits reported higher user satisfaction: No visits (n\u2009=\u2009217, 69.3%), 1 visit (n\u2009=\u200970, 22.0%), and\u2009\u2265\u20092 visits (n\u2009=\u200926, 8.3%).\nIt is important to mention that differences in patient length of stay were observed according to the type of care, as patients treated through the TC system 14\u2009\u00b1\u20095 stayed for a shorter period than those receiving hybrid care through TC and in-person visits 18\u2009\u00b1\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). As expected, patients with more calls stayed longer in the HBIC system as described below: Frequency of calls in TC: \u22642 calls 13\u2009\u00b1\u20093, and\u2009\u2265\u20093 calls 18\u2009\u00b1\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Table 2).\n3.3 Statistical analysis associated with patient satisfaction\nA binary logistic regression analysis was utilized to explore the variables associated with high or very high patient satisfaction levels. The results revealed that individuals who placed more than three calls (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those displaying symptoms (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were more inclined to report increased satisfaction. Nevertheless, no statistically significant relationships were found between user satisfaction and the other independent variables investigated (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 3).\nTable 3. Relevant demographic variables that influence patient satisfaction.\r\n\n3.4 Statistical analysis associated with patient length of stay in HBIC\nA Cox regression analysis was employed to examine the factors influencing the duration of hospital stays in patients who reported high levels of satisfaction. The findings revealed that patients who made more than three phone calls had a significantly lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000), indicating a greater likelihood of reducing their length of stay. Similarly, patients with more in-person visits also exhibited a lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). However, no statistically significant associations were observed between the length of stay and the other independent variables analyzed (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 4).\nTable 4. Cox regression analysis to elucidate the demographic variables associated with the length of stay in HBIC and patients\u2019 satisfaction.\r\n\n3.5 Statistical analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC\nPreviously, we identified the following variables that significantly influence patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC: the presence of symptoms, the number of phone calls, and in-person follow-ups. Subsequently, we examined the relationship between symptoms and patient satisfaction with the number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups (Table 5). It was noted that symptomatic patients with low or moderate satisfaction levels have an OR\u2009=\u20095.7 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and 7.6 times higher likelihood of having in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was notably longer for those with a higher number of phone calls. Conversely, patients with high or very high satisfaction levels have a 2.3 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was significantly longer for those with in-person follow-up. Sig p\u2009<\u20090.05 (Table 5).\nTable 5. Analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC.\r\n\n4 Discussion\nThis study aimed to evaluate the levels of patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC among COVID-19 patients while also examining the different factors that may impact these outcomes. Given the considerable number of COVID-19-positive instances and the limited bed availability at COVID-19-specific hospitals, the HBIC endorsed the practice of home isolation for COVID-19-affected persons. This directive was instituted because most COVID-19 patients were either asymptomatic or displayed mild symptoms. Such cases generally do not necessitate hospitalization at COVID-19-designated medical facilities and can be adequately managed at home with appropriate medical guidance and monitoring. The heightened level of patient satisfaction observed in symptomatic individuals treated by HBIC is supported by an associated investigation conducted through a survey-based study (10, 16\u201318).\nWe identified a noteworthy connection between a high or very high satisfaction level and the frequency of phone call follow-ups in patients with COVID-19 symptoms. Essentially, for each increment of one in the frequency of phone call follow-ups, the chances of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction rose by a factor of 2.8 (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000). This tendency may be attributed to patients encountering difficulties during their healthcare facility stay, and regular communication with the follow-up team assists in addressing some of these challenges. As per the National HBIC Guideline, the frequency of phone call follow-ups escalates as the severity of the COVID-19 illness worsens, with follow-ups occurring once a week, every 3\u2009days until discharge, and daily until discharge (19). Correspondingly, individuals exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms had 2.0 times greater odds of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction than those with asymptomatic disease (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Cox regression analysis uncovered a negative correlation between the length of stay in HBIC patients with high or very high satisfaction and the frequency of phone calls, follow-ups, and in-person visits. Specifically, the number of phone calls and in-person visits (with a minimum of two visits) emerged as significant factors impacting the length of stay. Upon adjusting for other variables, it was observed that with each additional phone call, the length of stay in the hospital-based isolation center (HBIC) decreased by 46.3% (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000). Similarly, after accounting for other covariates, the length of stay among COVID-19 patients who had more than one in-person visit was 50.5% lower compared to patients with no in-person visits (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Finally, this investigation determined that symptomatic patients with Low or Moderate satisfaction had a greater likelihood of experiencing a larger Number of Phone Calls, In-Person follow-ups, and a longer stay at HBIC compared to patients with high or very high satisfaction.\nUser satisfaction and length of stay have shown dissimilar results in different latitudes. A study conducted in general and university hospitals in the Netherlands found no evidence of a correlation between the average length of stay in hospital wards and patient satisfaction (20). Several studies conducted at the Nancy University Hospital Center in France and in training hospitals in Turkey and Japan (21\u201323) have found a connection between prolonged lengths of stay and decreased patient satisfaction. These studies have highlighted the importance of environmental factors in influencing patient satisfaction (24). However, a distinct study carried out in teaching hospitals in Turkey discovered that patients who stayed longer expressed higher satisfaction levels than those with shorter stays (25). Despite these variations, one can speculate about the reasons for higher user satisfaction in patients with greater follow-ups. Among these reasons, it can be argued that it is well-documented that telemedicine technology has the potential to enhance the quality of primary medical care, shorten the duration of treatment, and decrease the number of severe hospitalization cases (17). Telemedicine expands the availability of medical services and broadens the range of medical care, which is particularly crucial in Ethiopia, with a fragmented healthcare system and limited coverage (26, 27). The sharing of medical resources is especially significant for rural or isolated areas, and telemedicine offers a greater abundance of advanced medical resources for primary hospital consultations in these vast rural regions, thereby enhancing the quality of medical and healthcare services (10, 28, 29).\nThe incorporation of telemedicine into the healthcare systems of low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as Ethiopia, has the potential to bring about cost savings and resource conservation in the long run. Consequently, this could alleviate the financial burden on individuals and enhance their access to affordable healthcare services (17). It is important to note that in many LMICs, a significant portion of overall health spending comes from out-of-pocket payments, as there is often no general health insurance available (30). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has further strained the already fragile healthcare systems in LMICs (10, 31). In this regard, telemedicine services could be crucial in relieving pressure on the healthcare system by saving time and resources and enhancing efficiency and accessibility. Additionally, telemedicine can facilitate social distancing measures and reduce the need for face-to-face interactions in hospitals and clinics, helping prevent the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 through physical contact (10, 32). Furthermore, telemedicine can also be instrumental in providing counseling and specific advice to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as guidance on prevention measures. Overall, the adoption of telemedicine in LMICs holds great potential for addressing healthcare challenges, reducing costs, and improving access to quality care. It can serve as a valuable tool in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthening healthcare systems in these countries (33).\nThroughout the initial three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, most patients seeking medical care were directed to the HBIC. This strategic decision is believed to have effectively alleviated the potential burden of cases and prevented burnout among the existing treatment facilities (2). The HBIC specifically caters to COVID-19 patients and represents our country\u2019s pioneering national telehealth service. Therefore, it is crucial to examine its operational experiences thoroughly. The focus should be on integrating functionalities that encourage community acceptance of this telehealth modality. As COVID-19 patients continue to be enrolled in the HBIC, the findings from this study will serve as a valuable resource for the Ministry of Health and COVID-19 response teams in their efforts to enhance the healthcare system. The HBIC framework offers a practical solution for healthcare providers who aim to extend their services to patients residing in remote areas. Moreover, the growing acceptance and familiarity with telemedicine visits, driven by the pandemic, are likely to shape the future landscape of healthcare delivery for both patients and providers.\nThe study\u2019s findings should be evaluated considering the strengths and limitations identified. The study\u2019s strength lies in the thorough selection process of participants from various sub-cities throughout the entire duration of the service. The research questions were also carefully developed using a validated tool and assessed for internal consistency, ensuring their comprehensibility.\n4.1 Limitations\nIt is important to acknowledge a limitation of the study, which is the potential recall bias introduced by enrolling most patients during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this limitation, this study is expected to pave the way for advancements in telemedical services in Ethiopia. Furthermore, it can potentially expand and incorporate other telemedicine care modalities, such as videoconferencing, in the future.\n5 Conclusion\nThe investigation evaluated patient satisfaction and length of stay in telemedicine services. The findings revealed that most patients, accounting for over 70.5%, reported high or very high satisfaction with these services. Notably, patients who received frequent follow-up phone calls and exhibited symptomatic COVID-19 disease expressed higher satisfaction. Additionally, it was observed that a higher frequency of phone calls and in-person visits resulted in a shorter stay in the Hospital-Based Isolation Center (HBIC). Consequently, it is crucial to consider the aforementioned factors to enhance patient satisfaction and reduce the length of stay in HBIC or other telemedicine services. It is worth mentioning that the HBIC, which caters specifically to COVID-19 patients, represents the first large-scale national telemedicine service implemented in our country. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly examine the experiences gained from this service, with particular attention given to incorporating features that facilitate community acceptance and reimbursement of this mode of healthcare delivery. Meanwhile, as the enrollment of COVID-19 patients in the HBIC continues, the findings of this study will serve as a valuable resource for guiding the Ministry of Health, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, and the COVID-19 response team in their efforts to improve the system.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving humans were approved by the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee.

Businesses that prioritize it enjoy greater loyalty, enhanced reputation, and increased sales. Bain & Company found that a 5% increase in customer retention can raise profits by 25% to 95%.\nWith 32% of customers willing to abandon a brand they love after a single bad experience, businesses must consistently deliver exceptional service. In the digital age, where reviews and word-of-mouth can make or break a brand, focusing on customer satisfaction not only retains existing clients but also attracts new ones. By addressing the key factors influencing customer satisfaction, businesses can build loyalty and drive growth.\nUnderstanding the factors that affect customer satisfaction is crucial for any business owner, or customer service manager aiming to thrive in today's competitive marketplace. By delving into deeper aspects, businesses can identify areas for improvement and tailor their strategies to meet customer expectations.\nWhat is customer satisfaction\nCustomer satisfaction refers to how well a company's products or services meet or exceed their customer's expectations. It's a critical measure of success, reflecting how happy customers are with what they\u2019ve purchased or experienced.\nWhen a business delivers on its promises \u2014 or better yet, exceeds them \u2014 it moves closer to achieving high levels of customer satisfaction. High levels of customer happiness often result in positive outcomes for businesses, such as loyalty, repeat business, positive word-of-mouth referrals, and a strong brand reputation. Conversely, low customer happiness can lead to churn, negative reviews, and a damaged brand image.\nBusinesses frequently use surveys, feedback forms, and metrics like Customer Satisfaction Scores (CSAT) and Net Promoter Score (NPS) to measure customer satisfaction, helping them identify areas for improvement. Various factors influence customer satisfaction, including product quality, customer support, ease of doing business, and the overall customer experience.\nWhy does customer satisfaction matter\nCustomer satisfaction is significant for several compelling reasons, impacting modern customer experiences in various ways:\n\nEncourages repeat business: Satisfied customers are more likely to return and make additional purchases, significantly contributing to the company's long-term revenue.\nFosters loyalty & reduces churn: High levels of customer satisfaction cultivate loyalty, making customers less inclined to switch to competitors. This loyalty not only lowers churn rates but also turns satisfied customers into brand advocates who are eager to recommend the company to others.\nAmplifies word-of-mouth marketing: Happy customers serve as powerful marketing allies. They are inclined to share positive experiences with friends, and family, and on social media, effectively acting as organic promoters of the brand's strengths. This form of word-of-mouth marketing is both highly effective and cost-efficient, rooted in genuine satisfaction and trust.\nEnhances brand reputation & competitive edge: In today's digital age, where online reviews can significantly impact a business, maintaining a strong brand reputation is crucial. Positive reviews and high satisfaction ratings establish a competitive advantage, attracting new customers who rely on the experiences of others when making purchasing decisions.\nPromotes continuous improvement: Monitoring customer satisfaction through surveys and feedback enables businesses to pinpoint both strengths and areas that require enhancement. This ongoing feedback loop empowers companies to evolve alongside their customer base, ensuring they remain relevant and responsive to changing needs and expectations.\nBoosts financial performance: Numerous studies have established a direct correlation between customer satisfaction and key business performance metrics such as sales growth, market share, and profitability. Satisfied customers typically spend more and engage in behaviors that enhance profitability, driving revenue without the proportional increase in marketing or acquisition costs usually associated with attracting new customers.\n\nBy focusing on key aspects like product quality, service efficiency, technological advancements, and personalization, businesses can cultivate a culture of customer satisfaction that drives success and growth. A robust customer support framework is essential for adapting to evolving consumer expectations and refining strategies for an enhanced overall customer experience.\n12 factors affecting customer satisfaction\nUnderstanding the factors that drive customer satisfaction is essential for any business seeking to prosper. By identifying and analyzing these factors, businesses can effectively adapt their customer satisfaction strategies to meet and exceed expectations. This ultimately strengthens client relationships and enhances their market position. Here are 12 essential factors influencing customer satisfaction:\n\nAccessibility\nEmpathy\nCommunication\nResponse time\nConvenience\nVariety of choices\nSimplicity\nQuality\nCompetitive pricing\nRecognition and appreciation\nLoyalty programs\nCommunity\n\nEach of these factors plays a crucial role in influencing customer satisfaction, thereby shaping the customer experience. Let\u2019s delve deeper into this list of the factors that influence customer satisfaction.\n1. Accessibility\nAccessibility is a measure of how easy it is to access your products and services. This can be supported through user-friendly websites or physical locations, thereby, creating a seamless experience that fosters trust and satisfaction.\nOffering multiple interaction channels\u2014like phone, email, and social media\u2014enhances the customer experience and positively influences satisfaction. When customers can easily connect with a business, it strengthens their satisfaction and fosters loyalty. Ultimately, prioritizing accessibility can significantly impact a company's success and reputation.\nMoxo streamlines communication and enhances the customer experience by consolidating resources, support, and services into one intuitive interface - a client portal. With everything at their fingertips, customers stay informed on the go, never missing important updates. This seamless interaction boosts satisfaction, fosters loyalty, and strengthens long-term relationships, ultimately elevating business success and reputation.\n2. Empathy\nEmpathy is an essential factor that contributes to building customer satisfaction and loyalty. It involves building customer relations by understanding and sharing customers' feelings through active listening and genuine care. By fostering emotional connections, brands build trust and loyalty. Moxo enhances personalized interactions as a centralized communication hub, ensuring no customer message is missed. With features like personalized messaging and video calls, you can foster authentic connections that boost customer satisfaction.\n3. Language\nClear communication is key to customer satisfaction. Using simple, relatable language helps avoid confusion, build rapport, and foster trust, enhancing the overall customer experience. Moxo enhances customer satisfaction by integrating text, email, voice, and video communication. Its user-friendly platform streamlines document sharing and real-time interactions, reducing miscommunication. With in-context messaging and spot commenting, Moxo fosters collaboration, helping businesses connect effectively and clients feel valued.\n4. Response time\nIn today's age of instant gratification, quick response times are crucial for businesses. Customers demand prompt answers, and companies that prioritize responsiveness not only meet those needs but also build stronger relationships and loyalty.\nMoxo enhances communication by replacing traditional emails with synced conversations, integrating multiple channels into one platform. This centralization streamlines customer interactions, speeds up issue resolution, and improves team collaboration, ultimately boosting response times and customer satisfaction.\n5. Convenience\nOne of the most important factors that contribute to customer satisfaction is convenience. Clients today demand services, which are served conveniently. It improves customer experiences by streamlining interactions, offering flexible payment options, easy returns, and user-friendly interfaces. Prioritizing convenience enhances satisfaction, loyalty, and repeat business, driving success and stronger connections.\nMoxo simplifies these interactions with seamless communication tools for messaging, video calls, and document sharing\u2014all on one platform. It enhances task and project management by setting deadlines for stakeholders, reducing the need for multiple apps. This streamlined approach ensures support is just a click away, boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty at every step.\n6. Choices\nProviding a range of options lets customers choose what best meets their unique needs, enhancing satisfaction and fostering a personalized experience. When customers feel in control, it boosts their confidence and loyalty, leading to a more positive relationship with the brand.\nMoxo stands out in the digital landscape by seamlessly integrating third-party tools and customizable workflows into its services. This streamlined approach simplifies workflows, enabling companies to utilize familiar applications without the hassle of managing multiple platforms.\n7. Simplicity\nSimplicity is essential for reducing frustration and enhancing the customer experience. Clear processes and intuitive designs foster trust and reliability, boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty. Moxo's client portals exemplify this with easy navigation, allowing hassle-free access to services. By eliminating complexity, Moxo stands out as a solution provider that truly understands client needs.\n8. Quality\nQuality of service or product is a crucial factor for customer satisfaction and business success. High-quality products and services not only exceed expectations but also build trust and loyalty. When customers feel valued, they are more likely to return and refer others.\n9. Reasonable prices\nCompetitive pricing is at the center of the list of factors that influence customer satisfaction. While customers undoubtedly seek quality products and excellent service, they also prioritize fairness and transparency in pricing. When businesses offer competitive rates, it attracts customers. By striking the right balance between quality and cost, businesses can create a positive experience that keeps customers coming back.\n10. Appreciation\nShowing appreciation to customers boosts their satisfaction. Simple gestures like personalized thank-you notes and tailored offers create lasting connections and encourage repeat business. Loyalty rewards programs foster a sense of community, enhancing the overall customer experience. Moxo exemplifies this by engaging in feedback loops to understand user needs, ensuring customers feel valued. Quick response times and regular product updates reinforce trust and satisfaction, ultimately fostering loyalty and long-term success.\n11. Loyalty programs\nLoyalty programs incentivize repeat business by rewarding customers with points, discounts, or exclusive perks. These programs offer one of the best ways to influence customer satisfaction. They enhance customer retention, deepen brand connections, and make customers feel valued. By encouraging ongoing engagement, these programs foster long-term relationships and increase satisfaction.\n12. Community\nCreating a community around a brand boosts customer satisfaction and loyalty. When customers feel connected, they build trust and engagement, leading to positive word-of-mouth. This connection not only fosters loyalty but also helps cultivate a vibrant ecosystem, driving customer retention and long-term success.\nExploring strategies to foster loyalty and ensure customer satisfaction reveals that these efforts enhance the customer experience and support sustainable business growth. Now, we\u2019ll understand how prioritizing customer happiness drives overall business performance, leading to improved profitability, reduced churn rates, and a stronger brand reputation. Let\u2019s delve into the vital link between customer satisfaction and business success.\nHow improving customer satisfaction boosts business\nImproving customer satisfaction directly boosts business success. Satisfied customers tend to make repeat purchases, leave positive reviews, and refer others, leading to lower churn rates and increased market share. High satisfaction translates into tangible growth, measurable through key performance indicators (KPIs). Here are a few important ones:\n\nNet Promoter Score (NPS): The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a primary KPI influenced by customer satisfaction. It measures the likelihood of customers recommending a business to others. A high NPS signifies strong customer loyalty and can result in increased customer acquisition as satisfied clients become enthusiastic brand advocates.\nCustomer Lifetime Value (CLV): Another crucial KPI impacted by customer satisfaction is Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). Satisfied customers are more likely to remain loyal over time, contributing significantly to revenue growth. By enhancing CLV, businesses can reduce acquisition costs and allocate resources more effectively, fostering further growth.\nCustomer Effort Score (CES): Customer satisfaction also affects the Customer Effort Score (CES), which assesses how easy it is to do business with a company. A lower effort score indicates higher satisfaction and can drastically cut operational costs related to support and service. This efficiency not only boosts profitability but also strengthens competitive advantage in crowded markets.\n\nInvesting in customer satisfaction leads to an upward spiral of business benefits: from fostering loyalty and advocacy to optimizing operational efficiency and improving financial performance. By prioritizing customer happiness, companies set themselves on a path toward sustainable growth and long-term success.\nHow Moxo enhances client experience and satisfaction\nMoxo enhances client experience and satisfaction with innovative solutions that streamline communication and simplify processes.

More information is available at the\u202fCDC\u2019s website.\nWhere can I get a vaccine?\nVaccines are administered at retail pharmacies, including Walgreens, Walmart and CVS, clinics and other locations, such as doctor\u2019s offices. Use the federal government\u2019s website Vaccines.gov to search for vaccination sites by ZIP code. Get the same information by texting your ZIP code to 438829 or by calling 800-232-0233. You can check with your primary care physician\u2019s office to see if COVID-19 vaccinations are offered. If you are a veteran, the Department of Veterans Affairs offers COVID-19 vaccinations at VA facilities. Sign up online or call 800-827-1000 to make an appointment.More information about COVID-19 vaccines is available at the Florida Department of Health\u2019s Florida COVID-19 Response website and on the department\u2019s Facebook page. You can also call one of the department\u2019s local health offices, which are listed at the top right-hand side of the department\u2019s home page under \u201cCounties.\u201d Get advice for finding or requesting your vaccination records on the Florida Department of Health\u2019s website or visit Florida SHOTS, a free, online, statewide immunization system.\nDo I have to pay for the vaccination?\nThe federal government no longer covers the cost of the vaccines, but most people with Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance will not have to pay out of pocket for the shot.If you are uninsured, contact your local or state public health department or a nearby federally qualified health center about vaccination opportunities.Children 18 and younger may qualify to receive no-cost or low-cost vaccines through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program.Florida residents can check whether they qualify for the Vaccines for Adults (VFA) Program or Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program.\nWhat should I bring to my vaccine appointment?\nSome vaccination sites ask for proof of identity or eligibility. Bring a driver\u2019s license or other state-issued ID that shows your name, age and state residency, along with your health insurance card.\nDo I need to bring my vaccine card?\n The CDC no longer distributes vaccine cards, and\u202fthey are not required to receive a vaccine. If you\u2019ve lost your vaccine card, you can call the site where you were vaccinated to request a new one or a copy of your vaccination record. You can also contact the Florida Department of Health to get a copy of your record.\nWhat are the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine?\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to experience mild to moderate side effects after getting vaccinated, such as soreness in the arm, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, nausea, fever or chills \u2014 but these are temporary \u201cand normal signs that your body is building protection,\u201d the CDC says.A small number of vaccine recipients have experienced adverse reactions to the shots.\nCan I get the COVID-19, RSV and flu vaccines at the same time?\nAccording to the CDC, it is safe to receive the flu vaccine and updated COVID-19 vaccines simultaneously, although you are a little more likely to experience side effects, such as a headache and fatigue. Adults 75 or older (and those 60 to 74 with certain underlying health conditions) who are encouraged to get the RSV vaccine may receive that at the same time as the others, but some health experts suggest\u202fspacing them out. If you had the RSV vaccine last year, you don\u2019t need another one this year.Contact your health care provider for more information.\nHow are vaccinations working in nursing homes and long-term care facilities?\nThe U.S. government no longer distributes COVID-19 vaccines to long-term care facilities. That means nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other long-term care settings are responsible for coordinating COVID-19 vaccination programs for their residents and staff. Most long-term care facilities have partnerships with pharmacies or health departments to provide vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and other illnesses. Long-term care facilities that receive Medicare and/or Medicaid dollars are required by\u202ffederal law\u202fto educate residents, their representatives and staff about COVID-19 vaccines and offer a COVID-19 vaccine to residents, resident representatives and staff.\nHow protected am I postvaccination?\nAll vaccines reduce the risk of COVID-19 infections and are highly effective at preventing severe illness and death from the disease. No vaccine is 100 percent effective, and infections can still occur postvaccination.\nHow can I avoid COVID-19 scams?\u00a0\nBe aware that scammers often purport to offer COVID-19 vaccines and treatments and try to charge for them. The \u202fAARP Fraud Watch Network is tracking the latest scams.Florida residents who believe they\u2019ve encountered a COVID-19 scam can report it to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General by calling 800-447-8477 or by submitting a complaint online.Editor's note: This guide was last published Oct. 5, 2023, and has been updated with new information.Michelle Tuccitto Sullo is a contributing writer covering state and federal policy.

Updated COVID vaccines are chosen to target the variants currently circulating and are recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older.\nIn this Q&A, Andy Pekosz, PhD, a professor in Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, discusses who the updated vaccine is recommended for, when to get yours, whether it\u2019s safe to get it alongside other seasonal vaccines.\nWhat\u2019s new about this year\u2019s updated COVID vaccines?\nThe updated mRNA COVID vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer are based on the KP.2 strain, one of the FLiRT variants that have been spreading since early spring. These variants and their sub-variants have caused the majority of infections during this summer\u2019s COVID wave.\nWho should be getting an updated COVID vaccine?\nEveryone 6 months and older should get vaccinated against COVID, according to the CDC\u2019s recommendations.\nFor children ages 6 months to 4 years: Vaccination is recommended, but the number of vaccinations is based on which vaccine they receive, their age, and whether they\u2019ve received a previous COVID vaccine. Parents and guardians should refer to CDC guidance and check with their pediatrician to see what\u2019s recommended for their child.\nFor people ages 5 years and up: One dose of the updated COVID vaccine is recommended, regardless of whether they\u2019ve been vaccinated previously. If someone has received a COVID vaccine recently, they should wait at least two months before getting the updated one for this season.\nAccording to updated CDC guidelines, individuals who are immunocompromised may receive additional doses with their health care provider\u2019s guidance.\nWhen is the best time to get vaccinated?\nThis summer\u2019s surge has been larger and lasted longer than many experts anticipated, making it a little trickier than years past to determine the best time to get vaccinated.\nPeople who have not had COVID in the past few months have a couple options:\n\nGet the updated COVID vaccine as soon as it\u2019s available\u00a0(late August, early September) to protect yourself as the wave of summer infections continues.\nGet the updated COVID vaccine around mid-October to build protection in time for the rise of cases that typically occur around November through January.\n\nPeople at higher risk of severe illness should consider getting an updated COVID vaccine as soon as possible. Everyone who is eligible should get an updated COVID vaccine by mid-October in order to build immunity ahead of holiday travel and gatherings. Remember, it takes about two weeks to build up immunity following a vaccine, so schedule your vaccination accordingly.\nHow long does protection last after I'm vaccinated?\nBroadly speaking, the COVID vaccine provides strong protection against infection for up to three months and protection against severe disease out to six months. That said, there are a lot of variables that can affect duration and strength of protection, including any new variants that may emerge and how different they are from the vaccine formulation.\nIf I had COVID recently, when should I get the updated vaccine?\nIf you\u2019ve had COVID this summer, you\u2019ll have strong infection-based immunity and can wait a few months after your infection before getting the vaccine. According to the CDC, you can wait three months since your symptoms began or, for asymptomatic cases, since you first tested positive.\nThere\u2019s some evidence to support waiting as long as six months after a COVID infection to receive an updated vaccine. Waiting longer than the CDC\u2019s guidance of three months is not recommended for high-risk groups, but it\u2019s something people can discuss with their doctor.\nHow should I choose which COVID vaccine to get?\nBetween the two mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer, there is no reason to get one over the other. They target the same KP.2 variant, are similarly effective, and elicit similar side effects.\nIs the COVID vaccine free?\nThe COVID vaccine is free under most health insurance plans and Medicare.\nIf you don\u2019t have insurance to cover the cost of the COVID vaccine, look for vaccination clinics run by your local or state health department. Children under 18 may also be eligible to get a free COVID vaccine through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program.\nYou can find local pharmacies offering COVID vaccines at Vaccines.gov or by contacting your health care provider or local health department.\nAre there any side effects to the updated COVID vaccine?\nThe common side effects are the same as with previous COVID vaccines. Symptoms like soreness at the injection site, achiness or joint pain, fatigue, slight fever, chills, or nausea are normal and not cause for concern. These side effects are a sign that your body is mounting an immune response\u2014exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do following a vaccine. Side effects generally subside within a day or two.\nIf I haven\u2019t gotten any COVID vaccines yet, can I start with this one?\nIf you\u2019ve never been vaccinated against COVID, now is a great time to start. People 5 years of age and older are considered up to date on COVID vaccination once they receive one dose of an updated mRNA COVID vaccine.\nHow well does the vaccine protect against the variants currently circulating?\nThe vaccine is a close match to variants currently circulating and provides good protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. While KP.2 is not causing a significant number of infections, the most prevalent variants circulating right now are very closely related to them. The vaccine will never be a perfect match to the circulating variants because it takes 2-4 months to make the vaccine, and during that time the virus continues to change as it infects people.\nIs vaccine-induced immunity better than immunity from infection?\nVaccine-induced immunity is better because it\u2019s safer. When you get infected with COVID, symptoms from the infection wreak havoc on your body. Whether or not you\u2019ve been infected or vaccinated previously, the updated COVID vaccine is going to strengthen your immune responses to high levels and do so in a safe way.\nCan I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated?\nPeople who are vaccinated can still get COVID, but it is much more likely they will experience mild symptoms. Vaccinated people are much less likely to experience severe illness or get so sick that they need to be hospitalized. Data continue to show that those who are hospitalized with COVID are largely people who have not received a COVID vaccine within the past 12 months.\nParticularly for people at higher risk of severe COVID, vaccination is an essential tool for reducing COVID complications, hospitalization, and death.\nCan you get the flu shot and the COVID vaccine at the same time?\nYes! In fact, studies have shown that people who decide to spread out their vaccines into separate appointments often don\u2019t follow through with getting both. We\u2019ve also seen that the immune response generated by each vaccine does not change based on whether they are administered at the same time or separately.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that many of the same populations at high risk of experiencing severe illness from COVID are also at high risk of severe influenza. Especially for these vulnerable populations, it\u2019s a good idea to time your vaccines together.\nWhen might we see a combined COVID and flu vaccine?\nSome vaccine manufacturers have been working on developing a combined vaccine for COVID and flu, but we\u2019re not there yet. We certainly won\u2019t see a combined vaccine this year. It\u2019s possible one will be ready in time for fall 2025, but we won\u2019t know for sure until more clinical trial results are available.\nAliza Rosen is a digital content strategist in the Office of External Affairs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nRelated Articles:\n\nUnderstanding the CDC\u2019s Updated COVID Isolation Guidance\nWhat to Know About COVID FLiRT Variants\nThe Long History of mRNA Vaccines\n\nRelated Content\n\nA \u2018Critical Pathogen\u2019: The Rise of Drug-Resistant Fungal Diseases\nAugust 27, 2024\n\nWhy We\u2019re Still Waiting for a Pandemic Treaty\nAugust 12, 2024\n\nWhy COVID Surges in the Summer\nAugust 07, 2024\n\nThe Visible and Unseen Dangers Lurking in Floodwater\nJuly 30, 2024\n\nPublic Health Prep for the 2024 Paris Olympics\nJuly 24, 2024\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\n615 N.

Updated COVID vaccines are chosen to target the variants currently circulating and are recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older.\nIn this Q&A, Andy Pekosz, PhD, a professor in Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, discusses who the updated vaccine is recommended for, when to get yours, whether it\u2019s safe to get it alongside other seasonal vaccines.\nWhat\u2019s new about this year\u2019s updated COVID vaccines?\nThe updated mRNA COVID vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer are based on the KP.2 strain, one of the FLiRT variants that have been spreading since early spring. These variants and their sub-variants have caused the majority of infections during this summer\u2019s COVID wave.\nWho should be getting an updated COVID vaccine?\nEveryone 6 months and older should get vaccinated against COVID, according to the CDC\u2019s recommendations.\nFor children ages 6 months to 4 years: Vaccination is recommended, but the number of vaccinations is based on which vaccine they receive, their age, and whether they\u2019ve received a previous COVID vaccine. Parents and guardians should refer to CDC guidance and check with their pediatrician to see what\u2019s recommended for their child.\nFor people ages 5 years and up: One dose of the updated COVID vaccine is recommended, regardless of whether they\u2019ve been vaccinated previously. If someone has received a COVID vaccine recently, they should wait at least two months before getting the updated one for this season.\nAccording to updated CDC guidelines, individuals who are immunocompromised may receive additional doses with their health care provider\u2019s guidance.\nWhen is the best time to get vaccinated?\nThis summer\u2019s surge has been larger and lasted longer than many experts anticipated, making it a little trickier than years past to determine the best time to get vaccinated.\nPeople who have not had COVID in the past few months have a couple options:\n\nGet the updated COVID vaccine as soon as it\u2019s available\u00a0(late August, early September) to protect yourself as the wave of summer infections continues.\nGet the updated COVID vaccine around mid-October to build protection in time for the rise of cases that typically occur around November through January.\n\nPeople at higher risk of severe illness should consider getting an updated COVID vaccine as soon as possible. Everyone who is eligible should get an updated COVID vaccine by mid-October in order to build immunity ahead of holiday travel and gatherings. Remember, it takes about two weeks to build up immunity following a vaccine, so schedule your vaccination accordingly.\nHow long does protection last after I'm vaccinated?\nBroadly speaking, the COVID vaccine provides strong protection against infection for up to three months and protection against severe disease out to six months. That said, there are a lot of variables that can affect duration and strength of protection, including any new variants that may emerge and how different they are from the vaccine formulation.\nIf I had COVID recently, when should I get the updated vaccine?\nIf you\u2019ve had COVID this summer, you\u2019ll have strong infection-based immunity and can wait a few months after your infection before getting the vaccine. According to the CDC, you can wait three months since your symptoms began or, for asymptomatic cases, since you first tested positive.\nThere\u2019s some evidence to support waiting as long as six months after a COVID infection to receive an updated vaccine. Waiting longer than the CDC\u2019s guidance of three months is not recommended for high-risk groups, but it\u2019s something people can discuss with their doctor.\nHow should I choose which COVID vaccine to get?\nBetween the two mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer, there is no reason to get one over the other. They target the same KP.2 variant, are similarly effective, and elicit similar side effects.\nIs the COVID vaccine free?\nThe COVID vaccine is free under most health insurance plans and Medicare.\nIf you don\u2019t have insurance to cover the cost of the COVID vaccine, look for vaccination clinics run by your local or state health department. Children under 18 may also be eligible to get a free COVID vaccine through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program.\nYou can find local pharmacies offering COVID vaccines at Vaccines.gov or by contacting your health care provider or local health department.\nAre there any side effects to the updated COVID vaccine?\nThe common side effects are the same as with previous COVID vaccines. Symptoms like soreness at the injection site, achiness or joint pain, fatigue, slight fever, chills, or nausea are normal and not cause for concern. These side effects are a sign that your body is mounting an immune response\u2014exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do following a vaccine. Side effects generally subside within a day or two.\nIf I haven\u2019t gotten any COVID vaccines yet, can I start with this one?\nIf you\u2019ve never been vaccinated against COVID, now is a great time to start. People 5 years of age and older are considered up to date on COVID vaccination once they receive one dose of an updated mRNA COVID vaccine.\nHow well does the vaccine protect against the variants currently circulating?\nThe vaccine is a close match to variants currently circulating and provides good protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. While KP.2 is not causing a significant number of infections, the most prevalent variants circulating right now are very closely related to them. The vaccine will never be a perfect match to the circulating variants because it takes 2-4 months to make the vaccine, and during that time the virus continues to change as it infects people.\nIs vaccine-induced immunity better than immunity from infection?\nVaccine-induced immunity is better because it\u2019s safer. When you get infected with COVID, symptoms from the infection wreak havoc on your body. Whether or not you\u2019ve been infected or vaccinated previously, the updated COVID vaccine is going to strengthen your immune responses to high levels and do so in a safe way.\nCan I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated?\nPeople who are vaccinated can still get COVID, but it is much more likely they will experience mild symptoms. Vaccinated people are much less likely to experience severe illness or get so sick that they need to be hospitalized. Data continue to show that those who are hospitalized with COVID are largely people who have not received a COVID vaccine within the past 12 months.\nParticularly for people at higher risk of severe COVID, vaccination is an essential tool for reducing COVID complications, hospitalization, and death.\nCan you get the flu shot and the COVID vaccine at the same time?\nYes! In fact, studies have shown that people who decide to spread out their vaccines into separate appointments often don\u2019t follow through with getting both. We\u2019ve also seen that the immune response generated by each vaccine does not change based on whether they are administered at the same time or separately.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that many of the same populations at high risk of experiencing severe illness from COVID are also at high risk of severe influenza. Especially for these vulnerable populations, it\u2019s a good idea to time your vaccines together.\nWhen might we see a combined COVID and flu vaccine?\nSome vaccine manufacturers have been working on developing a combined vaccine for COVID and flu, but we\u2019re not there yet. We certainly won\u2019t see a combined vaccine this year. It\u2019s possible one will be ready in time for fall 2025, but we won\u2019t know for sure until more clinical trial results are available.\nAliza Rosen is a digital content strategist in the Office of External Affairs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nRelated Articles:\n\nUnderstanding the CDC\u2019s Updated COVID Isolation Guidance\nWhat to Know About COVID FLiRT Variants\nThe Long History of mRNA Vaccines\n\nRelated Content\n\nA \u2018Critical Pathogen\u2019: The Rise of Drug-Resistant Fungal Diseases\nAugust 27, 2024\n\nWhy We\u2019re Still Waiting for a Pandemic Treaty\nAugust 12, 2024\n\nWhy COVID Surges in the Summer\nAugust 07, 2024\n\nThe Visible and Unseen Dangers Lurking in Floodwater\nJuly 30, 2024\n\nPublic Health Prep for the 2024 Paris Olympics\nJuly 24, 2024\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\n615 N.

      "\u2022 Varicella activity increased from last month and was above the previous 5-year average. \u2022 106 cases were reported in March. \u2022 Hepatitis A activity decreased from last month and was below the previous 5-year average. \u2022 11 cases were reported in March. \u2022 Meningococcal disease activity increased from last month and was above the previous 5-year average. \u2022 6 cases were reported in March. \u2022 Pertussis activity increased from last month and was above the previous 5-year average. \u2022 24 cases were reported in March. March 2024 April 2023 March 2024 April 2023 Unvaccinated children are at increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases like mumps, pertussis, and varicella. Communities with a higher proportion of religious exemptions (REs) to vaccination are at increased risk of vaccine-preventable disease transmission. The proportion of children age 4-18 years with new REs are increasing each month. Statewide, the estimated prevalence of REs among children age 4\u201318 years old is 5.5% with individual counties ranging from 1.0\u201312.5%. In March 2023, the statewide prevalence was 4.9% and the prevalence has gradually increased since. To learn more about REs at the local level, please visit FloridaHealth.gov/ REmap For all vaccine-preventable diseases, timely and complete vaccination is the best way to prevent infection. Although vaccinated individuals can still become infected with diseases like pertussis or varicella, in general, those who have received at least 1 dose of vaccine have less severe outcomes than those who have never been vaccinated for the disease. Posted April 29, 2024 on the Bureau of Epidemiology (BOE) website: FloridaHealth.gov/VPD Produced by the BOE, Florida Department of Health Vaccine-Preventable Disease Surveillance Report March 2024 The rate of religious exemptions is likely higher than the rate presented in this report. This is due to eligible persons with religious exemptions who have opted out of Florida SHOTS and persons who have had their religious exemptions processed outside of the Florida SHOTS system. The map above includes REs registered in Florida SHOTS through March 31, 2024. March 2024 April 2023 Meningococcal Disease Pertussis Hepatitis A Varicella 6 March 2024 April 2023 11 24 106 Map 3 Hepatitis A Surveillance March Key Points In March 2024, 11 hepatitis A cases were reported in 4 counties. The number of reported hepatitis A cases in March decreased from the previous month and was below the previous 5-year average. In 2024, 28 hepatitis A cases were reported. The best way to prevent hepatitis A infection is through vaccination. In March 2024, 64% of cases were not up-to-date on hepatitis A vaccinations and 18% of cases had unknown hepatitis A vaccination status. Since 2006, hepatitis A vaccine has been recommended for all children at age 1 year. Hepatitis A vaccine is also recommended for certain adult high-risk groups, including persons using injection and non-injection drugs, persons experiencing homelessness, and men who have sex with men. To learn more about the hepatitis A vaccine, talk to your doctor or visit: www.CDC.gov/Vaccines/HCP/VIS/VIS-Statements/Hep-A.html. 40-49 year olds had the highest incidence *The white bars indicate the total number of cases as of March for each year 11 cases 18% of cases linked to other cases 64% of cases were not up-to-date and 18% of cases had unknown vaccination status In 2024, 40-49 year olds have the highest incidence rate at 0.28 cases per 100,000 population. In March 2024, 2 cases were epidemiologically (epi) linked to another case. Varicella Surveillance Hepatitis A Surveillance National activity Hepatitis A rates have decreased by more than 95% since the first vaccine became available in 1995. However, since outbreaks were first identified in 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been monitoring outbreaks in 37 states. More information about these outbreaks can be found here: www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/ outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm Hepatitis A surveillance goals \u2022 Identify cases to limit transmission \u2022 Identify and prevent outbreaks \u2022 Monitor effectiveness of immunization programs and vaccines To learn more about hepatitis A, please visit FloridaHealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vaccine-preventable-disease/hepatitis-a. For more information on the data sources used in Florida for hepatitis A surveillance, see the last page of this report. In March 2024, no cases were co-infected with chronic hepatitis C and no cases were co-infected with chronic hepatitis B. Co-infection with more than one type of viral hepatitis can lead to more severe liver disease and increase the risk of developing liver cancer. In March 2024, there was an average of 1 contact to reported cases. Contacts are those who were exposed to the virus and recommended prophylaxis for illness prevention. Epi linked cases Total cases Varicella Surveillance Hepatitis A Surveillance ! Vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A infection. Health care providers are encouraged to actively offer the hepatitis A vaccine to individuals at risk including men who have sex with men. For more information about hepatitis A vaccination in Florida visit: https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/ hepatitis/hepatitis-vaccination-testing-program.html Hepatitis A infections can be severe, leading to inpatient hospitalization and sometimes death. In 2024, 18 cases (64%) reported in Florida have been hospitalized due to hepatitis A infection. No deaths have been identified as hepatitis A associated in 2024. The Florida Department of Health is actively working to vaccinate those most at risk for hepatitis A infection. In March 2024, 3,940 doses were administered. The number of first doses of hepatitis A vaccine administered by both private providers and county health departments to adults age 18 years and older, as recorded in Florida SHOTS, increased and was below the previous 5-year-average. Vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A infection. In 2024, 39% of the 28 cases in Florida reported the risk factor of travel outside of the U.S. and 4% of cases reported the risk factor of men who have sex with men. No cases reported drug use or recent homelessness. Household-associated Outbreak-associated Total cases *The white bars indicate the total number of cases as of March for each year Pertussis Surveillance In March 2024, five pertussis cases were household-associated. One pertussis cases was outbreak-associated. In the past 6 months, there was an average of 3 household-associated cases, an average of 1 outbreak-associated cases and an average of 14 total cases. From October 2022 to March 2023, there was an average of 0 household-associated cases, an average of 0 outbreak-associated cases and an average of 6 total cases. For most pertussis cases, exposure to other known cases is not identified and are not able to be linked to outbreaks. Map 3 March Key Points 84 cases in the past 6 months One outbreak of 2 cases 24 cases The number of pertussis cases reported in March increased from the previous month and was above the previous 5-year average. <1 year olds had the highest 6 month average incidence In 2024, 55 pertussis cases were reported. In March 2024, 24 pertussis cases were reported in 14 counties, outlined in black in the map below. From January 2023 through March 2024 the average county rates varied throughout the state. There was an average of 2 contacts per case between October 2022 and March 2023 and between October 2023 and March 2024. Contacts are classified as people whom antibiotics were recommended to prevent illness. Antibiotics can shorten the amount of time cases are contagious and can also be used to prevent illness in those exposed. Understanding pertussis transmission is a key factor in decreasing pertussis infections. In Florida, transmission setting is not routinely identified for non-outbreak cases, resulting in 82% of cases reporting unknown setting in 2024. Pertussis Surveillance October 2023 to March 2024 October 2022 to March 2023 The average incidence rate was highest among <1 year olds at 0.775 cases per 100,000 population between October 2023 and March 2024. Infants experience the greatest burden of pertussis infections, not only in number of cases but also in severity. Infants <2 months old are too young to receive vaccinations against pertussis, which is why vaccination of parents, siblings, grandparents, and other age groups is important in infection prevention among infants. In 2024, over half of cases reported were not up-to-date on their pertussis vaccinations. In general, those who have received at least one pertussis vaccination have less severe outcomes than those who have never been vaccinated. If a person was born before January 1st, 1982, the current pertussis immunization recommendation would not have been implemented when they were receiving their childhood immunizations. Based on the case\u2019s age, 11 cases would not have been vaccinated under the current childhood immunization recommendations. Pertussis surveillance goals \u2022 Identify cases to limit transmission in settings with infants or others who may transmit pertussis to infants \u2022 Identify and prevent outbreaks \u2022 Identify transmission settings in non-outbreak cases to prevent the spread of sporadic cases \u2022 Identify contacts of cases and recommend appropriate prevention measures, including exclusion, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunization \u2022 Monitor the effectiveness of immunization programs and vaccines To learn more about pertussis, please visit FloridaHealth.gov/Pertussis. For more information on the data sources used in Florida for pertussis surveillance, see the last page of this report. National activity The number of pertussis cases gradually increased since the 1980s, peaking in 2012 at levels not seen since the 1950s. Since 2012, the number of pertussis cases started gradually decreasing. Pertussis incidence has remained highest among infants <1 year old and lowest among adults \u226520 years old since the 1990s. Pertussis Surveillance Meningococcal disease rates have been declining in Florida with more than 150 cases reported annually 25 years ago to 27 cases reported in 2021, as vaccination rates have increased. Rates of disease have been stable over the last 5 years with an exception to 2022. The number of reported meningococcal cases is higher in 2022 than previous years. The last time meningococcal cases exceeded 65 cases in a year was 2007 at 67 cases reported in 25 counties. *The white bars indicate the total number of cases as of March for each year March Key Points The number of meningococcal disease cases reported in March 2024 increased from the previous month and was above the previous 5 year average. Meningococcal Disease Surveillance 6 cases In 2024, 13 meningococcal disease cases were reported in 9 counties. 100% of cases not vaccinated for meningococcal disease. Vaccines can help prevent meningococcal disease. In March 2024, 100% of reported cases were not vaccinated for meningococcal disease. There are currently two types of meningococcal vaccines available in the United States: Meningococcal conjugate or MenACWY vaccines and Serogroup B meningococcal or MenB vaccines. Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) recommends meningococcal disease vaccination for all preteens and teens as well as other children and adults who are at increased risk of meningococcal disease. To learn more about the meningococcal vaccine, talk to your doctor or visit: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mening/public/index.html 24 cases in the past 6 months 0% of cases linked to other cases National and International activity Meningococcal disease rates are at a historic low in the United States. Rates have been declining since the 1990s and currently remain low. In 2021, there were about 210 total cases of meningococcal disease reported (incidence rate of 0.06 cases per 100,000 persons). Meningococcal outbreaks are rare in the United States and only about 1 in 20 cases is related to outbreaks. Meningococcal disease occurs worldwide. The highest incidence of disease is found in the \u2019meningitis belt\u2019 located in sub-Saharan Africa. This region experiences large-scale epidemics every 5 to 12 years. Epidemics during the dry season (December-June) reach up to 1,000 cases per 100,000 population. More information can be found at https:// www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/global.html Meningococcal disease surveillance goals \u2022 Identify cases to limit transmission and prevent outbreaks by implementing control measures \u2022 Collect data on key variables for monitoring meningococcal disease \u2022 Monitor effectiveness of immunization programs and vaccines In 2024, the meningococcal disease rate was highest among <1 years at 0.859 cases per 100,000 population. Meningococcal Disease Surveillance In 2024, among reported cases, 100% of reported cases were seen in the emergency department and 85% of reported cases were hospitalized. In 2024, 1 death was identified as being associated to meningococcal disease. The best protection against meningococcal disease is keeping up-to-date with recommended vaccines. Meningococcal disease can often be severe leading to inpatient hospitalization and sometimes death. According to the CDC, about 10 to 15 in 100 people with meningococcal disease will die. Up to 1 in 5 survivors will have long-term disabilities which may include: loss of limb/s, deafness, nervous system problems, brain damage. More information can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/clinical-info.html *The white bars indicate the total number of cases as of March for each year The number of varicella cases reported in March 2024 increased from the previous month and was above the previous 5-year average. Due to robust vaccination programs, there is no longer discernable seasonality for varicella cases in the United States. In March 2024, 106 varicella cases were reported in 17 counties, outlined in black in the map below. From January 2023 through March 2024 the average county rates varied throughout the state. Map 3 Varicella Surveillance March Key Points 106 cases Two new outbreaks In 2024*, 216 varicella cases were reported. The annual number of reported varicella cases increased from 2018 to 2019 and decreased significantly in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Cases reported in 2023 returned to levels similarly observed prior to the 2020 pandemic. *CDC MMWR report year 80% cases not up-to-date or unknown vaccination status In March, the varicella rate was highest among 1-5 year olds at 2.54 cases per 100,000 population. 1-5 year olds had the highest incidence Varicella Surveillance Household-associated Outbreak-associated Total cases National activity Varicella incidence decreased significantly following the vaccine becoming available in 1995 and has continued to decrease since 2006 when recommendations changed from 1 to 2 doses of varicella vaccine. From 2006 to 2015, all age groups had a substantial decrease in incidence with the largest decline in children aged 5 to 14 years. Although varicella is not reported to the CDC by all states, based on available data, the number of varicella cases nationally has steadily decreased each year from 2012 to 2015. Varicella surveillance goals \u2022 Identify and control outbreaks, monitor trends, and identify severe outcomes \u2022 Identify transmission settings in non-outbreak cases to prevent the spread of sporadic cases \u2022 Monitor effectiveness of immunization programs and vaccines To learn more about varicella, please visit FloridaHealth.gov/Varicella. For more information on the data sources used in Florida for varicella surveillance, see the last page of this report. In March, 9 cases were household-associated and 44 case were outbreak-associated. For most varicella cases, exposure to other known cases is not identified. In Florida, transmission setting is not routinely identified for non-outbreak cases resulting in 45% of cases reporting unknown setting in March. People with shingles infection can transmit the virus that causes varicella to people without immunity. In March, 10 cases reported contact with someone diagnosed with shingles during their exposure period. In March 2024, 80% of individuals reported with varicella had not received the recommended number of varicella vaccinations for their age or had unknown vaccination status. Vaccination against varicella is important for infants, children, teenagers, and adults. If a person was born before July 1, 1994, the current varicella immunization recommendation would not have been implemented when they were receiving their childhood immunizations. Based on the case\u2019s age, 45 cases in 2024 would not have been vaccinated under the current childhood immunization recommendations. In 2024, the majority of adults aged 19 years and older with varicella were not up-to-date on their varicella vaccinations or had unknown vaccination status. Although individuals who have been vaccinated can still develop varicella, complete and timely vaccination remains the best way to prevent varicella and severe complications. Case Data \u2022 Current case data are preliminary and will change as new information is gathered. The most recent data available are displayed in this report. \u2022 Case data is calculated using CDC MMWR Report Year. \u2022 Pertussis, varicella, hepatitis A and meningococcal disease are reportable diseases in Florida. Case information is documented by county health department (CHD) epidemiologists in Merlin, Florida\u2019s reportable disease surveillance system. \u2022 Only Florida residents are included in case counts, but contact investigations are conducted for all exposed individuals. \u2022 Pertussis, varicella, hepatitis A, and meningococcal disease case counts include both confirmed and probable cases. \u2022 Map counts and rates are determined by the individual\u2019s county of residence; these data do not take into account location of exposure. \u2022 CHD epidemiologists also report outbreaks of pertussis, varicella, hepatitis A, and meningococcal disease into Merlin. \uf0e0 Household-associated cases are defined as \u22652 cases exposed within the same household. \uf0e0 Pertussis outbreaks are defined as \u22652 cases associated with a specific setting outside of a household. \uf0e0 Varicella outbreaks are defined as \u22653 cases associated with a specific setting outside of a household. \uf0e0 An outbreak for meningococcal disease occurs when there are multiple cases of the same serogroup in community or institution over a short period of time.

A qualitative study was planned to understand the barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation program at rural and tribal areas. The study participants were medical officers from rural and tribal areas who actively planned and implemented COVID-19 vaccination at the primary health centre.\u00a0A total of 30 medical officers were interviewed.\u00a0Interview questions were focussed on the planning of COVID-19 vaccination in their area. Other questions were the problem faced during the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program and how it has been tackled.\nResults\nThe factors identified were grouped into three groups: Health system factors, Human resource factors and Community level factors.\u00a0Health system factors like shortage of vaccines and syringes, tablet paracetamol, online digital method of vaccination registration, overcrowding at the initial stage, and inadequate infrastructure were barriers to vaccination. Fear about vaccine adverse events, even in healthcare workers (HCWs), and overburdened healthcare workers were also factors affecting vaccination. At the community level, high resistance initially and misconception about the vaccine, and also the fear about post-vaccination side effects have an impact on the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural and tribal areas.\nConclusion\nThe successful vaccination rate among the population needs community leadership and a community-centred approach when conducting outreach and strengthening primary health care in terms of infrastructure, manpower, and capacity building of healthcare staff.\nKeywords: india, vaccination, outreach, barriers, facilitators, covid-19\nIntroduction\nOne of the greatest advancements in public health of the 20th century was the development of vaccines to prevent communicable diseases, which have prevented millions of deaths and saved billions of dollars [1]. Willingness to be vaccinated varies among individuals and groups based on various factors, including individual beliefs about vaccine safety and efficacy.\u00a0Every Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccination has been reported to cause reluctance, including delays in or outright rejection of the vaccines by some medical professionals [2,3].\nThe national policy includes a thorough, secure, and effective immunization effort. Successful vaccine awareness campaigns typically employ multiple strategies [4]. India set a goal to vaccinate 300 million people against COVID-19 by August 2021, the largest immunization program\u00a0ever. This challenge was announced on January 16, 2021. The homegrown vaccines made by Bharat Biotech, Covishield and Covaxin have been licensed for limited emergency use by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI)\u00a0[5]. India simultaneously planned COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in both urban and rural areas. The designated manpower, such as midwives, auxiliary nurses, etc., from all the states, who played a significant part in the healthcare of people in rural India, were trained in COVID-19 immunization. Midwives and auxiliary nurse midwives, who have a far broader reach in the interior and rural areas, were included in the first set of health workers educated in vaccination skills because India planned to have COVID-19 immunization programs in the urban and rural areas at the same time. The government utilized allied healthcare personnel, including pharmacists and public health professionals, to scale up a vaccination campaign. Primary health centres are in charge of effectively implementing the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural areas [6]. So, the study was planned to seek insight into the challenges faced by health personnel in the effective implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program.\nMaterials and methods\nA qualitative study was planned to understand the barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation program at rural and tribal areas.\u00a0Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of Government Medical College Akola (MH). The study was conducted in a rural area of Akola district, which lies in the western parts of Maharashtra State and belongs to the Vidarbha region, and is said to be one of the progressive districts in the region. The district has one municipal corporation (Akola Municipal Corporation), six municipalities (Murtizapur; Akot; Balapur; Patur; Telhara and Barshitakli) and 535 Gram panchayat (Total 864 villages). According to the 2011 Census, the district has a total population of 18,13,906, comprising 10,94,165 persons in rural areas and 7,19,741 persons in urban areas accounting for 1.6 percent of the total population of the State [7].\u00a0In Akola district, there are 30 primary health centres and 178 subcentres.\nThe study participants were medical officers from rural and tribal areas who actively planned and implemented COVID-19 vaccination at the primary health centre.\u00a0A total of 30 medical officers were interviewed.\u00a0Informed consent was taken from each participant. Each subject gave their informed consent. The Government Medical College (GMC) Akola Institutional Ethics Committee approved the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in person between September 2021 and December 2021.\u00a0All participants were asked regarding problems faced during the implementation of COVID-19 vaccination in their area.\u00a0Interview questions included: (1) How do you plan for COVID vaccination in your area? (2) What are the problems faced during COVID vaccination?\u00a0(3) What measures had been taken to solve the problems? (4) What measures will you suggest to implement COVID vaccination in your area successfully?\u00a0The interviews lasted 20 to 30 minutes and were conducted in the participants' preferred language (Hindi, Marathi, or English). A brief introduction and explanation of the study goals opened the session. Confidentiality was maintained to all participants. Participants were made aware of the existence of no right or wrong responses. Participants were welcomed to express their opinions on the effective implementation and difficulties encountered with the COVID vaccine.\nTranscripts of all recordings were created. Two researchers independently read the transcripts before using descriptive words or phrases to code them. Then, areas of interest were assigned to the coded transcripts, and developing themes were described. Review and editing were done on these emergent topics as well as sample transcripts that had been coded. A written presentation of the data is used whenever necessary to highlight study findings with quotes.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nA total of 30 medical officers involved in COVID vaccination working at the primary health centres (PHCs) were interviewed.\u00a0Twelve individuals (12 [40%] women; mean [SD] age, 45.04 [6.9] years) participated (Table 1). Twenty-three (76.7%) participants had work experience of more than five years at PHC in a rural area.\u00a0A total of 16 (53.3%) medical officers held MBBS degrees.\nTable 1. Characteristics of study participants.\nBarriers and facilitators in COVID vaccination\nThe factors identified were grouped into three groups: Health system factors, Human resource factors and Community level factors.\nHealth system factors\nIn the initial phase of the mass COVID-19 vaccination program, the barrier to implementation was a shortage of vaccine supply. The basic requirements to conduct an effective vaccination session, like space, manpower, vaccine stock, syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc. were not available initially. One key respondent mentioned that \u201cPeople unnecessarily argued for the non-availability of vaccine and created a panic situation that was difficult to handle by us. So we took help from the police department.\u201d\nRural or illiterate people did not prefer the online digital method of vaccination registration. Additionally, the network issue for registration was also one of the barriers to vaccination.\n\u201cDue to compulsory online registration for vaccination, people keep postponing for it.\u201d\nThe respondent also mentioned about the inconvenience to the people due to overcrowding highlighting the inadequate infrastructure as a barrier to vaccination.\nHuman resource factors\nRespondent mentioned that initially there was fear about vaccine adverse events even among healthcare workers.\n\u201cInitially there was fear about vaccine adverse events even among healthcare workers which led to misconception and rejection for vaccination.\u201d\nMost respondents referred to the general shortage of health personnel as a barrier to vaccination. The deficit in human resources affected the vaccination program and overburdened the healthcare workers; it affected non-COVID activities like Universal Immunization Programme, Antenatal check-ups, Field visits, etc.\u00a0One respondent mentioned that, due to a shortage of manpower in some facilities only one health worker has to perform various tasks in vaccination such as registration, counselling of clients and administration of vaccine.\n\u201cThere should be proactive involvement of other than health department like for registration, teachers from primary school should be involved. Such involvement should not be on paper but actually on the field.\u201d\nThe poor attitude among health care workers and lack of commitment due to everyday daily vaccination sessions also were reported to impact negatively on the implementation of the program. Lack of appreciation from higher authority and no additional incentives for staff involved in vaccination was also the barrier observed in the study. Regular training creates awareness among staff. Review from higher authority, especially bureaucrats under the disaster management act, also has an impact on the vaccination program.\nCommunity level factors\nRespondents also discussed the attitude of the community towards vaccination.\u00a0Most respondents viewed the misconception about the vaccine seen to undermine the delivery of COVID vaccine.\u00a0Respondents stated that there was high resistance initially and misconception about the vaccine particularly.\u00a0Misconception and superstitious behaviour about the vaccine is present in some communities like Muslims, Buddhist so half of the population of villages is unvaccinated.\u00a0Healthcare staff also faced high reluctance to vaccination in tribal areas. In Akola district, there were pockets of tribal populations; these populations were also not ready to take vaccines initially due to fear and mistrust.\nOne respondent said that:\n\u201cIn a few villages, people\u00a0were not ready to take the COVID vaccine, only after involving leaders from villages like Sarpanch and house-to-house counselling by Healthcare staff motivated the people for vaccination.\u201d\nMisconception and myths about the adverse outcome of the vaccine was a major barrier at the community level. The people were very hesitant and had a phobia about the side effects of vaccination. Pregnant women were also unwilling to take the COVID vaccination due to fear of side effects.\u00a0One respondent has mentioned that:\n\u201cInitially, people were unaware of the safety of vaccines. People had various misbeliefs about the efficacy and safety of vaccine like an increase in death rate after vaccination.\u201d\nSome respondents stated that vaccination session timing was not feasible, so people didn\u2019t prefer to lose their daily wages for vaccine.\n\u201cIn rural areas, in the afternoon, people go to the field, which is more preferred than taking the vaccine, so we can\u2019t cover the total population.\u201d\nPost-vaccination side effects like fever, headache, and myalgia created fear among unvaccinated people.\nDiscussion\nThis qualitative study explored barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural and tribal blocks of Akola district.\u00a0The findings highlighted in our study were classified at three levels: health system, human resource and community.\u00a0There were several administrative barriers during the initial phase of the COVID pandemic. India is a big country with disparities in health literacy, access to care, and risk perception among the general public by area [7]. The basic requirements to conduct an effective vaccination session like space, manpower, vaccine stock, syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc. were not available initially. In the initial phase, online digital registration for COVID-19 vaccination and internet or mobile network issues in rural areas were critical issues for illiterate people in rural areas. Vaccinating the whole population was challenging even though the country has the largest vaccine-producing units [8]. More than 2.4 billion doses of the vaccine are produced in India each year, in addition to a variety of surgical and medical disposables such as vials, stoppers, syringes, gauze, and alcohol swabs. However, because this necessitates adhering to very strict temperature guidelines, the first barrier was the storage and delivery of the vaccinations until the inoculation sessions [9]. Representatives from the Government of India (GOI) claim that the current healthcare system may not need more personnel to administer the vaccine to healthcare professionals [9].\nIn relation to WHO standards, India's health worker density continues to be low. In addition to the scarcity, it is extremely difficult to keep skilled health workers in rural and neglected areas [7]. In our study, the general shortage of health personnel and overburdening the healthcare workers affected non-COVID activities like Universal Immunization Programme, Antenatal Care Check-ups, field visits, etc. The frontline HCWs (FLHCWs) were particularly susceptible to increased work stress for a variety of reasons, such as having to work under stressful conditions because of rapidly changing guidelines, the inevitable need to be deployed to new settings and high-risk areas, the lack of adequate technical and human resources, and the worry that they might infect their families after work with COVID-19 [6]. In our study, fear about vaccine\u00a0adverse events even among healthcare workers (HCWs) was also a reason behind the effective implementation of the COVID vaccination program.\nA review by Biswas et al. indicated that 22.51% of 76,471 HCWs\u00a0worldwide reported COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy. Their main concerns with the vaccine were potential side effects (60%), safety (48%), and how well it works (30%). HCWs in this review also found higher vaccine acceptance in Whites and Asians [10]. A study conducted by Fu et al. on Chinese healthcare workers found that about 50% were unwilling to accept COVID-19 vaccination [11]. However, a study by Saudi healthcare workers\u00a0Magadmi and\u00a0Kamel\u00a0displayed hesitancy toward vaccination [12]. Medical professionals showed a high level of vaccine scepticism, according to Dror et al. [2]. Concerns about the safety of a quickly created vaccine were raised by several respondents who did not follow the recommendations for vaccines. In contrast, individuals who believed they had a higher risk of sickness showed greater vaccine acceptance [2].\nThe poor attitude among healthcare workers and lack of commitment due to daily vaccination sessions were also reported to impact the program's implementation negatively. Lack of appreciation from higher authority and no additional incentives for staff involved in vaccination was also the barrier observed in the study. Regular training creates awareness among staff. Review from higher authority, especially bureaucrats under the disaster management act, also has an impact on the vaccination program.\u00a0Rao and\u00a0Chowdhury also mentioned that frontline workers across the country were the backbone of the Indian public health system [13]. They were underpaid, undervalued, and alienated without any state support or protection. Workloads were raised during the COVID epidemic. The lack of medical insurance, proper governmental support, decreased physical and mental health, and delayed payments all contributed to the financial vulnerability that the healthcare workforce was experiencing [13].\nIn our study, it was observed that misconception and superstitious behaviour about vaccines were present in some communities like Muslim\u00a0and Buddhist so half of the population of villages is unvaccinated.\u00a0Healthcare staff also faced high reluctance to vaccination in tribal areas in the tribal block. The people were very hesitant and had a phobia about the side effects of vaccination [14,15]. Dutta et al. mentioned that various studies have identified myriad factors related to vaccination refusal and hesitancy, including refusal for religious, social, and philosophical reasons, lack of trust in vaccine providers and others, and fear of vaccines and adverse outcomes following immunization [16]. At the same time, King et al. mentioned that mandatory vaccination requirements must be planned with great care; there is no reason to think they are incompatible with human rights law [17]. So there is a need to create awareness regarding vaccination in the community. Vaccination session timing was not feasible for some people, so they didn\u2019t prefer to lose their daily wages for vaccines.\nThe limitation of our study is that findings cannot be extended to wider area populations with the same degree of certainty as the research findings are not tested statistically. In our study, we focussed on the understanding and explanation of the dynamics of the implementation of COVID vaccination in rural areas, but we haven\u2019t quantified the coverage and issues. This can be better answered with further research with a mixed-method approach.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, our findings were enablers and barriers for COVID-19 vaccination programs in rural and tribal areas.\u00a0Health system factors like shortage of vaccines and syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc., online digital method of vaccination registration and overcrowding at the initial stage, and inadequate infrastructure were a barrier to vaccination.\u00a0Fear about vaccine adverse events even in healthcare workers and overburdened healthcare workers were also factors affecting vaccination. At the community level, high resistance initially, misconception about the vaccine, and fear about post-vaccination side effects impact the COVID-19 vaccine program in rural and tribal areas.\u00a0The successful vaccination rate among the population needs community leadership and a community-centred approach when conducting outreach and strengthening primary health care in terms of infrastructure, manpower, and healthcare staff capacity building.\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nHuman Ethics\nConsent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.

A qualitative study was planned to understand the barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation program at rural and tribal areas. The study participants were medical officers from rural and tribal areas who actively planned and implemented COVID-19 vaccination at the primary health centre.\u00a0A total of 30 medical officers were interviewed.\u00a0Interview questions were focussed on the planning of COVID-19 vaccination in their area. Other questions were the problem faced during the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program and how it has been tackled.\nResults\nThe factors identified were grouped into three groups: Health system factors, Human resource factors and Community level factors.\u00a0Health system factors like shortage of vaccines and syringes, tablet paracetamol, online digital method of vaccination registration, overcrowding at the initial stage, and inadequate infrastructure were barriers to vaccination. Fear about vaccine adverse events, even in healthcare workers (HCWs), and overburdened healthcare workers were also factors affecting vaccination. At the community level, high resistance initially and misconception about the vaccine, and also the fear about post-vaccination side effects have an impact on the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural and tribal areas.\nConclusion\nThe successful vaccination rate among the population needs community leadership and a community-centred approach when conducting outreach and strengthening primary health care in terms of infrastructure, manpower, and capacity building of healthcare staff.\nKeywords: india, vaccination, outreach, barriers, facilitators, covid-19\nIntroduction\nOne of the greatest advancements in public health of the 20th century was the development of vaccines to prevent communicable diseases, which have prevented millions of deaths and saved billions of dollars [1]. Willingness to be vaccinated varies among individuals and groups based on various factors, including individual beliefs about vaccine safety and efficacy.\u00a0Every Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccination has been reported to cause reluctance, including delays in or outright rejection of the vaccines by some medical professionals [2,3].\nThe national policy includes a thorough, secure, and effective immunization effort. Successful vaccine awareness campaigns typically employ multiple strategies [4]. India set a goal to vaccinate 300 million people against COVID-19 by August 2021, the largest immunization program\u00a0ever. This challenge was announced on January 16, 2021. The homegrown vaccines made by Bharat Biotech, Covishield and Covaxin have been licensed for limited emergency use by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI)\u00a0[5]. India simultaneously planned COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in both urban and rural areas. The designated manpower, such as midwives, auxiliary nurses, etc., from all the states, who played a significant part in the healthcare of people in rural India, were trained in COVID-19 immunization. Midwives and auxiliary nurse midwives, who have a far broader reach in the interior and rural areas, were included in the first set of health workers educated in vaccination skills because India planned to have COVID-19 immunization programs in the urban and rural areas at the same time. The government utilized allied healthcare personnel, including pharmacists and public health professionals, to scale up a vaccination campaign. Primary health centres are in charge of effectively implementing the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural areas [6]. So, the study was planned to seek insight into the challenges faced by health personnel in the effective implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program.\nMaterials and methods\nA qualitative study was planned to understand the barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation program at rural and tribal areas.\u00a0Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of Government Medical College Akola (MH). The study was conducted in a rural area of Akola district, which lies in the western parts of Maharashtra State and belongs to the Vidarbha region, and is said to be one of the progressive districts in the region. The district has one municipal corporation (Akola Municipal Corporation), six municipalities (Murtizapur; Akot; Balapur; Patur; Telhara and Barshitakli) and 535 Gram panchayat (Total 864 villages). According to the 2011 Census, the district has a total population of 18,13,906, comprising 10,94,165 persons in rural areas and 7,19,741 persons in urban areas accounting for 1.6 percent of the total population of the State [7].\u00a0In Akola district, there are 30 primary health centres and 178 subcentres.\nThe study participants were medical officers from rural and tribal areas who actively planned and implemented COVID-19 vaccination at the primary health centre.\u00a0A total of 30 medical officers were interviewed.\u00a0Informed consent was taken from each participant. Each subject gave their informed consent. The Government Medical College (GMC) Akola Institutional Ethics Committee approved the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in person between September 2021 and December 2021.\u00a0All participants were asked regarding problems faced during the implementation of COVID-19 vaccination in their area.\u00a0Interview questions included: (1) How do you plan for COVID vaccination in your area? (2) What are the problems faced during COVID vaccination?\u00a0(3) What measures had been taken to solve the problems? (4) What measures will you suggest to implement COVID vaccination in your area successfully?\u00a0The interviews lasted 20 to 30 minutes and were conducted in the participants' preferred language (Hindi, Marathi, or English). A brief introduction and explanation of the study goals opened the session. Confidentiality was maintained to all participants. Participants were made aware of the existence of no right or wrong responses. Participants were welcomed to express their opinions on the effective implementation and difficulties encountered with the COVID vaccine.\nTranscripts of all recordings were created. Two researchers independently read the transcripts before using descriptive words or phrases to code them. Then, areas of interest were assigned to the coded transcripts, and developing themes were described. Review and editing were done on these emergent topics as well as sample transcripts that had been coded. A written presentation of the data is used whenever necessary to highlight study findings with quotes.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nA total of 30 medical officers involved in COVID vaccination working at the primary health centres (PHCs) were interviewed.\u00a0Twelve individuals (12 [40%] women; mean [SD] age, 45.04 [6.9] years) participated (Table 1). Twenty-three (76.7%) participants had work experience of more than five years at PHC in a rural area.\u00a0A total of 16 (53.3%) medical officers held MBBS degrees.\nTable 1. Characteristics of study participants.\nBarriers and facilitators in COVID vaccination\nThe factors identified were grouped into three groups: Health system factors, Human resource factors and Community level factors.\nHealth system factors\nIn the initial phase of the mass COVID-19 vaccination program, the barrier to implementation was a shortage of vaccine supply. The basic requirements to conduct an effective vaccination session, like space, manpower, vaccine stock, syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc. were not available initially. One key respondent mentioned that \u201cPeople unnecessarily argued for the non-availability of vaccine and created a panic situation that was difficult to handle by us. So we took help from the police department.\u201d\nRural or illiterate people did not prefer the online digital method of vaccination registration. Additionally, the network issue for registration was also one of the barriers to vaccination.\n\u201cDue to compulsory online registration for vaccination, people keep postponing for it.\u201d\nThe respondent also mentioned about the inconvenience to the people due to overcrowding highlighting the inadequate infrastructure as a barrier to vaccination.\nHuman resource factors\nRespondent mentioned that initially there was fear about vaccine adverse events even among healthcare workers.\n\u201cInitially there was fear about vaccine adverse events even among healthcare workers which led to misconception and rejection for vaccination.\u201d\nMost respondents referred to the general shortage of health personnel as a barrier to vaccination. The deficit in human resources affected the vaccination program and overburdened the healthcare workers; it affected non-COVID activities like Universal Immunization Programme, Antenatal check-ups, Field visits, etc.\u00a0One respondent mentioned that, due to a shortage of manpower in some facilities only one health worker has to perform various tasks in vaccination such as registration, counselling of clients and administration of vaccine.\n\u201cThere should be proactive involvement of other than health department like for registration, teachers from primary school should be involved. Such involvement should not be on paper but actually on the field.\u201d\nThe poor attitude among health care workers and lack of commitment due to everyday daily vaccination sessions also were reported to impact negatively on the implementation of the program. Lack of appreciation from higher authority and no additional incentives for staff involved in vaccination was also the barrier observed in the study. Regular training creates awareness among staff. Review from higher authority, especially bureaucrats under the disaster management act, also has an impact on the vaccination program.\nCommunity level factors\nRespondents also discussed the attitude of the community towards vaccination.\u00a0Most respondents viewed the misconception about the vaccine seen to undermine the delivery of COVID vaccine.\u00a0Respondents stated that there was high resistance initially and misconception about the vaccine particularly.\u00a0Misconception and superstitious behaviour about the vaccine is present in some communities like Muslims, Buddhist so half of the population of villages is unvaccinated.\u00a0Healthcare staff also faced high reluctance to vaccination in tribal areas. In Akola district, there were pockets of tribal populations; these populations were also not ready to take vaccines initially due to fear and mistrust.\nOne respondent said that:\n\u201cIn a few villages, people\u00a0were not ready to take the COVID vaccine, only after involving leaders from villages like Sarpanch and house-to-house counselling by Healthcare staff motivated the people for vaccination.\u201d\nMisconception and myths about the adverse outcome of the vaccine was a major barrier at the community level. The people were very hesitant and had a phobia about the side effects of vaccination. Pregnant women were also unwilling to take the COVID vaccination due to fear of side effects.\u00a0One respondent has mentioned that:\n\u201cInitially, people were unaware of the safety of vaccines. People had various misbeliefs about the efficacy and safety of vaccine like an increase in death rate after vaccination.\u201d\nSome respondents stated that vaccination session timing was not feasible, so people didn\u2019t prefer to lose their daily wages for vaccine.\n\u201cIn rural areas, in the afternoon, people go to the field, which is more preferred than taking the vaccine, so we can\u2019t cover the total population.\u201d\nPost-vaccination side effects like fever, headache, and myalgia created fear among unvaccinated people.\nDiscussion\nThis qualitative study explored barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural and tribal blocks of Akola district.\u00a0The findings highlighted in our study were classified at three levels: health system, human resource and community.\u00a0There were several administrative barriers during the initial phase of the COVID pandemic. India is a big country with disparities in health literacy, access to care, and risk perception among the general public by area [7]. The basic requirements to conduct an effective vaccination session like space, manpower, vaccine stock, syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc. were not available initially. In the initial phase, online digital registration for COVID-19 vaccination and internet or mobile network issues in rural areas were critical issues for illiterate people in rural areas. Vaccinating the whole population was challenging even though the country has the largest vaccine-producing units [8]. More than 2.4 billion doses of the vaccine are produced in India each year, in addition to a variety of surgical and medical disposables such as vials, stoppers, syringes, gauze, and alcohol swabs. However, because this necessitates adhering to very strict temperature guidelines, the first barrier was the storage and delivery of the vaccinations until the inoculation sessions [9]. Representatives from the Government of India (GOI) claim that the current healthcare system may not need more personnel to administer the vaccine to healthcare professionals [9].\nIn relation to WHO standards, India's health worker density continues to be low. In addition to the scarcity, it is extremely difficult to keep skilled health workers in rural and neglected areas [7]. In our study, the general shortage of health personnel and overburdening the healthcare workers affected non-COVID activities like Universal Immunization Programme, Antenatal Care Check-ups, field visits, etc. The frontline HCWs (FLHCWs) were particularly susceptible to increased work stress for a variety of reasons, such as having to work under stressful conditions because of rapidly changing guidelines, the inevitable need to be deployed to new settings and high-risk areas, the lack of adequate technical and human resources, and the worry that they might infect their families after work with COVID-19 [6]. In our study, fear about vaccine\u00a0adverse events even among healthcare workers (HCWs) was also a reason behind the effective implementation of the COVID vaccination program.\nA review by Biswas et al. indicated that 22.51% of 76,471 HCWs\u00a0worldwide reported COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy.

They were underpaid, undervalued, and alienated without any state support or protection. Workloads were raised during the COVID epidemic. The lack of medical insurance, proper governmental support, decreased physical and mental health, and delayed payments all contributed to the financial vulnerability that the healthcare workforce was experiencing [13].\nIn our study, it was observed that misconception and superstitious behaviour about vaccines were present in some communities like Muslim\u00a0and Buddhist so half of the population of villages is unvaccinated.\u00a0Healthcare staff also faced high reluctance to vaccination in tribal areas in the tribal block. The people were very hesitant and had a phobia about the side effects of vaccination [14,15]. Dutta et al. mentioned that various studies have identified myriad factors related to vaccination refusal and hesitancy, including refusal for religious, social, and philosophical reasons, lack of trust in vaccine providers and others, and fear of vaccines and adverse outcomes following immunization [16]. At the same time, King et al. mentioned that mandatory vaccination requirements must be planned with great care; there is no reason to think they are incompatible with human rights law [17]. So there is a need to create awareness regarding vaccination in the community. Vaccination session timing was not feasible for some people, so they didn\u2019t prefer to lose their daily wages for vaccines.\nThe limitation of our study is that findings cannot be extended to wider area populations with the same degree of certainty as the research findings are not tested statistically.

Willingness to be vaccinated varies among individuals and groups based on various factors, including individual beliefs about vaccine safety and efficacy.\u00a0Every Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccination has been reported to cause reluctance, including delays in or outright rejection of the vaccines by some medical professionals [2,3].\nThe national policy includes a thorough, secure, and effective immunization effort. Successful vaccine awareness campaigns typically employ multiple strategies [4]. India set a goal to vaccinate 300 million people against COVID-19 by August 2021, the largest immunization program\u00a0ever. This challenge was announced on January 16, 2021. The homegrown vaccines made by Bharat Biotech, Covishield and Covaxin have been licensed for limited emergency use by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI)\u00a0[5]. India simultaneously planned COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in both urban and rural areas. The designated manpower, such as midwives, auxiliary nurses, etc., from all the states, who played a significant part in the healthcare of people in rural India, were trained in COVID-19 immunization. Midwives and auxiliary nurse midwives, who have a far broader reach in the interior and rural areas, were included in the first set of health workers educated in vaccination skills because India planned to have COVID-19 immunization programs in the urban and rural areas at the same time. The government utilized allied healthcare personnel, including pharmacists and public health professionals, to scale up a vaccination campaign. Primary health centres are in charge of effectively implementing the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural areas [6]. So, the study was planned to seek insight into the challenges faced by health personnel in the effective implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program.\nMaterials and methods\nA qualitative study was planned to understand the barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation program at rural and tribal areas.\u00a0Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of Government Medical College Akola (MH). The study was conducted in a rural area of Akola district, which lies in the western parts of Maharashtra State and belongs to the Vidarbha region, and is said to be one of the progressive districts in the region. The district has one municipal corporation (Akola Municipal Corporation), six municipalities (Murtizapur; Akot; Balapur; Patur; Telhara and Barshitakli) and 535 Gram panchayat (Total 864 villages). According to the 2011 Census, the district has a total population of 18,13,906, comprising 10,94,165 persons in rural areas and 7,19,741 persons in urban areas accounting for 1.6 percent of the total population of the State [7].\u00a0In Akola district, there are 30 primary health centres and 178 subcentres.\nThe study participants were medical officers from rural and tribal areas who actively planned and implemented COVID-19 vaccination at the primary health centre.\u00a0A total of 30 medical officers were interviewed.\u00a0Informed consent was taken from each participant. Each subject gave their informed consent. The Government Medical College (GMC) Akola Institutional Ethics Committee approved the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in person between September 2021 and December 2021.\u00a0All participants were asked regarding problems faced during the implementation of COVID-19 vaccination in their area.\u00a0Interview questions included: (1) How do you plan for COVID vaccination in your area? (2) What are the problems faced during COVID vaccination?\u00a0(3) What measures had been taken to solve the problems? (4) What measures will you suggest to implement COVID vaccination in your area successfully?\u00a0The interviews lasted 20 to 30 minutes and were conducted in the participants' preferred language (Hindi, Marathi, or English). A brief introduction and explanation of the study goals opened the session. Confidentiality was maintained to all participants. Participants were made aware of the existence of no right or wrong responses. Participants were welcomed to express their opinions on the effective implementation and difficulties encountered with the COVID vaccine.\nTranscripts of all recordings were created. Two researchers independently read the transcripts before using descriptive words or phrases to code them. Then, areas of interest were assigned to the coded transcripts, and developing themes were described. Review and editing were done on these emergent topics as well as sample transcripts that had been coded. A written presentation of the data is used whenever necessary to highlight study findings with quotes.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nA total of 30 medical officers involved in COVID vaccination working at the primary health centres (PHCs) were interviewed.\u00a0Twelve individuals (12 [40%] women; mean [SD] age, 45.04 [6.9] years) participated (Table 1). Twenty-three (76.7%) participants had work experience of more than five years at PHC in a rural area.\u00a0A total of 16 (53.3%) medical officers held MBBS degrees.\nTable 1. Characteristics of study participants.\nBarriers and facilitators in COVID vaccination\nThe factors identified were grouped into three groups: Health system factors, Human resource factors and Community level factors.\nHealth system factors\nIn the initial phase of the mass COVID-19 vaccination program, the barrier to implementation was a shortage of vaccine supply. The basic requirements to conduct an effective vaccination session, like space, manpower, vaccine stock, syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc. were not available initially. One key respondent mentioned that \u201cPeople unnecessarily argued for the non-availability of vaccine and created a panic situation that was difficult to handle by us. So we took help from the police department.\u201d\nRural or illiterate people did not prefer the online digital method of vaccination registration. Additionally, the network issue for registration was also one of the barriers to vaccination.\n\u201cDue to compulsory online registration for vaccination, people keep postponing for it.\u201d\nThe respondent also mentioned about the inconvenience to the people due to overcrowding highlighting the inadequate infrastructure as a barrier to vaccination.\nHuman resource factors\nRespondent mentioned that initially there was fear about vaccine adverse events even among healthcare workers.\n\u201cInitially there was fear about vaccine adverse events even among healthcare workers which led to misconception and rejection for vaccination.\u201d\nMost respondents referred to the general shortage of health personnel as a barrier to vaccination. The deficit in human resources affected the vaccination program and overburdened the healthcare workers; it affected non-COVID activities like Universal Immunization Programme, Antenatal check-ups, Field visits, etc.\u00a0One respondent mentioned that, due to a shortage of manpower in some facilities only one health worker has to perform various tasks in vaccination such as registration, counselling of clients and administration of vaccine.\n\u201cThere should be proactive involvement of other than health department like for registration, teachers from primary school should be involved. Such involvement should not be on paper but actually on the field.\u201d\nThe poor attitude among health care workers and lack of commitment due to everyday daily vaccination sessions also were reported to impact negatively on the implementation of the program. Lack of appreciation from higher authority and no additional incentives for staff involved in vaccination was also the barrier observed in the study. Regular training creates awareness among staff. Review from higher authority, especially bureaucrats under the disaster management act, also has an impact on the vaccination program.\nCommunity level factors\nRespondents also discussed the attitude of the community towards vaccination.\u00a0Most respondents viewed the misconception about the vaccine seen to undermine the delivery of COVID vaccine.\u00a0Respondents stated that there was high resistance initially and misconception about the vaccine particularly.\u00a0Misconception and superstitious behaviour about the vaccine is present in some communities like Muslims, Buddhist so half of the population of villages is unvaccinated.\u00a0Healthcare staff also faced high reluctance to vaccination in tribal areas. In Akola district, there were pockets of tribal populations; these populations were also not ready to take vaccines initially due to fear and mistrust.\nOne respondent said that:\n\u201cIn a few villages, people\u00a0were not ready to take the COVID vaccine, only after involving leaders from villages like Sarpanch and house-to-house counselling by Healthcare staff motivated the people for vaccination.\u201d\nMisconception and myths about the adverse outcome of the vaccine was a major barrier at the community level. The people were very hesitant and had a phobia about the side effects of vaccination. Pregnant women were also unwilling to take the COVID vaccination due to fear of side effects.\u00a0One respondent has mentioned that:\n\u201cInitially, people were unaware of the safety of vaccines. People had various misbeliefs about the efficacy and safety of vaccine like an increase in death rate after vaccination.\u201d\nSome respondents stated that vaccination session timing was not feasible, so people didn\u2019t prefer to lose their daily wages for vaccine.\n\u201cIn rural areas, in the afternoon, people go to the field, which is more preferred than taking the vaccine, so we can\u2019t cover the total population.\u201d\nPost-vaccination side effects like fever, headache, and myalgia created fear among unvaccinated people.\nDiscussion\nThis qualitative study explored barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural and tribal blocks of Akola district.\u00a0The findings highlighted in our study were classified at three levels: health system, human resource and community.\u00a0There were several administrative barriers during the initial phase of the COVID pandemic. India is a big country with disparities in health literacy, access to care, and risk perception among the general public by area [7]. The basic requirements to conduct an effective vaccination session like space, manpower, vaccine stock, syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc. were not available initially. In the initial phase, online digital registration for COVID-19 vaccination and internet or mobile network issues in rural areas were critical issues for illiterate people in rural areas. Vaccinating the whole population was challenging even though the country has the largest vaccine-producing units [8]. More than 2.4 billion doses of the vaccine are produced in India each year, in addition to a variety of surgical and medical disposables such as vials, stoppers, syringes, gauze, and alcohol swabs. However, because this necessitates adhering to very strict temperature guidelines, the first barrier was the storage and delivery of the vaccinations until the inoculation sessions [9]. Representatives from the Government of India (GOI) claim that the current healthcare system may not need more personnel to administer the vaccine to healthcare professionals [9].\nIn relation to WHO standards, India's health worker density continues to be low. In addition to the scarcity, it is extremely difficult to keep skilled health workers in rural and neglected areas [7]. In our study, the general shortage of health personnel and overburdening the healthcare workers affected non-COVID activities like Universal Immunization Programme, Antenatal Care Check-ups, field visits, etc. The frontline HCWs (FLHCWs) were particularly susceptible to increased work stress for a variety of reasons, such as having to work under stressful conditions because of rapidly changing guidelines, the inevitable need to be deployed to new settings and high-risk areas, the lack of adequate technical and human resources, and the worry that they might infect their families after work with COVID-19 [6]. In our study, fear about vaccine\u00a0adverse events even among healthcare workers (HCWs) was also a reason behind the effective implementation of the COVID vaccination program.\nA review by Biswas et al. indicated that 22.51% of 76,471 HCWs\u00a0worldwide reported COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy. Their main concerns with the vaccine were potential side effects (60%), safety (48%), and how well it works (30%). HCWs in this review also found higher vaccine acceptance in Whites and Asians [10]. A study conducted by Fu et al. on Chinese healthcare workers found that about 50% were unwilling to accept COVID-19 vaccination [11]. However, a study by Saudi healthcare workers\u00a0Magadmi and\u00a0Kamel\u00a0displayed hesitancy toward vaccination [12]. Medical professionals showed a high level of vaccine scepticism, according to Dror et al. [2]. Concerns about the safety of a quickly created vaccine were raised by several respondents who did not follow the recommendations for vaccines. In contrast, individuals who believed they had a higher risk of sickness showed greater vaccine acceptance [2].\nThe poor attitude among healthcare workers and lack of commitment due to daily vaccination sessions were also reported to impact the program's implementation negatively. Lack of appreciation from higher authority and no additional incentives for staff involved in vaccination was also the barrier observed in the study. Regular training creates awareness among staff. Review from higher authority, especially bureaucrats under the disaster management act, also has an impact on the vaccination program.\u00a0Rao and\u00a0Chowdhury also mentioned that frontline workers across the country were the backbone of the Indian public health system [13]. They were underpaid, undervalued, and alienated without any state support or protection. Workloads were raised during the COVID epidemic. The lack of medical insurance, proper governmental support, decreased physical and mental health, and delayed payments all contributed to the financial vulnerability that the healthcare workforce was experiencing [13].\nIn our study, it was observed that misconception and superstitious behaviour about vaccines were present in some communities like Muslim\u00a0and Buddhist so half of the population of villages is unvaccinated.\u00a0Healthcare staff also faced high reluctance to vaccination in tribal areas in the tribal block. The people were very hesitant and had a phobia about the side effects of vaccination [14,15]. Dutta et al. mentioned that various studies have identified myriad factors related to vaccination refusal and hesitancy, including refusal for religious, social, and philosophical reasons, lack of trust in vaccine providers and others, and fear of vaccines and adverse outcomes following immunization [16]. At the same time, King et al. mentioned that mandatory vaccination requirements must be planned with great care; there is no reason to think they are incompatible with human rights law [17]. So there is a need to create awareness regarding vaccination in the community. Vaccination session timing was not feasible for some people, so they didn\u2019t prefer to lose their daily wages for vaccines.\nThe limitation of our study is that findings cannot be extended to wider area populations with the same degree of certainty as the research findings are not tested statistically. In our study, we focussed on the understanding and explanation of the dynamics of the implementation of COVID vaccination in rural areas, but we haven\u2019t quantified the coverage and issues. This can be better answered with further research with a mixed-method approach.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, our findings were enablers and barriers for COVID-19 vaccination programs in rural and tribal areas.\u00a0Health system factors like shortage of vaccines and syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc., online digital method of vaccination registration and overcrowding at the initial stage, and inadequate infrastructure were a barrier to vaccination.\u00a0Fear about vaccine adverse events even in healthcare workers and overburdened healthcare workers were also factors affecting vaccination. At the community level, high resistance initially, misconception about the vaccine, and fear about post-vaccination side effects impact the COVID-19 vaccine program in rural and tribal areas.\u00a0The successful vaccination rate among the population needs community leadership and a community-centred approach when conducting outreach and strengthening primary health care in terms of infrastructure, manpower, and healthcare staff capacity building.\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nHuman Ethics\nConsent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.

India set a goal to vaccinate 300 million people against COVID-19 by August 2021, the largest immunization program\u00a0ever. This challenge was announced on January 16, 2021. The homegrown vaccines made by Bharat Biotech, Covishield and Covaxin have been licensed for limited emergency use by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI)\u00a0[5]. India simultaneously planned COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in both urban and rural areas. The designated manpower, such as midwives, auxiliary nurses, etc., from all the states, who played a significant part in the healthcare of people in rural India, were trained in COVID-19 immunization. Midwives and auxiliary nurse midwives, who have a far broader reach in the interior and rural areas, were included in the first set of health workers educated in vaccination skills because India planned to have COVID-19 immunization programs in the urban and rural areas at the same time. The government utilized allied healthcare personnel, including pharmacists and public health professionals, to scale up a vaccination campaign. Primary health centres are in charge of effectively implementing the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural areas [6]. So, the study was planned to seek insight into the challenges faced by health personnel in the effective implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program.\nMaterials and methods\nA qualitative study was planned to understand the barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation program at rural and tribal areas.\u00a0Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of Government Medical College Akola (MH). The study was conducted in a rural area of Akola district, which lies in the western parts of Maharashtra State and belongs to the Vidarbha region, and is said to be one of the progressive districts in the region. The district has one municipal corporation (Akola Municipal Corporation), six municipalities (Murtizapur; Akot; Balapur; Patur; Telhara and Barshitakli) and 535 Gram panchayat (Total 864 villages). According to the 2011 Census, the district has a total population of 18,13,906, comprising 10,94,165 persons in rural areas and 7,19,741 persons in urban areas accounting for 1.6 percent of the total population of the State [7].\u00a0In Akola district, there are 30 primary health centres and 178 subcentres.\nThe study participants were medical officers from rural and tribal areas who actively planned and implemented COVID-19 vaccination at the primary health centre.\u00a0A total of 30 medical officers were interviewed.\u00a0Informed consent was taken from each participant. Each subject gave their informed consent. The Government Medical College (GMC) Akola Institutional Ethics Committee approved the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in person between September 2021 and December 2021.\u00a0All participants were asked regarding problems faced during the implementation of COVID-19 vaccination in their area.\u00a0Interview questions included: (1) How do you plan for COVID vaccination in your area? (2) What are the problems faced during COVID vaccination?\u00a0(3) What measures had been taken to solve the problems? (4) What measures will you suggest to implement COVID vaccination in your area successfully?\u00a0The interviews lasted 20 to 30 minutes and were conducted in the participants' preferred language (Hindi, Marathi, or English). A brief introduction and explanation of the study goals opened the session. Confidentiality was maintained to all participants. Participants were made aware of the existence of no right or wrong responses. Participants were welcomed to express their opinions on the effective implementation and difficulties encountered with the COVID vaccine.\nTranscripts of all recordings were created. Two researchers independently read the transcripts before using descriptive words or phrases to code them. Then, areas of interest were assigned to the coded transcripts, and developing themes were described. Review and editing were done on these emergent topics as well as sample transcripts that had been coded. A written presentation of the data is used whenever necessary to highlight study findings with quotes.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nA total of 30 medical officers involved in COVID vaccination working at the primary health centres (PHCs) were interviewed.\u00a0Twelve individuals (12 [40%] women; mean [SD] age, 45.04 [6.9] years) participated (Table 1). Twenty-three (76.7%) participants had work experience of more than five years at PHC in a rural area.\u00a0A total of 16 (53.3%) medical officers held MBBS degrees.\nTable 1. Characteristics of study participants.\nBarriers and facilitators in COVID vaccination\nThe factors identified were grouped into three groups: Health system factors, Human resource factors and Community level factors.\nHealth system factors\nIn the initial phase of the mass COVID-19 vaccination program, the barrier to implementation was a shortage of vaccine supply. The basic requirements to conduct an effective vaccination session, like space, manpower, vaccine stock, syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc. were not available initially. One key respondent mentioned that \u201cPeople unnecessarily argued for the non-availability of vaccine and created a panic situation that was difficult to handle by us. So we took help from the police department.\u201d\nRural or illiterate people did not prefer the online digital method of vaccination registration. Additionally, the network issue for registration was also one of the barriers to vaccination.\n\u201cDue to compulsory online registration for vaccination, people keep postponing for it.\u201d\nThe respondent also mentioned about the inconvenience to the people due to overcrowding highlighting the inadequate infrastructure as a barrier to vaccination.\nHuman resource factors\nRespondent mentioned that initially there was fear about vaccine adverse events even among healthcare workers.\n\u201cInitially there was fear about vaccine adverse events even among healthcare workers which led to misconception and rejection for vaccination.\u201d\nMost respondents referred to the general shortage of health personnel as a barrier to vaccination. The deficit in human resources affected the vaccination program and overburdened the healthcare workers; it affected non-COVID activities like Universal Immunization Programme, Antenatal check-ups, Field visits, etc.\u00a0One respondent mentioned that, due to a shortage of manpower in some facilities only one health worker has to perform various tasks in vaccination such as registration, counselling of clients and administration of vaccine.\n\u201cThere should be proactive involvement of other than health department like for registration, teachers from primary school should be involved. Such involvement should not be on paper but actually on the field.\u201d\nThe poor attitude among health care workers and lack of commitment due to everyday daily vaccination sessions also were reported to impact negatively on the implementation of the program. Lack of appreciation from higher authority and no additional incentives for staff involved in vaccination was also the barrier observed in the study. Regular training creates awareness among staff. Review from higher authority, especially bureaucrats under the disaster management act, also has an impact on the vaccination program.\nCommunity level factors\nRespondents also discussed the attitude of the community towards vaccination.\u00a0Most respondents viewed the misconception about the vaccine seen to undermine the delivery of COVID vaccine.\u00a0Respondents stated that there was high resistance initially and misconception about the vaccine particularly.\u00a0Misconception and superstitious behaviour about the vaccine is present in some communities like Muslims, Buddhist so half of the population of villages is unvaccinated.\u00a0Healthcare staff also faced high reluctance to vaccination in tribal areas. In Akola district, there were pockets of tribal populations; these populations were also not ready to take vaccines initially due to fear and mistrust.\nOne respondent said that:\n\u201cIn a few villages, people\u00a0were not ready to take the COVID vaccine, only after involving leaders from villages like Sarpanch and house-to-house counselling by Healthcare staff motivated the people for vaccination.\u201d\nMisconception and myths about the adverse outcome of the vaccine was a major barrier at the community level. The people were very hesitant and had a phobia about the side effects of vaccination. Pregnant women were also unwilling to take the COVID vaccination due to fear of side effects.\u00a0One respondent has mentioned that:\n\u201cInitially, people were unaware of the safety of vaccines. People had various misbeliefs about the efficacy and safety of vaccine like an increase in death rate after vaccination.\u201d\nSome respondents stated that vaccination session timing was not feasible, so people didn\u2019t prefer to lose their daily wages for vaccine.\n\u201cIn rural areas, in the afternoon, people go to the field, which is more preferred than taking the vaccine, so we can\u2019t cover the total population.\u201d\nPost-vaccination side effects like fever, headache, and myalgia created fear among unvaccinated people.\nDiscussion\nThis qualitative study explored barriers and facilitators of the COVID-19 vaccination program in rural and tribal blocks of Akola district.\u00a0The findings highlighted in our study were classified at three levels: health system, human resource and community.\u00a0There were several administrative barriers during the initial phase of the COVID pandemic. India is a big country with disparities in health literacy, access to care, and risk perception among the general public by area [7]. The basic requirements to conduct an effective vaccination session like space, manpower, vaccine stock, syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc. were not available initially. In the initial phase, online digital registration for COVID-19 vaccination and internet or mobile network issues in rural areas were critical issues for illiterate people in rural areas. Vaccinating the whole population was challenging even though the country has the largest vaccine-producing units [8]. More than 2.4 billion doses of the vaccine are produced in India each year, in addition to a variety of surgical and medical disposables such as vials, stoppers, syringes, gauze, and alcohol swabs. However, because this necessitates adhering to very strict temperature guidelines, the first barrier was the storage and delivery of the vaccinations until the inoculation sessions [9]. Representatives from the Government of India (GOI) claim that the current healthcare system may not need more personnel to administer the vaccine to healthcare professionals [9].\nIn relation to WHO standards, India's health worker density continues to be low. In addition to the scarcity, it is extremely difficult to keep skilled health workers in rural and neglected areas [7]. In our study, the general shortage of health personnel and overburdening the healthcare workers affected non-COVID activities like Universal Immunization Programme, Antenatal Care Check-ups, field visits, etc. The frontline HCWs (FLHCWs) were particularly susceptible to increased work stress for a variety of reasons, such as having to work under stressful conditions because of rapidly changing guidelines, the inevitable need to be deployed to new settings and high-risk areas, the lack of adequate technical and human resources, and the worry that they might infect their families after work with COVID-19 [6]. In our study, fear about vaccine\u00a0adverse events even among healthcare workers (HCWs) was also a reason behind the effective implementation of the COVID vaccination program.\nA review by Biswas et al. indicated that 22.51% of 76,471 HCWs\u00a0worldwide reported COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy. Their main concerns with the vaccine were potential side effects (60%), safety (48%), and how well it works (30%). HCWs in this review also found higher vaccine acceptance in Whites and Asians [10]. A study conducted by Fu et al. on Chinese healthcare workers found that about 50% were unwilling to accept COVID-19 vaccination [11]. However, a study by Saudi healthcare workers\u00a0Magadmi and\u00a0Kamel\u00a0displayed hesitancy toward vaccination [12]. Medical professionals showed a high level of vaccine scepticism, according to Dror et al. [2]. Concerns about the safety of a quickly created vaccine were raised by several respondents who did not follow the recommendations for vaccines. In contrast, individuals who believed they had a higher risk of sickness showed greater vaccine acceptance [2].\nThe poor attitude among healthcare workers and lack of commitment due to daily vaccination sessions were also reported to impact the program's implementation negatively. Lack of appreciation from higher authority and no additional incentives for staff involved in vaccination was also the barrier observed in the study. Regular training creates awareness among staff. Review from higher authority, especially bureaucrats under the disaster management act, also has an impact on the vaccination program.\u00a0Rao and\u00a0Chowdhury also mentioned that frontline workers across the country were the backbone of the Indian public health system [13]. They were underpaid, undervalued, and alienated without any state support or protection. Workloads were raised during the COVID epidemic. The lack of medical insurance, proper governmental support, decreased physical and mental health, and delayed payments all contributed to the financial vulnerability that the healthcare workforce was experiencing [13].\nIn our study, it was observed that misconception and superstitious behaviour about vaccines were present in some communities like Muslim\u00a0and Buddhist so half of the population of villages is unvaccinated.\u00a0Healthcare staff also faced high reluctance to vaccination in tribal areas in the tribal block. The people were very hesitant and had a phobia about the side effects of vaccination [14,15]. Dutta et al. mentioned that various studies have identified myriad factors related to vaccination refusal and hesitancy, including refusal for religious, social, and philosophical reasons, lack of trust in vaccine providers and others, and fear of vaccines and adverse outcomes following immunization [16]. At the same time, King et al. mentioned that mandatory vaccination requirements must be planned with great care; there is no reason to think they are incompatible with human rights law [17]. So there is a need to create awareness regarding vaccination in the community. Vaccination session timing was not feasible for some people, so they didn\u2019t prefer to lose their daily wages for vaccines.\nThe limitation of our study is that findings cannot be extended to wider area populations with the same degree of certainty as the research findings are not tested statistically. In our study, we focussed on the understanding and explanation of the dynamics of the implementation of COVID vaccination in rural areas, but we haven\u2019t quantified the coverage and issues. This can be better answered with further research with a mixed-method approach.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, our findings were enablers and barriers for COVID-19 vaccination programs in rural and tribal areas.\u00a0Health system factors like shortage of vaccines and syringes, tablet paracetamol, etc., online digital method of vaccination registration and overcrowding at the initial stage, and inadequate infrastructure were a barrier to vaccination.\u00a0Fear about vaccine adverse events even in healthcare workers and overburdened healthcare workers were also factors affecting vaccination. At the community level, high resistance initially, misconception about the vaccine, and fear about post-vaccination side effects impact the COVID-19 vaccine program in rural and tribal areas.\u00a0The successful vaccination rate among the population needs community leadership and a community-centred approach when conducting outreach and strengthening primary health care in terms of infrastructure, manpower, and healthcare staff capacity building.\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nHuman Ethics\nConsent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.

      "Operational efficiency: A clear path to outperformance in distribution\n\nMany distributors are finding it difficult to grow revenues and maintain margins while meeting the rising expectations of customers. Hiring and retention challenges, sharp demand variability, uncertain supply lead times, shortages, and inflationary pressures may seem like the new normal.\nBut opportunities abound for those who know where to look: distributors can meaningfully improve operational excellence to create more value for shareholders, customers, and suppliers.\nIn our inaugural survey of operations leaders in more than 80 North American distributors across more than a dozen subsectors, we identified many operations shortfalls\u00e2\u0080\u0094along with improvements that are helping about one in ten distributors outperform the industry by wide margins. Since 2019, these \u00e2\u0080\u009ctransformers\u00e2\u0080\u009d have improved returns on invested capital by almost 30 percent and revenues by an average of almost 9 percent annually, boosted profits by around five percentage points, and expanded EBITDA margins by nearly seven percentage points.  1For more on outperformance in distribution, see \u00e2\u0080\u009cLessons from transformers: How some distributors reset and won,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, February 21, 2023.\nDistribution leaders recognize that operational excellence can be a promising path to profitable growth in these uncertain times. In this article, we outline the steps leading distributors are taking in operations to overcome their toughest challenges\u00e2\u0080\u0094and prepare for new ones.\n The labor market has eased overall but is still a top concern\nLabor shortages have eased since the pandemic, but more than a fifth of survey respondents still consider worker turnover their biggest operational gap (Exhibit 1). Labor mismatches are unlikely to fully dissipate on their own due to structural shifts such as early retirements and relocations. As one operations executive at an electronics distributor told us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrepandemic labor for warehousing and transportation was tight, and during the pandemic it became absurdly hard to recruit and retain people from the front line all the way to senior VP level. The situation is cooling, but labor is still a top priority.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Many distributors continue to face difficulties recruiting in select regions or for specific roles, such as commercial drivers and warehouse workers.\nNearly all respondents said they were hiring externally to meet talent needs, and most are offering more compensation or other benefits (Exhibit 2). But barely four in ten are helping current employees master new skills. Those companies that are upskilling may be gaining an edge: training can boost organizational agility in a more volatile marketplace, and career development and advancement can reduce turnover because they matter more to workers today.  2For more on the changing needs of workers, please see Ela Chodyniecka, Aaron De Smet, Bonnie Dowling, and Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoney can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buy your employees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 loyalty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McKinsey, March 28, 2022. \nIn conversations, leaders discussed a wide range of approaches they are taking to improve operations and the employee experience. An operations leader at a building supplies distributor credited his company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lean operations system with giving workers more control over how they do their work and increasing their job satisfaction. He added that targeted infrastructure improvements, such as remodeling the break room and improving the air-conditioning system, increased retention. A food service distributor has introduced more flexible schedules, including a part-time work option, five eight-hour shift options, four ten-hour shift options, and extended operating hours to accommodate more flexible schedules. Another operations executive has made equipment and operations bilingual, expanding the pool of potential talent to include Spanish speakers. Some distributors are also employing flexible labor, such as contract workers, to plug labor gaps. While these workers can be more expensive, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not as costly as productivity losses or declines in service levels caused by staffing shortfalls.\nMany distributors continue to face difficulties recruiting in select regions or for specific roles, such as commercial drivers and warehouse workers.\nTechnology is also playing a much larger role in retention. We spoke with leaders at a distribution company who used advanced analytics to understand what was driving attrition. Based on what they learned, they redesigned the daily routines of frontline roles. Improvements included more accurate delivery scheduling that reduced driver idle time, along with significant reductions in downtime and overstaffing in distribution centers. Retention rose by approximately 15 percent.\n Low digital adoption has slowed the pace of operational improvement\nBy definition, every big distributor is a master of complexity\u00e2\u0080\u0094it may source, stock, price, and distribute half a million SKUs to meet customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs\u00e2\u0080\u0094but many leaders have yet to harness basic digital tools, such as planning processes or systems, to manage that complexity. As one auto parts distribution executive put it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCompared to our peers, we rank at six or seven out of ten on digital capabilities, but the industry as a whole is 20 years behind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some distributors are discouraged by the costs of purchasing, ROI, and building on legacy systems, but evolving software-as-a-service offerings are changing the equation and presenting an opportunity to leapfrog digital solutions. The time for upgrades has arrived.\nNearly half of our respondents said they had not invested in core building blocks of digital supply chain consistently across their networks, such as advanced planning systems (APS), warehouse management systems (WMS), or transportation management systems (TMS). About 14 percent still rely on manual spreadsheets for planning, while other sectors, from retail to advanced industries, are driving operational efficiency by using APS in pursuit of autonomous planning. Half of respondents have no warehouse robotics or automation\u00e2\u0080\u0094and no plans to adopt them (Exhibit 3).\nAlmost half of survey respondents said they had accelerated their implementation of advanced analytics to respond to recent supply chain challenges, but progress has been difficult in many cases\u00e2\u0080\u0094data scattered across different systems is the most common pain point. Other challenges include perceived high investment costs and slow implementation and adoption, with steep learning curves, across acquired subsidiaries. One senior leader in the chemicals sector told us that some software had been \u00e2\u0080\u009chome runs\u00e2\u0080\u009d in terms of value, some had not met expectations, and some had simply never been used.\n Inventory and network strategies are increasingly important in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more volatile marketplace\nAs supply constraints ease, more distributors are getting back to basics, such as improving the customer experience. Their success will depend heavily on strategies that make inventory available across networks in more efficient ways, particularly for traditional distributors aiming to provide high service levels to retain high margins. Many distributors are building capacity to stay closer to customers, for example, by offering larger selections of SKUs and exceeding service-level expectations to boost customer acquisition and retention.\nMore than six in ten survey respondents say they have reassessed inventory strategy to maintain higher service levels, including faster deliveries and higher fill rates, and now hold larger stocks of critical SKUs. Many are finding ways to expand warehouse capacity to accommodate a larger and wider selection of inventory. In fact, nearly a third of survey respondents expect to make major investments in capacity and automation in the next three to five years\u00e2\u0080\u0094roughly the same share as those who anticipate investments in digital (Exhibit 4).\nSome operations leaders are getting more value from the space they already have, such as by investing in retrieval systems that maximize the use of vertical space per square foot. As distributors focus on driving growth, network strategy will play an increasingly critical role, especially as revenues continue to shift to online channels and e-commerce.\n Recent disruptions revealed the high costs of complex organization design\nThe ability to make the right decisions quickly in response to changing market conditions is more important than ever as major disruptions become more frequent. But we find that many distributors become less agile as they grow\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example by adopting inconsistent systems and processes in different areas of their business. This is particularly the case for those who rely heavily on M&A to bolster the top line but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully integrate the companies they acquire.\nWithout standard tools and approaches to make organization-wide decisions and gain synergies, distributors are likely to miss opportunities to drive sourcing efficiency, optimize pricing, and respond quickly to shifting customer demand. They also tend to spend more on multiple solutions that do not integrate well with one another. A leader in energy and mining equipment distribution explained that too many levels of management created lengthy chains of approvals, causing delays in procurement and quote changes from suppliers and logistics vendors, raising the share of expedited shipments.\nMeanwhile, without central oversight, complex reporting lines and approval processes can slow strategic decision making and obscure accountability. Two-thirds of survey respondents said their companies had not centralized core functions or had duplicate and noncore functionality in IT, network planning, supplier management, or other areas. As one senior food services operations leader put it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe duplication in our business adds costs and impedes our ability to move quickly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nA value-back operations transformation can set up a distributor for success\nGiven the complexity of transforming operations, distributors should use a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvalue back\u00e2\u0080\u009d strategy to prioritize initiatives based on expected business impact, feasibility, and the time and cost to scale. Without a value-back approach, organizations risk pursuing projects that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deliver the maximum impact or investing in \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust have\u00e2\u0080\u009d digital solutions that remain underutilized and fail to deliver adequate returns\u00e2\u0080\u0094making future investments even more difficult to justify.\nOnly half of our survey respondents said their investments in digital technology met or exceeded expectations. Some of the biggest shortfalls in ROI arise from failures to link technology upgrades closely to process and organization changes. We have seen some companies delay digital journeys while they wait to compile \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect\u00e2\u0080\u009d master data, but starting with a few use cases and then gathering relevant data can yield results far more quickly. Another key to progress in most digital transformations is tapping talent with the right experience to complement the knowledge of those who understand distribution. As one executive that is focusing on bringing in external talent said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are one good person from success in any given organization.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nTransformation can seem daunting, but business as usual is a losing strategy in a volatile marketplace where competitors are raising their game. A value-back approach applied across functions and subsidiaries helps distributors set, execute, and modify strategy in response to almost any challenge, from economic and geopolitical disruption to sudden shifts in customer needs and expectations.\nIn today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tight labor market, for example, some distributors using value-back strategies are piloting physical automation. A global healthcare distributor has reduced its reliance on manual labor by using autonomous, maneuverable robots in distribution centers and is reportedly testing autonomous floor sweepers and scrubbers\u00e2\u0080\u0094specific use cases that deliver solid returns on investment. Some are also adopting labor planning systems that allow managers to identify areas with excess labor, make intraweek and even intraday labor adjustments, and build flex capacity to account for absenteeism\u00e2\u0080\u0094all of which can ease the impact of labor shortages and rising wages.\nIn our experience serving distributors across sectors around the world, we have found that digital advances underpin nearly every transformation. Most find that a first-rate warehouse management system improves labor management, for example. This is likely one reason why a majority of survey respondents without a WMS are considering implementing one (Exhibit 5).\n\n 5\n\nDistributors with up-to-date tech stacks and access to mountains of data from public, private, and internal sources will get more value from advanced analytics, including demand-and-supply planning, predictive inventory replenishment, machine-learning-based inventory forecasting, and a digital control tower.\nThe pace and scope of any transformation are vitally important. Achieving results and exciting stakeholders requires striking the right balance between thinking too big\u00e2\u0080\u0094an enterprise-wide transformation across multiple domains, for example\u00e2\u0080\u0094and thinking too small, such as pursuing only individual use cases to demonstrate material impact.\n It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to act\nAs systemic supply disruptions ease in an inflationary and increasingly transparent market, distributors who improve operational efficiency to offer better service, responsiveness, and capabilities could gain considerable competitive advantages and limit margin compression.\nWe expect the delta between leaders and laggards to expand in the years ahead. Based on our analysis, we believe that as much as one to two percentage points of EBITA margin could be up for grabs across the distribution market\u00e2\u0080\u0094a significant improvement given an industry average EBITA margin of just 8 percent.\nA few players could seize a larger share of that growth: the masters of operational excellence.\nThorne Brown is an associate partner in McKinsey\u2019s Atlanta office; Iliana Filyanova is a partner in the Denver office, where Kevin Sachs is a senior partner; and Rohit Panikkar is a partner in the Chicago office.\nThe authors wish to thank Kapil Dev Bansal, Navya Devarasetty, Neil Graham, Rob McCarthy, and Howard Tomb for their contributions to this article.\n"

Health insurance is compulsory, but people with an income above a fixed threshold or belonging to a particular professional group (e.g. self-employed people or civil servants) can opt out of SHI coverage and enrol in (substitutive) private health insurance (PHI). About 11 % of the population are covered by PHI; 89 % by SHI. Although coverage is universal for all legal residents and only 0.1 % of the population do not have health insurance, there are still gaps due to financial or administrative barriers (see Section 5.2). The multi-payer SHI system currently consists of 103 sickness funds and 41 PHI companies, and the three biggest sickness funds cover more than one third of the German population.\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cIn Germany, 88\u00a0percent of the population is covered by statutory health insurance, which is financed by financially and organizationally independent statutory health insurance funds, and 9\u00a0percent of the population is privately insured.15\u00a0The guiding principle of the German statutory health insurance system is solidarity regarding both income and provision of services: All insured people contribute a share of their income, irrespective of their health risk, and people are entitled to benefits according to their health needs, irrespective of their socioeconomic status, ability to pay, or location.16\u00a0All employed people earning less than the opt-out threshold, people receiving welfare benefits, and pensioners have mandatory statutory health insurance, and their nonearning dependents are insured free of charge. People with high income and self-employed people can purchase private health insurance or keep the statutory health insurance. Coverage of services is roughly the same in both systems, apart from certain newly launched drugs, which are paid for by private insurance. There is no restriction on patients\u2019 choice of hospitals, and patient copays for hospital stays do not differ across hospitals.\u201d\nSource: Esra Eren Bayindir\u00a0and\u00a0Jonas Schrey\u00f6gg. Public Reporting Of Hospital Quality Measures Has Not Led To Overall Quality Improvement: Evidence From Germany. Health Affairs\u00a02023\u00a042:4,\u00a0566-574\n\u201cThe German health system has a complex governance structure. The federal government defines only the legal framework, while regulatory details are specified in directives issued by the Federal Joint Committee \u2013 the highest self-governing decision-making body in the country. The Committee consists of representatives of associations of sickness funds, physicians, dentists and hospitals, as well as three independent members (plus patient representatives without voting rights). It takes decisions on SHI benefits, reimbursement systems and quality assurance.\u201cThe states (Bundesl\u00e4nder) supervise the self-governing bodies at the regional level and are responsible for hospital planning and investments, as well as medical education. They are also responsible for public health services and the running of public health offices, which gained in importance during the COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, the crisis revealed the challenges faced by federal systems in coordinating and managing the pandemic. Governance mechanisms have been put in place to enable rapid, cross-state measures to respond to the crisis through ordinance authorisations, particularly by the Federal Ministry of Health (Box 1).\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cThe German system provides universal population coverage either through social health insurance (SHI) (almost 90% of the population) or substitutive VHI [Voluntary Health Insurance]. As OOP [Out-Of-Pocket] policies of substitutive VHI vary widely (and data is largely unavailable), we focus on SHI. OOP spending in Germany is related to both direct payments for services not covered by SHI (e.g., over-the-counter drugs) and cost-sharing for SHI covered services, but the relative importance of cost-sharing versus direct payments is not known because of the health system\u2019s accounting methods. OOP spending above reference prices for dental care and medical aids can be substantial; for example, reference prices for dental care cover only about 50% of the costs of standard care. Cost-sharing requirements increased in 2004 for such things as prescription drugs, inpatient care, and physician and dental care, while at the same time adult eyeglasses were excluded from coverage. Since these increased requirements became effective in 2004 they do not affect the average growth rate in the 2004\u20132014 period and therefore do not contradict the observed drop in average growth in 2004\u20132014 compared to the 1994\u20132004 period. The most plausible explanation for the low growth in this period is the fact that in 2013, co-payments for physician visits were discontinued. The most important protection mechanism against OOPs is the exemption of children under 18\u00a0years of age and a maximum cost-sharing limit of 2% of annual income (or 1% for patients with severe chronic conditions). This has remained largely unchanged over the study period.\u201d\nRice, Thomas et al. \u201cRevisiting out-of-pocket requirements: trends in spending, financial access barriers, and policy in ten high-income countries.\u201d BMC health services research vol. 18,1 371. 18 May. 2018, doi:10.1186/s12913-018-3185-8.\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German federal government recently orchestrated a fundamental change to its public health infrastructure. This reconstruction centers around the founding of a National Institute for Prevention and Education in Medicine (Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Pr\u00e4vention und Aufkl\u00e4rung in der Medizin, BIPAM) at the cost of two federal institutions, the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) and the Federal Center for Health Education (Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, BzGA). Thus, the Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit, BMG) plans to dissolve the BzGA and integrate its personnel into the future BIPAM. Further, all RKI research and surveillance activities related to non-communicable diseases, including AI methods development will be transferred into the BIPAM. The RKI responsibilities will solely focus on infectious diseases. According to announced plans of the BMG the primary objective for establishing the BIPAM is to address non-communicable diseases and enhance overall population health. However, the medical specialist training for public health remains non-academic at a state institution. Simultaneously the BMG already replaced two thirds of experts of the permanent commission on vaccination (St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission, STIKO) and determined new procedures for appointing future expert commissioners. With these changes, Germany embarks on an extraordinary reshuffling of its national public health organizations and responsibilities, by fundamentally separating all issues around non-communicable diseases from those of infectious diseases. Germany\u2019s unraveled research tasks of public health authorities however remains unmet. Thus, 2024 marks a pivotal caesura for public health in the modern history of Germany.\u201d\nSource: Savaskan N, Lampl BMJ, Yavuz M, Tinnemann P.

It is the only country in Europe with coexisting SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] and substitutive PHI [Private Health Insurance]. Both schemes are separated along different organizational, regulative and financial lines (Figure 2.1). Care sectors are also separated in terms of organization, governance and financing. Due to separate legislation for individual sectors within public health, ambulatory and inpatient care, as well as in long-term care, there is strong fragmentation of service provision (Figures 2.1 and 2.2).\u201cHealth insurance is compulsory for all citizens and permanent residents, with SHI constituting the main source of financing health care. The multi-payer SHI insurance scheme covered 72.8 million people or 87.7% of the population in 2018. Employees above an opt-out threshold of income, \u20ac 62 550 in 2020, and certain professional groups, e.g. self-employed or civil servants, can opt to enroll in substitutive PHI. Thus, 8.7 million people (or 10.5% of the population) were covered by substitutive PHI (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit (BMG), 2019d; Statistisches Bundesamt, 2019b; Verband der privaten Krankenversicherung, 2019a) (see Section 3.3.1 Coverage for more detail). Another unique feature of the German health care system is that the vast majority of providers serve both insured populations. The few exemptions that are accessible only to those insured under substitutive PHI represent less than 1% of total hospitals in 2018 (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2020g).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i\u2013273.\n\u201cHealth insurance coverage is mandatory for the entire population. Coverage is virtually universal and less than 1% of the population is not insured. Some groups of people can choose between publicly financed coverage provided through the statutory health insurance scheme and privately financed substitutive coverage provided by private insurers. Access to substitutive private coverage is restricted to civil servants, self-employed individuals and high-income employees (the annual earnings threshold was \u20ac50,850 in 2012). These groups may opt out of the statutory scheme, but once they do so the return options are limited. For example, employees may only return to the statutory scheme when their earnings fall below the threshold. Individuals with substitutive private coverage who are older than 55 years are prohibited from returning to the statutory scheme.\u201d\nSource: Stefan Gre\u00df. \u201cGermany.\u201d In Voluntary health insurance in Europe: Country experience [Internet].

Observatory Studies Series, No. 42.\n\u201cThe archetypal Bismarck model is the traditional system of Germany, financed by multiple insurers, with employer-based schemes supplemented by the state, in which providers are privately owned and patients have direct access to specialists.\u201d\nSource:  Bevan G, Helderman JK, Wilsford D: Changing choices in health care: implications for equity, efficiency and cost. Health Econ Policy Law. 2010, 5 (3): 251-67. 10.1017/S1744133110000022.\n\u201cThe German health care system is notable for two essential characteristics: 1) the sharing of decision-making powers between states, federal government, and self-regulated organizations of payers and providers; and 2) the separation of SHI (including the social LTCI) and PHI (including the private LTCI). SHI and PHI (as well as the two long-term care insurance systems) use the same providers\u2014that is, hospitals and physicians treat both statutorily and privately insured patients, unlike those in many other countries.\u201cWithin the legal framework set by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Joint Committee has wide-ranging regulatory power to determine the services to be covered by sickness funds and to set quality measures for providers (see below). To the extent possible, coverage decisions are based on evidence from health technology assessments and comparative-effectiveness reviews. The Federal Joint Committee is supported by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency (IQWiG), a foundation legally charged with evaluating the cost-effectiveness of drugs with added therapeutic benefits, and the Institute for Quality and Transparency (IQTiG), which is responsible for intersectoral quality assurance.

Its tasks include developing laws and drawing up administrative guidelines for the self-governing activities within the health care system. The Ministry of Health directs a number of institutions and agencies responsible for dealing with higher-level issues of public health, such as the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (\u201cBundesinstitut f\u00fcr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte\u201d \u2013 BfArM) and the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices makes decisions concerning the approval of pharmaceuticals. The Paul Ehrlich Institute is responsible for approving vaccines.\u201cWhen it comes to matters concerning statutory health insurance, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) is the highest decision-making body within the self-governing health care system. It includes members representing doctors, dentists, psychotherapists, the statutory insurers, hospitals and patients. As the central entity of federal-level self-governance, the Federal Joint Committee makes decisions concerning which medical services will be covered by the statutory insurers and what form that coverage will take.\u201d\nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

All provide the same services as defined by the G-BA (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) or the different umbrella organizations of the SHFs (referred to in the following the Statutory Health Insurer\u2019s organizations (SHIs). Private insurance covers nearly the same services but allows additional benefits (e.g. first class service) \u2013 there is competition between private insurers. Since 2004, decision-making in statutory health insurance has been integrated into a trans-sector federal joint committee that is supported by an independent institute for quality and efficiency in health care, the German IQWiG. Since 2008, according to the new Competition Enhancement Act, the IQWiG has to evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of pharmaceuticals in Germany based on international accepted guidelines in evidence based medicine and in health economics.\u201d\nSource: ISPOR\u2014The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research.

Last accessed Oct. 2, 2019.\n\u201cThe German health care system is divided into three main areas: outpatient care, inpatient care (the hospital sector), and rehabilitation facilities.\u201cThe institutions responsible for running the health care system include the associations and representatives of various providers and professions, health insurers, regulatory bodies, the Federal Ministry of Health, patient organizations and self-help groups.\u201cThe basic principles of the health care system\u201cThe health care system in Germany is based on four basic principles:\u201cCompulsory insurance: Everyone must have statutory health insurance (\u201cgesetzliche Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 GKV) provided that their gross earnings are under a fixed limit (\u201cVersicherungspflichtgrenze\u201d). Anyone who earns more than that can choose to have private insurance (\u201cprivate Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 PKV).\u201cFunding through insurance premiums: Health care is financed mostly from the premiums paid by insured employees and their employers. Tax revenue surpluses also contribute. To give you an idea of what this means: State-funded health care systems like those in Great Britain or Sweden draw on tax revenue. In market-oriented systems such as that in the United States, many people have to carry the costs of treatment and loss of earnings due to illness themselves, or have to get private health insurance.\u201cPrinciple of solidarity: In the German health care system, statutory health insurance members jointly carry the individual risks of the costs of medical care in the event of illness. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care and continued payment of wages when ill \u2013 regardless of their income and premium level. The premiums are based on income. This means that the rich can help the poor, and the healthy can help the ill. However, these premiums are only calculated based on a percentage scale up to a certain income level (\u201cBeitragsbemessungsgrenze\u201d). Anyone earning more than this amount pays the same maximum premium.\u201cPrinciple of self-governance: While the German state sets the conditions for medical care, the further organization and financing of individual medical services is the responsibility of the self-governing bodies within the health care system. These are made up of members representing doctors and dentists, psychotherapists, hospitals, insurers and the insured people. The Federal Joint Committee (\u201cGemeinsamer Bundesausschuss\u201d or G-BA \u2013 please also see below: \u201cStructure and institutions of the health care system\u201d) is the highest entity of self-governance within the statutory health insurance system.\u201d \nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

Health insurance is compulsory, but people with an income above a fixed threshold or belonging to a particular professional group (e.g. self-employed people or civil servants) can opt out of SHI coverage and enrol in (substitutive) private health insurance (PHI). About 11 % of the population are covered by PHI; 89 % by SHI. Although coverage is universal for all legal residents and only 0.1 % of the population do not have health insurance, there are still gaps due to financial or administrative barriers (see Section 5.2). The multi-payer SHI system currently consists of 103 sickness funds and 41 PHI companies, and the three biggest sickness funds cover more than one third of the German population.\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cIn Germany, 88\u00a0percent of the population is covered by statutory health insurance, which is financed by financially and organizationally independent statutory health insurance funds, and 9\u00a0percent of the population is privately insured.15\u00a0The guiding principle of the German statutory health insurance system is solidarity regarding both income and provision of services: All insured people contribute a share of their income, irrespective of their health risk, and people are entitled to benefits according to their health needs, irrespective of their socioeconomic status, ability to pay, or location.16\u00a0All employed people earning less than the opt-out threshold, people receiving welfare benefits, and pensioners have mandatory statutory health insurance, and their nonearning dependents are insured free of charge. People with high income and self-employed people can purchase private health insurance or keep the statutory health insurance. Coverage of services is roughly the same in both systems, apart from certain newly launched drugs, which are paid for by private insurance. There is no restriction on patients\u2019 choice of hospitals, and patient copays for hospital stays do not differ across hospitals.\u201d\nSource: Esra Eren Bayindir\u00a0and\u00a0Jonas Schrey\u00f6gg.

Health Affairs\u00a02023\u00a042:4,\u00a0566-574\n\u201cThe German health system has a complex governance structure. The federal government defines only the legal framework, while regulatory details are specified in directives issued by the Federal Joint Committee \u2013 the highest self-governing decision-making body in the country. The Committee consists of representatives of associations of sickness funds, physicians, dentists and hospitals, as well as three independent members (plus patient representatives without voting rights). It takes decisions on SHI benefits, reimbursement systems and quality assurance.\u201cThe states (Bundesl\u00e4nder) supervise the self-governing bodies at the regional level and are responsible for hospital planning and investments, as well as medical education. They are also responsible for public health services and the running of public health offices, which gained in importance during the COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, the crisis revealed the challenges faced by federal systems in coordinating and managing the pandemic. Governance mechanisms have been put in place to enable rapid, cross-state measures to respond to the crisis through ordinance authorisations, particularly by the Federal Ministry of Health (Box 1).\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cThe German system provides universal population coverage either through social health insurance (SHI) (almost 90% of the population) or substitutive VHI [Voluntary Health Insurance]. As OOP [Out-Of-Pocket] policies of substitutive VHI vary widely (and data is largely unavailable), we focus on SHI. OOP spending in Germany is related to both direct payments for services not covered by SHI (e.g., over-the-counter drugs) and cost-sharing for SHI covered services, but the relative importance of cost-sharing versus direct payments is not known because of the health system\u2019s accounting methods. OOP spending above reference prices for dental care and medical aids can be substantial; for example, reference prices for dental care cover only about 50% of the costs of standard care. Cost-sharing requirements increased in 2004 for such things as prescription drugs, inpatient care, and physician and dental care, while at the same time adult eyeglasses were excluded from coverage. Since these increased requirements became effective in 2004 they do not affect the average growth rate in the 2004\u20132014 period and therefore do not contradict the observed drop in average growth in 2004\u20132014 compared to the 1994\u20132004 period. The most plausible explanation for the low growth in this period is the fact that in 2013, co-payments for physician visits were discontinued. The most important protection mechanism against OOPs is the exemption of children under 18\u00a0years of age and a maximum cost-sharing limit of 2% of annual income (or 1% for patients with severe chronic conditions). This has remained largely unchanged over the study period.\u201d\nRice, Thomas et al. \u201cRevisiting out-of-pocket requirements: trends in spending, financial access barriers, and policy in ten high-income countries.\u201d BMC health services research vol. 18,1 371. 18 May. 2018, doi:10.1186/s12913-018-3185-8.\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German federal government recently orchestrated a fundamental change to its public health infrastructure. This reconstruction centers around the founding of a National Institute for Prevention and Education in Medicine (Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Pr\u00e4vention und Aufkl\u00e4rung in der Medizin, BIPAM) at the cost of two federal institutions, the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) and the Federal Center for Health Education (Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, BzGA). Thus, the Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit, BMG) plans to dissolve the BzGA and integrate its personnel into the future BIPAM. Further, all RKI research and surveillance activities related to non-communicable diseases, including AI methods development will be transferred into the BIPAM. The RKI responsibilities will solely focus on infectious diseases. According to announced plans of the BMG the primary objective for establishing the BIPAM is to address non-communicable diseases and enhance overall population health. However, the medical specialist training for public health remains non-academic at a state institution. Simultaneously the BMG already replaced two thirds of experts of the permanent commission on vaccination (St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission, STIKO) and determined new procedures for appointing future expert commissioners. With these changes, Germany embarks on an extraordinary reshuffling of its national public health organizations and responsibilities, by fundamentally separating all issues around non-communicable diseases from those of infectious diseases. Germany\u2019s unraveled research tasks of public health authorities however remains unmet. Thus, 2024 marks a pivotal caesura for public health in the modern history of Germany.\u201d\nSource: Savaskan N, Lampl BMJ, Yavuz M, Tinnemann P. Germany\u2019s national public health gets reorganized: A new institute shall take center stage.\u00a0Health Policy. 2024;145:105084. doi:10.1016/j.healthpol.2024.105084\n\u201cThe German health system and its governance is highly complex. It is the only country in Europe with coexisting SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] and substitutive PHI [Private Health Insurance]. Both schemes are separated along different organizational, regulative and financial lines (Figure 2.1). Care sectors are also separated in terms of organization, governance and financing. Due to separate legislation for individual sectors within public health, ambulatory and inpatient care, as well as in long-term care, there is strong fragmentation of service provision (Figures 2.1 and 2.2).\u201cHealth insurance is compulsory for all citizens and permanent residents, with SHI constituting the main source of financing health care. The multi-payer SHI insurance scheme covered 72.8 million people or 87.7% of the population in 2018. Employees above an opt-out threshold of income, \u20ac 62 550 in 2020, and certain professional groups, e.g. self-employed or civil servants, can opt to enroll in substitutive PHI. Thus, 8.7 million people (or 10.5% of the population) were covered by substitutive PHI (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit (BMG), 2019d; Statistisches Bundesamt, 2019b; Verband der privaten Krankenversicherung, 2019a) (see Section 3.3.1 Coverage for more detail). Another unique feature of the German health care system is that the vast majority of providers serve both insured populations. The few exemptions that are accessible only to those insured under substitutive PHI represent less than 1% of total hospitals in 2018 (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2020g).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i\u2013273.\n\u201cHealth insurance coverage is mandatory for the entire population. Coverage is virtually universal and less than 1% of the population is not insured. Some groups of people can choose between publicly financed coverage provided through the statutory health insurance scheme and privately financed substitutive coverage provided by private insurers. Access to substitutive private coverage is restricted to civil servants, self-employed individuals and high-income employees (the annual earnings threshold was \u20ac50,850 in 2012). These groups may opt out of the statutory scheme, but once they do so the return options are limited. For example, employees may only return to the statutory scheme when their earnings fall below the threshold. Individuals with substitutive private coverage who are older than 55 years are prohibited from returning to the statutory scheme.\u201d\nSource: Stefan Gre\u00df. \u201cGermany.\u201d In Voluntary health insurance in Europe: Country experience [Internet].

Observatory Studies Series, No. 42.\n\u201cThe archetypal Bismarck model is the traditional system of Germany, financed by multiple insurers, with employer-based schemes supplemented by the state, in which providers are privately owned and patients have direct access to specialists.\u201d\nSource:  Bevan G, Helderman JK, Wilsford D: Changing choices in health care: implications for equity, efficiency and cost. Health Econ Policy Law. 2010, 5 (3): 251-67. 10.1017/S1744133110000022.\n\u201cThe German health care system is notable for two essential characteristics: 1) the sharing of decision-making powers between states, federal government, and self-regulated organizations of payers and providers; and 2) the separation of SHI (including the social LTCI) and PHI (including the private LTCI). SHI and PHI (as well as the two long-term care insurance systems) use the same providers\u2014that is, hospitals and physicians treat both statutorily and privately insured patients, unlike those in many other countries.\u201cWithin the legal framework set by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Joint Committee has wide-ranging regulatory power to determine the services to be covered by sickness funds and to set quality measures for providers (see below). To the extent possible, coverage decisions are based on evidence from health technology assessments and comparative-effectiveness reviews. The Federal Joint Committee is supported by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency (IQWiG), a foundation legally charged with evaluating the cost-effectiveness of drugs with added therapeutic benefits, and the Institute for Quality and Transparency (IQTiG), which is responsible for intersectoral quality assurance. It has 13 voting members: five from the Federal Association of Sickness Funds, two each from the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation, one from the Federal Association of SHI Dentists, and three who are unaffiliated. Five patient representatives have an advisory role but no vote. Representatives of patient organizations have the right to participate in different decision-making bodies\u2014for example, the subcommittees of the Federal Joint Committee.\u201cThe Federal Association of Sickness Funds works with the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation to develop the SHI ambulatory care fee schedule and the DRG catalogue, which are then adopted by bilateral joint committees.\u201d\nSource: Commonwealth Fund.

Last accessed Sept. 30, 2019.  \n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health (\u201cBundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit\u201d \u2013 BMG) is responsible for policy-making at the federal level. Its tasks include developing laws and drawing up administrative guidelines for the self-governing activities within the health care system. The Ministry of Health directs a number of institutions and agencies responsible for dealing with higher-level issues of public health, such as the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (\u201cBundesinstitut f\u00fcr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte\u201d \u2013 BfArM) and the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices makes decisions concerning the approval of pharmaceuticals. The Paul Ehrlich Institute is responsible for approving vaccines.\u201cWhen it comes to matters concerning statutory health insurance, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) is the highest decision-making body within the self-governing health care system. It includes members representing doctors, dentists, psychotherapists, the statutory insurers, hospitals and patients. As the central entity of federal-level self-governance, the Federal Joint Committee makes decisions concerning which medical services will be covered by the statutory insurers and what form that coverage will take.\u201d\nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

In addition to these four pillar organizations, patient representatives also participate in all sessions; they are entitled to put topics on the agenda, but not to vote.\u201d\nSource: The Federal Joint Committee: Who we are and what we do. Gemeinsame Bundesausschuss (Federal Joint Committee). Last accessed September 30, 2019.\n\u201cThe framework for health care in Germany is based on central decision making:\u201c1) Legislation established by the parliament,\u201c2) Decrees issued by the Ministry of Health,\u201c3) Directives issued by the G-BA under supervision of the ministry, and\u201c4) Contracts between self-governing organizations under supervision of the ministry.\u201cThere is no competition on products on services between the funds. All provide the same services as defined by the G-BA (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) or the different umbrella organizations of the SHFs (referred to in the following the Statutory Health Insurer\u2019s organizations (SHIs). Private insurance covers nearly the same services but allows additional benefits (e.g. first class service) \u2013 there is competition between private insurers. Since 2004, decision-making in statutory health insurance has been integrated into a trans-sector federal joint committee that is supported by an independent institute for quality and efficiency in health care, the German IQWiG. Since 2008, according to the new Competition Enhancement Act, the IQWiG has to evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of pharmaceuticals in Germany based on international accepted guidelines in evidence based medicine and in health economics.\u201d\nSource: ISPOR\u2014The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research. Global Health Technology Assessment Road Map:  Germany \u2013 Pharmaceutical. Updated June 2009. Last accessed Oct. 2, 2019.\n\u201cThe German health care system is divided into three main areas: outpatient care, inpatient care (the hospital sector), and rehabilitation facilities.\u201cThe institutions responsible for running the health care system include the associations and representatives of various providers and professions, health insurers, regulatory bodies, the Federal Ministry of Health, patient organizations and self-help groups.\u201cThe basic principles of the health care system\u201cThe health care system in Germany is based on four basic principles:\u201cCompulsory insurance: Everyone must have statutory health insurance (\u201cgesetzliche Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 GKV) provided that their gross earnings are under a fixed limit (\u201cVersicherungspflichtgrenze\u201d). Anyone who earns more than that can choose to have private insurance (\u201cprivate Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 PKV).\u201cFunding through insurance premiums: Health care is financed mostly from the premiums paid by insured employees and their employers. Tax revenue surpluses also contribute. To give you an idea of what this means: State-funded health care systems like those in Great Britain or Sweden draw on tax revenue. In market-oriented systems such as that in the United States, many people have to carry the costs of treatment and loss of earnings due to illness themselves, or have to get private health insurance.\u201cPrinciple of solidarity: In the German health care system, statutory health insurance members jointly carry the individual risks of the costs of medical care in the event of illness. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care and continued payment of wages when ill \u2013 regardless of their income and premium level. The premiums are based on income. This means that the rich can help the poor, and the healthy can help the ill. However, these premiums are only calculated based on a percentage scale up to a certain income level (\u201cBeitragsbemessungsgrenze\u201d). Anyone earning more than this amount pays the same maximum premium.\u201cPrinciple of self-governance: While the German state sets the conditions for medical care, the further organization and financing of individual medical services is the responsibility of the self-governing bodies within the health care system. These are made up of members representing doctors and dentists, psychotherapists, hospitals, insurers and the insured people. The Federal Joint Committee (\u201cGemeinsamer Bundesausschuss\u201d or G-BA \u2013 please also see below: \u201cStructure and institutions of the health care system\u201d) is the highest entity of self-governance within the statutory health insurance system.\u201d \nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

Health insurance is compulsory, but people with an income above a fixed threshold or belonging to a particular professional group (e.g. self-employed people or civil servants) can opt out of SHI coverage and enrol in (substitutive) private health insurance (PHI). About 11 % of the population are covered by PHI; 89 % by SHI. Although coverage is universal for all legal residents and only 0.1 % of the population do not have health insurance, there are still gaps due to financial or administrative barriers (see Section 5.2). The multi-payer SHI system currently consists of 103 sickness funds and 41 PHI companies, and the three biggest sickness funds cover more than one third of the German population.\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cIn Germany, 88\u00a0percent of the population is covered by statutory health insurance, which is financed by financially and organizationally independent statutory health insurance funds, and 9\u00a0percent of the population is privately insured.15\u00a0The guiding principle of the German statutory health insurance system is solidarity regarding both income and provision of services: All insured people contribute a share of their income, irrespective of their health risk, and people are entitled to benefits according to their health needs, irrespective of their socioeconomic status, ability to pay, or location.16\u00a0All employed people earning less than the opt-out threshold, people receiving welfare benefits, and pensioners have mandatory statutory health insurance, and their nonearning dependents are insured free of charge. People with high income and self-employed people can purchase private health insurance or keep the statutory health insurance. Coverage of services is roughly the same in both systems, apart from certain newly launched drugs, which are paid for by private insurance. There is no restriction on patients\u2019 choice of hospitals, and patient copays for hospital stays do not differ across hospitals.\u201d\nSource: Esra Eren Bayindir\u00a0and\u00a0Jonas Schrey\u00f6gg.

Health Affairs\u00a02023\u00a042:4,\u00a0566-574\n\u201cThe German health system has a complex governance structure. The federal government defines only the legal framework, while regulatory details are specified in directives issued by the Federal Joint Committee \u2013 the highest self-governing decision-making body in the country. The Committee consists of representatives of associations of sickness funds, physicians, dentists and hospitals, as well as three independent members (plus patient representatives without voting rights). It takes decisions on SHI benefits, reimbursement systems and quality assurance.\u201cThe states (Bundesl\u00e4nder) supervise the self-governing bodies at the regional level and are responsible for hospital planning and investments, as well as medical education. They are also responsible for public health services and the running of public health offices, which gained in importance during the COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, the crisis revealed the challenges faced by federal systems in coordinating and managing the pandemic. Governance mechanisms have been put in place to enable rapid, cross-state measures to respond to the crisis through ordinance authorisations, particularly by the Federal Ministry of Health (Box 1).\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cThe German system provides universal population coverage either through social health insurance (SHI) (almost 90% of the population) or substitutive VHI [Voluntary Health Insurance]. As OOP [Out-Of-Pocket] policies of substitutive VHI vary widely (and data is largely unavailable), we focus on SHI. OOP spending in Germany is related to both direct payments for services not covered by SHI (e.g., over-the-counter drugs) and cost-sharing for SHI covered services, but the relative importance of cost-sharing versus direct payments is not known because of the health system\u2019s accounting methods. OOP spending above reference prices for dental care and medical aids can be substantial; for example, reference prices for dental care cover only about 50% of the costs of standard care. Cost-sharing requirements increased in 2004 for such things as prescription drugs, inpatient care, and physician and dental care, while at the same time adult eyeglasses were excluded from coverage. Since these increased requirements became effective in 2004 they do not affect the average growth rate in the 2004\u20132014 period and therefore do not contradict the observed drop in average growth in 2004\u20132014 compared to the 1994\u20132004 period. The most plausible explanation for the low growth in this period is the fact that in 2013, co-payments for physician visits were discontinued. The most important protection mechanism against OOPs is the exemption of children under 18\u00a0years of age and a maximum cost-sharing limit of 2% of annual income (or 1% for patients with severe chronic conditions). This has remained largely unchanged over the study period.\u201d\nRice, Thomas et al. \u201cRevisiting out-of-pocket requirements: trends in spending, financial access barriers, and policy in ten high-income countries.\u201d BMC health services research vol. 18,1 371. 18 May. 2018, doi:10.1186/s12913-018-3185-8.\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German federal government recently orchestrated a fundamental change to its public health infrastructure. This reconstruction centers around the founding of a National Institute for Prevention and Education in Medicine (Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Pr\u00e4vention und Aufkl\u00e4rung in der Medizin, BIPAM) at the cost of two federal institutions, the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) and the Federal Center for Health Education (Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung, BzGA). Thus, the Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit, BMG) plans to dissolve the BzGA and integrate its personnel into the future BIPAM. Further, all RKI research and surveillance activities related to non-communicable diseases, including AI methods development will be transferred into the BIPAM. The RKI responsibilities will solely focus on infectious diseases. According to announced plans of the BMG the primary objective for establishing the BIPAM is to address non-communicable diseases and enhance overall population health. However, the medical specialist training for public health remains non-academic at a state institution. Simultaneously the BMG already replaced two thirds of experts of the permanent commission on vaccination (St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission, STIKO) and determined new procedures for appointing future expert commissioners. With these changes, Germany embarks on an extraordinary reshuffling of its national public health organizations and responsibilities, by fundamentally separating all issues around non-communicable diseases from those of infectious diseases. Germany\u2019s unraveled research tasks of public health authorities however remains unmet. Thus, 2024 marks a pivotal caesura for public health in the modern history of Germany.\u201d\nSource: Savaskan N, Lampl BMJ, Yavuz M, Tinnemann P.

It is the only country in Europe with coexisting SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] and substitutive PHI [Private Health Insurance]. Both schemes are separated along different organizational, regulative and financial lines (Figure 2.1). Care sectors are also separated in terms of organization, governance and financing. Due to separate legislation for individual sectors within public health, ambulatory and inpatient care, as well as in long-term care, there is strong fragmentation of service provision (Figures 2.1 and 2.2).\u201cHealth insurance is compulsory for all citizens and permanent residents, with SHI constituting the main source of financing health care. The multi-payer SHI insurance scheme covered 72.8 million people or 87.7% of the population in 2018. Employees above an opt-out threshold of income, \u20ac 62 550 in 2020, and certain professional groups, e.g. self-employed or civil servants, can opt to enroll in substitutive PHI. Thus, 8.7 million people (or 10.5% of the population) were covered by substitutive PHI (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit (BMG), 2019d; Statistisches Bundesamt, 2019b; Verband der privaten Krankenversicherung, 2019a) (see Section 3.3.1 Coverage for more detail). Another unique feature of the German health care system is that the vast majority of providers serve both insured populations. The few exemptions that are accessible only to those insured under substitutive PHI represent less than 1% of total hospitals in 2018 (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2020g).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i\u2013273.\n\u201cHealth insurance coverage is mandatory for the entire population. Coverage is virtually universal and less than 1% of the population is not insured. Some groups of people can choose between publicly financed coverage provided through the statutory health insurance scheme and privately financed substitutive coverage provided by private insurers. Access to substitutive private coverage is restricted to civil servants, self-employed individuals and high-income employees (the annual earnings threshold was \u20ac50,850 in 2012). These groups may opt out of the statutory scheme, but once they do so the return options are limited. For example, employees may only return to the statutory scheme when their earnings fall below the threshold. Individuals with substitutive private coverage who are older than 55 years are prohibited from returning to the statutory scheme.\u201d\nSource: Stefan Gre\u00df. \u201cGermany.\u201d In Voluntary health insurance in Europe: Country experience [Internet].

SHI and PHI (as well as the two long-term care insurance systems) use the same providers\u2014that is, hospitals and physicians treat both statutorily and privately insured patients, unlike those in many other countries.\u201cWithin the legal framework set by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Joint Committee has wide-ranging regulatory power to determine the services to be covered by sickness funds and to set quality measures for providers (see below). To the extent possible, coverage decisions are based on evidence from health technology assessments and comparative-effectiveness reviews. The Federal Joint Committee is supported by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency (IQWiG), a foundation legally charged with evaluating the cost-effectiveness of drugs with added therapeutic benefits, and the Institute for Quality and Transparency (IQTiG), which is responsible for intersectoral quality assurance. It has 13 voting members: five from the Federal Association of Sickness Funds, two each from the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation, one from the Federal Association of SHI Dentists, and three who are unaffiliated. Five patient representatives have an advisory role but no vote. Representatives of patient organizations have the right to participate in different decision-making bodies\u2014for example, the subcommittees of the Federal Joint Committee.\u201cThe Federal Association of Sickness Funds works with the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation to develop the SHI ambulatory care fee schedule and the DRG catalogue, which are then adopted by bilateral joint committees.\u201d\nSource: Commonwealth Fund.

It includes members representing doctors, dentists, psychotherapists, the statutory insurers, hospitals and patients.

All provide the same services as defined by the G-BA (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) or the different umbrella organizations of the SHFs (referred to in the following the Statutory Health Insurer\u2019s organizations (SHIs). Private insurance covers nearly the same services but allows additional benefits (e.g. first class service) \u2013 there is competition between private insurers. Since 2004, decision-making in statutory health insurance has been integrated into a trans-sector federal joint committee that is supported by an independent institute for quality and efficiency in health care, the German IQWiG. Since 2008, according to the new Competition Enhancement Act, the IQWiG has to evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of pharmaceuticals in Germany based on international accepted guidelines in evidence based medicine and in health economics.\u201d\nSource: ISPOR\u2014The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research.

Anyone who earns more than that can choose to have private insurance (\u201cprivate Krankenversicherung\u201d \u2013 PKV).\u201cFunding through insurance premiums: Health care is financed mostly from the premiums paid by insured employees and their employers. Tax revenue surpluses also contribute. To give you an idea of what this means: State-funded health care systems like those in Great Britain or Sweden draw on tax revenue. In market-oriented systems such as that in the United States, many people have to carry the costs of treatment and loss of earnings due to illness themselves, or have to get private health insurance.\u201cPrinciple of solidarity: In the German health care system, statutory health insurance members jointly carry the individual risks of the costs of medical care in the event of illness. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care and continued payment of wages when ill \u2013 regardless of their income and premium level. The premiums are based on income. This means that the rich can help the poor, and the healthy can help the ill. However, these premiums are only calculated based on a percentage scale up to a certain income level (\u201cBeitragsbemessungsgrenze\u201d). Anyone earning more than this amount pays the same maximum premium.\u201cPrinciple of self-governance: While the German state sets the conditions for medical care, the further organization and financing of individual medical services is the responsibility of the self-governing bodies within the health care system. These are made up of members representing doctors and dentists, psychotherapists, hospitals, insurers and the insured people. The Federal Joint Committee (\u201cGemeinsamer Bundesausschuss\u201d or G-BA \u2013 please also see below: \u201cStructure and institutions of the health care system\u201d) is the highest entity of self-governance within the statutory health insurance system.\u201d \nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

The country also spends the highest share of its GDP on health among EU Member States (11.7 % in 2019, compared to the EU average of 9.9 %).\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cGermany spends almost an equal amount on inpatient and outpatient care. At EUR 1,221 per capita for outpatient care and EUR 1,212 for inpatient care in 2019, these figures are above the EU averages (EUR 1,022 for outpatient and EUR 1,010 for inpatient care), as was Germany\u2019s spending across all categories of health care (Figure 8). However, overall spending has increased more slowly than the EU average since 2016, and the distribution of resources across different functions is close to the EU averages at around 27 % each for inpatient and outpatient care (EU: 29.1 % and 29.5 %), 19 % for long-term care (LTC) (EU: 16 %), 19 % for medical goods (EU: 18 %) and 3 % for prevention (EU: 3 %). Over recent years, LTC spending has grown more strongly than other expenditure categories. In 2015, Germany spent EUR 637 per capita on LTC (the health component); this increased to EUR 849 in 2019. The 2017 reform of LTC increased spending as it expanded the benefits package and increased the number of recipients entitled to LTC services.\u201d\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n\u201cGermany spends a substantial amount of its wealth on health. Total expenditure on health amounted to 11.7% of GDP in 2018 according to data of the Federal Statistical Office. According to WHO data, per capita health expenditure more than doubled between 2000 and 2018, from US$ 2687 (adjusted for differences in purchasing power) to US$ 6098, which ranks Germany third in comparison to other WHO Europe countries in 2018 (after Switzerland and Norway) (World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, 2020) (see Section 3.1 Health expenditure). By OECD data, health expenditure in Germany as a share of GDP was the fourth highest share among OECD countries (after the United States, Switzerland and Norway) and per capita spending was way above the OECD36 average of US$ 3994 in 2018 (OECD, 2019).\u201cPer capita expenditure on health in Germany rose by an average of 2.5% per annum in real terms between 2013 and 2018 (up from 2.1% p.a. between 2008 and 2013). In comparison to other OECD countries, this was a relatively large increase during this period, and higher than in the Netherlands (0.5%), France (0.8%), Austria (1.0%), Switzerland (2.1%) and the OECD36 average (2.4%). According to OECD calculations, average per capita health expenditure growth is projected at 1.9% a year between 2015 and 2030, which would reflect a moderate increase compared to other OECD countries (OECD, 2019). The pace of health expenditure growth is partly attributable to the comparatively large human, technical and infrastructural resources in the German health care system and a high level of activity (e.g. in terms of consultations, hospital cases, consumption of pharmaceuticals). In addition, the full implementation of reforms to the long-term care insurance (LTCI) scheme, such as the broadening of eligibility criteria and benefits, and a rapidly ageing population, represent additional pressures on the sustainability of financing (see Section 5.8 Long-term care).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i\u2013273.\n\u201cCost-sharing and out-of-pocket spending: Out-of-pocket spending accounted for 13.2 percent of total health spending in 2014, mostly on nursing homes, pharmaceuticals, and medical aids.9\u201cCopayments include EUR5.00 to EUR10.00 (USD6.36 to USD12.72) per outpatient prescription, EUR10.00 per inpatient day for hospital and rehabilitation stays (for the first 28 days per year), and EUR5.00 to EUR10.00 for prescribed medical devices. Sickness funds offer selectable tariffs with a range of deductibles and no-claims bonuses. Preventive services do not count toward the deductible. SHI-contracted physicians are not allowed to charge above the fee schedule for services in the SHI benefit catalogue. However, a list of \u201cindividual health services\u201d outside the comprehensive range of SHI coverage may be offered to patients paying out of pocket.\u201cSafety nets: Children under 18 years of age are exempt from cost-sharing. For adults, there is an annual cap on cost-sharing equal to 2 percent of household income; part of a household\u2019s income is excluded from this calculation for additional family members. About 0.3 million of those insured under SHI exceeded the 2 percent cap in 2014 and were exempted from further cost-sharing. The cap is lowered to 1 percent of annual gross income for qualifying chronically ill people; to qualify, those people have to demonstrate that they attended recommended counseling or screening procedures prior to becoming ill. Nearly 6.3 million people, or around 9 percent of all the SHI-insured, benefited from this regulation in 2014.10 Unemployed people contribute to SHI in proportion to their unemployment entitlements. For the long-term unemployed, government contributes on their behalf.\u201d \nSource: Commonwealth Fund. International Health System Profiles: Germany. From the web, last accessed Sept. 30, 2019.\n\u201cAllocative efficiency indicates the extent to which an appropriate mix of services or interventions are purchased to maximize population health outcomes. In Germany the allocation of resources at the federal level mostly reflects the bargaining process between corporatist bodies, rather than a restrictive budget plan. Although there are mechanisms in place to secure the (cost-)effectiveness of benefits covered under SHI using tools such as Health Technology Assessment (see Section 2.7 Regulation), there is no priority setting by e.g. formulating goals. Pooled resources are reallocated among the sickness funds according to a morbidity-based risk-adjustment scheme, by which sickness funds have to cover all costs (see Section 3.3 Overview of the statutory financing system). However, the details of care provision and reimbursement are consequently negotiated between corporatist bodies and are not guided by an overarching strategic programme at the national level (instead, budgets are determined by historic spending levels).\u201cInternational comparisons of health expenditure by function show that Germany spent 27.2% on curative and rehabilitative care in inpatient and day care settings in 2018, which is higher than in the Netherlands (24.4%), Denmark (25.1%) and Switzerland (25.3%), but lower than the EU average (30%), France (31.5%) and Austria (33.3%) (OECD, 2020b). In more detail, Germany spent \u20ac 1169 per inhabitant on hospital care in 2018 (up from \u20ac 691 in 2000), \u20ac 428 on inpatient long-term care (up from \u20ac 211 in 2000) and \u20ac 122 on preventive and rehabilitative institutions (up from \u20ac 92 in 2000).\u201cGermany spent considerably less on ambulatory care than other EU countries. For instance, France (27.2%), Austria (29%), the Netherlands (29.2%), Switzerland (33.4%) and Denmark (34.9%) spent a higher share of health expenditure on ambulatory care, and the EU average is 31.4% (OECD, 2020b). In 2018, \u20ac 662 was spent per inhabitant for ambulatory care practices (up from \u20ac 383 in 2000), \u20ac 330 for dental care practices (up from \u20ac 227), \u20ac 257 for ambulatory long-term care (up from \u20ac 83) and \u20ac 206 on other allied health professionals (up from \u20ac 73).\u201cPharmaceuticals and medical devices accounted for another 13.7% of current health expenditures in 2018 (the fourth highest), according to the Federal Statistical Office. OECD data give a higher estimation for this category, with pharmaceuticals and medical devices representing the third highest budget item (19.3%). Under this data source, comparative countries like France (18.4%), Austria (168%), Switzerland (14.8%) and the Netherlands (11.5%) spent less on pharmaceuticals than Germany, while Denmark (10%) recorded almost half of the German costs (OECD, 2020b).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i\u2013273.\n\u201cA large part of health care expenditure in Germany is derived from the SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] system (see Table 3.2). Contributions to the 105 sickness funds constitute the major system of financing health care. The sickness funds are responsible for collecting contributions, which they transfer to a central reallocation pool known as the Gesundheitsfonds, which is responsible for pooling and reallocating the revenues according to a risk-adjustment mechanism (see Section 3.3.3 Pooling and allocation of funds).\u201cGeneral tax revenue is also used for various purposes in the health care system. All tax-based budgets, at federal as well as state level, are determined by legislatures acting on proposals from their governments. In addition, the Hospital Financing Act stipulates that investment costs should be paid from state taxes as well as by owners of public, private not-for-profit and private for-profit hospitals, if listed in the state\u2019s hospital requirement plan. Therefore, states receive tax money for investments in their hospitals (see Section 3.7.1 Paying for health services).\u201cTaxes as a source of health care financing have decreased throughout the last decade, falling from 10.8% of total health expenditure in 1996 to 4.2% in 2018. The most substantial decrease has been observed in spending on long-term care (about 50%), reflecting the unburdening of municipal budgets after the introduction of statutory long-term care insurance (see Section 5.8 Long-term care). Nevertheless, other spending on investments has decreased as well. Altogether, general government and statutory public sources accounted for 73.5% of current expenditure on health. Private sources accounted for a total 26.5% of total current expenditure: this includes direct out-of-pocket payments made by private households (13.6%). Private insurers financed 8.7%, which includes expenditures for substitutive/comprehensive health insurance, complementary health insurance and long-term care insurance.\u201cIt should be noted that the largest tax-financed item \u2013 the subsidies for SHI \u2013 is not declared as such in the fiscal statistics. Sickness funds receive a fixed amount from the federal budget for several benefits relevant to family policies: maternity benefits, sick-pay for parents caring for sick children, in-vitro fertilization, sterilization for contraceptive purposes, and prescription-only contraception up to the age of 21 and legal abortions. The federal government transfers its subsidy to the central reallocation pool (see Section 3.3.3 Pooling and allocation of funds). In 2012 the federal subsidy was \u20ac 14 billion. In order to consolidate the federal budget, the subsidy was temporarily reduced to \u20ac 10.5 billion in 2013 and \u20ac 11.5 billion in 2015. In 2016 it was again at \u20ac 14 billion and from 2017 it has been set at \u20ac 14.5 billion annually (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit (BMG), 2020j). Although these funds come from general taxation, these sums are coded as \u201cstatutory health insurance\u201d in health expenditure statistics.* Figure 3.4 shows the main financial flows between the population, purchasers and health care providers in the German health care system in 2018 \u2013 including public health services and long-term care (except the purchasers and providers mentioned in the footnote).\u201d\nSource: Bl\u00fcmel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R.

      "The Cost of Common Surgeries Compared\nUpdated: 13 September 2024\nAustralia\u2019s healthcare system is divided into two distinct sectors. Private and public. With the public system, public patients are covered by Medicare and often do not have many out-of-pocket fees. The downside to Medicare is that they do not cover every procedure. The private system has more freedom in choice and a faster expectation regarding the surgery date. The downside to this system is that it is often expensive and requires a good health insurance policy that will cover all the associated costs that Medicare cannot.\nKey facts\nCompare Health Insurance Quotes\nProtect what\u2019s most important to you.

Please consider the PDS before purchasing any products.\nUnderstanding Surgery Costs in Australia\nSurgeries are classified into three distinct groups. Urgent, elective and cosmetic.\u00a0Understanding each surgery type will assist you in knowing if your health insurance policy covers it.\u00a0Let\u2019s look closely at these surgery types, the difference between each and why they are necessary.\nMedicare and surgery\nMedicare is free health insurance for all Australian residents. Medicare assists in covering most fees at a public hospital and some at a private hospital.\u00a0Medicare\u00a0does not cover the costs of accommodation and theatre at private hospitals. Private health insurance is important because it creates a safety blanket between you and unforeseen costs. Different health insurance policies are tailored to different requirements. Before any procedure, you must speak to your health insurance provider to\u00a0understand the associated coverage and what out-of-pocket costs can be expected.\nPrivate Surgery and Associated Costs\nPrivate health insurance\u00a0covers any costs that Medicare does not. This may include accommodation, theatre and ambulance costs. Private health insurance offers three packages: Hospital, Extras and Combined. Hospital policies cover costs associated with being a private patient in a private hospital. Extras policies cover out-of-hospital costs that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover, as well as ambulance cover for those who live in a state that does not provide ambulance cover. Combined cover is an option that merges both hospital and extras policies. Identifying your personal requirements will assist you in choosing the health insurance policy that meets your needs.\nWhen the costs of your procedure are larger than your policy\u2019s coverage, you will often need to pay for it out-of-pocket or as a copayment. The medical gap scheme assists you in this situation. This is usually a result of specialist fees, bulk billing availability and the services you need. The amount owed is referred to as \u2018the gap\u2019. Most private health insurance providers have policies that include coverage for any gaps that may occur.\u00a0The amount of assistance provided for gap costs varies between health insurance providers.\nAdvantages of private health insurance\nAnalysis of Costs for Top 10 Surgical Procedures\nCataract Surgery\nCataract surgery is a procedure that involves the removal of the eye\u2019s lens and replacing it with an artificial lens.\u00a0The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $2000 in specialist fees and $2400 in hospital fees. Private health insurance will typically cover the full hospital fee, depending on your coverage type.\u00a0\nFor private patients requiring cataract surgery with a glaucoma stent in a private hospital, the average out-of-pocket payment is $490 and $370 for private patients needing general cataract surgery. The average expected costs for uninsured patients can range from $1700 to $2500 per eye. The cost may fluctuate depending on the chosen artificial lens, hospital, and location. Medicare provides cover for this procedure.\u00a0Medicare will pay for 80% of the involved costs, with the patient needing to pay the remaining 20%.\nGastroscopy\nGastroscopy is a procedure that utilises a small and thin flexible tube to examine the upper digestive tract.\u00a0This procedure is used to visualise the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and rule out possible conditions such as peptic ulcers and gastritis. The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $940 for specialist fees and $530 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure receive an average out-of-pocket cost of $140.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $370. This out-of-pocket cost will fluctuate based on your policy. Medicare will pay an average of $420 towards the procedure, with the rest being covered by your private health insurer.\nKnee Replacement\nKnee replacement surgery involves the removal and replacement of diseased, worn-out or damaged knee joint areas.\u00a0The replacement is usually an artificial piece that acts just as a knee joint would and lowers the overall pain a patient may feel while restoring movement to the designated area. The average out-of-pocket cost of this procedure in Australia is around $4,800 for specialist fees and $ 18,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $680.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $3900 but fluctuates based on the chosen policy.\nHeart Angiogram with or without Heart Catheterization\nA heart angiogram is a procedure in which an X-ray is used to view the blood supply to the heart.\u00a0This is to check if the patient has any heart-related issues that need rectifying. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2000 for specialist fees and $ 4,200 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $40.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $490.\nCesarean Section\nA cesarean section, also known as a C-section, is a\u00a0pregnancy-related procedure that allows the baby to be delivered through an incision made on the mother\u2019s abdomen.\u00a0This usually occurs when the healthcare provider believes it is safer for the mother, baby, or both. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 3,500 for specialist fees and $ 7,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $450.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $570.\nCholecystectomy\nA cholecystectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a patient\u2019s gallbladder.\u00a0This surgery is often done to remove gallstones and any complications they may cause. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2,800 for specialist fees and $4,500 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $400.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,200.\nCoronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)\nA coronary artery bypass graft is a surgical procedure that improves oxygen supply and blood flow to the heart.\u00a0\u00a0This surgery is usually done to assist with coronary artery disease, which causes a buildup of plaque in the heart\u2019s arteries. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $15000 for specialist fees and $ 35,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $470.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,600.\nHip Replacement Surgery\nA hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which\u00a0damaged, diseased or worn-out hip joint areas are removed and replaced with an artificial piece.\u00a0The artificial piece works in the same manner that a healthy hip joint would and aims to reduce pain in the patient\u2019s hip area while also increasing the area\u2019s mobility. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 5,000 for specialist fees and $ 20,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $690.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 4,000.\nBreast Biopsy\nA breast biopsy is a procedure in which\u00a0a sample of the breast tissue is removed and tested for abnormal cells.\u00a0This test rules out the possibility of breast cancer or any other condition. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 2,400 for specialist fees and $1,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $500.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 100.\nVentral Hernia Repair\nA ventral hernia repair is a surgical procedure in which the surgeon makes an\u00a0incision into the abdomen above the hernia and pushes any protruding intestines back into the abdomen to repair the muscle wall.\u00a0The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 800 for specialist fees and $3 300 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $380.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 1,000.\nCompare common surgeries\nSource: Medical Costs Finder (October 2023; The prices above are estimates for specialists fees; Please refer to your medical professional for an accurate cost estimation)\nHow Private Health Insurance Can Assist with Surgery Costs\nPrivate health insurance is designed to assist patients with any fees that they may have during the course of the necessary procedure.\u00a0Depending on the coverage type, this may include ambulance, extras, and hospital cover.\nThere may be an instance in which the total cost of the procedure is higher than the coverage provided by both Medicare and your Private Health Insurance Provider. Depending on your chosen provider, the policy\u00a0will often provide assistance in the form of gap cover that partially or completely lowers the final amount that you will have to\u00a0pay out-of-pocket.\u00a0The assistance amount will vary based on the provider and policy that you have chosen.\nHow Medicare Works with Private Health Insurance\nMedicare typically covers 75% of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee for procedures performed in private hospitals, but this doesn\u2019t include hospital accommodation or theater fees.

      "The Cost of Common Surgeries Compared\nUpdated: 13 September 2024\nAustralia\u2019s healthcare system is divided into two distinct sectors. Private and public. With the public system, public patients are covered by Medicare and often do not have many out-of-pocket fees. The downside to Medicare is that they do not cover every procedure. The private system has more freedom in choice and a faster expectation regarding the surgery date. The downside to this system is that it is often expensive and requires a good health insurance policy that will cover all the associated costs that Medicare cannot.\nKey facts\nCompare Health Insurance Quotes\nProtect what\u2019s most important to you.

Urgent, elective and cosmetic.\u00a0Understanding each surgery type will assist you in knowing if your health insurance policy covers it.\u00a0Let\u2019s look closely at these surgery types, the difference between each and why they are necessary.\nMedicare and surgery\nMedicare is free health insurance for all Australian residents. Medicare assists in covering most fees at a public hospital and some at a private hospital.\u00a0Medicare\u00a0does not cover the costs of accommodation and theatre at private hospitals. Private health insurance is important because it creates a safety blanket between you and unforeseen costs. Different health insurance policies are tailored to different requirements. Before any procedure, you must speak to your health insurance provider to\u00a0understand the associated coverage and what out-of-pocket costs can be expected.\nPrivate Surgery and Associated Costs\nPrivate health insurance\u00a0covers any costs that Medicare does not. This may include accommodation, theatre and ambulance costs. Private health insurance offers three packages: Hospital, Extras and Combined. Hospital policies cover costs associated with being a private patient in a private hospital. Extras policies cover out-of-hospital costs that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover, as well as ambulance cover for those who live in a state that does not provide ambulance cover. Combined cover is an option that merges both hospital and extras policies. Identifying your personal requirements will assist you in choosing the health insurance policy that meets your needs.\nWhen the costs of your procedure are larger than your policy\u2019s coverage, you will often need to pay for it out-of-pocket or as a copayment. The medical gap scheme assists you in this situation. This is usually a result of specialist fees, bulk billing availability and the services you need. The amount owed is referred to as \u2018the gap\u2019. Most private health insurance providers have policies that include coverage for any gaps that may occur.\u00a0The amount of assistance provided for gap costs varies between health insurance providers.\nAdvantages of private health insurance\nAnalysis of Costs for Top 10 Surgical Procedures\nCataract Surgery\nCataract surgery is a procedure that involves the removal of the eye\u2019s lens and replacing it with an artificial lens.\u00a0The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $2000 in specialist fees and $2400 in hospital fees. Private health insurance will typically cover the full hospital fee, depending on your coverage type.\u00a0\nFor private patients requiring cataract surgery with a glaucoma stent in a private hospital, the average out-of-pocket payment is $490 and $370 for private patients needing general cataract surgery. The average expected costs for uninsured patients can range from $1700 to $2500 per eye. The cost may fluctuate depending on the chosen artificial lens, hospital, and location. Medicare provides cover for this procedure.\u00a0Medicare will pay for 80% of the involved costs, with the patient needing to pay the remaining 20%.\nGastroscopy\nGastroscopy is a procedure that utilises a small and thin flexible tube to examine the upper digestive tract.\u00a0This procedure is used to visualise the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and rule out possible conditions such as peptic ulcers and gastritis. The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $940 for specialist fees and $530 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure receive an average out-of-pocket cost of $140.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $370. This out-of-pocket cost will fluctuate based on your policy. Medicare will pay an average of $420 towards the procedure, with the rest being covered by your private health insurer.\nKnee Replacement\nKnee replacement surgery involves the removal and replacement of diseased, worn-out or damaged knee joint areas.\u00a0The replacement is usually an artificial piece that acts just as a knee joint would and lowers the overall pain a patient may feel while restoring movement to the designated area. The average out-of-pocket cost of this procedure in Australia is around $4,800 for specialist fees and $ 18,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $680.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $3900 but fluctuates based on the chosen policy.\nHeart Angiogram with or without Heart Catheterization\nA heart angiogram is a procedure in which an X-ray is used to view the blood supply to the heart.\u00a0This is to check if the patient has any heart-related issues that need rectifying. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2000 for specialist fees and $ 4,200 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $40.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $490.\nCesarean Section\nA cesarean section, also known as a C-section, is a\u00a0pregnancy-related procedure that allows the baby to be delivered through an incision made on the mother\u2019s abdomen.\u00a0This usually occurs when the healthcare provider believes it is safer for the mother, baby, or both. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 3,500 for specialist fees and $ 7,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $450.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $570.\nCholecystectomy\nA cholecystectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a patient\u2019s gallbladder.\u00a0This surgery is often done to remove gallstones and any complications they may cause. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2,800 for specialist fees and $4,500 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $400.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,200.\nCoronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)\nA coronary artery bypass graft is a surgical procedure that improves oxygen supply and blood flow to the heart.\u00a0\u00a0This surgery is usually done to assist with coronary artery disease, which causes a buildup of plaque in the heart\u2019s arteries. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $15000 for specialist fees and $ 35,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $470.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,600.\nHip Replacement Surgery\nA hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which\u00a0damaged, diseased or worn-out hip joint areas are removed and replaced with an artificial piece.\u00a0The artificial piece works in the same manner that a healthy hip joint would and aims to reduce pain in the patient\u2019s hip area while also increasing the area\u2019s mobility. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 5,000 for specialist fees and $ 20,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $690.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 4,000.\nBreast Biopsy\nA breast biopsy is a procedure in which\u00a0a sample of the breast tissue is removed and tested for abnormal cells.\u00a0This test rules out the possibility of breast cancer or any other condition. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 2,400 for specialist fees and $1,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $500.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 100.\nVentral Hernia Repair\nA ventral hernia repair is a surgical procedure in which the surgeon makes an\u00a0incision into the abdomen above the hernia and pushes any protruding intestines back into the abdomen to repair the muscle wall.\u00a0The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 800 for specialist fees and $3 300 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $380.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 1,000.\nCompare common surgeries\nSource: Medical Costs Finder (October 2023; The prices above are estimates for specialists fees; Please refer to your medical professional for an accurate cost estimation)\nHow Private Health Insurance Can Assist with Surgery Costs\nPrivate health insurance is designed to assist patients with any fees that they may have during the course of the necessary procedure.\u00a0Depending on the coverage type, this may include ambulance, extras, and hospital cover.\nThere may be an instance in which the total cost of the procedure is higher than the coverage provided by both Medicare and your Private Health Insurance Provider. Depending on your chosen provider, the policy\u00a0will often provide assistance in the form of gap cover that partially or completely lowers the final amount that you will have to\u00a0pay out-of-pocket.\u00a0The assistance amount will vary based on the provider and policy that you have chosen.\nHow Medicare Works with Private Health Insurance\nMedicare typically covers 75% of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee for procedures performed in private hospitals, but this doesn\u2019t include hospital accommodation or theater fees.

Costs for all wound types were determined.\nConclusion The cost of treating wounds in Australia was determined and is anticipated to inform a review of equitable reimbursement of wound treatment costs for Australians with wounds.\nIntroduction\nChronic wounds, or wounds that have failed to heal, are a serious public health issue1,2. In Australia, the economic burden arising from chronic wounds was estimated to be around A$3 billion annually based on 2003\u20132004 and 2010\u20132011 datasets3,4. It is estimated that some 450,000 Australians live with a chronic wound4 which impacts on their explicit and implicit costs and their quality of life and wellbeing1,2,4. Furthermore, the management of acute and chronic wounds presents a significant workload and fiscal burden for Australian hospitals, primary healthcare settings, residential aged care facilities (RACFs) and community health services1\u20135. Yet actual data, which is important for planning, budgeting and resourcing purposes, and which informs national benchmarking and activity-based funding6, is limited across all Australian health sectors. More importantly, there is inequitable access to evidence-based wound management services and contemporary treatment consumables for all Australians1,2,4.\nIn response to these challenges the Australian Health Research Alliance (AHRA), which is comprised of 10 National Health and Medical Research Centre-accredited research translation centres across Australia developed and implemented a National Wounds Initiative which comprised four projects:\nCollectively, these four projects aimed to promote a nationally consistent and effective approach to wound care. The initiative was co-led for the AHRA by the Western Australian Health Translation Network (WAHTN) and Health Translation Queensland (HTQ).\nIn developing this National Wounds Initiative, an extensive literature review was undertaken which considered the recommendations and outcomes produced in some key literature such as: the Australian Centre for Health Services Innovation\u2019s Chronic wounds in Australia: an issues paper1; Pacella et\u00a0al\u2019s Solutions to the chronic wounds problems in Australia: a call to action2; the Australian Government\u2019s 2019 Wounds management pilot grant opportunity7; and the Medicare Benefits Schedule Review Taskforce\u2019s Wound Management Working Group Taskforce findings8. In addition, the AHRA hosted a workshop in Brisbane, Queensland which brought together 32 clinical experts, researchers and representatives from the AHRA and Wounds Australia to determine the wound-related research priorities and strategies.\nThis paper reports on the methodology and outcomes for Project\u00a01: Determining the actual cost of wound care, which aimed to determine the number and type of wounds and their treatment costs (consumables and labour) in Australian hospitals, RACFs, general practices (GPs) and community providers, and to provide evidence to inform reimbursement of wound treatment costs for all Australians. This would do much to ensure access to best practice treatments and a consistent standard of wound care for all Australians. This project was initiated and led by WAHTN in partnership with HTQ and in collaboration with the Silver Chain Group Inc (Silverchain), a large Australian community care provider.\nMethodology\nExpressions of interest to participate were sought from the Western Australian (WA) and Queensland (QLD) Health Departments, public hospitals and RACF administrators and GP directors. Unfortunately, the COVID pandemic and associated staffing and access restrictions limited the number of participating facilities and areas. However, two tertiary hospitals (one in WA with 600 beds and the other in QLD with 1,308 beds), one secondary care hospital in WA (290 beds), three WA RACFs (207 beds) and four GPs (two in WA and two in QLD) participated. Approval to conduct the study was obtained from the relevant Human Research Ethics Committees and site-specific Governance Committees.\nData recorded in Silver Chain Group\u2019s (community care provider hereafter) electronic wound module at the point-of-care in 2020/2021 were analysed. They comprised 21,189 clients with 49,234 wounds treated by nurses from this community care provider in WA, QLD and South Australia (SA). The scope included all wounds treated during 2020/2021 irrespective of whether they were healed or discharged unhealed during the year or had ongoing care beyond 2020/2021. A total of 445,400 client visits for wound treatments were recorded. For each of these visits, the following details were collected: the date, the visit duration, the category and type of wound/s treated, and consumables used excluding Goods and Services Tax. The contemporary wound treatment consumables used (dressing packs, solutions, dressings, devices, instruments, bandages/wraps) were provided at no cost to clients by the community care provider.\nEmbedded in the electronic wound module was the cost of these wound consumables, which were automatically allocated to each electronic care plan for each wound treatment performed. These records were linked with details about the attending nurse time spent undertaking each procedure, and labour costs were calculated using the actual direct time taken to perform the wound treatments by each attending community nurse and multiplied by their pay rates. Other indirect costs such as travel and organisational overheads were excluded, as these would have differed across the various health settings.\nIf client visits involved the treatment of multiple wounds, the cost of consumables was ascertained from each care plan for each wound. The labour cost for treating multiple wounds on the same client at the same visit was estimated based on the mean and median time taken to treat the collective different wound types. Since every wound treated had a unique identifier in the wound module database, all the costs of managing a wound across numerous client visits was consolidated into a single total cost to manage each wound treated during 2020/2021.\nAll of the wounds recorded in the wound module were catalogued into wound categories and wound types, the latter being subdivisions of each of the former. The wound categories were acute wounds, amputations, foot ulcers, leg ulcers, pressure injuries, skin tears and tumours and other wounds (primarily open dermatological wounds or abrasions). Although skin tears are in effect acute wounds, they were categorised separately, because skin tears comprised a large cohort of wounds in the community provider\u2019s data for elderly clients9.\nThe client outcomes identified in this same dataset, and reported separately, demonstrated 80% of wounds healed or were discharged to self-care (virtually healed and usually required the client to remove the final protective dressing), during the study period9.\nThe cost to treat the hospital, GP and RACF wounds was estimated by using the mean and median costs for the same wound type as identified in the community care provider 2020/2021 dataset. The rationale for this modelling was that it standardised the cost of wounds to treat across the cohorts and it took into account that many hospital patients are discharged prior to complete wound healing. Therefore, the cost for each study wound type was estimated based on the mean and median costs to treat different wound types in the community care provider\u2019s dataset 2020/2021 for 21,189 clients with 49,234 wounds. The assumption was that the same wound type across the four cohorts would have had similar treatments and all healthcare providers (primarily nurses) would have taken similar times to perform the treatments, and would have used similar consumables (dressing packs, instruments, solutions, dressings, devices, bandages/wraps).\nIn order to determine if this modelling was reasonable, a review of wound costing methods literature was conducted using Medline and Onesearch, with three relevant articles identified10\u201312. The project methodological design and data collection methods were reviewed in light of the literature to confirm that:\nData was then collected during the surveys conducted in WA hospitals, GPs and RACFs on electronic tablets using Qualtrics\u00ae software between 14 December 2020 and 20 August 2021. In Queensland, survey data was collected between 19 May 2021 and 15 October 2021 using hospital survey software or Qualtrics\u00ae for GPs. A 1-day representative survey sample of data for 30 June 2021 was obtained from the community care provider.\nThe following protocol was adopted to carry out the wound surveys in the hospitals and RACFs:\nAs the number of patients who visited a GP with a wound on a daily basis was considered to be low, the following process was adopted to facilitate data collection in the GPs:\nA representative sample of 1 day of community clients who had wound care on 30 June 2021 was obtained from the community care provider and underwent the same costing analysis as the other three cohorts. All statistical analysis was conducted using R (version 4.2.1) with descriptive statistics reported as counts or proportions of the total cohort. Chi-squared tests of proportion were used to determine differences between gender proportions between settings.\nResults\nThe characteristics of each individual and each wound recorded in the respective surveys across each of the four cohorts are summarised in Table\u00a01. Overall, there were 2,505 patients/residents/clients with 3,096 wounds. The relatively low numbers of hospital patients with wounds was influenced by COVID\u201119 access restrictions in some hospital areas. In addition, written consent was required for hospital patients; a large proportion of these were either too ill or cognitively unable to provide written consent, whilst some declined.\nThe four cohorts differed in both demographics such as age and also in wound categories and type of wounds. The median age of individuals in the hospitals, RACFs, GPs and community provider cohorts was 64\u00a0years, 82\u00a0years, 67\u00a0years and 69.5\u00a0years respectively. However, it is to be noted that no paediatric hospital was surveyed. As expected, the RACFs generally cared for older patients as compared to hospitals and GPs. There was an observed difference in the percentage of males between cohorts (\u03c72(3)=18.8, p=0.0003). The GPs treated more females with wounds than males (\u03c72(1)=4.20, 95% CI [0.33, 0.50], p=0.040) and the community care provider treated more males with wounds than females (\u03c72(1)=30.3, 95% CI [0.55, 0.60], p<0.0001).\n\u00a0\n\n\n* Includes some patients/residents/clients treated for multiple wounds\n\u00a0\nOverall, acute wounds were the most common (34.01%), followed by leg ulcers (17.70%), \u2018other wounds\u2019 (13.27%), foot ulcers (11.92%), pressure injuries (9.95%), skin tears (8.14%), and tumours (2.94%). In the hospital cohort, there were 816 patients with 748 wounds, mostly acute wounds (56.82%, including amputations) due to surgical or traumatic aetiologies. The RACF cohort treated 205 residents with 99 wounds, mostly \u2018other wounds\u2019 (34.34%), skin tears (28.28%) and pressure injuries (8.8%). The GP cohort treated 137 patients with 181 wounds, mostly acute wounds (49.72%), leg ulcers (21.55%) and skin tears (11.05%). The community care provider treated 1,347 clients with 2,068 wounds, mostly acute wounds (28.85%, including amputations), leg ulcers (23.74%) and foot ulcers (16.73%).\nEstimates using both the mean and the median costs associated with treating wounds in all four cohorts are shown in Table\u00a02. The distribution of costs was heavily right skewed. While the median is more robust against outliers than the mean, the mean better reflects the real costs expended in clinical practice. There were a significant number of \u2018other wound\u2019 types whose costs could not be estimated because insufficient numbers of these wound types were recorded in the community care provider dataset. Also, some \u2018other wound\u2019 types such as incontinence-associated dermatitis that were identified in the hospital and RACF cohorts were not specifically recorded in the community care provider dataset. Different categorisation schema may also have contributed to low numbers of certain wound types. The wound categories that conveyed the costliest burdens were acute wounds followed by leg ulcers and pressure injuries.\nTable\u00a02 summarises the estimated costs of wounds in the four cohorts, including the standard error (SE) in each estimate. Estimates\u00a0A and B indicate the estimated costs of wound treatment for each wound type based on the mean or median costs, respectively, as extrapolated from the community care provider\u2019s costs in 2020/2021. For example, Estimate\u00a0A for the consumables cost for treating the 95 abscesses observed during this survey was A$16,841\u00b1804, calculated by multiplying 95 by the mean cost of consumables incurred by the community care provider in treating abscesses in 2020/2021. Estimate\u00a0B of the labour cost for the same 95 abscesses was A$17,773\u00b1820, calculated by multiplying 95 by the median cost. Lastly, estimates of the total treatment cost are the sum of the consumables and labour costs.\n\u00a0\nTable 2. Consumables and direct labour costs for wounds across the four cohorts* as estimated using the mean (Estimate A) or median (Estimate B) costs identified in the community provider\u2019s dataset for 2020/2021\n\n\n\n* Four care settings combined: residential aged care, hospital, general practice, and community. Excluded any indirect costs such as organisational overheads, management, administration, travel, systems, training that were additional to direct client contact, and business overheads such as rent, utilities, insurances, vehicles, maintenance and repairs. Consumable costs excluded the goods and services tax.\n\u2020 These wounds were excluded from cost analysis since there were no comparator wounds in the community care provider dataset.\n\u00a0\nDiscussion\nEvaluation of the data collection methods across each site and cost modelling, which was conducted using a modified bottom-up costing method based on the Independent Hospital and Aged Care Pricing Authority (IHACPA) methodology, proved robust15. The results provided valuable insight into the number and type of wounds across a sample of Australian hospitals, RACFs, GPs and a community care provider. Although it was anticipated that hospitals would have a higher number of acute wounds, it was noteworthy that acute wounds also comprised the greater number of wounds managed by GPs and the community care provider. Similar findings were found in a community cross-sectional study conducted in North America16, as well as in a cross-sectional study conducted amongst 18 GPs in Queensland in 2011, which demonstrated 81.5% of the wounds resulted from surgery or trauma17.\nSkin tears, which are common wounds found amongst the elderly, comprised 28.28% of the RACF wounds18,19. They also comprised 12.97% of hospital wounds which was slightly more than the WoundsWest findings obtained from surveys which were conducted across all 86 public hospitals in WA in 2008, 2009, 2011, and which found skin tears to be 11%, 9% and 9.6% respectively20,21. Pressure injuries on the other hand were found to range from 4% in GPs, 9% in RACFs and hospitals, and 10% in the community cohort. Nghiem et\u00a0al22 reported 12.9% of pressure injuries cost Australian public hospitals A$9.11\u00a0billion (95% confidence intervals (CI): 9.02, 9.21) in 2020 and treatment costs attributed to A$3.59\u00a0billion (CI: 3.57, 3.60) of these costs. Whilst there appears to be a dearth of data concerning pressure injuries managed by GPs, Wilson et\u00a0al23 reported projected costs of A$98,489 to care for 20 residents with 23 pressure injuries. However, these modelled costs included wound treatments, pressure off-loading devices, nutritional supplements and labour, whereas the median cost (consumables and labour) to treat pressure injuries in a community cohort in 2020/2021 was A$150.56 (interquartile range: A$71.85\u2013391.12)9. Pressure injuries are costly, and they are considered to be largely preventable wounds; the implementation of preventative strategies is therefore a fundamental tenet of the Australian Commission for Safety and Quality in Health Care Standards24.\nThe Australian Medical Association25 reported challenges in gauging the extent of GP and community wound care costs, although a study in the UK found 81% of total wound care costs to the National Health Scheme were incurred in the community sector26. Access to rigorous data from diverse community healthcare providers in Australia is complicated by the number and variety of community healthcare providers and the potential for duplication of services. An Australian study conducted in Queensland found patients with leg ulcers reported a median of three (range two to seven) healthcare provider organisations involved in their care27. Fortunately, the community care provider whose data was used to determine costs in this study has an enviable and rigorous electronic system for recording wound data at point of care and a commitment to monitoring data entry9.\nAdherence to the principle that wound care should be provided at the lowest appropriate cost without compromising best practice28 is challenged by inequitable access to contemporary wound consumables across Australia1,2. Furthermore, some researchers have employed a top-down costing model using hospital estimated costs4, or in other settings modelled costs for inclusion of adjuvant therapies such as nutritional supplements or pressure off-loading devices5. Although the IHACPA approach uses a bottom-up model for costing direct labour time and therapeutic goods specific to the patient and the diagnosis, they also include additional cost buckets for recurrent costs such as hotel costs, procedure and imaging costs, staff salaries with on-costs and depreciation15.\nHowever, the researchers involved in this study chose to report only actual costs for treatment consumables and direct labour costs to perform the wound treatments in order to provide a more transparent insight into the direct costs of wound care. It was acknowledged that many other costs associated with the delivery of care are covered within alternative funding arrangements of the treating organisation. Nor did the researchers explore additional costs that may have been placed on patients/residents/clients, although these additional costs should be investigated by subsequent research.\nAs outlined, a strength of this study was the use of actual costs made possible by the fact that contemporary treatment consumables were provided at no cost to the community care provider\u2019s clients, and it was these data that were used to model the costs of wound treatments across the four study cohorts. However, treatment costs varied significantly between and within the study wound types due to the variations between the estimates for each wound type (Table\u00a02). This variation emphasises that a standardised average reimbursement price for wound care across all wound types is not feasible. However, determining the cost of reimbursement other than for labour and consumables for each wound type was outside the scope of this study.\nThe wound types associated with highest estimated costs in this study were suture lines, open incisional wounds and venous leg ulcers. The findings for incisional wounds were similar to a review of 2014 data from US Medicare beneficiaries which found surgical wounds and infections were the costliest items, noting that the highest costs were incurred in outpatient settings29. In an earlier study, Fife et\u00a0al30 reported a mean cost to heal per wound of US$3,927, and also noted wide variation in costs for complex wounds such as flaps or grafts which had a mean cost to heal of US$9,358. Guest et\u00a0al31 examined a sample of 2,000 patients which comprised 40% acute wounds, 48% chronic wounds and 12% an unknown diagnosis in the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS) and calculated costs of \u00a3698\u20133,998 for healed wounds, and \u00a31,719\u20135,976 for unhealed wounds. The wide variations in costs were again similar to those found in this study.\nPhillips et\u00a0al32 reported that leg and foot ulcers, pressure injuries and postoperative wounds accounted for most of the wound care costs in GP in Wales in 2012/2013, with average costs of \u00a31,727 per patients (for up to 6\u00a0months follow-up). Costs were associated with GP visits, district nurse home visits, outpatient and inpatient care32. Potentially some of these associated costs would have been covered by other NHS funding arrangements, and conglomerate healthcare costs make for difficult comparisons of actual wound treatment costs (consumables and labour). Furthermore, they can negatively influence the argument for national reimbursement of wound consumables.\nNotwithstanding, it is difficult to compare costs across studies as there is inconsistency in methods of cost evaluation, that is discrepancies in use of direct and indirect costs, duration of data collection and outcomes measured. Romanelli et\u00a0al33 reported standard care direct costs were US$2,540 for venous leg ulcers during an 8-week trial in an outpatient setting. While Urwin et\u00a0al34 reported an average 2-week cost per person of \u00a3166.39 (95% CI: 157.78\u2013175.00), with an estimated annual cost per person of \u00a34,585.70 using data from a survey of nine UK NHS community health services in 2015/2016. More recently, venous leg ulcers were demonstrated to be a common wound in an Australian community cohort, with a median cost to treat (consumables and direct labour) of A$495 (range A$198\u20131,162)9.\nConsidering venous leg ulcers are estimated to affect over 300,000 mainly older Australians, and with anticipated increases in the ageing population35 and reports of lengthy healing times and recurrence rates of up to 78%35,36, it would appear feasible and prove cost-effective to fund preventive treatments. Compression therapy in the form of bandages, hosiery or wraps is considered the \u2018gold\u2019 standard treatment for venous leg ulcers34\u201336. However, there is currently no Australian reimbursement scheme for dressings or compression therapies for all Australians. Cheng et\u00a0al35 determined reimbursement of compression therapy for the treatment of venous leg ulcers would cost the Australian health system an additional A$270 million over 5\u00a0years, which they proposed would be substantially offset by anticipated A$1.4 billion in cost savings.\nIn accordance with the results from this study, the researchers debated three options for an Australian Health System reimbursement of wound treatment (product, labour) services and products:\nThe researchers would recommend the last option as it is considered to be more feasible for ensuring equitable access to wound care services and products for all Australians.\nAs previously highlighted, a strength of this study was the use of data for actual wound treatment consumables and direct labour costs for performing the wound dressing procedures. The fact that the consumables were supplied at no charge to clients with wounds recorded in the community care provider dataset, and these data were used to model the costs across the four cohorts, allowed for standardised comparisons.\nA limitation relates to the fact that the community care provider has the capacity to bulk purchase consumables yet these associated cost benefits may not be available to smaller providers. Furthermore, these costs reflect 2020/2021 costs for labour and consumables, and variations in exchange rates and procurement may lead to associated cost increases over time. The community provider labour costs were determined based on nurse salary levels; it could be assumed that health professionals other than nurses may perform the wound dressing procedures in other health settings and therefore this may lead to associated cost differences. Additional limitations were access restrictions associated with the management of the COVID\u201119 pandemic which limited the capacity to survey all wards in the tertiary hospitals and conduct surveys in more health settings, particularly regional hospitals, remote communities and a more diverse range of GPs across all Australian states and territories.\nConclusion\nThis study sought to determine the number and type of wounds and their treatment costs (consumables and labour) in a sample of Australian hospitals, RACFs, GPs and community care providers and provide evidence to inform reimbursement of wound treatment costs for all Australians. Ultimately, every Australian with a wound should expect the same standard of care regardless of their geographic location, type of wound and healthcare provider. The researchers are strongly convinced that best practice wound prevention and management would lead to optimal healing outcomes if services and practitioners who adhere to this thesis and implemented national standards were reimbursed the mean cost of wound treatments and, if not covered by other funding arrangements, the mean cost of direct labour for performing the treatment procedures.\nAcknowledgements\nThe researchers gratefully acknowledge the support of the administrators and staff of Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Armadale Hospital, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Third Avenue Surgery, Illawarra Medical Centre, Salisbury Medical Centre, Inala Primary Care, Hall and Prior Aged Care Homes (Belmont, Leighton and Karingal Green), School of Nursing QUT, Silver Chain Group Inc., The University of Western Australia, Queensland University of Technology, Curtin University, University of Notre Dame Australia and all of the surveyors.\nAuthor contribution\nJo Wilkie was involved in the conception, design, acquisition, analysis and interpretation of the data, as well as final approval of the version of the paper to be published.

Some commentators point to widespread supply bottlenecks and adverse geo-political events that caused significant disruption to the production and availability of manufactured goods. Others argue that significant shifts in aggregate demand for manufactured goods were the leading factors underlying these observed price fluctuations, and cite shifts in consumer preferences, unprecedented discretionary fiscal policy, and a change in the monetary policy stance following the pandemic.\nIn this note, we provide new evidence to the debate of how much of the recent run-up and retreat of producer price inflation is driven by supply versus demand factors, which is part of an ongoing area of research that has seen recent contributions by e.g. Shapiro (2022), Benigno and Eggertsson (2023), Kabaca and Tuzcuoglu (2023), Bai, Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde, Li and Zanetti (2024) among others. Quantifying the relative effects of supply and demand shocks is critical to understanding movements in inflation and, thus, to informing appropriate policy responses to changes in inflation.\nFigure 1 (top panel) shows the year-on-year (YoY) inflation rate based on the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) of manufactured goods published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. After a brief decline during the height of the pandemic, prices climbed rapidly in subsequent months, reaching rates above 18%, the highest recorded values since the start of the index in 1987. Then, in 2023, manufacturing producer prices suddenly levelled off, with a rapid decline in the rate of inflation to levels near zero.\nHow much of these fluctuations can be attributed to supply and demand factors? Answering this question has proved very difficult not only because of the complexity of the post-pandemic period, but also because many of the observed outcomes could be consistent with either changes in supply or demand conditions. For new evidence on this topic, we leverage data from the Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity (QPC), a U.S. Census Bureau data product primarily designed to gauge capacity and utilization rates in the manufacturing sector.\nThe survey asks establishments to report their full production capabilities (capacity) as well as their operating rate, with plants operating at less than full capacity further asked to identify the reasons. As shown in Figure 1 (bottom left), in normal times the vast majority of establishments cite lack of demand (or, \"insufficient orders\") as the reason for operating at less than capacity. During the pandemic, this share dropped notably, with the fraction of plants citing \"insufficient orders\" reaching an all-time low of just 48.3% in the first quarter of 2022. On the other hand, Figure 1 (bottom right) also shows a spike of manufacturing establishments citing \"insufficient supply of materials\" during the pandemic, with this fraction reaching an all-time high of 42.7% of firms in the fourth quarter of 2021. Both of these spikes in establishment responses have since largely, though not completely, unwound to more typical levels. Taken together, the evidence from the QPC suggests both supply and demand as being important drivers of producer prices over the last few years.\nThe QPC is a useful resource for gauging demand and supply conditions together in one survey. Moreover, the QPC measure of supply bottlenecks is ideal in that it captures the extent to which a firm is constrained from producing a desired quantity. However, the published QPC data only report the share of respondents citing a certain explanation, which has drawbacks in quantifying structural supply and demand factors underlying the manufacturing PPI. Furthermore, even if used as direct explanatory variables for PPI inflation, their high mutual correlation would make it difficult to disentangle their individual contributions.\nNote: Shaded areas indicate periods of recessions as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research where appropriate: March 2001\u2013November 2001, December 2007\u2013June 2009 and February 2020\u2013April 2020.\nSources: Top panel: Bureau of Labor Statistics. Bottom panel: U.S. Census Bureau Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity (Disclosure Review Board (DRB) approval number: CBDRB\u2011FY23\u20110231).\nAccessible version\nIn this FEDS note, we argue for an approach that combines insights from the QPC survey data with bivariate industry-level structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models for industrial production (quantities) and producer prices. These are simple models designed to disentangle producer price fluctuations into supply and demand factors. We then relate these models to industry-level estimates of demand and supply constraints from the QPC survey data to obtain sharper identification. After decomposing changes in PPI into supply and demand factors at a granular level, we then aggregate to obtain a decomposition for the entire manufacturing sector.\nFor our exercise, we collect data at the 3-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) level for industrial production (IP) and producer price indexes, and match those with shares of establishments reporting either insufficient materials or insufficient demand in the QPC data. After extending PPI indexes back in time, the result is monthly data on IP and PPI from 1978 to December 2023, for a total of 18 industries1, and quarterly QPC survey data going back to 2008.\nIn the following, we denote by $$ q_{it} $$ and $$ p_{it} $$ the monthly percentage changes in industry i's industrial production and producer price index, respectively. We consider bivariate industry-level structural VAR (SVAR) models of the form:\n$$$$ q_{it} = \\alpha_i p_{it} + c_{1i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\alpha_{ij}^{qq} q_{i,t-j} + \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\alpha_{ij}^{qp} p_{i,t-j} + \\epsilon_{it}^s , \\\\ $$$$\n$$$$ q_{it} = \\beta_i p_{it} + c_{2i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\alpha_{ij}^{pq} q_{i,t-j} + \\sum_{j=1}^{12} \\alpha_{ij}^{pp} p_{i,t-j} + \\epsilon_{it}^d , $$$$\nwhere the first equation is the supply equation perturbed by supply shocks $$ \\epsilon_{it}^s $$, with $$ \\alpha_i $$ measuring industry i's short-run price elasticity of supply. The second equation represents the demand equation, where $$ \\epsilon_{it}^d $$ are demand shocks and $$ \\beta_i $$ measures the short-run price elasticity of demand. The rest of the coefficients are meant to capture the joint-dynamics of IP and PPI around their average growth rate.\nWithout further assumptions, the bivariate system of equations is not identified, yielding many constellations of $$ \\alpha_i $$ and $$ \\beta_i $$ equally consistent with the data (for a discussion, see e.g., Kilian and L\u00fctkepohl (2017)). To achieve identification, we impose a series of identifying constraints. First, we assume conventional sign restrictions on the short run price elasticities. This includes that the supply curve is upward sloping ($$ \\alpha_i > 0 $$ ), while the demand curve is downward sloping ($$ \\beta_i < 0 $$ ). Second, we postulate that quarterly averages of structural supply and demand shocks should be highly correlated with the change in the QPC survey measure for establishments citing insufficient materials and insufficient demand, respectively.2 Once the model is identified, it is possible to decompose industry i's PPI growth through the lenses of the estimated SVARs as:\n$$$$ p_{it} = \\mu_i + p_{it}^d + p_{it}^s $$$$\nwhere $$\\mu_i $$ is the average growth rate of industry i's PPI index, the term $$p_{it}^s $$ is the variation that can be accounted for by supply shocks, and the term $$ p_{it}^d $$ is the variation driven by demand shocks. Finally, an approximate decomposition of the aggregate PPI's monthly percentage increase $$ p_t $$ is then given by:\n$$$$ p_{t} = \\underbrace{\\sum_i w_{i,t} \\mu_i}_{\\text{deterministic components}} + \\underbrace{\\sum_i w_{i,t} p_{it}^s}_{\\text{supply factors}} + \\underbrace{\\sum_i w_{i,t} p_{it}^d}_{\\text{demand factors}} $$$$\nwhere $$w_{i,t} $$ are industry relative importance weights available from the Federal Reserve Board's Industrial Production G.17 statistical release.3\nThis methodology is related to the recent work by Shapiro (2022), which disentangles the supply and demand factors driving the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index by leveraging joint fluctuations in quantity and price data of individual PCE goods and services categories. For each month, a category's PCE growth rate is allocated to either the supply or demand component based on sign restrictions equivalent to what we use in our industry level SVARs. We refine this approach by sharpening the identification strategy, i.e. leveraging the additional survey data that is unique to the manufacturing sector. In addition, our approach allows us to decompose each industry's monthly variation into a mix of both demand and supply factors, and historical realizations thereof, instead of only estimating their net effect, as in Shapiro (2022).\nBefore discussing the results of our decomposition, we first conduct an exercise to test the ex-post validity of our methodology. Following Shapiro (2022), we study the dynamic response of the estimated PPI demand and supply factors to well-understood macroeconomic shocks. Specifically, we estimate empirical impulse response functions (IRF) to a monetary policy shock as in Bauer and Swanson (2023), and oil supply shocks as in Kanzig (2021).4 For a credible decomposition, only the demand component of the PPI should respond to a monetary policy shock, and only the supply component to an oil supply shock.\nFigure 2 shows estimates of these IRFs to a monetary policy shock, normalized to increase the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points (top panel), and an oil supply shock normalized to increase the real oil price by 10% (bottom panel). The solid lines show the dynamics of producer prices in percentage deviations from trend, with dashed and dotted lines indicating estimation uncertainty at the 68% confidence interval coming from two econometric procedures.5 As we expect, the demand-driven level of producer prices is estimated to decrease in response to a 25bp tightening in monetary policy, peaking at about -0.5 percent after 18 months. On the other hand, the dynamic effect on the supply factor remains small and is statistically insignificant. Similarly, in the IRFs to a cost-pushing oil supply shock normalized to increase oil prices by 10%, we find strong reactions in supply driven factors, which peak rapidly at around 0.7 percent after 8 months. The demand component is estimated to decrease slightly but remains insignificant.\nThese IRF results validate that the supply and demand shocks we identify act as intended in disentangling the supply and demand driven fluctuations in the producer price index of manufactured goods.6 Next, we show the role these supply and demand factors have played in the evolution of the manufacturing PPI since 2007.\nNote: The solid lines show the dynamics of producer prices in percentage deviations from trend, with dashed and dotted lines indicating estimation uncertainty at the 68% confidence interval. The dashed line corresponds to confidence intervals computed by the block bootstrap of Jentsch and Lunsford (2022), while the dotted line corresponds to weak-identification robust confidence set by Montiel Olea, Stock and Watson (2021).\nAccessible version\nFigure 3 plots the estimated decomposition of the year-on-year PPI inflation rate (black line), adjusted for the deterministic terms. The beige bars capture the fluctuations that are attributed to supply shocks, while the red bars capture demand factors. The gray shaded areas correspond to recessions as reported by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\nNote: Shaded areas indicate periods of recessions as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research: December 2007\u2013June 2009 and February 2020\u2013April 2020.\nAccessible version\nWe focus our discussion of this decomposition on the period of the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) as well as the COVID and post-Covid inflation surge more recently.\nGreat Financial Crisis\nThe increase in prices at the onset of the Great Financial Crisis has been well documented. Hamilton (2009) discusses in detail the demand and supply factors leading to the oil price shock in 2007-2008 which contributed significantly to the increase in goods prices. Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas (2008) highlight the surge in commodity (in particular oil) prices during the early part of the GFC. The Caballero et al. (2008) model alongside the evidence put forward by Christiano, Eichenbaum, Trabandt (2015) and Gilchrist, Schoenle, Sim, Zakrajsek (2017), argues that the main reason for the commodity price volatility and other \"missing disinflation/deflation\" during this time was ultimately due to the scarce supply of liquid financial assets.\nOur decomposition for the Great Financial Crisis suggests that the sharp increase in producer prices was predominantly due to supply factors. This result lends support to research emphasizing the cost pressures on U.S. producers emanating from higher global commodity prices and reduced availability of credit in the initial phase of the crisis. In the second phase, after the severe disruption to financial markets and sharp decline in aggregate activity triggered by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the decomposition intuitively shows that the resulting changes in prices are driven mostly by demand factors.\nCovid and its aftermath\nThe decomposition in Figure 3 also shows features of the Covid period that are both intuitive and revealing. The change in PPIs during the first few months of the pandemic is skewed to changes in demand factors, which aligns with the experience of extensive shutdowns during this period. In subsequent months (from mid-2020 into 2021), however, supply factors quickly moved from being a drag on prices to being a driver of price increases. Indeed, significant jumps in supply factors occur around February 2021, aligning with the so-called Texas Freeze that had dramatic effects on the petrochemical and downstream industries. It was also during this time that semiconductor shortages began to impact prices and delivery times of many manufactured goods including automobiles, computers, household appliances and other consumer electronics.\nNoticeable changes in the demand contributions lag those of supply, with a switch from a drag on prices to supporting price increases in the first half of 2021. Supply contributions to price increases peak in the latter half of 2021, while demand contributions peak in early 2022, very soon (maybe a quarter or two) after U.S. monetary policy tightens.\nMore recently, both supply and demand have moved into negative territory in 2023, with once again supply moving more suddenly and somewhat in advance of the demand contributions. In the last data point, in December 2023, supply factors remain the main drag on goods prices, although in the last five months demand is beginning to exert significant downward pressure as well.\nCombining novel survey evidence with a structural VAR model of quantities and prices, we decompose the role of supply and demand factors in U.S. manufacturing producer price inflation from 2007 to 2023. Such a decomposition is particularly useful in recent years encompassing the post-COVID inflation surge, as policymakers and market participants debate the relative impacts of monetary policy versus supply chain normalization in the rapid disinflationary period observed in 2022 and 2023. Over the last several years, our evidence points to a significant role for supply factors in the run-up and retreat of goods prices, with demand factors contributing to that contour, but with a lag. Looking ahead, this decomposition will further our understanding of the forces behind future inflation developments, while also serving to inspire other ways in which survey evidence can be combined with more traditional tools for identifying the mechanisms underlying economic outcomes.\nBai, Xiwen, Jesus Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde, Yiliang Li and Francesco Zanetti (2024). \"DP18785 The Causal Effects of Global Supply Chain Disruptions on Macroeconomic Outcomes: Evidence and Theory\".

These sample correlations are computed over the period 2008-2023 for which quarterly QPC data is available.

It should take 8 minutes for the ambulance to arrive if the call is life threatening or an emergency. Ambulance services often send more than one vehicle to try to meet the 8 minute target.\nWhy are ambulance response times so long?\nPlus, despite the increased workforce, ambulance crews have less capacity, as ambulances now have to wait longer with patients outside hospitals. According to one Health Foundation report, more than 10% of ambulances had to wait for over an hour outside hospitals in July 2022.\nWhat is the average EMS response time in Chicago?\nThe state standard is six minutes.

Ambulance services collaborate with various other service-types, e.g. hospitals, general practices, mental healthcare institutions, fire brigades, and police departments.\nWhat is the emergency waiting time in the UK?\nTime spent by patients in A&E For patients who required admission to hospital, the median A&E waiting time remained below four hours until September 2019. In December 2019, the median wait increased to a high of 5 hours 21 minutes.\nWhy do paramedics walk so slow?\nNever move faster than your ability to make good decisions Running to a patient prevents us from spotting hazards on the way in. Remember, we're walking into an unknown. We must carefully observe and assess for danger.\nWhat percentage of ambulance calls are life threatening?\nIn 2021/22 a higher proportion of incidents were life-threatening (category 1, 12%) or emergency (category 2, 66%) compared with 2018/19 (9% and 60%, respectively). These life-threatening and emergency incidents require more resources than categories 3 and 4.\nWhat is priority 3 patient?\nPriority 3 (Green) \"Walking-wounded\" Victims who are not seriously injured, are quickly triaged and tagged as \"walking wounded\", and a priority 3 or \"green\" classification (meaning delayed treatment/transportation).\nHow long should an ambulance take for a stroke?\nThe target response time for a category 2 call (which includes heart attacks and strokes) is 18 minutes.\n",
      "Mayors blast 'terrible' rural ambulance response times\nAuditor general report shows poor rural response times masked by urban data\nSocial Sharing\nMayors and community leaders in small\u2013town New Brunswick say they weren't surprised at all by this week's scathing report by the auditor general about ambulance response times.\nThe audit shows that in many rural and remote communities, Ambulance New Brunswick fails to respond to 90 per cent of calls within its target of 22 minutes.\n\"It's terrible,\" said\u00a0Belledune Mayor Joe Noel. \"It shouldn't be allowed and there's no need for it.\"\nBut those shortfalls are obscured, and don't count against ANB's performance payments, because they're combined with better response times in urban centres for measuring performance--which is allowed under the company's contract.\nBlackville Mayor Chris Hennessy said\u00a0the report is a vindication for him.\n\"They basically bury the rural stats in the urban numbers so they never show the bad with the good,\" he said.\n\"I know people thought I was crazy when I was preaching about this for the last five years \u2026 so I'm glad somebody uncovered that.\"\u00a0\nRural vs. urban response\nThe aggregation of the numbers allows Medavie Health Services New Brunswick, which operates the ambulance service, to collect $650,000 a year for hitting the broader 90-percent target in four large zones that include cities and towns.\u00a0\n\"They're meeting them on the backs of the rural areas,\" Noel said.\n\"That's exactly what happens here. When an ambulance goes out in Campbellton or Bathurst, they take the ambulance from Belledune and send it to Bathurst or Campbellton to sit there, whether it gets a call or not...\n\"That's where the calls are and that's why they're doing it: because it makes their numbers look good.\"\u00a0\nHarvey Mayor Winston Gamblin said\u00a0response times in the village are good when the ambulance happens to be at its local station.\u00a0\nBut when it's been shifting elsewhere, paramedics have a hard time reaching some locations within 22 minutes.\n\"We feel that if you live in a rural area, you have to take second best, and that's the way it came out in the report yesterday -- that we're second class citizens and [they say] 'we'll get there when we can,'\" he said.\nAmbulance targets\nUnder Medavie's contract with the province, ambulances must hit response targets 90 per cent of the time for the organization to receive performance payments.\nThe targets are to reach the scene of a call within nine minutes in 16 urban areas and within 22 minutes everywhere else in New Brunswick.\nThe audit found that in 19 out of 67 communities, ANB fell short of the 90 per cent goal.\u00a0\nBut because response times are blended together within four large zones, it \"masked\" the poor numbers in those rural, remote communities, Auditor General Kim Adair-MacPherson said Tuesday.\nHer audit said the system \"has introduced a bias toward achieving high performance in areas of greater population density, to the detriment of rural or remote communities where 911 calls occur less frequently.\"\nRural areas were at a disadvantage because the system is \"reducing the emphasis on improving performance in those areas,\" allowing Medavie \"to focus resources on urban areas while having decreased performance in outlying communities.\"\nIn a statement released Tuesday, Medavie Health Services New Brunswick president Richard Losier agreed the average response time \"varies from community to community.\"\nBut he pointed out what Adair-MacPherson's audit acknowledged: that the contract doesn't rate performance community by community but in four large zones.\n\"MHSNB is always open and willing to work with our government partners to improve the services to the people of New Brunswick,\" he said.\nMedavie mum\nMedavie did not respond to a request Wednesday for an interview with Losier.\nOn Tuesday Health Minister Dorothy Shephard said she was talking to Medavie officials about renegotiating the contract, which was renewed in 2017 for another 10 years.\nNoel said\u00a0rural response times should carry more weight in measuring ambulance performance.\n\"When you're 25 minutes away from a hospital to start with, that's where you need the response times,\" he said.\nBelledune had the lowest number of any community measured by the auditor general: ambulances reached their destination within 22 minutes in only 69 per cent of calls.\nMarc Henrie, the former chair of the Saint-Paul local service district north of Moncton, said\u00a0he was not surprised to see the Fords Mills ambulance station with the second-worst rate in the report.\nAmbulances based there reach calls within 22 minutes in only 70 per cent of cases.\n\"The auditor general just released proof that rural citizens are sadly taken as citizens of a second-class,\" he said.\nHenrie chaired the LSD when Ambulance New Brunswick decided to put its bay in Fords Mills rather than in another location closer to Saint-Paul and Route 126, where he says most people in the area live.\n\"The numbers are not surprising at all,\" he said.\nSometimes ambulances responding to calls in the Saint-Paul area are sent from Salisbury, even though Moncton is closer. Henrie believes it's so ambulances based in Moncton can stay there and respond to calls in and around the city.\u00a0\n\"It's clear that it's not strategic and it's not what's for the well-being in an emergency situation,\" he says.\nGamblin says he's glad to see the auditor general put the spotlight on the problem but worries it will discourage people from moving to smaller communities. \"It's not an advertisement for rural areas,\" he says.\u00a0\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nProvincial Affairs reporter\nJacques Poitras has been CBC's provincial affairs reporter in New Brunswick since 2000.

Dive into the fascinating world of average ambulance response times, where every second counts. From bustling cities boasting 4-minute sprints to remote rural areas clocking in at 30-minute marathons, the numbers paint a vivid picture of lifesaving speed limits. Buckle up for a wild ride through the data, as we explore how time, technology, and even traffic shape the race against the clock for emergency medical care.\nCultural and Regional Factors Affecting Ambulance Response Time\n\nResearch indicates that minority communities often experience longer ambulance response times compared to predominantly white areas.\n\nInterpretation\nThese Average Ambulance Response Time statistics serve as a sobering reminder that time is not colorblind when it comes to emergency services. While ambulances should be racing against the clock, it seems that in some communities, they're also racing against systemic inequalities. It's a troubling diagnosis for our healthcare system, highlighting the urgent need for equitable access to life-saving care, regardless of zip code or skin tone.\nGeographic Variations in Ambulance Response Time\n\nThe average ambulance response time in the United States is 8 minutes and 59 seconds.\nIn urban areas, the average ambulance response time is around 6 minutes.\nRural areas have a significantly higher average ambulance response time, typically ranging from 15 to 30 minutes.\nIn some metropolitan areas, the average ambulance response time can be as low as 4 minutes.\nLess-populated states like Wyoming and Montana have some of the longest average ambulance response times in the US.\nThe average ambulance response time in Canada is 8.4 minutes.\nAmbulance response times tend to be longer during peak traffic hours, with delays averaging around 2-3 minutes.\nStudies show that faster ambulance response times are associated with better patient outcomes, particularly in cases of cardiac arrest.\nThe average ambulance response time in the United Kingdom is 7 minutes and 6 seconds.\nIn Australia, the average ambulance response time ranges from 8 to 10 minutes in most urban areas.\nFactors like weather conditions and road closures can increase ambulance response times by up to 5 minutes.\nThe average ambulance response time for non-urgent calls is typically longer than for emergencies, averaging around 15 minutes.\nThe average ambulance response time in Japan is approximately 6 minutes.\nThe average ambulance response time in Germany is 10 minutes.\nThe average ambulance response time in South Africa is 15 minutes.\nIn Brazil, the average ambulance response time can vary greatly depending on the region, with some areas experiencing delays of up to 30 minutes.\nStudies have shown that the average ambulance response time in Sweden is 7.5 minutes.\nThe average ambulance response time in India is approximately 15 minutes in urban areas and can be significantly longer in rural regions.\nResearch indicates that the average ambulance response time in Mexico City is 12 minutes.\nIn the Netherlands, the average ambulance response time is 10 minutes.\nHigh-altitude regions like the Himalayas experience longer ambulance response times due to challenging terrain and limited infrastructure, with averages exceeding 30 minutes.\nThe average ambulance response time in Israel is 9 minutes.\nStudies have shown that the average ambulance response time in Spain is 8 minutes and 43 seconds.\nIn South Korea, the average ambulance response time is approximately 10 minutes.\nThe average ambulance response time in Norway is 12 minutes.\nIn Russia, the average ambulance response time can range from 15 to 30 minutes in urban areas.\nStudies show that the average ambulance response time in Turkey is 9 minutes.\nThe average ambulance response time in Switzerland is 8 minutes and 30 seconds.\nIn Saudi Arabia, the average ambulance response time is around 15 minutes.\nResearch indicates that the average ambulance response time in Indonesia is 20 minutes.\nThe average ambulance response time in Argentina is 14 minutes.\nIn Egypt, the average ambulance response time is approximately 20 minutes.\nThe average ambulance response time in Nigeria is 25 minutes.\nStudies have shown that the average ambulance response time in Thailand is 16 minutes.\n\nInterpretation\nIn the world of ambulance response times, it seems the clock is always ticking, sometimes faster than others depending on where you are. From speed demons getting to emergencies in just a few minutes to leisurely strolls taking up to half an hour, the statistics paint a vivid picture of a system navigating urban jungles, rural expanses, and everything in between. While we may chuckle at the thought of a global ambulance race, the serious truth remains that those precious moments can make all the difference in saving lives. So next time you hear that siren wailing in the distance, remember that behind those numbers are real people racing against time to be the cavalry in someone's darkest hour.\nImpact of Population Density on Ambulance Response Time\n\nHigh population density areas like Singapore have some of the fastest ambulance response times globally, with an average of 8 minutes.\n\nInterpretation\nIn a world where time is of the essence, it appears that living in the fast lane can actually be a matter of life and death in high population density areas. With ambulance response times clocking in at an average of 8 minutes in places like Singapore, one can't help but wonder if residents are secretly running emergency drills every time they hear a siren. Here, the race against the clock isn't just a metaphor\u2014it's a vital reality where every second truly counts. So, the next time you find yourself stuck in traffic in a bustling city, just remember that somewhere nearby, an ambulance might be navigating its way through the chaos to save a life in record time.\nInfluence of Technology on Ambulance Response Time\n\nSome major cities like New York and Los Angeles have implemented programs to reduce ambulance response times through improved dispatch systems.\nThe use of advanced technology like GPS tracking and predictive analytics has been shown to help improve ambulance response times by up to 20% in some regions.\n\nInterpretation\nIn the high-stakes race against time, major cities are turning to advanced dispatch systems to give their ambulances a speed boost. From the bustling streets of New York to the star-studded avenues of Los Angeles, the use of GPS tracking and predictive analytics is proving to be the turbocharger in emergency response, shaving off precious minutes and improving outcomes. It seems even technology wants to be a hero nowadays, swooping in to save the day and make those sirens sing a little louder.\nRecommendations and Guidelines for Improving Ambulance Response Time\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends an ambulance response time of 8 minutes or less for life-threatening emergencies.\nAccording to a study by the American Heart Association, every minute decrease in ambulance response time for cardiac arrest cases increases the chances of survival by 7-10%.\n\nInterpretation\nWhen it comes to ambulance response times, the clock isn't just ticking - it's a matter of life and death. The World Health Organization's 8-minute target is not just a suggestion, it's a lifeline for those in dire need. As the American Heart Association's study suggests, every minute saved can mean the difference between life and death, with chances of survival increasing with each swift arrival. So the next time you hear that siren in the distance, remember that those minutes matter more than you think.\nReferences\nE ems.gov\nJ jems.com\nN ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\nW who.int\nM medicare.gov\nJ jamanetwork.com\nC cbc.ca\nS sciencedirect.com\nP pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\nE england.nhs.uk\nA abs.gov.au\nA annemergmed.com\nJ jaanet.org\nS straitstimes.com\nA ahajournals.org\nJ journals.plos.org\nI itu.int\nT timeslive.co.za\nP portalms.saude.gov.br\nL lakartidningen.se\nI indianexpress.com\nA aa.com.tr\nO omnyaccz.com\nT timesofindia.indiatimes.com\nY ynetnews.com\nE europeanciss.org\nR researchgate.net\nM medicalgeography.studymoose.com\nC cnnturk.com\nR rts.ch\nS sulaimanialrestaurants.com\nT thejakartapost.com\nM mdzol.com\nE egyptindependent.com\nN nimc.gov.ng\nS setn.net\n\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\n\nRigorous fact-checking process\nData from reputable sources\nRegular updates to ensure relevance\n\nExplore More In This Category\n\nExploring the Most Dangerous Hobbies: Risks and Statistics Revealed\nShocking Lineman Death Rate Statistics: 20.3 Fatalities per 100,000 Workers\nShocking Lineman Death Rate Statistics: 20.3 Fatalities per 100,000 Workers\nAfrica Hunger Statistics: Alarming Figures Reveal Widespread Undernourishment Crisis\nGlobal Asbestos Statistics: Deadly Impact, Legal Challenges, and Health Risks.\nBicycle Helmet Safety Statistics: Key Facts on Head Injury Prevention\n\nOur Most Popular Topics\nIndustry Specific StatisticsEducation and Learning StatisticsHealth and Medical StatisticsSports StatisticsCrime and Safety StatisticsHealth and Wellness StatisticsAnimal and Wildlife StatisticsTravel StatisticsMedia and Entertainment Statistics\n\nWorldmetrics.org\n\nHome\nPrivacy Policy\nContact\nOur Process\nAbout Us\nOur Partner\n\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

      "No 'silver bullet' to fix ambulance response times, CEO says\nAmbulance N.B. says on-time formula, bonus payments on the table in contract negotiations\nSocial Sharing\nAmbulance New Brunswick says there's no easy solution to chronically poor response times in many rural and remote communities around the province.\nOfficials appearing at a committee of MLAs for the second time this month said the problems require changes in the broader health-care system that would, for example, reduce the time ambulances are stuck at hospitals waiting to offload patients.\u00a0\n\"There is not a silver bullet solution to these challenges,\" said Craig Dalton, the CEO of EM/ANB Inc., a provincial government-owned company that contracts with Medavie Health Services New Brunswick Inc. to operate the ambulance service.\n\"It's really an attempt to do as many things as we can to reduce pressure on the system, and not just the emergency health system but the health system in general.\"\nDalton said a growing population, with a fast-expanding share of older people, will mean more calls for ambulances \u2014 while at the same time, recruiting paramedics is a challenge.\n\"The level of service decreases as those pressures increase,\" he said.\nDalton and Ian Watson, the chair of EM/ANB and also the assistant deputy minister in the provincial Health Department, confirmed Sept. 6 that they are talking to Medavie about changing the contract before it expires in 2027.\nUnder that agreement, Medavie must be on time for calls 90 per cent of the time.\n\"On time\" is defined as within nine minutes in urban areas and 22 minutes in rural areas.\nA 2020 auditor-general's report found that low on-time response rates in rural areas do not count against bonus payments to Medavie.\nThe formula in the contract allows those calls to be averaged into broader regional numbers that include a far greater number of on-time responses in urban areas \u2014 producing an overall regional number that hits the target.\nWatson said Thursday that formula, which allowed Medavie to scoop up $2.7 million in bonuses last year, is on the table as part of a possible renegotiation of the contract.\n\"The short answer is 'yes,'\" he said.\nBut Dalton rejected the auditor general's finding that the formula creates a disincentive for ANB to improve by rewarding them for overall numbers so they don't need to hire more paramedics to address local shortfalls.\n\"My comment would be there's no internal disincentive to have the absolute best performance that we can have,\" he said.\n\"I understand the perception, which is why we're really keen to sit down and look at those as well. But I can assure you inside the organization, the only incentive is doing the best we can on each and every call.\"\u00a0\nDalton and Watson were at the legislature's public accounts committee for the second time this month because MLAs from all parties agreed they wanted more answers than what they got during their first appearance Sept. 6.\nLast year's numbers showed 19 rural and remote communities, out of 67 in total, having on-time ambulance responses far below 90 per cent of the time.\u00a0\nThey were the same 19 that the auditor-general identified in 2020, including:\nBelledune, whose calls did not hit the target of 90 per cent on-time response in any month of 2022, and which had an on-time rate of just 29.2 per cent in December.\u00a0\nPort Elgin, where the on-time response rate ranged from 55.6 per cent in July to 15.8 per cent in September.\nFords Mills, in Kent County, with a 57.1 per cent rate in May of last year as its best result, and a 23.1 per cent rate its lowest in August.\nDalton said some new pilot projects are working, including a \"pre-alert\" system that allows paramedics to assess a patient on-site and divert them from a hospital emergency department in some cases.\nThat diverted 10,000 calls in which paramedics helped patients arrange to get care elsewhere.\nNew rapid response units with a single paramedic who can provide care before an ambulance arrives also free up some ambulances for other calls.\nBut Green MLA Kevin Arseneau questioned why there's no such unit in Kent County, given Fords Mills and other communities have had such poor response times.\nDalton said the units were placed in areas with the highest need, and ANB will likely look at putting one in Kent County when the next service review happens. Those reviews take place every two years.\u00a0\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nProvincial Affairs reporter\nJacques Poitras has been CBC's provincial affairs reporter in New Brunswick since 2000.

      "Contents\n2024 United Kingdom riots\nFar-right protesters:[b]\nGovernment of the United Kingdom[3]\nCounter-protests\nIn late July and August 2024, far-right protesters[b] rioted in various parts of the United Kingdom[a]\nin response to a mass stabbing in Southport, Merseyside on 29 July 2024 which killed three children and injured ten other people.\nThe riots began on 30 July when a crowd, some of whom police believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, gathered outside Southport Mosque. The protesters wrongly believed the suspect in the mass stabbing was a Muslim immigrant, due to the spread of disinformation on social media platforms. They attacked police officers, threw objects at the mosque, and set a police vehicle on fire. The riot left over fifty officers injured, some seriously, three police dogs wounded, and multiple arrests were made. The unrest spread to other parts of the UK in the following days. On 31 July, over 100 protesters were arrested in London and demonstrations occurred in Manchester, Hartlepool and Aldershot. On 2 August, rioting took place in Sunderland. A police station was set on fire, three police officers were injured, and several people arrested. On 3 August, far-right protesters again clashed with police in various locations, as well as with anti-racist counter-protests.\nThe riots have been described as being Islamophobic,[11][12][13] racially charged,[14][15][16] anti-immigration,[17][18][16] and far-right.[b] The fascist National Front party and neo-Nazi group British Movement spread misinformation online,[26][27] and members of the neo-Nazi group Patriotic Alternative took part in and helped organise the Southport riots.[28][2]\nBackground\nSouthport stabbing\nOn 29 July 2024, a knife attack took place at a children's yoga and dance workshop. Three children were killed, and eight other children were injured, with five of them in critical condition. Two adults at the event were also critically injured.[29]\nFalse claims\nFollowing the stabbing, there was incorrect speculation and disinformation online about the suspected attacker.[30] Misinformation, including false claims about the suspect's identity, nationality, religion and immigration status, were circulated on social media by high-profile far-right accounts.[31] The false claim that the perpetrator was named \"Ali Al-Shakati\" is believed to have originated from the X account of an anti-lockdown campaigner and gained a greater audience when repeated by the website Channel 3 Now. Andrew Tate also posted on X that the attacker was an \"illegal immigrant\", and ex-boxer Anthony Fowler shared that it was a \"fellow from Syria\".[32][33] A newly created \"Southport-themed\" Telegram group became inundated with misinformation, including from the far-right National Front, prior to dissemination on social media platforms,[26] as well as disinformation spread on social media by the neo-Nazi group British Movement.[27]\nMerseyside Police attempted to quell speculation by confirming that the name being circulated was not connected to the case and was not the suspect,[34] and it was later reported that the suspect was born in Wales to Rwandan parents and moved to the Southport area in 2013.[35][36] The spread of misinformation has widely been attributed to the cause of the riots.[37][38][39][40]\nProfessor of political communication, Andrew Chadwick, described a viral tweet as being \"deliberately fabricated to generate hostility toward ethnic minorities and immigrants, and it's a potentially Islamophobic piece of propaganda\".[41] Matthew Feldman, an expert on right-wing extremism, commented \"It is difficult to think of a much better example of online harms breaching the real world than a fake story demonising Muslims and people of colour and leading to riots on the streets\".[42] Former security minister, Stephen McPartland, accused Russia and Vladimir Putin's regime of involvement in the campaign of misinformation, describing it as \"part of the Russian playbook\".[43] Guardian columnist Owen Jones blamed X (formerly Twitter) as a \"cesspit of disinformation and far-right talking points\" for the spread of unverified claims.[44]\nTimeline\n30 July\nAt approximately 20:05 BST, hundreds of protesters gathered outside Southport Mosque chanting, \"No surrender!\" and \"English till I die!\"[45] Within several minutes, protesters clashed with police.[46] Protesters barricaded themselves and shouted \"Tommy Robinson,\" a far-right activist who founded the English Defence League (EDL). Robinson had been arrested and then released two days prior.[47] By 20:37, protesters began throwing objects at the mosque and police, leaving one officer injured.[48] A police van was set alight[49] as police deployed smoke canisters.[50] Merseyside Police requested officers from Greater Manchester Police, Cheshire Constabulary, Lancashire Police, and North Wales Police.[51] Riot police cleared the area near the mosque by 21:14[52] and protesters began dispersing shortly after that as night fell.[53] By 23:14, the riot had ended.[49] A local convenience store was damaged.[54]\nDuring the riot, The Guardian said that far-right activists had been promoting the protest that started in Southport,[45] prior to involvement in the riot.[19] Huff Post described far-right activists as having \"hijacked\" the vigil for the victims,[55] and Manchester Evening News reported \"far right thugs, fuelled by lies, sought to exploit the tragedy\".[56] Merseyside Police said on the night of the riot that they believed supporters of the English Defence League were involved in and organised the disturbances.[1][57][58] Hope Not Hate described them as supporters of Tommy Robinson.[59] Robinson denied the EDL were involved, while arguing that the anger in Southport was justified.[41] A prominent member of the neo-Nazi group Patriotic Alternative took part in the riot and another member helped to promote the event.[2][28]\nThe following day, the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate warned of the possibility of further demonstrations by far-right groups in several cities across the country.[43] Concerns of further violence were echoed by Merseyside Police.[60]\n31 July\nIn London, the Metropolitan Police established public order conditions for a protest dubbed \"Enough is Enough\",[43] the slogan of Patriotic Alternative,[26] where far-right demonstrators clashed with police on 31 July.[61][62] More than 100 people were arrested.[7]\nOn the evening of 31 July, a group of approximately 40 demonstrators[63] gathered outside a Holiday Inn in Manchester which was purportedly housing asylum seekers. Chants were heard of the group exclaiming \"we want our country back\", a phrase associated with far-right groups in the UK.[64] Two people were arrested.[7]\nDemonstrations also broke out in the County Durham town of Hartlepool on the same evening. Objects including eggs and glass bottles were thrown at the police in response to the latter's riot shields.[65][66] Several police officers were injured and a police car was set alight. Eight people were arrested.[7]\nThere was also a protest outside a hotel housing migrants in Aldershot. Police and crime commissioner, Donna Jones, described \"mob-type\" behaviour, and Hampshire Constabulary reported a crowd of 200 people, with a minority throwing objects and subjecting people to racial abuse.[67]\nThe organiser of a march in Middlesbrough was arrested by Cleveland Police on suspicion of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.[68]\n2 August\nOn the evening of 2 August, protestors gathered in Sunderland's Keel Square for a march around the city centre. Mounted officers from Northumbria Police attended the demonstration along with officers in riot gear. Police and protestors clashed outside a mosque in St Mark's Road after some of the marchers attempted to approach the building. The protestors chanted \"save our kids\" and \"we want our country back\", as well as slogans in support of Tommy Robinson, and Islamophobic slurs.[69][70] An Uber taxi was burnt and shops looted. Sunderland Central police station was set alight, and trains to Sunderland were cancelled or diverted to St Peter's.[71][72] Eight people were subsequently arrested and three police officers hospitalised.[5]\nA hundred protestors shouting anti-immigrant slogans gathered in Liverpool on the same evening.[73][74]\n3 August\nOn 3 August, numerous far-right rallies and counter-protests occurred in England. In Leeds, approximately 150 protesters chanted slogans such as \"paedo Muslims off our street\" and \"stop the boats\", with counter-protesters chanting \"Nazi scum off our streets\". In Manchester, 150 protesters took part in the \"Enough is Enough\" protest. In Nottingham, clashes were reported between opposing groups of protesters, and in Stoke-on-Trent, there appeared to be a stand-off between groups of protesters. In Hull, protesters attacked a hotel housing asylum seekers, throwing bricks and smashing windows,[10] and in Liverpool, far-right protesters threw bricks at police.[6] Police in Bristol made multiple arrests and closed roads after protestors gathered in Castle Park.[75][76]\nIn Liverpool, shops were looted and a library was set on fire.[77]\nA protest also took place in Belfast, where anti-immigration and anti-racism demonstrators were kept apart by police. A shop on the city's Botanic Avenue was damaged when protesters and counter-protesters smashed windows and damaged furniture. Fireworks were also thrown during the march.[78]\nIt was reported that there are discussions about courts in the England and Wales jurisdiction opening overnight to preliminarily rule on suspects of committing crimes arrested by the police. This also happened during the 2011 England riots.[79]\nAftermath\nThe Merseyside Police Federation said that over fifty officers were injured at the Southport incident, with North West Ambulance Service reporting that twenty-seven were hospitalised and twelve were discharged at the scene.[80] Merseyside Police stated that eight officers were seriously injured and three police dogs were wounded.[81]\nOne man from Standish was arrested on suspicion of possessing a bladed article.[82] Police put in place a 24-hour Section 60 Order giving officers further stop-and-search authority, and a Section 34 Order, allowing police to direct people who are engaging in certain activities away from the area. Merseyside Police deployed additional officers after the riot, and ambulance resources remained.[80]\nAccording to The Independent, the Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is \"reviewing whether the far-right English Defence League [...] should be made a proscribed terrorist organisation\", after its connection to the riots,[43] a suggestion echoed by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.[83] The Reform UK leader Nigel Farage was criticised for suggesting that the truth was being withheld, and subsequently accused of inciting violence and creating conspiracy theories by a former counter-terrorism police officer,[84] as well as condemned by the husband of the murdered MP Jo Cox, who accused Farage of \"inciting a riot\".[85] Farage was also accused of giving legitimacy to acts of violence by Steve Rotheram, the Mayor of Liverpool City Region, after releasing a video in which he said the protests were \"nothing to what could happen over the course of the next few weeks\".[86]\nResponses\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer wrote that those who had \"hijacked the vigil for the victims\" had \"insulted the community as it grieves\" and that rioters would feel the full force of the law.[87] On 1 August, and following a meeting with senior police officers, Starmer announced the establishment of a national violent disorder programme to facilitate greater cooperation between police forces when dealing with violent disorder.[88]\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the riot as appalling and requested a criminal investigation.[89] The MP for Southport, Patrick Hurley, said on BBC Radio 4's Today on 31 July, that the rioters were not local residents, but were \"thugs who'd got the train in\" and were \"utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children, and [...] the town\".[90] The rioters had broken windows of Southport Mosque; Hurley told Today that people \"were using the horrific incident on Monday, the deaths of three little kiddies, for their own political purposes\".[91]\nThe Liverpool Region Mosque Network and the Muslim Association of Britain released statements condemning the riot.[92] Ahead of anticipated protests the following weekend, the Muslim Council of Britain recommended that mosques \"review and strengthen their security protocols\".[93][94]\nOn 2 August, and with a number of further protests expected to occur over subsequent days, Home Office minister David Hanson said that police were monitoring organisations, and would use face recognition technology to identify anyone involved in violence.[95]\nIn response to the far-right rallies, counter-protests by anti-racists were organised under the banner of \"Stop the far right: Don\u2019t let the racists divide us\", predominantly by Stand Up to Racism.[96]\nChurch leaders in Northern Ireland condemned calls for anti-Islamic protests in the province on the weekend following the stabbing.[13] The Police Service of Northern Ireland have said that they are planning a proportionate response.[97]\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences",

In the UK there has been a radical shift in how (and whether) many of us travel to and for work, for shopping and for leisure. This shift has had a very visible impact on our towns and cities, with urban centres at times during 2020 appearing virtually empty and at other times hyper-congested as people have sought alternative means of transport in response to the evolving pandemic.\nEach year the London Ambulance Service (LAS) typically attends around 1.1m incidents while the London Fire Brigade 1 (LFB) attends around 100,000 incidents . In many cases the 2 speed of these responses can mean the difference between life and death, so over the years, considerable effort and money has been invested to shave seconds off response times so that first responders are on the scene as soon as possible.\nMuch has been made of this fact during the recent debates over low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) and pop-up cycle lanes introduced as part of the government\u2019s response to the pandemic, with opponents of the changes - though typically not the emergency services themselves - routinely claiming that measures to reduce traffic could cost lives by causing delays to fire and ambulance response times. It is true that the response times of these emergency services are sensitive to changes in road conditions, and ambulance chiefs have recently reported that their in house SatNav systems have 3 sometimes not kept pace where changes to road layouts were made rapidly.\nBut there remains no evidence that 4 London\u2019s new active travel measures have yet caused any measurable increase in overall emergency response times .\n5 LFB records do show an increase in reported delays due to traffic calming measures in fire crew incident reports in areas where LTNs have been introduced but, crucially, any such impacts experienced and reported by crews were completely 5 London\u2019s Police, Fire Brigade and Ambulance Service have all stated they have no records of increased 999 response times as a result of these measures.\n4 https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/low-traffic-neighbourhoods-ltns-999-calls-lo ndon-ambulance-b953716.html 3 https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/london-ambulances-need-new-live-data -systems-to-beat-traffic-jams-in-emergencies-report-claims-a3875251.html 2 https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/incident-response-times-fire-facts 1 https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ambulance-quality-in dicators/ 6 offset by a concomitant decrease in other kinds of delays (likely, reduced overall traffic levels across the areas in question) so that the actual recorded response times in these areas have remained unchanged.6 While the novelty of new and unexpected road layouts and the rapid pace of recent changes have given rise to a mismatch between perceived and actual delays to 999 response times, there is another factor affecting these journeys which may suffer from the opposite effect. Traffic congestion is a daily fact of life in the UK capital - ranked as the 8th most congested city in the world in 2019 - that is so 7 mundane as to be effectively invisible to its residents. Yet the resultant risk of delays to emergency vehicles has the clear potential to have a real impact on the outcomes for critically ill patients and people who are victims of fire and accidents.\nUntil the pandemic hit in 2020 it had been difficult to estimate the extent of the effect that congestion has on emergency service response times, or to separate this effect from other factors.\nBut with traffic levels dropping sharply to unprecedented lows during the various lockdowns, an unplanned, living experiment was thrust upon us, allowing us to gain a fuller picture of how much typical congestion levels delay emergency service vehicles in London for the first time.\n7 https://inrix.com/press-releases/2019-traffic-scorecard-uk/ 6 https://findingspress.org/article/23568-the-impact-of-2020-low-traffic-neighbourh oods-on-fire-service-emergency-response-times-in-london-uk 7 Congestion Levels in London In order to quantify the change in congestion levels experienced in London since the pandemic started, three sources of data on traffic levels in London were accessed.\nThe car navigation platform TomTom uses their satellite 8 navigation systems to gather data on congestion in cities around the world, including London. TomTom quantifies congestion by comparing the actual time taken by vehicle drivers in a given hour against an estimate of the time the same journey would take in the absence of any congestion.\nFor example, a congestion level of 36% means that a trip will take 36% more time than it would have done in uncongested conditions.9 At the time of writing, the TomTom website hosted weekly congestion level data for London for the whole of 2021 to date.\nFor 2020 only monthly data was available on the live TomTom website, however it was possible to access data for the first 41 weeks of 2020 by using archive.org\u2019s Wayback Machine.\nThe 10 gap in the weekly data series from October to December 2020 has been bridged by using the monthly data (dashed lines in the chart below).\nThe TomTom data starts with the normal lull in congestion as Londoners return from their Christmas and New Year holidays, with levels rapidly returning to historical norms for the first two months of the year. It then shows a steep reduction in the level of congestion starting well in advance of the official announcement on 23rd March of the first lockdown.\nCongestion reduced from the peak in week 10 of 2020 (2nd March to 8th March) to a minimum in week 14 (29th March to 5th April) before starting to creep back up again early in the lockdown and gradually returning to levels similar to before the lockdown by November.\nThe monthly data for October to December (dashed lines) suggest a smaller reduction during the shorter second lockdown before a more substantial drop over Christmas and as the country entered the third lockdown. Congestion levels then resumed their upwards trend as the lockdown 10 https://web.archive.org/web/20201115144731/https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic -index/london-traffic/ 9 https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic-index/about/ 8 https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic-index/london-traffic/ 8 progressed and as it was gradually phased out starting in March 2021.\nFigure 1: London congestion levels 2020-21 (Source: TomTom) Another relevant source of data exists in the form of an ongoing programme of traffic counts at locations on major and minor roads across the country managed by the Department for Transport.\n149 of the traffic count points in 11 the London region had one of these 12-hour vehicle counts take place in either 2018 or 2019 (mostly between April and June) and another during the first lockdown (all between April and June 2020). Comparing the count in 2018 or 2019, years which represent recent baseline traffic flows, with the count during the first lockdown gives an indication of how traffic flows changed during the pandemic.\nIn total nearly 2 million vehicles of all kinds were logged passing these 149 points during the counts undertaken in 2018 or 2019. At the same 149 points during the pandemic the number of vehicles logged had reduced by an average of 50%: 11 https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/downloads 9 Table 1: Overall traffic flows in London, 2018/19 vs 2020 covid lockdown (Source: Department for Transport road traffic stats) 2018 or 2019 First Lockdown Change Vehicle Type Count Share Count Share Count % Pedal Cycles 3,541 0.2% 6,354 0.6% +2,813 +79% Two Wheeled Motor Vehicles 6,645 0.3% 3,620 0.4% -3,025 -46% Cars and Taxis 1,481,960 74.4% 612,514 61.3% -869,446 -59% Buses and Coaches 10,188 0.5% 2,940 0.3% -7,248 -71% LGVs 281,344 14.1% 204,977 20.5% -76,367 -27% HGVs 207,715 10.4% 169,162 16.9% -38,553 -19% Total 1,991,393 999,567 -991,826 -50% Total Excluding 2 Wheeled 1,981,207 989,593 -991,614 -50% With the exception of pedal cycles, which saw an increase of nearly 80% as Londoners took to bikes to get around, all vehicle types saw a reduction.\nPassenger cars, which accounted for around 75% of vehicles counted pre-pandemic, saw an average reduction of nearly 60% during the pandemic and nearly 90% of the change in vehicle numbers counted can be attributed to this reduction in car and taxi traffic.\nFinally, Transport for London tracks bus speeds across its network to monitor bus service performance and this 12 provides an indirect measure of congestion in London. The data shows a substantial increase in average bus speeds across London during the first and third lockdowns in particular as congestion dropped: 12 https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/buses-performance-data 10 Figure 2: London bus speeds, 2017-2021 (Source: Transport for London) 11 London Fire Brigade Travel Times The London Fire Brigade responds to nearly 100,000 incidents each year (over 250 per day) and records data about the response times, including the time taken to travel from the station to the incident, for each of these.\nIt is therefore 13 possible to build up a detailed picture of how response times have changed in the last few years, in particular during the pandemic.\nThe Greater London area is divided up into a number of station areas. The inner London stations typically cover an area ranging from under 1 square mile to around 6 square miles, with outer London station areas being typically 14 considerably larger, one of the reasons why average response times in outer London are over 30 seconds higher than response times in inner London.\nFigure 3: London Fire station boundaries15 15 https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/brigade_orders_and_ground_maps#i ncoming-597801 14 https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/242506/response/597801/attach/2/LFB %20station%20boundaries.pdf 13 https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-fire-brigade-mobilisation-records 12 The chart below shows the average travel times between the station and the incident of the first appliance to arrive on the scene in each week from the start of 2019 to the end of June 2021, overlaid with the dates of the three lockdowns which had been imposed during the pandemic: Figure 4: LFB 999 response travel times 2019-2021 (Source: London Fire Brigade, Fire Facts) A pronounced reduction in travel times can be seen in the weeks running up to the first lockdown (starting in around week 10 of 2020) as Londoners started taking steps to reduce their movements and traffic levels reduced. Reductions in travel time were also seen during the second and third lockdowns although as congestion levels did not drop as far as during the first lockdown, these were not as pronounced.\nThe relationship between travel time and congestion level reveals that for each percent increase in congestion, the travel time by fire appliances increases by approximately one second: 13 Figure 5: LFB response travel times vs congestion metric.\nInner London fire stations saw a 44 second reduction (-20%) in mean travel times between week 10 and week 14 of 2020 while outer London fire stations saw a 38 second reduction (-14%) over the same period. Travel times in outer London dropped further as lockdown continued, reaching an 18% reduction in week 18 of 2020 compared with week 10.\nComparing April 2020 travel times with April 2019 shows that some inner London stations saw large improvements: 14 Table 2: London fire stations which saw the biggest reductions in 999 response times during April 2020 lockdown.\nStation Name Apr-19 Response Times (s) Apr-20 Response Times (s) Reduction % Change Soho 250 159 1m31s -37% Greenwich 204 148 0m56s -27% Deptford 228 169 0m59s -26% Shoreditch 211 157 0m54s -26% Tooting 246 189 0m57s -23% Paddington 233 183 0m50s -22% Lambeth 214 168 0m46s -22% Islington 233 187 0m46s -20% Peckham 215 173 0m42s -19% Euston 215 174 0m41s -19% Nationally, 999 response times to serious \u2018primary\u2019 fires have been rising inexorably since the 1990s. This rise is almost exclusively attributable to increases in travel time, since crew turnout times have fallen over this period, while call handling times flatlined or fell for protracted periods in which overall response times continued to increase . Government analysis 16 of the factors behind rising fire response times nationally from 1996-2006 concluded that rising traffic levels was the primary cause.17 Our analysis from the London lockdowns shows that when traffic levels fall, fire response times come down too - and that the most plausible explanation for this correlation is causal. To put it another way, the presence of \u2018normal\u2019 levels of motor traffic on the capital\u2019s streets are causing substantial delays to the London Fire Brigade\u2019s response times to the most serious incidents.\n17 https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20120919173844mp_/http://www.\ncommunities.gov.uk/documents/fire/pdf/frsresponsetimes.pdf 16 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/atta chment_data/file/857924/response-times-fires-england-1819-hosb0120.pdf 15 London Ambulance Service Response Times NHS England publishes monthly data on average response times for each region of England, detailing the number of incidents and mean response times by incident category.18 Unlike the fire brigade data, the ambulance data represents the total response time and not just the travel time to the incident. The clock starts when the call is coded as C1, when the first ambulance resource is assigned or 30 seconds after the emergency call connects, whichever is earliest.\nAs a result of this approach to reporting ambulance response times, and in contrast to London Fire Brigade response time datasets, it is not possible to fully disentangle the impact of congestion on ambulance journey times from other factors such as changes in call volumes (e.g. higher call volumes lead to longer call answer times) or changes in staffing levels, both of which are understood to have had a major impact on response times during the pandemic .\n19 Incidents coded as C1 (Category 1) in the data are those that received a response on scene where life-threatening injuries and illnesses, specifically cardiac arrest, were involved. These incidents have a target mean response time of seven minutes. C1 incidents where any patients were transported by an Ambulance Service emergency vehicle are coded as C1T.\nC1T does not include incidents where an ambulance clinician on scene determines that no conveyance is necessary, or incidents with non-emergency conveyance. The C1T response time for an incident is the response time of the first vehicle which is capable of conveying the patient.\nThe NHS ambulance response data goes back as far as the end of 2017 when the C1 category was introduced, and shows the C1 target time of 7 minutes (420 seconds) being met since the summer of 2018. However, as the pandemic hit there was a substantial spike in total response times (see the dotted lines in Figure 6) as an exceptionally large volume of calls were received and the NHS was put under the immense 19 Snooks et al, 2021: Call volume, triage outcomes, and protocols during the first wave of the COVID\u201019 pandemic in the United Kingdom: Results of a national survey https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8328888/ 18 https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ambulance-quality-in dicators/ 16 pressure of the pandemic.\nThis peak has since been 20 confirmed as London Ambulance Service\u2019s busiest ever month and during this surge, mean call answer times 21 increased from a pre-pandemic average of around 12 seconds to 200 seconds.\nFigure 6: Mean response times net of mean call answer time (solid lines) for C1 and C1T emergency, 2017-2021. The total response times have also been included along with the mean call answer time.22 By deducting the mean call answer time from the total response times we remove one of the major confounding factors (the time for the call to connect), leaving us with an estimate of the average time from the emergency call connecting to an operator through to the ambulance arriving on scene. However, substantial uncertainties remain in the extent to which the reduction in C1T response times which can be seen in the data can be attributed to reduced 22 https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ambulance-quality-in dicators/ 21 https://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/2021/09/06/2021-summer-months-three-of-our-top-five-busiest-months-ever/ 20 https://www.hsj.co.uk/ambulance-waiting-times-soared-in-march-as-calls-hit-rec ord-high/7027368.article 17 congestion (for example call duration, ambulance availability or crew turnout times may also have changed during this period).\nAs the ambulance data covers total response time, other factors beyond the level of congestion experienced travelling to an incident are also at play - as in the periods when surging Covid-19 cases overwhelmed the service, which were subsequently followed by a sustained drops in call volumes compared to the baseline.\nPast NHS reviews of the factors 23 behind geographical disparities in ambulance response times have found that these tend to be dominated by the overall workload in urban areas.\nWe therefore cannot state 24 with complete confidence that reduced congestion explains the drop in response times seen during the Covid-19 lockdowns.\nNevertheless, the general trend in response times closely correlates with the congestion trends over the period in question. Moreover, there is no other plausible explanation for the substantially reduced travel response times experienced by the London Fire Brigade during the lockdown periods, and we therefore contend that it is reasonable to conclude that reduced congestion has played a dominant part in these faster response times.\nLondon\u2019s ambulances and fire appliances are using the same roads, after all.\nThis hypothesis is also supported by other circumstantial evidence. For instance, analysis of NHS England data by the Nuffield Trust has found a similar pattern in C1 response times since 2018 at the national level, with a spike at the start of the pandemic followed by a dip during lockdown; but the 25 national reduction in response time during this period was less pronounced than that seen in London - which in normal times is the most congested city in the UK.26 We were not able to determine why average response times between C1 and C1T calls have historically varied so widely.\nBut we speculate that this may be explained by the fact that C1T includes only vehicles capable of conveying patients to hospital, and therefore excludes cycle and motorcycle paramedics, who are typically dispatched to life threatening incidents in parallel with ambulances, and are often first on the scene since they can \u201ccan get through the traffic faster 26 https://inrix.com/press-releases/2019-traffic-scorecard-uk/ 25 https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/ambulance-response-times#background 24 https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ambulance-response-pr ogramme-review.pdf 23 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8328888/ 18 than a large ambulance\u201d.\nThis could also explain why the 27 variance between C1 and C1T response times fell to under 100 seconds during lockdown, when it is typically over 300 seconds; perhaps \u201clarge ambulances\u201d were no longer being held up by traffic? Further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis however.\n27 https://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/calling-us/who-will-treat-you/single-respon der/ 19 Implications Although it is well established that there is a causal relationship between fire and ambulance 999 response times and fatality rates, this relationship is in most cases a highly complex one. For instance, the number and range of factors influencing whether a fire leads to fatalities is very large, and the non-linear relationship between fire spread and time elapsed makes it very difficult to draw any straightforward link between 999 response times and outcomes for victims of fires. Outcomes of delays for the diverse range of medical emergencies suffered by Londoners are perhaps even more challenging to quantify, and we were cautioned by clinical researchers that in practice patient outcomes are far too multi-factorial to be amenable to crude attempts at attribution.\nDespite the confounding factors, the Department for Communities and Local Government has in the past used fire service data to develop a benchmark statistical model for planning fire service provision, in the form of the Fire Service Emergency Cover Toolkit.\n\u201cFatality rate response time 28 relationships\u201d were developed which attempted to quantify the impact of different response times on fatality rates for a range of different incident types. There is no real question that Londoners are dying as a consequence of delays to 999 responses caused by congestion - even though it is not practicable to ascertain exactly how many and from what causes.\nIn the context of this report\u2019s focus it should also be noted that of London\u2019s 9,678 serious \u2018primary\u2019 fires in 2019, 1,925 of these involved motor vehicles - around 20% of the total.\nOver 30,000 29 Londoners were casualties of road traffic collisions in 2019, nearly 4000 of whom were seriously injured or killed.\nMotor traffic 30 therefore not only impedes emergency service vehicles on their way to incidents; it also generates a high proportion of the most dangerous incidents being responded to.\n30 https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/road-safety -https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzgyZTc0ZmYtMjlmOC00ZGFmLWJmNzMtZW JkMjdhMDU4MGY1IiwidCI6IjFmYmQ2NWJmLTVkZWYtNGVlYS1hNjkyLWEwODljMjU1MzQ2Y iIsImMiOjh9 29 https://data.london.gov.uk/download/lfb-fires-in-london-1966-2019---fire-facts/cfd 2b25b-8014-436f-add2-a68ef9017bee/Fire%20Facts%20-%20Fires%20in%20Greater% 20London%202019.pdf 28 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2012-updates-to-the-fire-service-em ergency-cover-toolkit-special-service-and-fire-fatality-rate-functions 20 Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of its associated civil lockdowns offer an unprecedented \u2018living experiment\u2019 opportunity to assess the impact of typical congestion levels in London on the response times of its emergency services.\nThis paper has shown that these effects are very substantial, and we believe that in practice they are likely to account for a significant number of excess deaths each year amongst Londoners requiring urgent assistance for both fires and medical emergencies.\nBecause traffic congestion has become an endemic feature of life in London, most residents, including emergency service crews, have become desensitised to its negative effects.\nImaginary grievances about perceived acute impacts on 999 response times arising from new cycle lanes and low traffic neighbourhoods generate sensational headlines and fury on social media -despite not being detectable in official records. Meanwhile the real, chronic impacts of too many cars on the city\u2019s streets are demonstrably preventing life saving emergency services from getting to their destinations as quickly as they might, yet continue to go unremarked and unreported. We hope this short report will go some way towards rectifying this.\n21"

In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading.

Demand for treatment of depression is also up, with 72% of psychologists who treat depressive disorders saying they have seen an increase, compared with 60% in 2020. Other treatment areas with greater demand included sleep-wake disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and substance-related and addictive disorders, the survey found.\nThe number of psychologists who reported receiving more referrals this year almost doubled from last year (from 37% in 2020 to 62% this year).

A high Access Ranking\u00a0(1-13) indicates that a state provides relatively more access to insurance and mental health\u00a0treatment than those ranked 39-51.\nThe eight measures that make up the Access Ranking include:\n\n\n\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness.\nIn 2022, 64% of adults who were uninsured said that they did not have health insurance because they could not afford it.\nThe state prevalence of uninsured adults with mental illness ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\nAdults with SUD Who Needed But Did Not Receive Treatment\nOver three-quarters (76.9%) of all adults with a substance use disorder did not receive the treatment they needed.\nMost adults with SUD who sought or thought about receiving treatment reported they didn\u2019t because they thought they should have been able to handle their drug or alcohol use on their own (75.4%).\nThis was followed by: Not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop or cut back using alcohol or drugs (48.4%), thought it would cost too much (47.7%), and did not know how or where to get treatment (47.3%).\nThe state prevalence of adults with SUD with unmet treatment needs ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\n10.2% of adults who experienced a mental illness in the past year had private health insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems.\nThe state prevalence of adults with AMI whose private insurance did not cover mental or emotional problems ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs\n24.58% of adults who reported experiencing 14 or more mentally unhealthy days each month were not able to see a doctor due to costs. This was a 2% increase over last year\u2019s report.\nHigh costs of mental health care are a critical barrier to access. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading. Unfortunately, doing so hides the fact that the percentages are significantly lower.\nThe state rate of students identified as having an emotional disturbance for an IEP ranges from 28.01 per 1,000 students in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 students in Alabama.\n\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\nMental Health Workforce Availability\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. The term \u201cmental health provider\u201d includes psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care.\nAs of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, and only 27% of the mental health need in shortage areas was being met by mental health providers. Over the next 15 years, the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis has projected increasing shortages for several behavioral health providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health and addiction counselors.\nThe state rate of mental health workforce ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.\nThe State of Mental Health in America\n2024 STATISTICS\nAccess to Care\nAbout Us\nGet Help\nGet Active\nGet Information\n\n                500 Montgomery Street,\n                \n                Suite 820\n                \n                Alexandria, VA. 22314\n                \n\n                Phone (703) 684.7722\n                \n                Toll Free (800) 969.6642\n                \n                Fax (703) 684.5968\n              \nFooter menu\n"

A high Access Ranking\u00a0(1-13) indicates that a state provides relatively more access to insurance and mental health\u00a0treatment than those ranked 39-51.\nThe eight measures that make up the Access Ranking include:\n\n\n\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness.\nIn 2022, 64% of adults who were uninsured said that they did not have health insurance because they could not afford it.\nThe state prevalence of uninsured adults with mental illness ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\nAdults with SUD Who Needed But Did Not Receive Treatment\nOver three-quarters (76.9%) of all adults with a substance use disorder did not receive the treatment they needed.\nMost adults with SUD who sought or thought about receiving treatment reported they didn\u2019t because they thought they should have been able to handle their drug or alcohol use on their own (75.4%).\nThis was followed by: Not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop or cut back using alcohol or drugs (48.4%), thought it would cost too much (47.7%), and did not know how or where to get treatment (47.3%).\nThe state prevalence of adults with SUD with unmet treatment needs ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\n10.2% of adults who experienced a mental illness in the past year had private health insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems.\nThe state prevalence of adults with AMI whose private insurance did not cover mental or emotional problems ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs\n24.58% of adults who reported experiencing 14 or more mentally unhealthy days each month were not able to see a doctor due to costs. This was a 2% increase over last year\u2019s report.\nHigh costs of mental health care are a critical barrier to access. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading. Unfortunately, doing so hides the fact that the percentages are significantly lower.\nThe state rate of students identified as having an emotional disturbance for an IEP ranges from 28.01 per 1,000 students in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 students in Alabama.\n\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\nMental Health Workforce Availability\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. The term \u201cmental health provider\u201d includes psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care.\nAs of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, and only 27% of the mental health need in shortage areas was being met by mental health providers. Over the next 15 years, the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis has projected increasing shortages for several behavioral health providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health and addiction counselors.\nThe state rate of mental health workforce ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.\nThe State of Mental Health in America\n2024 STATISTICS\nAccess to Care\nAbout Us\nGet Help\nGet Active\nGet Information\n\n                500 Montgomery Street,\n                \n                Suite 820\n                \n                Alexandria, VA. 22314\n                \n\n                Phone (703) 684.7722\n                \n                Toll Free (800) 969.6642\n                \n                Fax (703) 684.5968\n              \nFooter menu\n",

      "Findings of Poll 20\nThis study was conducted by Pollara Strategic Insights with an online sample of 3,713 adult Canadians between April 30 and May 16, 2024. The results from this study provide insights into the mental health of Canadians and reveal concerning trends.\u00a0Results from a probability sample of this size could be considered accurate to within \u00b11.6 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. Results have been weighted based on age, gender and region to be representative of the Canadian population.\u00a0\n \nA series of research briefs that provide an in-depth, specific investigation of our polling results can be found here.\u00a0Results of earlier polls are compared when applicable. \u00a0\nFindings from our polls are searchable on our free Data Portal.\nOur latest data shows that negative daily impacts of mental health symptoms are at a near record high, and access to support is on the rise.\u00a0\nThe findings reveal significant insights into mental health indicators and emerging trends:\nNegative Impacts of Mental Health Symptoms at Near Record-High:\u00a0 More than one in four (28%) of Canadians report that their mental health symptoms affect their daily functioning, marking the highest percentage recorded since the middle of the pandemic. Over one-third of respondents indicate that mental health symptoms disrupt various aspects of their lives, including work/school (40%), social/leisure (33%), and family/home (36%).\nHigh-Risk Problem Gambling in Canada: 7% of Canadians present high risk of problem gambling, with a higher rate of 15% among those aged 18-34. Those who present high-risk of problem gambling are more likely to face severe mental health issues, including 22% having planned a suicide attempt, and show higher rates of alcohol (38%) and cannabis (49%) dependency compared to non-gamblers.\nUpward Trend in Accessing Mental Health Support: More Canadians have accessed mental health support in the past year (16%), indicating a 5% increase since the summer of 2022.\nHigh Levels of Resilience: Almost seven-in-ten Canadians express confidence in their ability to bounce back from challenges (68%), marking the highest percentage recorded since the inception of this polling series. While younger Canadians are less optimistic, resilience levels have increased across all age groups.\nAdditional major findings from Poll 20 include:\nSelf-reported anxiety levels remain high, with 12% of Canadians experiencing high anxiety. However, there has been a slight decrease in self-reported depression, down to 9% since the last poll. Younger demographics continue to report higher rates of anxiety and depression compared to older cohorts.\nA growing number of Canadians report missing days of work or school due to mental health concerns (11%). Productivity at work or school has declined for 27% of respondents, reflecting a 6% increase since the previous poll.\nNearly half of Canadians are aware of the 988 Crisis Suicide Helpline (45%), with 4% having utilized the service themselves and an additional 8% knowing someone who has.\n\nMental Health Research Canada\nGet the latest updates on new events and funding opportunities.

In 2022, about three-quarters of Canadian primary care physicians reported that virtual care allowed them to effectively assess the mental and behavioural health needs of their patients.Reference5 \u00a0Virtual mental health care is not yet common across Canada, with only 1 in 9 Canadians (11%) reporting that they received virtual health care from a mental health professional (CMWF average: 7%); however, both uptake of and satisfaction with virtual mental health services were significantly higher among Canadian adults than among adults in other countries surveyed. Of those who received virtual mental health care, most were very or somewhat satisfied with the care received (Canada: 82%; CMWF average: 74%). Younger adults (19%) and females (14%) were more likely to use virtual mental health care. Nearly 3 in 4 Canadian adults who used virtual mental health care had a diagnosed mental health condition (72%).\nVirtual mental health care may not be appropriate for severe and/or acute mental health conditions, but it can be helpful for patients with anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.Reference7Reference8 \u00a0It may have the potential to address barriers to accessing care, and to empower patients to better manage their conditions.Reference9 Further research is needed to understand how to improve equitable access to virtual mental health care in marginalized communities.\nBack to Commonwealth Fund survey, 2023\nReferences\n1.\nBack to Reference 1 in text\nStatistics Canada.

In the 2022 CMWF survey of primary care physicians, less than half of Canadian physicians reported that they often screen or assess patients for their social needs like housing, financial security and food insecurity.Reference5\nDiscussions about stressors with health care professionals\n\n\nShow text version Hide text version\nText version of graph\nThe proportions of adults who reported that a health care professional talked with them in the past 12 months about things in their life that worry them or cause them stress are as follows: the United States, 40%; Australia, 35%; France, 30%; Germany, 30%; Sweden, 28%; CMWF average, 28%; Canada, 28%; New Zealand, 27%; Switzerland, 25%; the United Kingdom, 21%; and the Netherlands, 18%.

In 2022, about three-quarters of Canadian primary care physicians reported that virtual care allowed them to effectively assess the mental and behavioural health needs of their patients.Reference5 \u00a0Virtual mental health care is not yet common across Canada, with only 1 in 9 Canadians (11%) reporting that they received virtual health care from a mental health professional (CMWF average: 7%); however, both uptake of and satisfaction with virtual mental health services were significantly higher among Canadian adults than among adults in other countries surveyed. Of those who received virtual mental health care, most were very or somewhat satisfied with the care received (Canada: 82%; CMWF average: 74%). Younger adults (19%) and females (14%) were more likely to use virtual mental health care. Nearly 3 in 4 Canadian adults who used virtual mental health care had a diagnosed mental health condition (72%).\nVirtual mental health care may not be appropriate for severe and/or acute mental health conditions, but it can be helpful for patients with anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.Reference7Reference8 \u00a0It may have the potential to address barriers to accessing care, and to empower patients to better manage their conditions.Reference9 Further research is needed to understand how to improve equitable access to virtual mental health care in marginalized communities.\nBack to Commonwealth Fund survey, 2023\nReferences\n1.\nBack to Reference 1 in text\nStatistics Canada.

After all, to report on impact is not just looking at\u00a0past achievements. It is also a promise for the future: the\u00a0pact,\u00a0the commitment, and the hope. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 6 The ability to foster change in mental health is an ongoing commitment, for even when we achieve milestones we must be aware of emerging challenges. That is why the MHCC seeks to truly understand and engage with people who have lived and living experience of mental health and substance use health challenges. Not only are these experiences integrated into our research, planning, and outreach efforts. They make it possible to identify gaps in policy and services that provide our evidence-based research to inform change, training to reduce stigma, and programs to offer life-affirming hope. One example is Roots of Hope, a community-led initiative to reduce suicide rates whose impact is empowering communities and provinces across the country \u2014 most recently, the government of Manitoba.\nCanada is a vast country with many geographic, cultural, linguistic, and economic differences. But no matter what your status, you can be affected by mental health concerns. Just as we all have physical health, we all have mental health \u2014 and it\u2019s something that needs tending. Yet, because doing so can be difficult for many people, the MHCC is part of a global forum of mental health leaders who are tackling challenges related to virtual care implementation and its intersections with artificial intelligence. As critical questions emerge, so is the potential for virtual care to reduce mental health service wait times \u2014 something we saw this year in the Northwest Territories. An MHCC project, implemented in partnership with the territorial government and Stepped Care Solutions, led to a 79 per cent reduction in\u00a0wait times for mental health counselling in the region. The Stepped Care model allows individuals to access mental health services at level with the most effective impact. Each level can then be stepped up or down depending on progress and the nature of the concern. The reductions in wait times involved simplifying intake processes, introducing drop-in counselling sessions, and implementing e-mental health services.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 7 The MHCC is also changing the lives of Canadians and communities by increasing mental health literacy and improving access to quality mental health and substance use health supports. Since care needs to be culturally informed to do this well, the commission partnered with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) on a research and pilot program for culturally adapted cognitive behavioural therapy that is improving outcomes for Canadians of South Asian origin with anxiety and depression.\nIn addition, MHCC collaboration across numerous communities regarding the relationship between mental health and cannabis resulted in 40 community-based research projects. Six were led by Indigenous researchers, who provided perspectives on parental cannabis use and child welfare, cannabis retailers in Indigenous communities, and guidance on the interface of cannabis and traditional medicines.\nWe have also been collaborating with Indspire, a\u00a0cross-Canada Indigenous charity that invests in the education of First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis youth and young adults. This initiative focuses on mental health education and resources to support Indigenous students with Indspire\u2019s programs.\nWhile these are truly impactful programs, mental health stigma continues to be a significant issue. We know from work with our research partners that 95 per cent of people with a mental health or substance use disorder were impacted by stigma over the past five years, with the majority reporting feelings of self-stigma and internalizing negative stereotypes.\nThis finding underscores the critical importance of our evidence-based training programs, including those offered through Opening Minds to increase mental health literacy. Since the MHCC was established in 2007, we have trained more than a million people in these innovative evidence-based courses and plan to increase this number significantly.\nTogether, we are actively ensuring that we are equipped to advance policy and program objectives in a sustainable and meaningful manner while creatively increasing our impact. Work like this changes lives.Michel Rodrigue\u2019s signature.\nMichel Rodrigue President and CEOChuck Bruce\u2019s signature.\nChuck Bruce Board Chair Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 8 Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 9 Sporting Mindfulness More than 15,000 schoolchildren across Saskatchewan received mental health training thanks to a ground-breaking partnership between the Mental Health Commission of Canada and\u00a0a\u00a0professional football team. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 10Three female athletes celebrating.\nThe MHCC\u2019s alliance with the Saskatchewan Roughriders also led to a new version of The Working\u00a0Mind (TWM), an evidence-based program to promote mental health and reduce the stigma associated with mental\u00a0illness in the workplace.\n\u201cI\u2019ve long been aware of the mental health training developed and delivered by the MHCC,\u201d says Cindy\u00a0Fuchs, the foundation\u2019s executive director and a recognized leader in Saskatchewan\u2019s not-for-profit sector. \u201cWhen\u00a0I learned about plans to develop a version of TWM for the sports industry, I saw an opportunity for us to work together and serve the greater good.\u201d Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 11Three male athletes celebrating.\nThe Saskatchewan Roughrider Foundation, the charitable organization affiliated with the Canadian Football League team, has\u00a0been funding community-based education, health, and amateur sports projects for young people since it\u00a0was\u00a0established in 2019.\nDeveloped by clinicians and peers, TWM offers facilitated discussions that focus on work-related mental health topics. Since the MHCC launched TWM in 2013, it has developed a series of industry\u2011specific versions of the training by collaborating with a range of\u00a0partners. One of those versions is TWM\u00a0Sport, which was piloted through the foundation with the help of Saskatchewan Roughrider players and coaches, along with a handful of elite athletes in the\u00a0province. Feedback\u00a0from the pilot led to additional improvements to the program.\nDetermined to have more elite football players benefit from the training, the foundation paid to deliver TWM\u00a0Sport to two varsity teams and several junior and women\u2019s teams. To spread its benefits further, the\u00a0foundation also built on its long-standing partnership with the province\u2019s Ministry of Education. For years, the ministry and foundation have partnered on the Game Changers Playbook to give elementary and secondary students evidence-based, curriculum\u2011related mental health and wellness resources. Now, five Roughrider players trained in TWM Sport tour the province to talk about mental health with student groups through the foundation\u2019s Win\u00a0With\u00a0Wellness\u00a0Presentation Series.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 12A Saskatchewan Roughrider team member speaks to students seated at their desks.\n\u201cThe mind is the strongest muscle in your body,\u201d says\u00a0Brayden Lenius, a Saskatchewan Roughrider wide\u00a0receiver who participated in the pilot.\n\u201cYou can develop your mind to become stronger and more resilient. TWM Sport teaches you how to do that.\u201d \u201cLessons from TWM are for everyone \u2014 not just pro athletes,\u201d says Lenius. \u201cTelling schoolchildren about some of the mental health challenges I face, and\u00a0listening to their stories, helps me and helps them.\u201d Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 13 The MHCC continues to seek like-minded partners to expand and improve the effectiveness of programs like TWM. In\u00a0the end, everyone must recognize that mental health can be nurtured, that help is\u00a0available, and that recovery is expected. TWM Versions Besides different versions for employees and managers in\u00a0Canada, Australia, and the United States, TWM is available for\u00a0specific industry groups. These include: \u2022 First responders (fire,\u00a0police, paramedics, corrections\u00a0staff) \u2022 Post-secondary students \u2022 Health care \u2022 Legal \u2022 Oral health care \u2022 Sports By the Numbers More than 300,000 people have completed at\u00a0least one version of TWM.\nMore than 1,500 TWM facilitators have\u00a0been trained worldwide.\nMore and more Peer\u2011reviewed studies demonstrate the effectiveness of TWM.1 1 See, for example, Effects of the Anti-stigma Workplace Intervention \u201cWorking Mind\u201d in\u00a0a\u00a0Canadian Health-Care Setting: A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Immediate Versus Delayed Implementation and The Working Mind: A\u00a0Meta\u2011Analysis of a Workplace Mental\u00a0Health and Stigma Reduction Program.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 14 Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 15 Taking Root Engaging and empowering individuals and\u00a0communities in suicide prevention The Roots of Hope model builds on community expertise to implement suicide prevention and life promotion initiatives based on five pillars of action and 13 guiding principles.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 16Three adults planting a tree together.\nThe impact of Roots of Hope on individuals and communities continues to deepen. Its\u00a0success is based on sound evidence and an operating model that prioritizes collaboration and independence: Each Roots of Hope community is encouraged to develop and implement the initiatives \u2014 and establish the partnerships \u2014 it considers most appropriate. In many cases, they build on existing programs and services.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 17 \u201cGiving back to others through Roots\u00a0of\u00a0Hope has helped to save my life.\u201d \u201cThe launching of an eight-week support group for [suicide] attempt survivors provided a space for them to work through their struggles in a safe space. I went through the group myself and found it beneficial. I know that, as a lived experience person on the team, it has given me the opportunity to use my life experience for good and to make meaning out of what happened. My\u00a0friend Travis also went through the group last year and found it helpful. He unfortunately died by suicide recently, but I think the group bought him the better part of a year.\nI am very grateful that Roots of Hope exists. I am also grateful that the services we provide gave me more time with my friend. This is meaningful work, and I hope to be able to see it through. It\u2019s the only group of its kind in the area \u2014 and by area I\u2019m pretty sure I mean all of Western Canada. Lastly, the suicide prevention-related events that Stony Plain hosts always have good\u00a0turnouts, and I think the public is starting to be able to speak more openly about it.\u201d Wesley Jones Roots of Hope community Stony Plain, Alberta Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 18 \u201cWe are network of 65 volunteers trained in ground-based search and rescue. Many of the people we search for don\u2019t want to be found, usually because they are experiencing a mental\u2011health crisis. These now account for about 75 per cent of our searches. In many cases, the person is contemplating suicide, and time is of the essence. Partnering with Roots of Hope improves our ability to find and rescue people in crisis. The partnership also improves the mental health of our volunteers, who are now more resilient.\u201d Tina Brown Planning Section Chief Colchester Ground Search and Rescue Colchester County, Nova Scotia \u201cA big reason that members of the 2SLGBTQI+ community experience higher rates of both mental illness and suicide ideation is social stigma, particularly in rural and remote communities. Under our partnership with Roots of Hope, two members of the 2SLGBTQI+ community in each of Nova Scotia\u2019s four health-care zones have been trained to deliver SafeTALK suicide-prevention courses. Hundreds of at-risk people, along with their friends and families, will benefit. Roots of Hope is a catalyst \u2014 the extra ingredient that inspires tangible progress.\u201d Tyler Colbourne Executive Director Healthy Minds Cooperative Nova Scotia Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 19Two youths at a race.\nBy the Numbers 2019 eight communities 2021 11 more Today 18 communities, three provinces, and one territory Roots of Hope is based on\u00a0community expertise To increase the impact of their efforts, Roots of Hope community coalition forge partnerships with a variety of local organizations.

Informed by five years of research, and developed in collaboration with educators and students, HEADSTRONG uses a proven two\u2011step process: Students from multiple schools are initially brought together to attend a summit; afterwards,\u00a0groups of students in each school design and\u00a0implement a range of\u00a0activities and initiatives based on\u00a0what they\u2019ve learned. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 23 Cape Breton-Victoria Regional\u00a0Centre\u00a0for Education in Nova Scotia, one of the first HEADSTRONG school boards, held its inaugural summit\u00a0in\u00a02014.

You want to know you are not alone and can overcome your struggles. You seek assurance that, with help, you can improve your mental health and lead a \u201cnormal\u201d life. Thankfully, within a Stepped\u00a0Care 2.0 system, people are provided with a variety of\u00a0care options to meet their own\u00a0needs.\u201d NWT resident who accessed\u00a0support Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 29 In March 2020, the NWT government began implementing SC2.0, in partnership with the Mental\u00a0Health Commission of Canada (MHCC), Stepped\u00a0Care Solutions and the NWT\u2019s Mental Wellness and Addictions Recovery Advisory Group. Through consultations with\u00a0the community, care providers, and administrators, the partners overhauled service delivery processes and transformed the system. This\u00a0work enabled the government to integrate SC2.0 into its Community Counselling Program and offer diverse care options while significantly reducing or eliminating\u00a0wait\u2011lists.\nSC2.0 comprises a series of increasingly intensive steps or levels of support and service. From a wide range of\u00a0available choices, individuals and families can make informed decisions about the care that best suits their needs and preferences. For instance, they can access relevant information anonymously, get support from an e-mental health app, join a support group, engage with cultural or land-based programs, or access one-on-one counselling, among other\u00a0options.\nThe Mental Wellness and Addictions Recovery Advisory Group includes residents from across the NWT. The\u00a0group helped co-design SC2.0 in the NWT and continues to provide advice and wisdom rooted in lived and living expertise with mental\u00a0wellness and substance use health.

[They] worked out the\u00a0time of\u00a0day and what worked for my life.\u201d NWT Community Counselling Program (CCP) user Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 31 \u201cIt was great to connect with people across the country who are also in recovery, so\u00a0that\u00a0you can relate to people who are maybe going through some of the same things you are. It certainly gives you an accountability to other people who are going through a very similar thing. It also helps you to stay connected. And such an important part of recovery is connection. I\u00a0would recommend the [Wagon] app \u2014 any way that we can help people to stay sober and stay in recovery is\u00a0a\u00a0positive thing for the territory.\u201d Natasha Kulikowski, Inuvik, Wagon app user (Edgewood Health Network) \u201cI look forward to my weekly session, not\u00a0only for\u00a0the chance to share in\u00a0a\u00a0safe space but to gain tools that further improve my sobriety journey and influence\u00a0the rest of my life.\u201d Wagon app user (Edgewood Health Network) Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 32 A Caregiver\u2019s Perspective \u201cStepped Care 2.0 is the way my practice has evolved naturally. It\u2019s a relief and validates how [we] already practised. It\u2019s so natural, it fits so well.\u201d NWT Community Counselling Program (CCP) service provider \u201cStepped Care 2.0 is ideal for youth because they\u2019re often not receptive to coming into an\u00a0office, and they want help when they need it. Early in my career, a young person seeking help had to go through a nurse or doctor. Now there\u2019s a wealth of readily accessible tools and strategies that can teach them how to regulate their feelings and anxieties.\u201d Nancy McInnis, Child and Youth Counsellor, Mental Health and Addictions Services, NWT Health and Social Services Authority-Beaufort Delta Region Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 33 Evaluation and next steps In 2023, a comprehensive evaluation consisting of service user surveys, reviews of focus-group sessions, and service provider reports found that SC2.0 had significantly increased access to services and produced positive outcomes for many service users and providers across the NWT. The evaluation also identified gaps, lessons learned, and areas for improvement to guide the way forward. For instance, it called for more community engagement and enhanced culturally safe programs to integrate Indigenous approaches to care and wellness, and greater efforts to deepen service user and provider understanding for improved access to quality care.\nTo access the full report, follow this link or go to mentalhealthcommission.ca/resource/ stepped\u2011care\u2011nwt/ The MHCC has also helped to implement SC2.0 in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island.

After all, to report on impact is not just looking at\u00a0past achievements. It is also a promise for the future: the\u00a0pact,\u00a0the commitment, and the hope. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 6 The ability to foster change in mental health is an ongoing commitment, for even when we achieve milestones we must be aware of emerging challenges. That is why the MHCC seeks to truly understand and engage with people who have lived and living experience of mental health and substance use health challenges. Not only are these experiences integrated into our research, planning, and outreach efforts. They make it possible to identify gaps in policy and services that provide our evidence-based research to inform change, training to reduce stigma, and programs to offer life-affirming hope. One example is Roots of Hope, a community-led initiative to reduce suicide rates whose impact is empowering communities and provinces across the country \u2014 most recently, the government of Manitoba.\nCanada is a vast country with many geographic, cultural, linguistic, and economic differences. But no matter what your status, you can be affected by mental health concerns. Just as we all have physical health, we all have mental health \u2014 and it\u2019s something that needs tending. Yet, because doing so can be difficult for many people, the MHCC is part of a global forum of mental health leaders who are tackling challenges related to virtual care implementation and its intersections with artificial intelligence. As critical questions emerge, so is the potential for virtual care to reduce mental health service wait times \u2014 something we saw this year in the Northwest Territories. An MHCC project, implemented in partnership with the territorial government and Stepped Care Solutions, led to a 79 per cent reduction in\u00a0wait times for mental health counselling in the region. The Stepped Care model allows individuals to access mental health services at level with the most effective impact. Each level can then be stepped up or down depending on progress and the nature of the concern. The reductions in wait times involved simplifying intake processes, introducing drop-in counselling sessions, and implementing e-mental health services.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 7 The MHCC is also changing the lives of Canadians and communities by increasing mental health literacy and improving access to quality mental health and substance use health supports. Since care needs to be culturally informed to do this well, the commission partnered with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) on a research and pilot program for culturally adapted cognitive behavioural therapy that is improving outcomes for Canadians of South Asian origin with anxiety and depression.\nIn addition, MHCC collaboration across numerous communities regarding the relationship between mental health and cannabis resulted in 40 community-based research projects. Six were led by Indigenous researchers, who provided perspectives on parental cannabis use and child welfare, cannabis retailers in Indigenous communities, and guidance on the interface of cannabis and traditional medicines.\nWe have also been collaborating with Indspire, a\u00a0cross-Canada Indigenous charity that invests in the education of First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis youth and young adults. This initiative focuses on mental health education and resources to support Indigenous students with Indspire\u2019s programs.\nWhile these are truly impactful programs, mental health stigma continues to be a significant issue. We know from work with our research partners that 95 per cent of people with a mental health or substance use disorder were impacted by stigma over the past five years, with the majority reporting feelings of self-stigma and internalizing negative stereotypes.\nThis finding underscores the critical importance of our evidence-based training programs, including those offered through Opening Minds to increase mental health literacy. Since the MHCC was established in 2007, we have trained more than a million people in these innovative evidence-based courses and plan to increase this number significantly.\nTogether, we are actively ensuring that we are equipped to advance policy and program objectives in a sustainable and meaningful manner while creatively increasing our impact. Work like this changes lives.Michel Rodrigue\u2019s signature.\nMichel Rodrigue President and CEOChuck Bruce\u2019s signature.\nChuck Bruce Board Chair Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 8 Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 9 Sporting Mindfulness More than 15,000 schoolchildren across Saskatchewan received mental health training thanks to a ground-breaking partnership between the Mental Health Commission of Canada and\u00a0a\u00a0professional football team. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 10Three female athletes celebrating.\nThe MHCC\u2019s alliance with the Saskatchewan Roughriders also led to a new version of The Working\u00a0Mind (TWM), an evidence-based program to promote mental health and reduce the stigma associated with mental\u00a0illness in the workplace.\n\u201cI\u2019ve long been aware of the mental health training developed and delivered by the MHCC,\u201d says Cindy\u00a0Fuchs, the foundation\u2019s executive director and a recognized leader in Saskatchewan\u2019s not-for-profit sector. \u201cWhen\u00a0I learned about plans to develop a version of TWM for the sports industry, I saw an opportunity for us to work together and serve the greater good.\u201d Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 11Three male athletes celebrating.\nThe Saskatchewan Roughrider Foundation, the charitable organization affiliated with the Canadian Football League team, has\u00a0been funding community-based education, health, and amateur sports projects for young people since it\u00a0was\u00a0established in 2019.\nDeveloped by clinicians and peers, TWM offers facilitated discussions that focus on work-related mental health topics. Since the MHCC launched TWM in 2013, it has developed a series of industry\u2011specific versions of the training by collaborating with a range of\u00a0partners. One of those versions is TWM\u00a0Sport, which was piloted through the foundation with the help of Saskatchewan Roughrider players and coaches, along with a handful of elite athletes in the\u00a0province. Feedback\u00a0from the pilot led to additional improvements to the program.\nDetermined to have more elite football players benefit from the training, the foundation paid to deliver TWM\u00a0Sport to two varsity teams and several junior and women\u2019s teams. To spread its benefits further, the\u00a0foundation also built on its long-standing partnership with the province\u2019s Ministry of Education. For years, the ministry and foundation have partnered on the Game Changers Playbook to give elementary and secondary students evidence-based, curriculum\u2011related mental health and wellness resources. Now, five Roughrider players trained in TWM Sport tour the province to talk about mental health with student groups through the foundation\u2019s Win\u00a0With\u00a0Wellness\u00a0Presentation Series.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 12A Saskatchewan Roughrider team member speaks to students seated at their desks.\n\u201cThe mind is the strongest muscle in your body,\u201d says\u00a0Brayden Lenius, a Saskatchewan Roughrider wide\u00a0receiver who participated in the pilot.\n\u201cYou can develop your mind to become stronger and more resilient. TWM Sport teaches you how to do that.\u201d \u201cLessons from TWM are for everyone \u2014 not just pro athletes,\u201d says Lenius. \u201cTelling schoolchildren about some of the mental health challenges I face, and\u00a0listening to their stories, helps me and helps them.\u201d Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 13 The MHCC continues to seek like-minded partners to expand and improve the effectiveness of programs like TWM. In\u00a0the end, everyone must recognize that mental health can be nurtured, that help is\u00a0available, and that recovery is expected. TWM Versions Besides different versions for employees and managers in\u00a0Canada, Australia, and the United States, TWM is available for\u00a0specific industry groups. These include: \u2022 First responders (fire,\u00a0police, paramedics, corrections\u00a0staff) \u2022 Post-secondary students \u2022 Health care \u2022 Legal \u2022 Oral health care \u2022 Sports By the Numbers More than 300,000 people have completed at\u00a0least one version of TWM.\nMore than 1,500 TWM facilitators have\u00a0been trained worldwide.\nMore and more Peer\u2011reviewed studies demonstrate the effectiveness of TWM.1 1 See, for example, Effects of the Anti-stigma Workplace Intervention \u201cWorking Mind\u201d in\u00a0a\u00a0Canadian Health-Care Setting: A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Immediate Versus Delayed Implementation and The Working Mind: A\u00a0Meta\u2011Analysis of a Workplace Mental\u00a0Health and Stigma Reduction Program.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 14 Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 15 Taking Root Engaging and empowering individuals and\u00a0communities in suicide prevention The Roots of Hope model builds on community expertise to implement suicide prevention and life promotion initiatives based on five pillars of action and 13 guiding principles.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 16Three adults planting a tree together.\nThe impact of Roots of Hope on individuals and communities continues to deepen. Its\u00a0success is based on sound evidence and an operating model that prioritizes collaboration and independence: Each Roots of Hope community is encouraged to develop and implement the initiatives \u2014 and establish the partnerships \u2014 it considers most appropriate. In many cases, they build on existing programs and services.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 17 \u201cGiving back to others through Roots\u00a0of\u00a0Hope has helped to save my life.\u201d \u201cThe launching of an eight-week support group for [suicide] attempt survivors provided a space for them to work through their struggles in a safe space. I went through the group myself and found it beneficial. I know that, as a lived experience person on the team, it has given me the opportunity to use my life experience for good and to make meaning out of what happened. My\u00a0friend Travis also went through the group last year and found it helpful. He unfortunately died by suicide recently, but I think the group bought him the better part of a year.\nI am very grateful that Roots of Hope exists. I am also grateful that the services we provide gave me more time with my friend. This is meaningful work, and I hope to be able to see it through. It\u2019s the only group of its kind in the area \u2014 and by area I\u2019m pretty sure I mean all of Western Canada. Lastly, the suicide prevention-related events that Stony Plain hosts always have good\u00a0turnouts, and I think the public is starting to be able to speak more openly about it.\u201d Wesley Jones Roots of Hope community Stony Plain, Alberta Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 18 \u201cWe are network of 65 volunteers trained in ground-based search and rescue. Many of the people we search for don\u2019t want to be found, usually because they are experiencing a mental\u2011health crisis. These now account for about 75 per cent of our searches. In many cases, the person is contemplating suicide, and time is of the essence. Partnering with Roots of Hope improves our ability to find and rescue people in crisis. The partnership also improves the mental health of our volunteers, who are now more resilient.\u201d Tina Brown Planning Section Chief Colchester Ground Search and Rescue Colchester County, Nova Scotia \u201cA big reason that members of the 2SLGBTQI+ community experience higher rates of both mental illness and suicide ideation is social stigma, particularly in rural and remote communities. Under our partnership with Roots of Hope, two members of the 2SLGBTQI+ community in each of Nova Scotia\u2019s four health-care zones have been trained to deliver SafeTALK suicide-prevention courses. Hundreds of at-risk people, along with their friends and families, will benefit. Roots of Hope is a catalyst \u2014 the extra ingredient that inspires tangible progress.\u201d Tyler Colbourne Executive Director Healthy Minds Cooperative Nova Scotia Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 19Two youths at a race.\nBy the Numbers 2019 eight communities 2021 11 more Today 18 communities, three provinces, and one territory Roots of Hope is based on\u00a0community expertise To increase the impact of their efforts, Roots of Hope community coalition forge partnerships with a variety of local organizations.

Informed by five years of research, and developed in collaboration with educators and students, HEADSTRONG uses a proven two\u2011step process: Students from multiple schools are initially brought together to attend a summit; afterwards,\u00a0groups of students in each school design and\u00a0implement a range of\u00a0activities and initiatives based on\u00a0what they\u2019ve learned. Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 23 Cape Breton-Victoria Regional\u00a0Centre\u00a0for Education in Nova Scotia, one of the first HEADSTRONG school boards, held its inaugural summit\u00a0in\u00a02014.

You want to know you are not alone and can overcome your struggles. You seek assurance that, with help, you can improve your mental health and lead a \u201cnormal\u201d life. Thankfully, within a Stepped\u00a0Care 2.0 system, people are provided with a variety of\u00a0care options to meet their own\u00a0needs.\u201d NWT resident who accessed\u00a0support Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 29 In March 2020, the NWT government began implementing SC2.0, in partnership with the Mental\u00a0Health Commission of Canada (MHCC), Stepped\u00a0Care Solutions and the NWT\u2019s Mental Wellness and Addictions Recovery Advisory Group. Through consultations with\u00a0the community, care providers, and administrators, the partners overhauled service delivery processes and transformed the system. This\u00a0work enabled the government to integrate SC2.0 into its Community Counselling Program and offer diverse care options while significantly reducing or eliminating\u00a0wait\u2011lists.\nSC2.0 comprises a series of increasingly intensive steps or levels of support and service. From a wide range of\u00a0available choices, individuals and families can make informed decisions about the care that best suits their needs and preferences. For instance, they can access relevant information anonymously, get support from an e-mental health app, join a support group, engage with cultural or land-based programs, or access one-on-one counselling, among other\u00a0options.\nThe Mental Wellness and Addictions Recovery Advisory Group includes residents from across the NWT. The\u00a0group helped co-design SC2.0 in the NWT and continues to provide advice and wisdom rooted in lived and living expertise with mental\u00a0wellness and substance use health. Under SC2.0, NWT residents can enjoy free access to several e-mental health services at the time most convenient to them.\n\u2022 Breathing Room\u2122 \u2014 self-guided support to help youth reduce stress, anxiety, and depression \u2022 Strongest Families Institute \u2014 coaching programs for children, youth, adults, and families experiencing mild-to-moderate mental health and\u00a0behavioural\u00a0concerns \u2022 Edgewood Health Network Wagon \u2014 addictions\u00a0recovery aftercare support Within SC2.0, the NWT also promotes and partners with\u00a0several other initiatives, including Wellness\u00a0Together Canada and the 7 Cups, Root\u2019d, and\u00a0Stronger Minds apps.\nMental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 30 \u201cThey were very understanding, good to\u00a0work with, and worked around my schedule.

It\u2019s so natural, it fits so well.\u201d NWT Community Counselling Program (CCP) service provider \u201cStepped Care 2.0 is ideal for youth because they\u2019re often not receptive to coming into an\u00a0office, and they want help when they need it. Early in my career, a young person seeking help had to go through a nurse or doctor. Now there\u2019s a wealth of readily accessible tools and strategies that can teach them how to regulate their feelings and anxieties.\u201d Nancy McInnis, Child and Youth Counsellor, Mental Health and Addictions Services, NWT Health and Social Services Authority-Beaufort Delta Region Mental Health Commission of Canada | 2022-2023 Impact Report 33 Evaluation and next steps In 2023, a comprehensive evaluation consisting of service user surveys, reviews of focus-group sessions, and service provider reports found that SC2.0 had significantly increased access to services and produced positive outcomes for many service users and providers across the NWT. The evaluation also identified gaps, lessons learned, and areas for improvement to guide the way forward. For instance, it called for more community engagement and enhanced culturally safe programs to integrate Indigenous approaches to care and wellness, and greater efforts to deepen service user and provider understanding for improved access to quality care.\nTo access the full report, follow this link or go to mentalhealthcommission.ca/resource/ stepped\u2011care\u2011nwt/ The MHCC has also helped to implement SC2.0 in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island.

So far this year, the United States has already experienced 25 weather and climate disasters that each resulted in more than a billion dollars of damages, costing hundreds of lives and more than $73 billion total. For some extreme weather events like Hurricane Idalia and the fires in Hawai\u2018i, the full cost is not yet completely known. Actions taken by President Biden through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS for America Act are helping Americans prepare for, and respond to extreme weather events, as well as a spectrum of other climate-related challenges.\nClimate disasters that occur in one region of the United States can have cascading or compounding effects in other regions. For example, wildfires in one region can worsen air quality and health in other regions. When hazards occur in different regions but at the same time, such as the simultaneous megafires that burned across multiple western states and record back-to-back Atlantic hurricanes in 2020, these compounding disasters can put unprecedented demand on federal emergency response resources. Climate change also interacts with other stressors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and social inequities, which can multiply harm and further increase demand for resources that are needed when responding to disasters. This is particularly true for overburdened communities. These interactions can lead to cascading impacts that cross state and national borders. For example, both gradual changes in average climate conditions (e.g., shifts in temperature and precipitation) and extreme events (e.g., floods, droughts, and wildfire) can shock the global food supply chain and lead to food insecurity, geopolitical instability, and mass migration. These cascading and compounding impacts affect people\u2019s well-being, our economy, and our national security.\nIn addition to federal action, state, local, Tribal, and territorial efforts to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions have expanded in every U.S. region. Many of these actions advance climate mitigation and adaptation at the same time. Effective climate action has prioritized equitable and inclusive planning processes to help ensure that affected communities can participate in decision-making. Across the country, mitigation and adaptation efforts that build upon community strengths and center local and Indigenous Knowledge systems improve resilience.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Fifth National Climate Assessment includes ten regional chapters that assess climate risks and describe challenges, opportunities, and success stories for managing those risks. In addition, the new NCA Atlas allows users to explore localized climate projections to inform climate resilience, adaptation, and mitigation efforts in their communities.\nClimate Change Impacts in Regions Across America\nNortheast \u2014 Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia\nThis region is experiencing increases in the frequency of extreme weather events and other climate-driven changes, including intense rainstorms, warmer ocean temperatures, and rapid sea level rise. For example, the amount of rain that falls during the heaviest downpours has increased by approximately 60% in the Northeast since the 1950s\u2014the largest increase in the United States. Many regional climate impacts, including extreme heat and flooding, disproportionately impact low-income communities and communities of color. The region is responding with mitigation and adaptation efforts, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative\u2014a market-based program aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions; eight state laws requiring emissions reductions of at least 80% by 2050; and new financing options, such as grants, loans, or tax assessments, that improve the capacity of households, communities, and businesses to build climate resilience. Cities, states, and Tribes are implementing climate action plans with innovative approaches that embrace inclusive and equitable processes. For example, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\u2019s Climate Action Plan was developed with multi-year civic engagement opportunities, focuses on benefits of climate action that improve equity, and tracks progress through annual reports. The city\u2019s 2022 stormwater code requires any new development that could affect stormwater runoff to plan for projected increases in heavy rainfall under climate change, rather than building to historical rainfall amounts. Read more in Chapter 21: Northeast.\nSoutheast \u2014 Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia\nThis region\u2019s growing population faces rising sea levels and increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves that lead to greater risks of wildfires. Climate stressors, including drought and extreme heat, are expected to disproportionately affect communities of color and low-income communities who struggle to afford energy bills, especially for air conditioning. Due to increasing energy demands and extreme weather events, there is a growing number of power outages in the region that affect more than 1,000 residents for longer than an hour. This is especially true during the warmer months that place some communities at a higher risk of heat exposure and heat-related illness due to a lack of access to air conditioning. While adaptation efforts tend to be concentrated in wealthier coastal and metropolitan areas, there have been notable advancements in climate actions throughout the region. Following repeated flooding from multiple hurricanes, measures to reduce flood risk in Princeville, North Carolina, include buyouts, elevating homes, and building housing that meets local flood standards. In Orlando, Florida, the city government and businesses are adopting commercial building energy efficiency requirements and a community-wide commitment to 100% renewable energy to advance the decarbonization of local buildings. As the largest rental car market in the world, the metropolitan area has also adopted new electric vehicle readiness policies. Read more in Chapter 22: Southeast.\nU.S. Caribbean \u2014 Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands\nWarmer air and ocean temperatures are leading to intense hurricanes and increasingly powerful storms. The number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes is projected to increase as the climate crisis worsens. In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused more than $2.3 billion in losses and damages to crops and infrastructure, which represented a reduction of about 80% of the main island\u2019s total agricultural value. Paired with rising sea levels and other climate changes, these impacts are harming human health\u2014particularly in underserved communities; degrading, disrupting, and undermining the functions of ecosystems, especially in coastal zones; and threatening the region\u2019s water and food security. Critical infrastructure in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands is at risk of flooding due to sea level rise and heavy rainfall. Changes in precipitation and extreme events are expected to increase outbreaks of disease and can also disrupt vital local services, such as health care and water quality management. Across the region, many community-based organizations have taken actions to advance adaptation, social transformation, and sustainable development. Effective adaptation to support resilience in the region could be enhanced by decentralization of energy and water systems, improved governance and funding, and stronger partnerships across the Caribbean region and the U.S. mainland. For example, decentralized household solar systems and rainwater harvesting improve resilience by providing power and water during interruptions to the centralized utility grid or public water system. Read more in Chapter 23: U.S. Caribbean.\nMidwest \u2014 Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Wisconsin\nThe Midwest is facing rising temperatures, drought, extreme precipitation, and other climate changes. These changes affect Midwestern ecosystems, agriculture, infrastructure, and human health, as well as livelihoods and cultural practices that rely on natural resources, including ice fishing or the harvesting of local plant species. Since 1980, the Midwest has incurred more than $49 billion in economic damages due to flooding. Although average corn and soybean yields have increased in recent decades, both flooding and extreme droughts significantly decreased corn yields in some locations and in some years by up to 37%. Over the past decade, clean energy production in the region has grown by more than 275% and has reduced carbon emissions from the energy sector. Communities, local and state governments, and businesses are embracing adaptation approaches that include green infrastructure, climate-smart agriculture, and collaboration with Tribes on land management issues to improve climate outcomes for all residents. For example, climate-smart agricultural approaches have the potential to increase production, improve resilience to climate-related risks, and yield additional benefits for Midwestern ecosystems. An innovative finance and construction approach being used by the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewer District has reduced the number of annual combined sewer overflow events over the last five years. Using a community-based public-private partnership, Milwaukee is now looking to add an additional 20 million gallons of green stormwater infrastructure capture capacity. Read more in Chapter 24: Midwest.\nNorthern Great Plains \u2014 Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming\nThe Northern Great Plains are experiencing unprecedented extremes, including severe droughts, floods, and wildfires. Climate change can affect floods along the Missouri River, like the ones in 2011 and 2019 that caused evacuations, costly damages, and interstate closures. With additional global warming, the region would expect to see some of the highest increases in annual flooding damage costs in the United States. At the same time, drought is projected to increase, with moderate to extreme droughts occurring as much as 20% more frequently by the end of the century. These changes threaten economic sectors, such as agriculture and recreation, and affect the mental and physical health of residents. The region\u2019s share of employees working in fossil fuel extraction is four times greater than in the nation as a whole. Shifts in energy demand, production, and policy will affect energy-related livelihoods for the region\u2019s residents, especially rural, Indigenous, and low-income immigrant populations, as opportunities in the clean energy field expand. Renewable energy production is on the rise in the Northern Great Plains, with the region supplying 12% of the total U.S. electricity generation from wind, biomass, and solar sources. In addition, the region is home to a number of Tribes who are leading the nation\u2019s clean energy transition by installing clean energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower. Read more in Chapter 25: Northern Great Plains.\nSouthern Great Plains \u2014 Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas\nIncreasing frequency and intensity of precipitation, warmer ocean temperatures, extreme heat, and rising sea levels are degrading the air, lands, and waters that people in the Southern Great Plains rely on for economic, recreational, and cultural activities. Annual precipitation has increased across most of the region, with Texas enduring its five wettest months on record between 2000 and 2021. By contrast, the region also experienced severe to exceptional drought for significant portions of the years between 2010 and 2022. Between 2018 and 2022, 52 individual billion-dollar climate-related disasters affected all or part of the region. By 2050, annual average temperatures are projected to exceed historical record levels in all three states. These impacts compound existing burdens on disadvantaged communities that have the fewest resources to prepare and adapt to climate change. Communities are adapting through nature-based solutions, reliance on Indigenous and local knowledge, and resilient infrastructure that enhances public health and the region\u2019s economy. In 2020, Oklahoma City produced its first sustainability plan to address climate change. Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas, Texas, adopted plans that included both mitigation and adaptation actions and have started to address local equity issues. Throughout the Southern Great Plains, a major shift in energy generation from fossil fuels toward renewables is underway, with the region accounting for 42% of national wind-generated electricity in 2022. This shift in the demand for clean energy is reducing emissions and creating new jobs and cleaner air in the region. Read more in Chapter 26: Southern Great Plains.\nNorthwest \u2014 Idaho, Oregon, Washington\nHigher temperatures are leading to declining snowpack, melting glaciers, and rising sea levels. These changes, combined with increasing risks of flooding, wildfires, and other climate hazards, threaten human health, ecosystems, infrastructure, and industries. For example, the record-breaking Pacific Northwest heatwave of June 2021 led to more than 1,400 heat-related deaths, a subsequent severe wildfire season, significant losses of economically important fishery species, and total damages exceeding $38.5 billion. Impacts on the Northwest\u2019s economy will have cascading effects on livelihoods and well-being of residents. For instance, snow-based recreational industries, such as skiing, have already lost revenue due to a decrease in snow days per calendar year. In parts of the Cascade Range, the snow season is projected to decrease by nearly half by the end of the century. In response to these changes, local governments, Tribes, labor unions, and community groups across the region are adopting policies and programs that support a just transition to a low-carbon future. State and local climate policies in the Northwest are prioritizing climate response strategies that recognize the importance of climate justice, such as subsidizing adaptation, redistributing benefits, and reducing harm to frontline communities. The Quinault Indian Nation is adapting to accelerated loss of land caused by sea level rise, flooding, and erosion along the central coast of Washington State by reacquiring fractionated land and relocating housing and key facilities from their traditional village site to a newly developed site at higher elevation. Read more in Chapter 27: Northwest.\nSouthwest \u2014 Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah\nClimate change is threatening water resources, increasing challenges to food and fiber production, and compromising human health in the Southwest through drought, wildfire, intense precipitation, sea level rise, and marine heatwaves. Since 2018, 31 climate- and weather-related disasters that have each resulted in more than a billion dollars in damages have affected the Southwest, resulting in more than 700 deaths and estimated damages totaling $67.3 billion. Climate-driven changes to infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries, and other economic sectors are impacting some communities disproportionately. These communities include farmers and ranchers, especially Hispanic, women, and migrant farmworkers; food-insecure households; Indigenous Peoples facing water access challenges; and coastal communities that are reliant on a declining population of traditional fish species. In response, state and local municipalities across the Southwest have implemented adaptive water governance and management approaches. After more than 22 years of historic drought, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation declared the first-ever water shortage on the Colorado River in August 2021. The federal governments of the United States and Mexico, the seven U.S. Colorado River basin states, and Indigenous Peoples are developing a range of adaptation pathways and solutions to enhance long-standing collaboration on the Colorado River, including modeling the impact of more extreme climate change scenarios on water resources in the basin. Efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are also being implemented throughout the region. For example, the Phoenix, Arizona Climate Action Plan states that the city is on track to meet its goal of 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Read more in Chapter 28: Southwest.\nAlaska\nAlaska is warming two to three times faster than the global average, with increases in annual average temperatures since 1971 as high as 6.2\u00b0F in northern Alaska. A 2019 summer heatwave brought record-high temperatures to southern and Interior Alaska, with daily high temperatures exceeding normal by more than 20\u00b0F. The Alaska snowfall season is projected to shorten and snowpack is projected to decrease significantly in the southern and western parts of the state. Warming temperatures, thawing permafrost, and other climate-related changes are damaging ecosystems, disrupting cultural practices, harming fisheries and other livelihoods, exacerbating health disparities, and placing critical infrastructure at risk. Many Alaskans, particularly Alaska Native Peoples, depend on natural resources and have a distinct connection to and understanding of the natural environment. While these communities foster self-reliance and resilience in light of a changing climate, geographical isolation and distance from health care and other services leave many people vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change. In recent years, Alaska has emerged as a leader of climate adaptation initiatives in the Arctic, many of which have been implemented by regional entities and municipal, community, and Tribal governments. For example, to address climate threats to traditional foods, the Chugach Regional Resources Commission, an inter-Tribal fish and wildlife commission in Alaska, is integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Western scientific methods in its adaptation efforts, including weekly water sampling for harmful algal blooms, kelp farming, and restoring clam populations. Community renewable energy initiatives like Thermalize Juneau and the Solarize initiatives in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Kenai, Mat-Su, and Palmer help residential and commercial property owners install solar capacity.

By 2050, fisheries catch are projected to decline by 40% compared to the early 2000s. These climate changes impair access to clean water and healthy food, undermine human health, threaten cultural resources and the built environment, exacerbate inequities, disrupt economic activity, and damage diverse ecosystems across the region. Strategies are being developed and implemented across the region to revitalize healthier traditional food systems, resulting in more just access to food. Subsistence-based food system practices have sustained Pacific Island peoples for millennia and have aided in recoveries from natural disasters such as typhoons and tsunamis. Other promising fisheries adaptations include establishing networks of marine protected areas to preserve coastal resources, safeguarding fish habitats from pollution runoff, and restoring traditional fishpond mariculture. To help mitigate climate change, the Kaua\u02bbi Island Utility Cooperative achieved a nearly 70% renewable portfolio standard in 2021, and the island is sometimes 100% renewably powered during midday hours. Meanwhile, U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands plan to use blue carbon ecosystems, including mangroves and seagrasses, to offset emissions while also protecting coastal infrastructure.

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites.\r\n                            \nIncome, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2023\nIncome, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2023\nSEPT. 10, 2024\u00a0\u2014 The U.S. Census Bureau today announced that real median household income increased by 4.0% between 2022 and 2023. This is the first statistically significant annual increase in real median household income since 2019. The official poverty rate fell 0.4 percentage points, to 11.1%, in 2023. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) rate in 2023 was 12.9%, an increase of 0.5 percentage points from 2022. Meanwhile, 92.0% of the U.S. population had health insurance coverage for all or part of 2023, not statistically different from 2022. An estimated 26.4 million or 8.0% of people did not have health insurance at any point during 2023, according to the 2024 Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC), also not statistically different from the previous year.\nThese findings come from three Census Bureau reports:\u00a0Income in the United States: 2023; Poverty in the United States: 2023; and\u00a0Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2023. While the official poverty measure is based on the concept of money income, which is pretax and does not include tax credits, the SPM is a post-tax and transfer poverty measure. The SPM provides an alternative way of measuring poverty in the United States and serves as an additional indicator of economic well-being. The Census Bureau has published poverty estimates using the SPM annually since 2011 in collaboration with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nFor consistency with past reports, the income estimates in the \u201cIncome in the United States: 2023\u201d report are based on the concept of money income. Appendix B of the income report provides post-tax estimates of median household income and income inequality metrics.\nAll three reports are based on data from the CPS ASEC. The\u00a0Current Population Survey\u00a0(CPS), sponsored jointly by the\u00a0Census Bureau\u00a0and\u00a0BLS, is conducted every month and is the primary source of labor force statistics for the U.S. population. It is used to calculate monthly unemployment rate estimates. Supplements are added in most months. The CPS ASEC \u2014 conducted in February, March and April \u2014 is designed to provide annual, national estimates of income, poverty and health insurance estimates, collecting information about job status, income and health insurance coverage during the prior calendar year.\nAlthough the 2024 ASEC was collected using standard procedures, response rates are still lower than they were before the pandemic. The response rate for the CPS basic household survey declined from 68.9% in March 2023 to 67.2% in March 2024.\nSince the response rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, which were regularly above 80%, it is important to examine how respondents differ from nonrespondents, as this difference could affect the accuracy of the estimates. For more details on how sample difference and the associated nonresponse bias impact income and official poverty estimates, refer to the Research Matters blog, \u201cUsing Administrative Data to Evaluate Nonresponse Bias in the 2024 Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement.\u201d\nIncome \nIncome estimates are based on the concept of money income and do not account for the value of in-kind transfers. They are pretax, unless otherwise indicated.\n\u00a0\nThe female-to-male earnings ratio compares the median earnings of women working full-time, year-round to the median earnings of men working full-time, year-round.\nPost-tax income is defined as money income net of federal and state taxes and credits, payroll taxes (FICA) and temporary cash payments administered by tax agencies like rebates or stimulus payments. Appendix B of the income report compares household median income and inequality measures based on post-tax income.\nPoverty\nAs defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Statistical Poverty Directive 14 and updated for inflation using the Consumer Price Index, the weighted average poverty threshold for a family of four in 2023 was $30,900 (Refer to <www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html> for the complete set of dollar value thresholds that vary by family size and composition).\u00a0\nThe SPM extends the official poverty measure by accounting for several government programs that are designed to assist low-income families but are not included in official poverty measure calculations. The SPM also accounts for geographic variation in housing expenses when calculating the poverty thresholds and includes federal and state taxes, work expenses, and medical expenses. The SPM does not replace the official poverty measure; however, it does provide a different metric of economic well-being that includes resources from government programs and tax credits to low-income families.\nHealth Insurance\nThe CPS ASEC asks people about health insurance coverage during the previous calendar year. People are considered insured if they were covered by any type of health insurance for part or all of the previous calendar year. People are considered uninsured if, for the entire year, they were not covered by any type of insurance. Among the findings:\nRegional estimates are available for income, poverty and health insurance coverage in each respective report. Tables showing state-level poverty and SPM rates using three-year averages are available in the press kit.\nThe CPS ASEC is subject to sampling and nonsampling errors. All comparisons made here and in each respective report have been tested and found to be statistically significant at the 90% confidence level, unless otherwise noted.\nAdditional information on the source of the data and accuracy of the income, poverty and health insurance estimates is available at <https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/techdocs/cpsmar24.pdf>.\n\n###\nShare\nContact\nPatricia Ramos\nPublic Information Office\n301-763-3030 or\n877-861-2010 (U.S. and Canada only)\npio@census.gov\nTop\nReceive Updates\nTo sign up for updates please enter your email address.\nStay Current\nAmerica Counts\nDirector\u2019s Blog\nDeputy Director\u2019s Blog\nRandom Samplings\nResearch Matters\nStay Connected\nContact\nSupport\nJobs\nFollow\nMeasuring America's People, Places, and Economy\n",

This ratio compares family income to a poverty threshold based on the age and number of family members.\nPeople are classified as being in poverty if their family income is less than the poverty threshold. Family resources may determine the ability to afford private health insurance, and families below certain thresholds may qualify for public health insurance, such as Medicaid.\nAge may also factor into individuals\u2019 access to health insurance coverage and type.\nChildren under age 19 may have health coverage through a variety of sources, including a parent\u2019s private plan or public programs like Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\nAdults ages 19 to 64 generally have lower coverage rates than those under age 19 and adults age 65 and older. That\u2019s because their coverage is often directly tied to employment. They do not qualify for programs intended for children and only qualify for public programs under specific medical or income-level circumstances.\nHealth Insurance Coverage by Age and Income-to-Poverty Ratio\nFrom 2020 to 2023, the share of children under 19 and working-age adults ages 19 to 64 with health coverage differed depending on income and poverty levels.\nAmong those who lived below the poverty level:\n\nMost children under 19 and working-age adults had public insurance. In each year, over three-quarters of children under 19 and about half of working-age adults in poverty had public coverage.\nThe uninsured rate of children under 19 in poverty ranged from 8.3% to 10.3% between 2020 and 2023.\nAbout a quarter of working-age adults in poverty were uninsured each year between 2020 and 2023.\n\n\n\nAmong those living in families with incomes between 100% and 399% of poverty thresholds:\n\nMore than half of children under 19 and working-age adults had private insurance.\nThe percentage of children under 19 with public insurance rose from 42.3% in 2020 to 45% in 2023.\nAbout a quarter of working-age adults had public insurance from 2020 to 2023.\nThe uninsured rate among children under 19 dipped between 2020 and 2022 from 7.0% to 6.1% and was 6.7% in 2023.\nThe uninsured rate for working-age adults fell from 17.3% in 2020 to 15.2% in 2022, increasing to 16.1% in 2023.\n\n\n\nAmong those in families with incomes in the highest income-to-poverty ratio group (at or above 400% of poverty):\n\nOver 90% of children under 19 and working-age adults had private insurance.\nThe share of children under 19 with public insurance rose from 5.9% in 2020 to 6.8% in 2023.\nThe share of working-age adults with public insurance rose from 5.2% in 2020 to 6% in 2023 while their uninsured rate fell from 4.5% to 4% during this period.\n\n\n\nDefinitions and more information on confidentiality protection and sampling and nonsampling error are available in the\u00a0technical documentation.\nAll comparative statements in this article have undergone statistical testing and, unless otherwise noted, are statistically significant at the 10% significance level.\nLisa Bunch and Halelujha Ketema are survey statisticians and Katherine Keisler-Starkey is an economist in the Census Bureau\u2019s Health and Disability Statistics Branch.\nThis article was filed under:\nAge\nData Equity\nHealth\nHealth Insurance\nIncome and Poverty\nPopulation\nRelated Statistics\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts Story America Counts: Stories about Health Insurance Stories featured behind the numbers for Health Insurance.\n\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts: Stories about Income & Poverty\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS) The CPS is a monthly survey sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts Story Data Equity Stories We feature stories on various topics such as families, housing, employment, business, education, the economy, emergency management, and population.\n\n\n\nSubscribe\nOur email newsletter is sent out on the day we publish a story.

This ratio compares family income to a poverty threshold based on the age and number of family members.\nPeople are classified as being in poverty if their family income is less than the poverty threshold. Family resources may determine the ability to afford private health insurance, and families below certain thresholds may qualify for public health insurance, such as Medicaid.\nAge may also factor into individuals\u2019 access to health insurance coverage and type.\nChildren under age 19 may have health coverage through a variety of sources, including a parent\u2019s private plan or public programs like Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\nAdults ages 19 to 64 generally have lower coverage rates than those under age 19 and adults age 65 and older. That\u2019s because their coverage is often directly tied to employment. They do not qualify for programs intended for children and only qualify for public programs under specific medical or income-level circumstances.\nHealth Insurance Coverage by Age and Income-to-Poverty Ratio\nFrom 2020 to 2023, the share of children under 19 and working-age adults ages 19 to 64 with health coverage differed depending on income and poverty levels.\nAmong those who lived below the poverty level:\n\nMost children under 19 and working-age adults had public insurance. In each year, over three-quarters of children under 19 and about half of working-age adults in poverty had public coverage.\nThe uninsured rate of children under 19 in poverty ranged from 8.3% to 10.3% between 2020 and 2023.\nAbout a quarter of working-age adults in poverty were uninsured each year between 2020 and 2023.\n\n\n\nAmong those living in families with incomes between 100% and 399% of poverty thresholds:\n\nMore than half of children under 19 and working-age adults had private insurance.\nThe percentage of children under 19 with public insurance rose from 42.3% in 2020 to 45% in 2023.\nAbout a quarter of working-age adults had public insurance from 2020 to 2023.\nThe uninsured rate among children under 19 dipped between 2020 and 2022 from 7.0% to 6.1% and was 6.7% in 2023.\nThe uninsured rate for working-age adults fell from 17.3% in 2020 to 15.2% in 2022, increasing to 16.1% in 2023.\n\n\n\nAmong those in families with incomes in the highest income-to-poverty ratio group (at or above 400% of poverty):\n\nOver 90% of children under 19 and working-age adults had private insurance.\nThe share of children under 19 with public insurance rose from 5.9% in 2020 to 6.8% in 2023.\nThe share of working-age adults with public insurance rose from 5.2% in 2020 to 6% in 2023 while their uninsured rate fell from 4.5% to 4% during this period.\n\n\n\nDefinitions and more information on confidentiality protection and sampling and nonsampling error are available in the\u00a0technical documentation.\nAll comparative statements in this article have undergone statistical testing and, unless otherwise noted, are statistically significant at the 10% significance level.\nLisa Bunch and Halelujha Ketema are survey statisticians and Katherine Keisler-Starkey is an economist in the Census Bureau\u2019s Health and Disability Statistics Branch.\nThis article was filed under:\nAge\nData Equity\nHealth\nHealth Insurance\nIncome and Poverty\nPopulation\nRelated Statistics\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts Story America Counts: Stories about Health Insurance Stories featured behind the numbers for Health Insurance.\n\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts: Stories about Income & Poverty\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS) The CPS is a monthly survey sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\n\n\nAmerica Counts Story Data Equity Stories We feature stories on various topics such as families, housing, employment, business, education, the economy, emergency management, and population.\n\n\n\nSubscribe\nOur email newsletter is sent out on the day we publish a story.

      "August 2024 DATA POINT 1 HP-2024-17 National Uninsured Rate at 8.2 Percent in the First Quarter of 2024 Newly released data from the National Health Interview Survey indicate a statistically insignificant change in the uninsured rate for the first quarter of 2024. KEY POINTS \u2022 According to newly released data from the National Health Interview Survey, in Q1 2024 the national uninsured rate for all ages was 8.2 percent, which corresponds to 27.1 million individuals. \u2022 Quarter-to-quarter changes in the national uninsured rate since the first quarter of 2023 are not statistically significant. The Q1 2024 rate is 1.5 percentage points lower than the uninsured rate for 2020, a difference which is statistically significant. \u2022 An estimated 11.5 percent of adults ages 18-64 were uninsured in Q1 2024. This rate is slightly higher than the rate for 2023, but 3 percentage points lower than the rate as of Q4 2020. \u2022 The uninsured rate for children has varied less over time. In Q1 2024, 5.2 percent of children under age 18 were uninsured, again slightly higher than the rate for 2023, but 1.2 percentage points lower than the rate as of Q4 2020. \u2022 Between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024, the percentage of adults ages 18-64 with private coverage increased by nearly 3 percentage points. This change was driven by a significant increase exchange-based private coverage. The estimated number of non-elderly adults with exchange-based coverage went up by over 4 million. \u2022 The percentage of children reporting private coverage was slightly lower in Q1 2024 compared to a year prior, though the difference was not statistically significant. \u2022 Between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024, the percentage of non-elderly adults with public coverage decreased by 3.4 percentage points. The percentage of children with public coverage declined by 2.7 percentage points over that period. INTRODUCTION This Data Point is part of a series of briefs that report on changes in health insurance coverage using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The most recent data are for the first quarter (Q1) of 2024. The data reflect changes in coverage during the first year of states returning to regular eligibility renewals in Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as well as record increases in enrollment in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Marketplaces.1 In Q1 2024, the estimated uninsured rate for the full population is 8.2 percent, which corresponds to 27.1 million individuals without insurance. This rate is not significantly different from the Q4 2023 uninsured rate of 7.7 percent. The estimates imply that in early 2024 as in 2023, over 300 million Americans have health insurance coverage. August 2024 DATA POINT 2 METHODS The NHIS, which is administered by the National Center for Health Statistics, is the largest nationally representative survey focused primarily on the health of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. As such, it is a key data source for tracking trends in health coverage. Quarterly estimates are from the NHIS Early Release program, which provides national estimates for broad categories of health coverage: public, private, and uninsured.2 For these coverage measures, estimates are reported for subpopulations defined by age, race/ethnicity and family income. In addition, the Early Release program provides quarterly estimates of the percentage of adults ages 18 to 64 with private, exchange-based (i.e., Marketplace) health plan coverage. The sample sizes for the quarterly data are relatively small: roughly 8,000 observations per quarter for adults and roughly 2,000 observations per quarter for children. As a result, quarterly estimates have wider confidence intervals than annual estimates. All estimates are unadjusted percentages based on preliminary data files and are released prior to final data editing and final weighting. FINDINGS To provide historical context, we begin by presenting long run trends in health coverage. Figure 1 presents the uninsured rate for the total U.S. population since 2000. Each data point from 2000 to 2023 represents an annual estimate from the NHIS. The last data point represents the quarterly estimate for Q1 2024. In 2000, just under 15 percent of the population was uninsured and by 2010, the year that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted, the uninsured rate had increased to 16 percent. The uninsured rate began to fall after the ACA\u2019s coverage provision went into effect. The first provision, which went into effect in September 2010, allows young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until age 26. Two other ACA coverage provisions\u2014the expansion of Medicaid eligibility and private insurance reforms, including tax credits for the purchase of private coverage through the newly established Marketplaces\u2014went into effect in January 2014. By 2015, the uninsured rate had declined to 9.1 percent. The uninsured rate stayed at that level through 2017 before increasing slightly the next two years. In 2019, 10.3 percent of the total U.S. population, or 33.2 million people, was uninsured.a Three pieces of legislation aimed to stabilize health coverage in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) provided states additional federal financial support if they met certain conditions, including agreeing to maintain the enrollment of most Medicaid beneficiaries. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) increased Marketplace premium tax credits for individuals and families with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the FPL and extended eligibility for premium tax credits to those with income above 400 percent of the FPL. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) renewed these Marketplace tax credit enhancements through 2025. In addition to these legislative efforts, the Biden-Harris Administration took administrative actions to improve access to health coverage, including creating special enrollment periods for Marketplace coverage and increasing funding for education and outreach.3 At the state level, since 2020 seven states (UT, ID, NE, OK, MO, SD, and NC) have implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion. The uninsured rate fell after these policies went into effect. The annual rates were 9.7 percent in 2020, 9.2 percent in 2021, 8.4 percent in 2022, and 7.6 percent in 2023. The uninsured rate for Q1 2024 is 8.2 percent, _______________________ a The NHIS underwent a survey redesign in 2019. Though the questions on health coverage did not change, the questionnaire design and sample weighting were revised. An analysis conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics concluded that the redesign may have caused the uninsured rate for adults to increase by 0.7 percentage points. For further details, see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/EReval202009-508.pdf. August 2024 DATA POINT 3 which corresponds to 27.1 million people. The estimated uninsured rate for Q1 2024 is not significantly different from the full-year estimate for 2023 or the quarterly estimate for Q4 2023 (7.7 percent).4 Figure 1.

The FFCRA\u2019s additional federal financial support for maintaining enrollment of most Medicaid beneficiaries went into effect retroactively on January 1, 2020 and the Consolidated Appropriation Act (CAA) of 2023 phased out the increase over three quarters, starting on March 31, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2023. The ARP premium tax credit provisions were effective for PY2021 and PY2022, and the IRA extended these provisions for PY2023 through PY2025. Beginning in 2004, two additional questions were added to the NHIS insurance section to reduce potential errors in reporting Medicare and Medicaid status, resulting in two methods to estimate uninsurance. Beginning in 2005, all estimates were calculated using Method 2. Please see \u201cTechnical Notes\u201d for the Early Release of Health Insurance Estimates Based on Data From the 2010 National Health Interview Survey for more information. To focus on recent trends, Figure 2 presents quarterly data on health coverage from Q1 2020 to Q1 2024. Data are reported separately for non-elderly adults (ages 18 to 64) and children (ages 0 to 17). The graph for adults indicates a gradual decline in the uninsured rate from Q4 2020 to Q2 2023, followed by a slight increase since then. The Q1 2024 uninsured rate for non-elderly adults is 0.5 percentage points higher than the rate for Q4 2023 and 3 percentage points lower than the rate from Q4 2020. For children, there is less evidence of a trend over the full period. The most recent quarterly data indicate that 5.2 percent of children are uninsured, up from 4.3 percent in Q4 2023. For both adults and children, the change between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 is not statistically significant.

For adults, there appears to be a clear downward trend since Q2 2023, when states began to return to regular Medicaid renewal operations following the end of the Medicaid continuous enrollment condition on March 31, 2023. Between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024, the percentage of non-elderly adults with private coverage declined by over 3 percentage points, from 24.8 percent to 21.4 percent. This difference is statistically significant. Even with this recent decrease, the Q1 2024 public coverage rate for adults remains above the rate as of Q1 2020 (20.3 percent). The percentage of children with public coverage was stable throughout 2023 before decreasing from 44.6 percent in Q4 2023 to 42.4 percent in Q1 2024. There is substantial overlap in the 95 percent confidence intervals of these two estimates, indicating that this change is not statistically significant at the 5 percent confidence level. 13.9% 11.5% 4.8% 5.2% 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 18-64 years 0-17 years August 2024 DATA POINT 5 Figure 3.

Between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024, the percentage of non-elderly adults with private coverage increased by 1.5 percentage points, from 67.1 percent to 68.6 percent. Comparing this to the results from Figure 3 implies that 44 percent of the decline in public insurance observed over this period was offset by an increase in private coverage (1.5/3.4 = 0.44). The increase in private coverage was driven by an increase in exchange-based private coverage (Figure 5). Between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024, the percentage of 18 to 64-year-olds with exchange-based coverage increased by 2.2 percentage points. Based on an estimated 200 million adults in this age range, this translates to an increase of over 4 million people. Similar to adults, for children public coverage decreased and private coverage increased between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024. The magnitude of the private coverage increase was slightly more than one-quarter the absolute magnitude of the public coverage decrease (0.7/2.7 = 0.26). In Q1 2024, 42.4 percent of children had public coverage and 54.2 percent had private coverage. For all individuals under age 65, private coverage increased by 1.3 percentage points between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024 (data not shown). 20.3% 22.0% 21.4% 40.9% 45.6% 42.4% 0.0% 5.0% 10.0% 15.0% 20.0% 25.0% 30.0% 35.0% 40.0% 45.0% 50.0% Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 18-64 years 0-17 years August 2024 DATA POINT 6 Figure 4.

Since Q2 2023, the uninsured rate for the lower two income groups appears to be trending up (Figure 6), corresponding to a similar decrease in public coverage (Figure 7). The percentage of adults with private coverage increased between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024 for the lowest income group, but not for 100-199 FPL category (Figure 8). The Q1 2024 uninsured rate for the higher two income categories was essentially the same as in Q2 2023. 67.9% 66.1% 68.6% 56.2% 52.0% 54.2% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 18-64 years 0-17 years 4.5% 5.1% 5.0% 7.2% 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 August 2024 DATA POINT 7 Figure 6.

These estimates are presented in Appendix Tables A1-A3. Throughout the time period reported in these figures, Hispanic adults were most likely to be uninsured than Blacks, who were more likely to be uninsured than Whites and Asians. Because of small samples, these estimates are noisy, making it difficult to assess short-run trends. Other ASPE research that tracks coverage over a longer period finds that these coverage disparities are significantly smaller than they were prior to the ACA coverage expansions.5,6,7 DISCUSSION On March 31, 2023, the continuous enrollment condition established by the FFCRA ended. In the following months, states began to resume regular Medicaid renewal and redetermination operations, a process commonly referred to as Medicaid \u201cunwinding.\u201d States varied in when they began this process; most began some time in Q2 2023, and all had begun by the end of 2023. Between March 2023 and April 2024, Medicaid enrollment had decreased by 12 million.8 The NHIS data presented in this Data Point cover a full year of the unwinding process. It is difficult to compare the NHIS estimates to the administrative enrollment data, for several reasons. One is the well-known finding that Medicaid enrollment is undercounted in national surveys and this undercount has grown in recent years.9,10,11,12 In addition, there are complications related to timing. Some people may not realize that they no longer have Medicaid until they go to use care, which may be some time after they were formally disenrolled. The results reported here are consistent with such a lag. For example, the percent of NHIS respondents reporting that they had public coverage actually increased between Q1 and Q2 2023, even as administrative data was showing a decrease in enrollment. Additionally, between Q2 and Q4 2023, the administrative data indicate that Medicaid/CHIP enrollment for children fell by nearly 3 million, yet in the NHIS public coverage for children was essentially unchanged. The most recent NHIS data reported in this Data Point indicate a larger decline in public coverage for children from Q3 2023 to Q1 2024, albeit one that is not statistically significant 23.4% 21.1% 27.8% 38.8% 39.2% 40.8% 71.4% 67.1% 70.5% 89.8% 90.9% 90.9% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 2022 2023 2024 <100% FPL 100-199% FPL 200-400% FPL >400% FPL August 2024 DATA POINT 9 due to the small quarterly samples. Over this most recent period, the decline in Medicaid/CHIP enrollment has slowed considerably. In fact, child enrollment was marginally higher in March 2024 than in December 2023.13 Abstracting from these issues of timing, comparing the decline in Medicaid enrollment to the much smaller increase in the estimated number of uninsured in the NHIS suggest that the majority of people who left Medicaid during the first year of the unwinding period have transitioned to other sources of coverage. This finding is consistent with analyses conducted prior to the end of the continuous enrollment condition, which projected that when the unwinding process was complete, between 60 and 80 percent of individuals leaving Medicaid would gain some other source of coverage. 14,15,16,17 This research also projects that the majority of individuals becoming uninsured to be eligible for either employer-sponsored insurance, subsidized Marketplace coverage, or Medicaid/CHIP. To facilitate smooth transitions between Medicaid and private insurance coverage, the Biden-Harris Administration established a Marketplace Special Enrollment Period (SEP) on HealthCare.gov for qualified individuals and their families losing Medicaid or CHIP coverage due to the end of the Medicaid continuous enrollment condition. State-based Marketplaces adopted similar SEP flexibilities. The Administration also continued to invest heavily in Marketplace outreach and consumer education, providing $99 million in grants to Marketplace Navigators in 2023.1 These efforts contributed to record Marketplace enrollment of over 21 million people.18 The increase in Marketplace enrollment is evident in the most recent NHIS data. Efforts taken to streamline Medicaid renewals during the unwinding period, such as using data from other programs to verify financial eligibility and renew people automatically\u2014a process referred to as ex parte renewals\u2014have helped eligible people remain enrolled and have limited coverage losses. Between April 2023 and March 2024, ex parte renewal rates increased by 80 percent, while the percentage of individuals disenrolled for procedural reasons fell roughly in half.19 Continuing such approaches should contribute to greater coverage stability in the longer term. In addition, as a result of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, most children newly enrolling or renewing their Medicaid or CHIP coverage after January 1, 2024, are guaranteed 12 months of continuous eligibility. A recent ASPE report estimated that more than 17 million Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children will potentially benefit from this policy.20 CONCLUSION This Data Point presents trends in health coverage through Q1 2024 based on data from the NHIS Early Release Program. Previous reports documented that the percentage of Americans without health insurance decreased by roughly 2 percentage points between 2020 and 2023.21 The most recent data indicate that between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, the uninsured rate increased by a statistically insignificant 0.5 percentage points to 8.2 percent. This estimate implies that 27.1 million people lacked health coverage in Q1 2024. The data reported here reflect changes in coverage during the first four quarters of states of states returning to regular Medicaid redetermination and renewal operations. It remains to be seen if the effects of this process and recent coverage policies have been fully captured in the NHIS data. ASPE will continue to monitor quarterly NHIS data to assess ongoing changes in coverage. August 2024 DATA POINT 10 APPENDIX Appendix Figure A1.

Savings of \u20ac3.5 billion\nThe government plans to save billions across the healthcare sector, including \u20ac600 million on hospital spending, \u20ac1.3 billion on healthcare products and medicine prices, \u20ac300 million on outpatient care (particularly on analysis laboratories), and \u20ac1.25 billion on \u2018making professionals and patients more responsible\u2019, or \u2018self-sufficient\u2019.\nDespite this, however, health insurance expenditure is still set to represent 8.7% of GDP in 2024, compared with 8.2% before the Covid-19 health crisis.\n2. More measures against social security fraud\nAlso on the government\u2019s list is the \u2018under-declaration\u2019 of turnover by micro-entrepreneurs employed by digital platforms.\nThis is estimated to equal a loss of revenue of \u20ac800 million. By 2027 platforms will be required to deduct these contributions directly, the government has said. The bill will also introduce the offences of 00\u2018incitement to social fraud\u2019 as well as the \u2018promotion and facilitation of fraud\u2019.\n3. Single-pill dispensing in the event of shortages\nIn the event that a medicine is in short supply, pharmacists may be required to dispense single-dose, or specific tablet quantities, of a medicine. Pharmacists will have to dispense \u2018the appropriate quantity\u2019 according to the patient's prescription, rather than a whole box.\nThe government may also make it compulsory to carry out a test rapide d'orientation diagnostique (TROD, rapid diagnostic test) when dispensing certain antibiotics, to ensure that antibiotics are only prescribed when appropriate.\nOn the other hand, testing will also mean that pharmacists will be able to check for issues such as strep throat and cystitis, and dispense antibiotics for these conditions without a doctor's prescription.\nRead more: Shortages of 4,000 medicines in France; what risk for this winter?\n4. Tighter controls on sick leave\nTighter rules on sick leave will mean that companies will have the power to appoint their own examining doctor, who will be authorised to suspend the payment of benefits to the patient on sick leave if they consider the absence to be unjustified. The Assurance maladie may also carry out a second examination.\nSick leave signed off via teleconsultation (video call) will be limited to three days at a time, except for those prescribed by the company\u2019s own appointed doctor.\nRead more: Doctors under fire over number of sick days they grant French workers\n5. \u2018Temporary status\u2019 for therapeutic cannabis\nTherapeutic cannabis - cannabis that is used to help treat health conditions, such as chronic pain - has been granted \u2018temporary status\u2019 for five years, pending a decision from European authorities on its marketing authorisation.\nSome European countries have already authorised medical cannabis to calm pain and anxiety for some patients. However, it was previously only authorised in France as part of an experiment, which had been due to end on March 26, 2024.\nRead more: Medical cannabis gets go-ahead for pain relief in French hospitals\n6. More widespread use of shared medical transport\nThe new bill states that patients who refuse to share a health transport service (light medical vehicle or approved taxi) with another patient without a valid medical reason will have to pay in advance.\nThey will also only be reimbursed on the basis of the price of shared transport, rather than a solo service.\n7. Different sources of hospital funding\nThe new budget is set to introduce two new funding methods for hospitals. One will be based on \u2018public health objectives\u2019 and the other on \u2018specific missions\u2019 (not yet revealed).\nThis reform will not begin to apply in full until January 1, 2025.\n8. Reimbursed physical activity sessions for cancer patients\nCancer patients will benefit from reimbursed physical activity sessions to help support their treatment journey. The scheme will initially be trialled for two years, on an experimental basis.\n9. Menstrual underwear and cups reimbursed\nReusable sanitary protection (menstrual pants and menstrual cups) will now be reimbursed for women under the age of 26, and all women covered by the Compl\u00e9mentaire sant\u00e9 solidaire scheme.\nCondoms will also be free for all insured persons under the age of 26.\n10. Systematic screening for pregnant women\nPregnant women will now be systematically screened for cytomegalovirus (CMV).This is a virus that can affect foetal development.\nIn addition, a three-year trial of a care pathway dedicated to post-partum depression - a serious condition that can range from \u2018baby blues\u2019 to severe psychosis - has also been added.\nRelated articles\nFrance\u2019s 2024 budget plans for healthcare: What could change for you?\nMore tax on alcohol, sick pay: what will France\u2019s 2024 budget change?\nWill sports sessions be reimbursable throughout France?\n\n\n\ngovernment funding\ngovernment\nfrench news\nbudget\nparliament\nhealth\n\nRunners join Nice-Cannes Marathon to fund English-language cancer support services in Alpes-Maritimes \nWet, overcast and blustery weather is forecast for most of the country\nThe door, window and joinery chain has gone into administration and cannot fulfil orders or reimburse customers\nMarathon effort boosts cancer support in France\n\n\n    Runners join Nice-Cannes Marathon to fund English-language cancer support services in Alpes-Maritimes \n\nLetters: French GP is charging more than he should for consultation\n\n\n    Connexion reader says her doctor is already asking for \u20ac30 per visit\n\n\nFrench winter warmer recipes: Boeuf bourguignon \n\n\n    This delicious beef stew braised in red wine is a standard of Parisian bistros\n\nSmartphone SOS alert saves driver's life in France after crash\n\n\n    Crash Detection system is triggered by violent movement and sends message to emergency services\n\nRevered French national icon falls from grace\n\n\n    Celebrated anti-poverty and homelessness campaigner Abb\u00e9 Pierre was voted France\u2019s most popular person for many years, but sexual abuse accusations have shattered the activist priest\u2019s crusading legacy\n\nEU faces legal challenge from French lawyer over weedkiller sale decision\n\n\n    Corinne Lepage fighting decision to allow glyphosate to be sold in Europe for another 10 years\n\nFrance's first national park is an outdoor haven\n\n\n    Discover the breathtaking landscapes and rich biodiversity of Parc National de la Vanoise, in the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region\n\nImprove your language skills with these five French tongue twisters\n\n\n    As well as being a fun party trick, these can help you master pronunciation of difficult sounds\n\nChild health booklets in France will be updated to include risks of screen time\n\n\n    Report by experts recommends banning screens for children under the age of three\n\nHow many bank holidays does France get vs Europe and US?\n\n\n    See how France compares as MPs debate taking away one of the country\u2019s jours f\u00e9ri\u00e9s\n\nBeaujolais Nouveau: France\u2019s youngest, freshest and fruitiest wine\n\n\n    Producer Laurent Metge-Toppin shares ten facts to help you appreciate the once-maligned tipple\n\n\nMany French hospitals trial fingertip test for heart disease\n\n\n    Test takes 15 minutes and can detect early signs of the disease\n\nSNCF train tickets open for early 2025 bookings\n\n\n    International destinations and skiing stations within France are included in the seats now available\n\nIgnoring this increasingly common French road sign could cost you \u20ac135\n\n\n    New driving rule relates to areas designated a zone \u00e0 trafic limit\u00e9\n\nFrench farmer protests: what action is planned and where on November 18?\n\n\n    Major unions are demonstrating against the Mercosur trade deal in a bid to pressure the government to provide more support\n\nFrance\u2019s 2025 budget will \u2018probably\u2019 be forced through without vote, says PM\n\n\n    Right-wing MPs rejected taxation section of the budget earlier this week\n\n\nFrench study tests psychedelics in alcoholism therapy\n\n\n    A groundbreaking experiment explores how psilocybin can be used to combat depressive symptoms in alcohol recovery\n\nHow your pet can be a blood donor in France\n\n\n    Veterinary hospitals say it is crucial to treat sick cats and dogs and it is easy to sign up your pet\n\nLetters: French cycling rules are rarely enforced\n\n\n    Connexion reader says he takes special precautions to stay safe\n\nStrepsils, Olbas Oil, TCP: Find French equivalents to common remedies\n\n\n    Moving to France means navigating pharmacies and hunting down alternatives to treat everyday ailments\n\nBriton applies for French residency card and finds he was adopted -

There will also be changes to some medical fees.\nHere is a list of the key changes to expect in the coming year:\nFranchises m\u00e9dicales\nThe franchise m\u00e9dicale, the obligatory fee which is not reimbursed (or refunded by mutuelles) on the purchase of prescription drugs and certain paramedical services (nurses, physiotherapists, speech therapists, podiatrists\u2026) could increase from 50 cents to \u20ac1 from January.\nIn December, Finance Minister Bruno le Maire confirmed the change but did not give a launch date. No further information has been given.\nThe franchise on medical transport costs could also increase from \u20ac2 to \u20ac4. However, an annual limit of \u20ac50 for prescription medicine and paramedical franchises will remain in place.\nRead more: Obligatory fee not reimbursed on medicines in France to double\nMedical buses\nThere are already 10 \u2018m\u00e9dicobus\u2019 services in operation \u2013 buses carrying everything onboard to provide a \u2018doctor\u2019s surgery\u2019 service.\nThe government aims for about 30 in early 2024 and 100 by the end of the year.\nAd\nDigital services\nA nationwide rollout of a digital version of the carte Vitale is due to be launched this year at an unspecified date.\nCurrently a \u2018carte Vitale\u2019 app is available on phones in a few departments but it is not familiar to all health professionals in these areas.\nThe idea was first announced in 2019 but has undergone several iterations since then.\nMeanwhile a \u2018digital prescription\u2019 service, whereby prescriptions should be printed in a special format with a smartcode containing the information \u2013 that pharmacists can scan \u2013 should also be rolled out for all hospital and doctors\u2019 appointments this year, but has suffered from limited take-up and familiarity.\nYou are also more likely this year to see \u2018telemedicine\u2019 cabins, especially in pharmacies, with France\u2019s largest provider of these, Medadom, hoping to reach 10,000 installations.\nThese allow people to have GP consultations at a distance and to provide basic health information such as blood pressure and heart rate.\nPreventative health checks\nFully-reimbursed preventative health checks are to be available nationwide from January for the following age groups: 18-25, 45-50, 60-65 and 70-75.\nCalled Mon bilan pr\u00e9vention, the checks will look at general health, diet, sleep, addictions etc as well as risk of illnesses common to the age group.\nThey will be on offer from doctors, midwives, nurses and pharmacists. If eligible, you can book one here.\nCondoms and sanitary protection\nCondoms are to be available free of charge from pharmacies for people aged below 26, and reusable menstrual protection including protective underwear or menstrual cups for women aged under 26 will now be reimbursed.\nVaccination\nVoluntary vaccinations against human papillomavirus will be available from age 11, instead of 14.\nSubsidised top-up insurance\nPeople who claim certain benefits will be automatically offered CSS subsidised top-up insurance without them having to apply and provide extra information on their means\nThe benefits that are eligible for this include:\n\nAAH and ASI disability benefits,\nAllocation de solidarit\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifique (means-tested benefit for people out of work whose rights to ordinary unemployment benefit have run out)\nAllocation de contrat d\u2019engagement jeune (for young jobseekers in training or volunteering)\n\nRead more: Claiming free or cheaper top-up French health insurance to get easier\n\u2715\nhealth french news doctor medicine\nDel p\u00e5 Facebook Del p\u00e5 Twitter Del p\u00e5 e-post\nAd\nhealth french news doctor medicine\n\n #### Is France set to ban smoking on restaurant and cafe terraces?

      "MOTOR\nResults for {phrase}\n\nAutomotive Data since 1903\n\nDealer Service Satisfaction Improves but Appointment Wait Times Continue to Grow\nDealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments\nBy J.D. Power\nTroy, Mich.\u2014While customer satisfaction with the dealer service experience has rebounded this year, dealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments, according to the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) Study. Overall customer service satisfaction improves five points to 851 (on a 1,000-point scale).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an improvement in service satisfaction but, unfortunately, the capacity and wait time issues have gotten progressively worse since the pandemic and show no immediate signs of easing up,\u201d said\u00a0Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power. \u201cExcluding Tesla owners, the service experience for BEV owners is underwhelming. As sales of BEVs continue to grow and the industry moves out of the early-adopter phase, the typical owner will not be as willing to tolerate a less-than-stellar service and ownership experience.\n\n\u201cOn the manufacturer side, a higher rate of BEV recalls is also contributing to an inconsistent experience. This is an area that automakers and dealers need to address now to help make the transition to electrification as pain-free as possible for owners in the future.\u201d\nContributing to the poor service experience of non-Tesla BEV owners is a notable lack of trust with servicing dealers to perform complex repairs and provide useful guidance. Overall dealer trust among non-Tesla BEV owners is 5.62 (on a 7-point scale) but jumps to 6.00 among owners of gas-powered vehicles owners and 5.74 among plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners.\n\nThe study, now in its 44th\u00a0year, has grown to include emerging features such as valet service, mobile vehicle servicing and online/smartphone app payment options to gauge the effect these processes have on the service experience. The study measures satisfaction with service at franchised dealer or aftermarket service facilities for maintenance or repair work among owners and lessees of one- to three-year-old vehicles.\nIt also provides a numerical index ranking of the highest-performing automotive brands sold in the United States, which is based on the combined scores of five measures that comprise the vehicle owner service experience. These measures are (in order of importance): service quality; service advisor; vehicle pick-up; service facility; and service initiation. In 2023, model segment rankings were added to the study to differentiate between the service needs of cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans.\nFollowing are key findings of the 2024 study:\nHighest-Ranking Brands and Segments\n\u2022 Lexus\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among premium brands for a third consecutive year, with a score of 897.\u00a0Porsche\u00a0(894) ranks second and\u00a0Cadillac\u00a0(883) ranks third.\n\u2022 Buick\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among mass market brands with a score of 887.\u00a0MINI\u00a0(884) ranks second and\u00a0Subaru\u00a0(877) ranks third.\n\u2022 MINI (877) ranks highest in the mass market car segment, followed by Subaru (874) and\u00a0Mazda\u00a0(867).\n\u2022 Buick ranks highest among mass market SUVs/minivans with a score of 887.\u00a0Mitsubishi\u00a0(877) and Subaru (877) each rank second in a tie.\n\u2022 Porsche (902) ranks highest in the premium car segment, followed by\u00a0Infiniti\u00a0(900) and Lexus (892).\n\u2022 Lexus ranks highest in the premium SUV segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 898.

Various traditional models (LR, DT, RF, GB, KNN, MLP, SVM) and H2O-SEM approach are compared based on Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination. Additionally, the H2O AutoML module is introduced as an alternative for comparison. The traffic generation and investigation are performed using the SUMO simulator.

      "Traffic Signals\nReport a Problem\nTo report a problem with a traffic or pedestrian signal, call 311. Please have the exact location of the problem ready.\nNYC DOT's contractors are required to arrive at the scene of the most serious problems (e.g., all lights out, or a knocked-down pole) within two hours of notification. If a bulb is out, contractors are required to respond within 48 hours.\nAccessible Pedestrian Signals\nNYC DOT installs special signals at crosswalks to assist pedestrians who are blind or have low vision. The signals make sounds and vibrate when pedestrians push a button installed at the crosswalk.\r\n  Learn more and see a list of all accessible pedestrian signals in New York City\nView a list of accessible pedestrian signals on NYC Open Data\nContact NYC DOT online to report a problem or request a new APS\n\nFlashing Yellow Arrow Turn Signals\nTurn signals reduce injuries for pedestrians and bicyclists, as well as improve safety, comfort and mobility for motorists. This video shows two examples of flashing yellow arrow left turn signals in New York City.\n\nSignal Timing\nExclusive Pedestrian Signals\nAt some intersections, NYC DOT programs traffic signals with an interval that stops traffic in all directions, giving pedestrians an exclusive time to cross the street.\r\n  View a list of exclusive pedestrian signals on NYC Open Data\n\nLeading Pedestrian Interval Signals\nTraffic signals at some intersections give pedestrians a head start to cross the street before car traffic. The goal of these signals is to improve street safety by giving pedestrians a chance to begin crossing the street before cars make turns across the crosswalk.\r\n  View a list of leading pedestrian intervals on NYC Open Data\nView the locations of leading pedestrian intervals on the Vision Zero View map\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Traffic Signals\nWhat does a traffic signal do?\nA traffic signal controls the right-of-way for vehicles arriving at an intersection, which can reduce traffic delay and accident-producing conflicts. It also makes an intersection safe by determining whether vehicles or pedestrians should proceed.\nDoes a traffic signal control speed?\nNo. In some areas where speeding is a problem, residents believe that a traffic signal is needed to address the speeding problem. In fact, traffic signals sometimes result in greater speeds as drivers accelerate to try to get through the signal before it turns red. Other traffic control measures, such as speed humps, speed limit signs, and traffic enforcement, are more effective in controlling speed.\nHow many traffic signals are there in New York City?\nAs of March 2022, there were 13,543 intersections with traffic signals citywide, including 2,862 in Manhattan, 1,768 in the Bronx, 4,848 in Brooklyn, 3,432 in Queens and 633 in Staten Island.\nHow long does it take lights to change?\nSignal timing cycle lengths usually fall between 45 and 120 seconds. The timing for each signal is determined based on traffic volume and traffic patterns in each particular area.\nA traffic signal's cycle is too long or too short, will NYC DOT change it?\nSometimes the presence of a traffic signal will result in changes in the previous traffic patterns, as some drivers seek alternative routes to avoid the signal. This may mean that the current signal timing is no longer appropriate. If you believe that the timing of a particular signal is incorrect, contact the NYC DOT Commissioner with your request. NYC DOT will conduct a study of traffic patterns to determine if any adjustments are needed. A study will take approximately 12 weeks.\nHow can I request a new traffic signal?\nYou can request the installation of a traffic signal by writing to the NYC DOT Commissioner. You can also request an accessible pedestrian signal, which plays audible messages to assist visually impaired users.\nHow does NYC DOT decide whether a traffic signal should be installed at an intersection?\nNYC DOT uses a detailed process called an intersection control study to determine if traffic signals or multi-way stop signs are appropriate for a location. The study includes (but is not limited to) these steps:\nWhat are the Federal Guidelines for traffic signals?\nThe federal standards for traffic control devices can be found in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which is published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The MUTCD establishes criteria known as \"warrants\" which are used to determine if a new traffic signal is appropriate.\nThe latest edition of the MUTCD, published in 2009, sets forth nine warrants, which are summarized below.\r\nLearn more about the MUTCD on the FHWA web site\nWhat is the Red Light Camera Program?\nThe Red Light Camera Program uses technology that enables NYC DOT to automatically take high-resolution photographs of vehicles that go through red lights, including close-ups of the license plates. Summonses are issued to the owners of the vehicles, as with parking violations. The photos are included with the summonses. The City had the first full-time red light photographic enforcement program in the United States, and was the first jurisdiction to send photos to respondents as part of the summons.\nAre red light cameras effective in preventing drivers from running red lights?\nStudies have shown a 40 percent decrease in the total number of incidents of motorists going through red lights at the locations where cameras have been installed. That means fewer accidents, making New York City much safer for pedestrians and other motorists.\nSince the Red Light Camera program began in December 1993, more than 4 million summonses have been issued through 2007. Because the summonses include photographs of the vehicle going through the intersection, very few motorists have contested the summonses. About 88% have been found guilty.\nIn April 1998, legislation was enacted that authorized NYC DOT to install cameras at 50 locations throughout New York City. In June 2006, legislation was enacted authorizing an additional 50 cameras. Another 50 cameras, for a total of 150, were authorized in legislation enacted in April 2009.\r\nLearn about paying and contesting red light camera violations from the Department of Finance\n  \n\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n",
      "News\nTotality angst: Dallas-Fort Worth avoids traffic woes during total solar eclipse\nOfficials issued safety notices, warned of emergency-like conditions and shut down major highway ramps into downtown Dallas in advance of the April 8 eclipse.\nBy Maggie Prosser, Philip Jankowski, Amber Gaudet and Irving Mejia-HilarioStaff Writers\nStaff Writers\nEditor\u2019s note: This story is part of The Dallas Morning News\u2019 coverage of the 2024 total solar eclipse. For more, visit dallasnews.com/eclipse.\nAny given day, the Buc-ee\u2019s in Temple serves as a haven for wayward people, weary travelers and commuters headed to or from Austin or Dallas.\nBut on Monday, the chipper Beaver looming over a stretch of Interstate 35 welcomed visitors to the 124-pump, mega pit stop oasis, offering more than smoked brisket, bathrooms and ample parking: The buck-toothed mascot had front-row seats to a once-in-lifetime celestial event.\n\u201cAfter we scouted the area, we went off our checklist. Gas, food, clean bathrooms,\u201d Shannon Murphy, 41, said. \u201cThat\u2019s Buc-ee\u2019s.\u201d\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\nOr with: \nBy signing up you agree to our\u00a0Terms of Service\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy Policy\nA few cars over, Lucy Valedez crocheted a blanket with stripes of sky blue, lilac, sunflower yellow and light green in her camping chair. Lucy and her husband, Jos\u00e9 Valedez, traveled from Bryan.\n\u201cWe figured, if we\u2019re going to travel, we\u2019d go somewhere that had parking,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Valedez said.\nTravel woes gnawed at eclipse goers ahead of the event Monday, prompting officials to issue safety notices, warn of emergency-like conditions, and even shut down major highway on-ramps into downtown Dallas, fearing traffic jams.\nThe angst came and went as quickly as totality: There were no major traffic problems reported Monday in Dallas, even with the influx of visitors and eclipse chasers. Local hospitals did not immediately report any patients with eye injuries. And the state\u2019s energy reserves held steady.\nThe Texas Department of Transportation predicted 1 million people will have visited the Lone Star state for optimal viewing of the total solar eclipse. The path of totality stretched across more than 480 Texas miles, reaching from the Rio Grande to the Red River.\nAll hands on deck at Buc-ee\u2019s\nAt the Buc-ee\u2019s nearly midway between Austin and Dallas, pitmaster Randy Pauly \u2014 donning Wrangler jeans, a cowboy hat and red and blue Buc-ee\u2019s brand shirt stitched with his name \u2014 handed out eclipse glasses to employees.\nMonday was an all-hands-on-deck situation for Buc-ee\u2019s, Pauly said, akin to the busiest travel days as people fanned out across the area of totality chasing clear skies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Super Bowl weekend for us,\u201d he said. Pauly jumped in a photograph with perhaps the most visible staffer at Buc-ee\u2019s: chief of cutting meat, Ginette Cortes, before she carved up a smoked brisket. Pauly said he expected this location to go through at least 100 briskets Monday, topping about 1,000 pounds of smoked beef rolled up into breakfast tacos and other fare.\nPauly said he wants to show out-of-state visitors \u201ca little bit of Texas.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty wild,\u201d Craig Kleine said of the enormous gas station. Kleine, of Tucson, Ariz., was headed about 90 miles north to Cleburne to view the eclipse. Interstate 35 moved freely throughout the morning, as travelers regularly made stops at the Buc-ee\u2019s pumps or inside the store.\nCommuters had yet to feel the effects, even as hundreds of early birds weaved and snaked in lines outside the Dallas Zoo and the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, staked out lawn spots in Dealey Plaza or on the shores of White Rock Lake, and applied sunscreen under cloudy skies while compulsively checking the weather radar.\nLinda Hampton left about 6:15 a.m. and trekked 43 miles down U.S. Highway 75 to the Dallas Arboretum. Traffic on Dallas-area roads and highways remained light Monday morning and throughout totality, according to TxDOT.\nHampton\u2019s early departure wasn\u2019t out of concern for traffic, rather her husband was responsible for the garden\u2019s petting zoo, and top of mind for her and others was whether the dense clouds would soften by 12:20 p.m., when the eclipse began.\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy for the sunshine \u2014 yes, yes, yes, yes!,\u201d said an elated Hampton, 75, as the diamond portion of the eclipse peeked out from behind the clouds, providing an aura of optimism. The initial forecast left some forlorn, worrying the moon\u2019s traversal in front of the sun would be obscured. The outlook began to brighten around lunchtime, but storms and severe weather were expected Monday evening.\nMore than 450,000 visitors\nGlobetrotters journeyed from all corners of the region (Garland, Mansfield, Gun Barrel City and Grand Prairie), the country (California, Florida and New York) and even internationally (Colombia, Germany and France) to witness the first total eclipse in North Texas since 1878.\nEarly estimates from city leaders expected up to a 35% increase in visitors, or more than 450,000 people. More accurate counts may not come until later.\nMinnesotans Ralph and Kim Haefner scooped up a vacation rental last February as hotel reservations were filling up. City officials expected 90% of the city\u2019s roughly 35,000 hotel rooms to be booked by Monday.\n\u201cMillions of years from now, as the moon keeps getting slightly farther and farther away from the Earth over time, it\u2019ll be too small to cover the sun,\u201d said Ralph Haefner, an eclipse chaser. The couple spent early Monday scoping out the best view at Bachman Lake. \u201cIt\u2019s just this weird little coincidence that you can see this amazing spectacle.\u201d\nAstronomy student Andr\u00e9s Torres, 21, traveled to Dallas from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, by way of Miami and Austin to fulfill his dream of witnessing a total eclipse. From Founders Plaza in downtown Dallas, Torres propped up a professional telescope on a tripod.\n\u201cIt was a long trip,\u201d he said. \u201c[The eclipse] is already starting, I\u2019m so excited.\u201d\nAs the eclipse began, Donnie, a 5-year-old pit bull, took refuge under trees and patchy shade near Reunion Tower. Donnie, with his humans Mark Ebanks and Autumn Flowers in tow, made the 14-hour trip from Jacksonville, Fla., on Sunday, arriving in Dallas just after 2 a.m. Monday.\nThe trip was spontaneous, \u201cspur of the moment,\u201d said Ebanks, who didn\u2019t know about the eclipse until Flowers, a self-described space nerd, told him about it last week.\nDonnie, Ebanks and Flowers planned to drive back to Florida after totality ended. They hadn\u2019t given much thought to traffic concerns, other than a potential stop in Louisiana for crawfish.\n\u2018Rolling\u2019 closures of highway exits\nDallas police issued temporary rolling closures of highway exits headed into downtown from about 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. in anticipation of traffic jams as totality ended and people left their viewing spots en masse. Despite the closures, traffic flowed smoothly after the eclipse and there were no issues to report, according to a Dallas police spokesperson.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t see a dramatic increase in traffic right after the totality, and I think that indicates that people were just preparing themselves to stay a little bit later and avoid some of that traffic,\u201d Texas Department of Transportation spokesperson Tony Hartzel said.\nThe state\u2019s most critical infrastructure also held strong during the total solar eclipse. ERCOT\u2019s grid never dipped below normal operating conditions during the entirety of the eclipse, a spokesperson told The Dallas Morning News.\nThe state\u2019s top hospitals, including Parkland Health, Baylor Scott & White Health and Methodist Health System, did not report an increase in new patients because of the eclipse Monday afternoon.\nCloud cover at Buc-ee\u2019s\nThe Buc-ee\u2019s pitstop filled with more than 200 people in camping chairs and on picnic blankets; totality came and went with some tension. With minutes to go until full moon cover, low-flying dark clouds blocked visibility. People took off their eclipse glasses amid worried groans as they tried to catch the sliver of the sun as the sky darkened.\nThen, less than a minute before totality, the clouds cleared, the sky darkened and cheers rang out. People settled into their awe and quietly marveled at the orange horizon clearly visible from all sides of the flat, field-lined gargantuan parking lot. A few planets were seen near the sun while the temperature dipped and the solar corona became visible.\n\u201cIt just makes me remember there is so much going on out there,\u201d said Kelsey Appleton, an Atlanta resident there with her parents, Bob and Margaret Appleton, from College Station. \u201cI\u2019m just a part of it.\u201d\n\u201cI just felt like this might be the only chance in my life to see one,\u201d Bob Appleton said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful.\u201d\nWithin 30 minutes, the vast majority of spectators of the cosmic event had left, leaving to clear traffic.\nStaff writers Maria Halkias, Leah Waters, Anna Butler, Nicholas Wooten and Marcela Rodrigues contributed to this report.\nMaggie writes about public safety and criminal courts.

      "\u201cNew Normal\u201d of 10am to 4pm Hybrid Work While Congestion Grows Globally\nToday INRIX launched the 2023 INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard, our 18th annual release, including a Q1 2024 update. The Scorecard tracks, measures and analyzes traffic congestion in 947 urban areas worldwide, providing insights for road authorities, transportation engineers, policymakers, and the public.\nTraffic congestion occurs when travel demand for roads exceeds the supply of available roadway. While typically viewed in a negative light, traffic congestion is an externality of economic growth and population movement. As more people and economic activity move into urban areas, it places strain on available road capacity, requiring intervention if there is a desire to ameliorate it.\nAdditionally, increased levels of traffic congestion mean more people, deliveries, employees, service workers and truckers, among others, losing time to traffic. It means more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, a reduction in air quality, and lost productivity and economic growth.\nWhile congestion is one barometer of growth, it can also hinder it. Fewer on-time deliveries, fewer goods to market, and a shrinking labor pool are just some outcomes when the impact of traffic congestion hits a certain threshold. While cities, DOTs, road authorities and transit operators work within constrained budgets and red tape, maintenance backlogs grow and key transportation bottlenecks grow more intense.\nHere are the key trends from this year\u2019s Global Traffic Scorecard:\nTrip patterns reveal massive midday \u201c10-4\u201d peak continues. Travel patterns have continued to push toward a midday \u201cnew-normal,\u201d first noted by INRIX back in 2021, that shows morning peak periods have shed some traffic to the midday hours, indicating a more \u201chybrid work\u201d commute pattern.\nINRIX estimates that during the midday travel period, nearly 72 million trips occur per hour, up nearly 23% since 2019, while the evening peak has dropped -9% to 73 million trips per hour. The typical hour during the morning peak sees -12% fewer trips.\nThis should continue to be a key focus of DOT officials and road authorities. Whether adjusting signal timing, adjusting transit schedules or allocating incident response vehicles, the move from the morning peak hours to the midday provides an interesting opportunity reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions.\nTraffic congestion continues to climb. 2023 saw increases in traffic congestion in 78% of the areas analyzed, fell in 19% and stayed the same in 3%. Yet despite the growth, just 54% of areas analyzed have reached their pre-COVID level of traffic congestion.\nMore Time and Economic Impact. The New York Urban Area tops the list, as the typical drivers lost 101 hours to traffic in 2023. This equates to $1,762 in lost time per driver, or $9.1 billion to the urban area. New York is followed by Mexico City (96 hours lost), London (99), Paris (97) and Chicago (96).\nThe typical U.S. driver lost 42 hours to congestion, equal to $733 per driver and $70.4 to the nation as a whole. U.K. drivers lost 61 hours on average, equal to \u00a3558 per driver and \u00a37.5 billion nationally, and drivers in Germany lost 40 hours to traffic on average in 2023, equal to 427 \u20ac and 3.3 billion \u20ac nationally.\nOther important transport statistics/topics. Overall micromobility use rose 8.3% in cities tracked by RideReport, and by Q1 2024 were up 8.6% over Q1 2023.\nThe year saw a couple of high-profile transportation disasters, from fires underneath the I-10 in Los Angeles to the I-95 collapse in Philadelphia. This was followed in 2024 by the collapse of the Key Bridge near Baltimore after it was struck by a cargo ship. However, the quick response of a temporary span on I-95 just a few weeks after the collapse provided a testament to our ability to build and recover.\nMigration continued on a similar path as the COVID recovery in the U.S. as well, with Texas, Florida and the Southern states accounting for 87% of the country\u2019s growth last year.\nPublic transport recovered ridership in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, but all still sit below their pre-COVID levels of ridership. Just seven percent of urban areas in the U.S. tracked by the Federal Transit Administration reached 2019 levels of ridership.\nConclusion\nMany trends are still being ironed out from the massive global disruption that COVID had on the transportation network. Traffic congestion continues to climb while new challenges emerge that also demand attention. The Scorecard reveals the contextual nature of transportation \u2013 its simply not a one size fits all approach. Some cities see trips to downtown stand pat while others see large increases. Many see traffic congestion building on arterials and neighborhood streets while others reveal stronger similarities to more traditional, \u201chub and spoke\u201d travel demand.\n",

The average driver in the Los Angeles area spent 119 hours in rush hour traffic, according to the most recent data from the University of Austin, Texas\u2019 2019 Mobility Report. Three decades ago, the average LA driver spent 66 hours a year in traffic. The 2017 congestion numbers post an 80 percent increase in average hours a year for drivers stuck in traffic.\r\n \r\nWhile LA is famous for its traffic, this is not an LA-specific issue, with cities and towns both big and small posting significant increases in congestion over the past three-plus decades. An expanding nation and, as a result, a growing workforce are both factors at play in the increasing congestion plaguing American roadways. Since 1982, there are 50 percent more people in the workforce, and while people are increasingly working from home, most are still commuting to office space during peak hours. The only year-over-year decrease in congestion was between 2008 and 2009 when the U.S. economy was reeling from the worst economic contraction and high unemployment, the country had seen since the Great Depression.\r\n  \r\nPeople on the roadways pay for this congestion through their time, but the economy pays for these delays through costly inefficiencies. The annual cost of traffic delays per commuter has nearly doubled, rising to $1,010. That is nearly double what it was in the early 1980s.\r\n\n                            \n\n                                        Description\n                                    \n\n                                        This chart shows the annual average hours of delay per commuter during peak hours by U.S. cities.\n                                    \n\n                                            Report\n                                        \n\n                \n                    Can I integrate infographics into my blog or website?\n                \n            \n\n                \n                    Yes, Statista allows the easy integration of many infographics on other websites.

Provisional estimates are published quarterly and remain provisional until after they have been constrained by the final annual estimates each year. These provisional estimates are based on traffic data collected continuously from a network of around 300 automatic traffic counters. Final annual figures also incorporate manual traffic count data.\nTraffic shows a seasonal pattern at the national level, being highest in summer and lowest in winter. This publication focuses on rolling annual traffic totals, which better illustrate medium and long term trends in traffic.\nAnnual traffic estimates are usually published between May and June of the following year. The next provisional figures, for the year ending June 2024, are due to be released in September 2024.\nThese are accredited official statistics[footnote 1] and were independently reviewed by the Office for Statistics Regulation in February 2013. For more information, see the background information on provisional road traffic estimates.\nHeadline figures\nOverall traffic levels in the year ending March 2024 were higher than in year ending March 2023 and below pre-pandemic levels.\nChart 1: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 1 is a line chart showing that 332.4 billion vehicle miles were driven on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was up 2.1% compared to the year ending March 2023. Motor vehicle traffic levels fell during the pandemic but have since increased. This is the case for all vehicle types and road types. Traffic levels for the year ending March 2024 were 1.8% below pre-pandemic levels.\nRoad traffic by vehicle type\nChart 2: Share of traffic by vehicle type for the year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 2 is a bar chart which shows that cars accounted for 76% of all motor vehicle traffic on Great Britain\u2019s roads over the year ending March 2024. Therefore, cars continue to be the main contributor to changes in overall motor vehicle traffic.\nThe proportion of van traffic has increased in recent years, accounting for 18% of all motor vehicle traffic in this 12 month period.\nLorries accounted for 5% of all motor vehicle traffic and 1% of traffic came from other motor vehicles including motorcycles and buses.\nIn the year ending March 2024:\nTable 1: Vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain by vehicle type in the year ending March 2024, and percentage change compared to previous 12 month periods (from TRA2501a)\nTable 1 shows how traffic in the year ending March 2024 compares to a selection of earlier years for different vehicle types. For example, car and taxi traffic was 2.6% higher in the year ending March 2024 than the year ending March 2023. Note that any differences between -0.5% and +0.5% are considered negligible.\nCars and taxis\nChart 3: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by cars and taxis in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 3 is a line chart which illustrates that cars and taxis travelled 252.5 billion vehicle miles in the 12 months ending March 2024. Car and taxi traffic rose 2.6% from the year ending March 2023. Car and taxi miles for the year ending March 2024 were down by 4.0% compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nVans (Light Commercial Vehicles - LCVs)\nChart 4: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by vans in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 4 is a line chart which shows that 58.2 billion vehicle miles were driven by vans on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was a rise of 1.1% compared to the year ending March 2023. Van distance travelled for the year ending March 2024 was 8.8% higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nLorries (Heavy Goods Vehicles - HGVs)\nChart 5: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by lorries in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 5 is a line chart showing that 16.9 billion vehicle miles were driven by lorries on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. Lorry traffic decreased by 2.0% compared to the year ending March 2023. Distance covered by lorries for the year ending March 2024 was 1.7% below pre-pandemic levels. The chart shows that the pandemic had a lesser effect on total lorry traffic than other vehicle types. Between the years ending December 2019 and December 2020, lorry traffic only fell by 5.9%, while car and van traffic fell by 24.9% and 9.2% respectively.\nRoad traffic by road type\nChart 6: Share of traffic by road type for the year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 6 is a bar chart displaying that on Great Britain\u2019s roads, in the year ending March 2024, 21% of motor vehicle miles travelled were on motorways, 44% on \u2018A\u2019 roads, and 35% on minor roads. 65% of motor vehicle miles travelled were on major roads (motorways and \u2018A\u2019 roads) despite comprising only 13% of the road network by length.\nIn the year ending March 2024:\nTable 2: Vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain by road type in the year ending March 2024 compared to previous 12 month periods (from TRA2502a)\nTable 2 shows how traffic in the year ending March 2024 compares to a selection of earlier years for different road types. For example, motorway traffic was 1.9% higher in the year ending March 2024 than the year ending March 2023. Note that any differences between -0.5% and +0.5% are considered negligible.\nMotorways\nChart 7: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled on motorways in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 7 is a line chart illustrating that 70.1 billion vehicle miles were driven on motorways in Great Britain in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was an increase of 1.9% compared to the year ending March 2023. Motorway traffic for the year ending March 2024 was similar to pre-pandemic levels.\n\u2018A\u2019 roads\nChart 8: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled on \u2018A\u2019 roads in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 8 is a line chart which shows 146.5 billion vehicle miles were driven on \u2018A\u2019 roads in Great Britain in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This represents a 2.6% rise from the year ending March 2023. Traffic on \u2018A\u2019 roads for the year ending March 2024 was 2.5% lower than pre-pandemic levels.\nMinor roads\nChart 9: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled on minor roads in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 9 is a line chart showing that 115.8 billion vehicle miles were driven on minor roads in Great Britain in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This represents a 1.6% increase from the year ending March 2023. Distance travelled on minor roads for the year ending March 2024 was 1.8% below pre-pandemic levels.\nBackground information\nGlossary\nFurther information\nA background quality report has been published for these statistics.

      "AAA Newsroom\nAutomotive, Travel, and Traffic Safety Information\nNearly 71 Million People Expected to Travel over July 4th Week\nThis year\u2019s extended Independence Day forecast exceeds pre-pandemic numbers, sets new record\nWASHINGTON, DC (June 20, 2024) \u2013 AAA projects 70.9 million travelers will head 50 miles or more from home over the Independence Day holiday travel period*. For the first time, AAA looked at the entire July 4th week, plus the Saturday before and the Sunday after the holiday. This year\u2019s projected number of travelers for that time period is a 5% increase compared to 2023 and an 8% increase over 2019.\n\u201cWith summer vacations in full swing and the flexibility of remote work, more Americans are taking extended trips around Independence Day,\u201d said Paula Twidale, Senior Vice President of AAA Travel. \u201cWe anticipate this July 4th week will be the busiest ever with an additional 5.7 million people traveling compared to 2019.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAAA projects a record 60.6 million people will travel by car over Independence Day week \u2013 that\u2019s an additional 2.8 million travelers compared to last year. This year\u2019s number also surpasses 2019 when 55.3 million people traveled by car over July 4th week. AAA car rental partner Hertz says Dallas, Denver, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco are the cities displaying the highest rental demand during the holiday week. The busiest pick-up days are projected to be Friday, June 28, Saturday, June 29, and Wednesday, July 3.\u00a0\u00a0\nGas prices are lower than last year when the national average was $3.53. Pump prices will likely continue going down leading up to Independence Day.\u00a0 At that point, they will likely level off and remain relatively stable until after Labor Day, similar to last year.\u00a0 An important caveat is hurricane season \u2013 underway now \u2013 which could affect gas prices should a storm negatively impact Gulf Coast oil production and refining centers.\u00a0\nThe number of air travelers is also expected to set a new record. AAA projects 5.74 million people will fly to their July 4th destinations. That\u2019s an increase of nearly 7% compared to last year and a 12% increase over 2019. AAA booking data shows domestic airfare is 2% cheaper this Independence Day week compared to last year, and the average price for a domestic roundtrip ticket is $800. Airports will be packed throughout the week. AAA recommends arriving 2 hours early, reserving parking ahead of time, and traveling with carry-on luggage versus checked bags to save time and money.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore than 4.6 million people are expected to travel by other modes of transportation, including buses, cruises, and trains. This category is seeing an increase of 9% compared to last year, but this year\u2019s number is shy of 2019\u2019s figure of 4.79 million. Cruising continues its remarkable post-pandemic comeback. This time of year, Alaska cruises are in high demand, making Seattle and Anchorage top domestic destinations. Cruise travelers are also finding deals this summer. With new ships coming onto the market \u2013 and going for a premium \u2013 some cruise lines have been offering targeted discounts to fill older inventory for remaining cabins.\u00a0\nBest/Worst Times to Drive and Peak Congestion by Metro\u00a0\nINRIX, a provider of transportation data and insights, says the worst times to travel by car before and on July 4th are between 2pm and 7pm. Drivers should hit the road in the morning, and travelers returning on Monday, July 8th should avoid rush hour traffic in the morning and afternoon.\u00a0\n\u201cDrivers in large metro areas can expect the worst traffic delays on Wednesday, July 3rd, as they leave town, and Sunday, July 7th, as they return,\u201d said Bob Pishue, transportation analyst at INRIX. \u201cRoad trips over the holiday week could take up to 67% longer than normal. Travelers should monitor 511 services, local news stations, and traffic apps for up-to-the-minute road conditions.\u201d\u00a0\nPlease note that the times listed below are for the time zone in which the metro is located.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor example, Atlanta routes = ET and Los Angeles routes = PT.\u00a0\nSource: INRIX\u00a0\nIncrease\u00a0\nCompared to Typical\u00a0\nSunday 7th\u00a0\u00a0\n6:30 PM\u00a0\nThursday 4th\u00a0\u00a0\n1:45 PM\u00a0\nWednesday 3rd \n2:45 PM\u00a0\nMonday 8th\u00a0\u00a0\n7:30 AM\u00a0\nMonday 8th\u00a0\u00a0\n3:30 PM\u00a0\nSaturday 6th\u00a0\u00a0\n1:30 PM\u00a0\nMonday 8th\u00a0\u00a0\n2:15 PM\u00a0\nMonday 8th\u00a0\u00a0\n4:45 PM\u00a0\nSunday 7th\u00a0\u00a0\n2:15 PM\u00a0\nMonday 8th\u00a0\u00a0\n8:30 AM\u00a0\nWednesday 3rd\n 5:00 PM\u00a0\nThursday 4th\u00a0\u00a0\n6:00 PM\u00a0\nTuesday 2nd\u00a0\u00a0\n5:45 PM\u00a0\nSunday 7th\u00a0\u00a0\n4:30 PM\u00a0\nWednesday 3rd \n10:15 AM\u00a0\nMonday 8th\u00a0\u00a0\n3:15 PM\u00a0\nSource: INRIX\u00a0\n\u00a0Top Destinations\u00a0\nThis July 4th week, travelers are cooling off in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska \u2013 and by the ocean! Seattle, Vancouver, and Anchorage are top destinations because of the popularity of Alaska cruises this time of year. Beaches in South Florida, Honolulu, Punta Cana, and Barcelona are in high demand. Historical sites in European cities like London, Rome, Dublin, Paris, and Athens are also popular. The top 10 domestic and international destinations below are based on AAA booking data.\u00a0\nFamily Road Trip Checklist\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWith road trips expected to set a new record this July 4th week, AAA teamed up with Chicco to share safety tips for families with young children. \u00a0\nHoliday Forecast Methodology\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nTravel Forecast\u202f\u00a0\nIn cooperation with AAA, S&P Global Market Intelligence (SPGMI) developed a unique methodology to forecast actual domestic travel volumes. The economic variables used to forecast travel for the current holiday are leveraged from SPGMI\u2019s proprietary databases. These data include macroeconomic drivers such as employment, output, household net worth, asset prices, including stock indices, interest rates, housing market indicators, and variables related to travel and tourism, including gasoline prices, airline travel, and hotel stays. AAA and SPGMI have quantified holiday travel volumes going back to 2000.\u202f\u00a0\nHistorical travel volume estimates come from DK SHIFFLET\u2019s TRAVEL PERFORMANCE/MonitorSM. The PERFORMANCE/MonitorSM is a comprehensive study measuring the travel behavior of U.S. residents. DK SHIFFLET contacts over 50,000 U.S. households each month to obtain detailed travel data, resulting in the unique ability to estimate visitor volume and spending, identify trends, and forecast U.S. travel behavior, all after the trips have been taken.\u00a0\nThe travel forecast is reported in person-trips. In particular, AAA and SPGMI forecast the total U.S. holiday travel volume and expected mode of transportation. The travel forecast presented in this report was prepared the week of May 27, 2024.\u00a0\u00a0\nBecause AAA forecasts focus on domestic leisure travel only, comparisons to TSA passenger screening numbers should not be made. TSA data includes all passengers traveling on both domestic and international routes. Additionally, TSA screens passengers each time they enter secured areas of the airport, therefore each one-way trip is counted as a passenger tally. AAA focuses on person-trips, which include the full round-trip travel itinerary. As a result, direct comparisons of AAA forecast volumes and daily TSA screenings represent different factors.\u00a0\n*Independence Day Holiday Travel Period\u00a0\u00a0\nFor this forecast, the Independence Day holiday travel period is defined as the nine-day period from Saturday, June 29 to Sunday, July 7. Historically, the Independence Day holiday period included only one weekend. This is the first year the Independence Day holiday travel period is a longer timeframe with two weekends included.\u00a0\nAbout AAA\u202f\u00a0\nStarted in 1902 by automotive enthusiasts who wanted to chart a path for better roads in America and advocate for safe mobility, AAA has transformed into one of North America\u2019s largest membership organizations.

      "final report\nTraffic Congestion and Reliability:\nTrends and Advanced Strategies for Congestion Mitigation\n2.0\tThe Nature of Traffic Congestion and Reliability:\nCauses, How They Are Measured, and Why They Matter\n2.1\tWHAT IS CONGESTION?\nCongestion is relatively easy to recognize\u2014roads filled with cars, trucks, and buses, sidewalks filled with pedestrians.\nThe definitions of the term congestion mention such words as \"clog,\" \"impede,\" and \"excessive fullness.\"\nFor anyone who has ever sat in congested traffic, those words should sound familiar.\nIn the transportation realm, congestion usually relates to an excess of vehicles on a portion of roadway at a particular time resulting in speeds that are slower\u2014sometimes much slower\u2014than normal or \"free flow\" speeds.\nCongestion often means stopped or stop-and-go traffic.\nThe rest of this chapter is devoted to describing congestion and how we measure it, as well as its causes and consequences.\n2.2\tCAUSES OF CONGESTION AND UNRELIABLE TRAVEL\nPrevious work has shown that congestion is the result of seven root causes, often interacting with one another.5\nThese \"seven sources\" can be grouped into three broad categories, as shown below:\nHighlight Box 1 discusses how the seven sources of congestion are related to the underlying traffic flow characteristics that create a disruption in traffic.\nWe typically think of a bottleneck as a physical restriction on capacity (Category 3 above).\nHowever, disorderly vehicle maneuvers caused by events have a similar effect on traffic flow as restricted physical capacity.\nBecause the traffic flow effects are similar, traffic disruptions of all types can be thought of as producing losses in highway capacity, at least temporarily.\nIn the past, the primary focus of congestion responses was oriented to adding more physical capacity:\nchanging highway alignment, adding more lanes (including turning lanes at signals), and improving merging and weaving areas at interchanges.\nBut addressing the \"temporary losses in capacity\" from other sources is equally important.\nHighlight Box 1 \u2013 What Causes Breakdowns in Traffic Flow?\nWhat causes traffic flow to break down to stop-and-go conditions?\nThe layman's definition of congestion as \"too many cars trying to use a highway at the same time\" is essentially correct.\nTransportation engineers formalize this idea as capacity\u2014the ability to move vehicles past a point over a given span of time.\nWhen the capacity of a highway section is exceeded, traffic flow breaks down, speeds drop, and vehicles crowd together.\nThese actions cause traffic to back up behind the disruption.\nSo, what situations would cause the overload that leads to traffic backups?\nBasically, there are three types of traffic flow behavior that will cause traffic flow to break down:\nInfluencing all of these disruptions in traffic flow is the level of traffic that attempts to use the roadway.\nHigh demand for highway use\u2014such as that caused by special events\u2014can compound the problems caused by disruptions to traffic flow.\nCongestion results from one\u2014or the interaction of several\u2014of the seven sources on the highway system.\nThe interaction can be complex and varies greatly from day-to-day and highway-to-highway.\nThe problem is that with the exception of the physical bottlenecks, the sources of congestion occur with maddening irregularity\u2014nothing is ever the same from one day to the next!\nOne day commuters might face low traffic volumes, no traffic incidents, and good weather; the next day traffic might be heavier than normal, it might be raining, and a severe crash may occur that blocks traffic lanes.\nAn analysis of how the combination of these events conspires to make congestion was done in Washington, D.C. (Table 2.1).\nThe worst traffic days experienced in Washington can be explained by the occurrence and combination of different events.\nAnother example of the irregularity in event occurrence can be seen in the frequency and duration of traffic incidents.\nFigure 2.1 shows how traffic incidents occurred on a 14-mile stretch of Interstate 405 in Seattle, Washington during peak travel periods for the first four months of 2003.\nSome days are relatively incident-free while others have numerous traffic incidents.\nInterestingly, at least one traffic incident occurred every day during the peaks on this highway.\nSo, while some days are better than others, traffic incidents are an unavoidable fact on crowded urban freeways.\nAnother source of variability is traffic demand, which is rarely the same from day-to-day.\nOn routes heavily used for commuting, weekday traffic is typically much higher than weekend traffic.\n(On routes in recreational, tourist, or shopping-dominated areas, weekend traffic higher.)\nFigure 2.2 shows this variability in dramatic fashion for Detroit freeways.\nIt also shows that there is some variability on weekdays:\nThursdays and Fridays are typically the highest traffic days for this period.\nThe congestion and travel time variability caused by planned special events are becoming a major concern for transportation agencies.\nIn a recent survey of state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials and the American Highway Users Alliance, special events were cited as significant contributors to noncommuter congestion.\nThese events may be categorized as:\nTable 2.1\tFactors Contributing to Extreme Congestion\nTen Worst Days of Washington, D.C. Traffic\nSource:\tVasudevan, Meenakshy; Wunderlich, Karl E., Shah, Vaisshali; and Larkin, James, Effectiveness of Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) Under Extreme Congestion:\nFindings from a Washington, D.C., Case Study, proceedings of ITS America, 2004.\nThe events that impede traffic flow and cause travel to be unreliable often occur in combination.\nThis diagram shows the number of days when different combinations of events occurred during the study period.\nFor example, there were three days when incidents occurred\u2014on two of these days only incidents occurred and on one day, incidents occurred in combination with high demand and bad weather.\nAs most commuters know, \"some days are worse than others.\"\nPile high demand (say, a Friday before a three-day weekend) on top of heavy rain and a lane-blocking crash, and you've got the ingredients for severe congestion.\nFigure 2.1\tThe Number and Duration of Incidents Varies Greatly from\nDay to Day\nI-405 Southbound, Seattle, Washington\nNote:\tData shown are for the morning and afternoon peak periods (7:00-10:00 a.m. and 4:00-7:00 p.m.) for the period from January 1, 2003 to April 30, 2003.\nTraffic incidents occur in a fairly erratic pattern from day-to-day.\nAlso, how long they last and how many lanes they block are fairly unpredictable.\nThis erratic behavior contributes significantly to making travel unreliable for travelers.\nFigure 2.2\tTraffic Levels Vary Substantially over the Course of a Week\nDetroit Freeways, 3/11/2001 - 4/7/2001\nNote:\tVMT (or \"vehicle-miles of travel\") is a common measure of highway usage.\nIt is calculated as the number of vehicles using the system times the distance they travel.\nFor the time period displayed, Sundays are the low points on the graph.\nWeekday travel can be more than 60 percent higher than Sunday travel.\nOn weekdays, the trend toward highway travel later in the week (Thursdays and Fridays) is common in most urban areas.\nWhile commuting trips are relatively stable throughout the week, discretionary trips are higher as the weekend approaches.\nAs if the congestion picture was not complicated enough, consider further that some events can cause others to occur.\nFor example:\nAll of this suggests the rather complex model of congestion shown in Figures 2.3a and 2.3b.\nFrom a practical standpoint, what is important to take away from this model are two notions:\n1) the sources of congestion can be tightly interconnected, and 2) because of the interconnectedness, significant payoffs can be expected by treating the sources.\nThat is, by treating one source, you can reduce the impact of that source on congestion plus have a partial impact on others.\nThe exact causal relationships among the sources of congestion are not yet well known, but consider the data shown in Figure 2.4.\nDisplayed in this figure is the relationship between delay (both bottleneck- and incident-related) and traffic intensity.\nSeveral observations can be made from these data:\nFigure 2.3\tAnatomy of Congestion\nFigure 2.3a Part 1 - Traffic Volumes Interact with Physical Capacity to Produce \"Base Delay\"\n= Source of Congestion\nNote:\tThe starting point for congestion on most days is the amount of traffic and the physical restrictions on the highway (bottlenecks).\nTraffic varies from day-to-day throughout the year and special events may cause surges in traffic at unexpected times.\nSee Figure 2.2 as an example of how much traffic varies even over as short a period as a month.\nFigure 2.3\tAnatomy of Congestion (continued)\nFigure 2.3b Part 2 - Roadway Events Reduce Available Capacity and Add Extra Delay to the System\n= Source of Congestion\nNote:\tJust as traffic varies across time periods, so does physical capacity.\nThe operation of traffic signals changes capacity, often minute-to-minute.\nWhen roadway events occur, they also cause the physical capacity of the roadway to be lowered.\n(Traffic incidents and work zones can \"steal\" lanes, and bad weather causes drivers to space themselves out more.) Base-level congestion caused by bottlenecks can lead to increased traffic incidents due to tighter vehicle spacing and vehicles overheating in summer.\nFinally, the existence of extreme congestion can cause some drivers to change their routes or to forego trips altogether.\nUnderstanding how all these factors interact is the subject of ongoing research.\nFigure 2.4\tRelationship of Incident and Bottleneck Delay to Traffic Intensity\nNote:\tThe AADT/C level is a general indicator of the \"intensity\" of traffic trying to use a highway with fixed capacity.\nAADT is Annual Average Daily Traffic (vehicles per day) and C is the two-way capacity of the roadway (vehicles per hour).\nBottleneck and traffic incident delay occur differently:\nbottlenecks cause delay at specific points while traffic incidents may occur anywhere along a highway segment.\nThis is the reason for using 5- and 10-mile segments for the traffic incident delay above.\nThe analysis shows that as traffic grows on a roadway with fixed capacity, traffic incident delay is initially higher than bottleneck delay.\nAs traffic grows, bottleneck delay overtakes traffic incident delay, because it happens fairly regularly while traffic incidents vary in occurrence and characteristics.\nThis analysis also shows the interrelationship between the sources of delay identified in Figures 2.3a and 2.3b.\nEven with no changes in traffic incident characteristics, traffic incident delay grows as more traffic is added to a roadway.\nIn other words, as the traffic level grows on a base of fixed capacity, the roadway is more vulnerable to disruptions caused by traffic incidents, or any other traffic-influencing event for that matter.\nThe exponential growth in bottleneck delay after the onset of congestion is a major reason why it is so difficult for agencies to keep up with congestion:\nonce it starts, things get bad quickly.\nIntroducing an extra vehicle to congested conditions means not only does that vehicle get delayed, it also adds extra delay to any other vehicles that join after it.\nThe fact that both bottleneck- and incident-related delay increase with base congestion level indicates that if physical capacity is increased, congestion for both sources would be decreased.\nIn other words, Facilities with greater base capacity are less vulnerable to disruptions:\na traffic incident that blocks a single lane has a greater impact on a highway with two travel lanes than a highway with three travel lanes.\nThis feature highlights the interdependence of the sources mentioned above.\nIt also reinforces the notion that adding physical capacity is a viable option for improving congestion, especially when made in conjunction with other strategies.\nWhat Is Travel Time Reliability?\nBy its very nature, roadway performance is at the same time consistent and repetitive, and yet highly variable and unpredictable.\nIt is consistent and repetitive in that peak usage periods occur regularly and can be predicted with a high degree of reliability.\n(The relative size and timing of \"rush hour\" is well known in most communities.)\nAt the same time, it is highly variable and unpredictable, in that on any given day, unusual circumstances such as crashes can dramatically change the performance of the roadway, affecting both travel speeds and throughput volumes.\nThe traveling public experiences these large performance swings, and their expectation or fear of unreliable traffic conditions affects both their view of roadway performance, and how and when they choose to travel.\nFor example, if a road is known to have highly variable traffic conditions, a traveler using that road to catch an airplane routinely leaves lots of \"extra\" time to get to the airport.\nIn other words, the \"reliability\" of this traveler's trip is directly related to the variability in the performance of the route she or he takes.\nIt is becoming clear that we can no longer just define congestion in terms of \"average\" or \"typical\" conditions.\nOne of the reasons was identified in Figure 2.4\u2014as the traffic on a fixed capacity roadway, a highway becomes more susceptible to delay from traffic incidents, and in fact, to all traffic-influencing events.\nBecause reliability indicates how much events influence traffic conditions, it is particularly important when it comes to defining operations strategies, which aim to control the effect of these events.\nHighlight Box 2 \u2013 Measuring Reliability\nBecause reliability is defined by how travel times vary over time, it is useful to develop frequency distributions to see how much variability exists.\nCalculating the average travel time and the size of the \"buffer\"\u2014the extra time needed by travelers to ensure a high rate of on-time arrival\u2014then helps us to develop a variety of reliability measures.\nThese measures include the Buffer Index, the Planning Time, and the Planning Time Index (see Figure 2.5).\nThey are all based on the same underlying distribution of travel times, but describe reliability in slightly different ways:\nFigure 2.5\tDistribution of Travel Times, State Route 520 Seattle,\nEastbound, 4:00-7:00 p.m. Weekdays (11.5 Miles Long)\nWith this discussion in mind, from a practical standpoint, travel time reliability can be defined in terms of how travel times vary over time (e.g., hour-to-hour, day-to-day).\nCommuters who take congested highways to and from work are well aware of this.\nWhen asked about their commutes, they will say things like:\n\"it takes me 45 minutes on a good day, but an hour and 15 minutes on a bad day.\"\nFigure 2.6 typifies this experience with data from State Route (SR) 520, a major commuter route, in Seattle, Washington.\nIf there was no congestion on this 11.5 mile segment, travel times would be around 11 1/2 minutes; on President's Day this was the case.\nOn other days, the average travel time was 17.5 minutes, or an average speed of 40 mph.\nBut when events (traffic incidents and weather) are present, it could take nearly 25 minutes, or 37 percent longer.\nCommuters who take SR 520 corridor must plan for this unpredictable variability if they want to arrive on time\u2014the average just will not do.\nFigure 2.6\tWeekday Travel Times\n5:00-6:00 p.m., on State Route 520 Eastbound, Seattle, Washington\nIn other words, they have to build in a buffer to their trip planning to account for the variability.\nIf they build in a buffer, they will arrive early on some days, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but the extra time is still carved out of their day.\nAnd this is time they could be using for other pursuits besides commuting.\nWhat Value Does Providing Reliable Travel Times Have?\nImproving the reliability of travel times is significant for a number of reasons:\nDespite our simple definition of travel time reliability as the variation in travel times over history, different perspectives exist:\nAs we have already seen, some days are better (or worse) than others in terms of congestion, and there is quite a bit of variation from average or typical conditions on any given day.\nFigure 2.7 displays this variation from the traveler and operator points of view.\nShown are travel times in the heavily congested I 75 corridor in central Atlanta for all Thursdays in 2003.\nThe average and 95th percentile travel times are shown along with the actual travel times from two specific Thursdays.\nJanuary 16 was clearly a \"bad\" day in this corridor while September 4 was \"better than average.\"\nFor both travelers and operators, a constantly updated display of travel conditions compared to baselines would be valuable information to have.\nIn fact, at least one traffic management center (Houston TRANSTAR) posts this sort of information on their web site in real-time.9\nIt should be noted that currently we do not have the ability to predict what is going to happen\u2014a difficult task given the uncertainty of unpredictable events like incidents or sudden, intense weather.\nWe can only compare what is happening now to historical conditions, but research is currently underway on this topic.\nStill, the ability to predict with some certainty what travel time will be in the near future is of great interest to operators and travelers.\nWhy is this important?\nIf a commuter has a routine activity that must occur every day\u2014such as picking up children from day care\u2014they must plan on an extra amount of trip time just to be sure they do not arrive late.\nThe same goes for local trucking firms engaged in pickup and delivery of goods.\nLooking again at the data in Figure 2.7, if a traveler starts in the corridor at 5:30 p.m., on the average Thursday the trip will take about 12 minutes.\nBut history has shown that to be safe, they have to plan for about 18 minutes (50 percent more) to have only a small chance of arriving late; they have to build in a buffer.\nThese are not huge numbers\u2014but this is a short corridor (4 miles).\nThe difference is, however, a large percentage.\nIf similar conditions exist over the rest of the commute, then the extra time starts to add up quickly.\nWith this simple approach, an extreme event can cause great problems for an individual trip, but at least we can compute a reasonable probability of arriving on time.\nFigure 2.7\tIs It a Good Day or Bad Day for Commuting:\nComparing Current Travel Times to Historical Conditions\nI-75 Southbound Central Atlanta, Thursdays, 2003\nNote:\tComparing what is happening on the highway system right now to \"typical\" (average) and \"extreme\" (95th percentile) conditions provides both operators and travelers with information that can lead to actions.\nFor example, the afternoon of September 4, travelers could see that congestion was lighter than usual and could schedule additional activities.\nJanuary 16 on the other hand was a heavy congestion day and as it unfolded, operators could post diversion messages to try to control it.\nPlanners are most interested in how things change over a longer period of time, though the question of \"are things getting better or worse\" is of general interest as well.\nIn the I 75 corridor in central Atlanta, travel times in the afternoon peak period have increased and reliability has decreased between 2001 and 2003 (Figure 2.8).\nMonitoring of performance trends like this is becoming more common at transportation agencies.\nAs discussed in the next section, performance monitoring is a major emphasis in operations and planning.\nFigure 2.8\tCongestion and Unreliable Travel Have Increased on\nI-75 Southbound in Central Atlanta, Georgia\nThursdays, 2001 and 2003\nNote:\tBy comparing the average travel times in 2001 and 2003 (the blue lines)), it can be seen that average congestion levels have increased in this corridor.\nAt the same time, travel time reliability has decreased, as shown by the increase in the 95th percentile travel times.\n2.3\tTRACKING CONGESTION\n2.3.1\tWhy Monitor Congestion?\nMonitoring congestion is just one of the several aspects of transportation system performance that leads to more effective investment decisions for transportation improvements.\nSafety, physical condition, environmental quality, economic development, quality of life, and customer satisfaction are among the aspects of performance that also require monitoring.10\nCongestion is intertwined with all of these other categories since higher congestion levels have been associated with their degradation.\nIn addition to facilitating better investments, improved monitoring of congestion can lead to several positive outcomes:\nThe performance of the highway system in terms of how efficiently users can traverse it may be described in three basic terms:\ncongestion, mobility, and accessibility.\nWhile researchers have different definitions of these terms, we have found it useful to define them as follows:\nCongestion and mobility are very closely related and the same metrics and concepts can be used to monitor both.\nAccessibility is a relatively new concept and requires a different set of metrics.\nMost the data that are currently available describe facility performance, not trip performance, although new technologies are emerging that will allow for direct monitoring of entire trips.\nOne of the principles that FHWA has established for monitoring congestion as part of its annual performance plan is that meaningful congestion performance measures must be based on the measurement of travel time.\nTravel times are easily understood by practitioners and the public, and are applicable to both the user and facility perspectives of performance.\nTemporal Aspects of Congestion:\nMeasuring congestion by times of the day and day of week has a long history in transportation.\nA relatively new twist on this is the definition of a weekday \"peak period\"\u2014multiple hours rather than the traditional peak hour.\nIn many metropolitan areas, particularly the larger ones, congestion now lasts three or more hours each weekday morning and evening.\nIn other words, over time, congestion has spread into more hours of the day as commuters leave earlier or later to avoid the traditional rush hour.\nDefinition of peak periods is critical in performing comparisons.\nFor example, consider a three-hour peak period.\nIn smaller cities, congestion may usually only last for one hour\u2014better conditions in the remaining two hours will \"dilute\" the metrics.\nOne way around this is not to establish a fixed time period in which to measure congestion, but rather determine how long congestion exists (e.g., percent of time where operating conditions are below a threshold.)\nSpatial Aspects of Congestion:\nCongestion spreads not only in time but in space as well.\nQueues from physical bottlenecks and major traffic-influencing events (like traffic incidents) can extend for many miles.\nCongestion measures need to be sensitive to this by tracking congestion over facilities or corridors, rather than just short highway segments.\nTable 2.2 presents a small sample of congestion performance measures (metrics) that can be used by agencies to monitor trends.\nFor a specific road section and time period:\nBuffer Index (%) =\nFigure 2.9 shows how travel times can be developed from data, analytic methods, or a combination.\nClearly, the best methods are based on direct measurement of travel times, either through probe vehicles or the more traditional \"floating car\" method, in which data collectors drive specific routes.\nHowever, both of these have drawbacks:\nprobe vehicles currently are not widely deployed and the floating car method suffers from extremely small samples because it is expensive and time consuming.\nFurther, since many performance measures require traffic volumes as well, additional collection effort is required to develop the full suite of performance measures.\nUse of ITS roadway equipment addresses these issues, but this equipment does not measure travel time directly; ITS spot speeds must be converted to travel times first.\n(The Appendix provides a description of the equipment used to collect these data.)\nOther indirect methods of travel time estimation use traffic volumes as a basis, either those that are directly measured or developed with travel demand forecasting models.\nTwo examples of how FHWA is developing travel times with these methods follow.\nFigure 2.9\tMeasuring Travel Time Is the Basis for Congestion Measures\nSince 2000, FHWA has been assembling volume and speed data from urban traffic management centers.\nThese data are primarily from ITS roadway equipment, although some cities are exploring the use of probe vehicles to capture travel time.\nData from 29 cities are currently obtained annually from participating traffic management centers.\nSome of these cities are now providing data on a monthly basis, and these monthly data are used to track citywide trends month-by-month.\nFigure 2.10 shows an example of how these data are presented.\nAs more cities participate\u2014and as surveillance coverage increases in existing cities\u2014these data will provide a way for FHWA to monitor monthly changes in congestion.\n(Section 3.0 presents additional analysis of the data used in this program.)\nFigure 2.10\tExample of the Newly Designed Urban Congestion Report\nUsed by FHWA to Track Monthly Changes in Congestion\nThe tracking of congestion within cities is dependent on having an intensive system of surveillance to collect vehicle speeds (through roadway detectors) or travel times (using toll-tagged probe vehicles) at closely spaced points on the roadway.\nOutside of major metropolitan areas, such surveillance does not exist.\nTo complement urban congestion measures and get a better picture of total system performance, FHWA is developing a system to monitor truck travel on intercity corridors that have significant freight volumes.\nFHWA is partnering with the American Transportation Research Institute and the trucking industry to use existing satellite-based systems that track truck movement for freight and fleet management purposes to support transport system performance measurement.\nAdditionally, FHWA is exploring using similar methods to measure delay at major international border crossings.\nFigure 2.11 shows an example of how this system has been applied to develop travel times on 10-mile stretches of Interstate 5.\nFigure 2.11\tInterstate 5 Average Travel Rate for Trucks:\n10-Mile Segments\nApril-June 2004, 3:00-7:00 p.m.\n2.4\tCONGESTION'S CONSEQUENCES\nThe nation's local, regional, and national transportation systems play a vital role in creating access to goods and services which sustain and grow our nation's economy.\nPlanners and economic development experts recognize that congestion is an economic development issue because it thwarts business attraction and expansion, and reduces the quality of life for residents.\nTransportation system users have developed strategies to deal with increased congestion and reduced reliability.\nIn the short term, we might change our mode or time of travel.\nOver the longer run, congestion might influence our decisions about where we live and work.\nThe same holds true for businesses.\nThese types of adjustments might reduce the impacts of congestion to us, but they still do not entirely eliminate the economic consequences for a region.\nTrucking Impacts.\nCongestion means longer travel times and less reliable pick-up and delivery times for truck operators.\nTo compensate, motor carriers typically add vehicles and drivers and extend their hours of operation, eventually passing the extra costs along to shippers and consumers.\nResearch on the trucking industry has shown that shippers and carriers value transit time in the range of $25 to $200 per hour, depending on the product being carried.\nThe cost of unexpected delay can add another 20 percent to 250 percent.11\nImpacts on Businesses.\nCongestion increases the costs of delivering goods and services, because of the increased travel times and operating costs incurred on the transportation system.\nLess obviously, there may be are other costs, such as:\nThe business value of time delay and market access act together to affect the profitability and revenue potential associated with doing business in a state or region.\nWhen one area is affected by congestion more than others, the relative competitiveness of these areas also shifts.\nThe result, then, is that businesses tend to stagnate or move out of areas with high operating costs and limited markets, while they locate and expand in areas with lower operating costs and broader market connections.\nThe magnitude of these changes varies by industry, based on how strongly the industry's total operating cost is affected by transportation factors.\nThe evidence seems to indicate that regional economies that are fostered by clusters or \"agglomerations\" of many interrelated firms are better positioned to counter the higher operating costs due to congestion than economies that are not.\nHousehold Impacts.\nHouseholds have both financial budgets and what is termed \"time budgets\" that are both impacted by congestion.\nHouseholds plan their activities around the available time budget as well as around their financial budgets.\nAs vehicle operating and maintenance costs increase with rising congestion, the budget for some types of activities or expenditures decreases.\nThe perceived \"quality of life\" of a neighborhood is diminished as well, when the safety, reliability and the convenience of the transportation system decreases.\nRegional Impacts.\nRegional economies are affected by these household and business-specific impacts.\nDiminished cost competitiveness and market growth opportunities are tantamount to a reduced ability to retain, grow, and attract businesses.\nAdditionally, the redistribution of business and household activity to outlying areas and the direct delay for trips that are not diverted or otherwise changed both lead to decreases in air quality, increases in public infrastructure investment requirements, and potential impacts on health and quality of life factors.12\nBack to Top\nPrevious | Table of Contents | Next\nUS DOT Home\u00a0| FHWA\nHome\u00a0|
