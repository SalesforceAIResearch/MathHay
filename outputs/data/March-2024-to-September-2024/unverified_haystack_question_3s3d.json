      "Phoenix and Maricopa County on track to count fewer heat deaths for first time in a decade\nMaricopa County's medical examiner isn't quite done counting heat-related deaths for 2024, but the Department of Public Health told The Arizona Republic this week the totals are likely to come in under that for 2023. It would be the first year in a decade when the number has not increased.\nIn 2023, 645 people died from factors related to environmental heat in Arizona's most populous county, with a majority of those cases determined to have been directly caused by heat. That staggering death toll, which drew international attention to metro Phoenix's record-breaking temperatures due to climate change and urban development, was a 52% increase over the previous year, which was a 25% jump compared to the year before that.\nLast year's heat mortality count was also nearly an eightfold increase over the 84 heat-related deaths in 2015.\n\"This is not yet absolute by any means, but about 75% of the cases that are under investigation are what we estimate will likely be confirmed,\" Dr. Nick Staab, a medical epidemiologist and assistant medical director for the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, told The Republic Tuesday. \"With our update today, that would be around 609 cases, which would be less than the 645 from last year.\"\nThe medical examiner's office changed protocols for flagging deaths under investigation as potentially heat-related in 2023 to address process oversights that may have resulted in undercounts for previous years. But \"nothing has changed for counts of confirmed heat-related deaths,\" chief medical examiner Dr. Jeff Johnston told The Republic on Wednesday, adding that \"comparisons of annual counts of heat-related deaths are reliable and should be comparable to other jurisdictions who are medically investigating such deaths.\"\nThe protocol change reflects a growing awareness nationwide of the deadly consequences of worsening extreme heat. In 2017, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a guidance toolkit for disaster-related medical death investigations that included a form and checklist for heat wave disasters. As some of the hottest urban areas in the country, Maricopa and Pima Counties were already ahead of the curve on these efforts at that point, Johnston said.\nThe CDC still \"does not have any real-time surveillance protocols that we are aware of for such investigations,\" he said, but the agency has praised Maricopa County's heat surveillance efforts, which have helped guide practices in other regions dealing with dangerously rising temperatures, including Miami-Dade County, FL; Harris County, TX; King County, WA; the state of Louisiana; and most recently Los Angeles County.\nMore:In Arizona, a generation fears uncertainties in abortion access and climate action\nThe fact that an increased focus on considering environmental temperatures in death investigations may be offset by fewer heat-caused cases this year also suggests that local programs aimed at stemming health impacts to Arizonans from extreme heat might be working. If the 2024 heat death total bends the skyrocketing trend from recent years downward, as Staab expects, even with changes that might result in more deaths being attributed to heat over the past two years than in previous assessments, it will signify a needed shift many years in the making.\n\u201cThere has been some reporting that maybe we were ahead of last year\u2019s numbers and really we think we will end up very close to last year\u2019s numbers, and maybe just under,\" Staab said. \"We\u2019re at a point where we feel like what we\u2019re doing in public health is working because we\u2019ve all seen in the last couple of years this kind of persistent climb upwards. We really want to see that number significantly lower because, as we have always said, we do believe all these deaths are preventable.\"\nPhoenix cites 20% fewer heat-related illness emergency calls in 2024\nThough Phoenix officials also do not yet have a confirmed 2024 heat-related death count, they, too, cited measurable progress this week on addressing the human toll of extreme heat.\n\"When we look at the number of heat-related emergencies that our firefighters are dealing with, we saw a 20% reduction when compared to the same period last year,\" Phoenix's executive assistant fire chief Tim Kreis told reporters at a news briefing Thursday.\nEven with that decrease, firefighters still responded to 1,416 heat-related calls for service between May 1 and October 1, during which time fire and emergency management staff used ice-filled cooling bags to quickly reduce dangerously high body temperatures of patients more than 300 times.\nSo far in 2024, the county medical examiner has determined that 240 people died from heat-related causes within Phoenix city limits, 83% of whom were exposed to dangerous temperatures outdoors. In 2023, a total of 340 people succumbed to heat in Phoenix, with 79% of cases originating in outdoor settings.\nThe slight drop in likely totals for 2024 and shift to outdoor risks highlights both Phoenix's challenges with keeping its large unhoused population safe from extreme heat and its successes in making some headway indoors. Access to cooled spaces for unhoused people and programs to check on indoor residents who may be at risk of heat impacts, like elderly and low-income families who may not have or use air conditioning at home, seem to be helping.\nDave Hondula, who directs Phoenix\u2019s Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, told The Republic last year that he makes many of the calls to check on vulnerable residents signed up with the city's \"Cool Callers\" program during heat waves himself. He attributed this year's incremental gains to improved coordination between members of the county's regional Heat Relief Network. One stat he shared Thursday was that his office had distributed one million water bottles to network partners this summer to facilitate regional cooling hydration.\n\u201cAlthough we had a record number of heat records this summer, I\u2019m very confident there\u2019s been a significant and positive public health impact from this heat relief work,\" Hondula said Thursday. \"Lives were saved and lives were changed.\u201d\u00a0\nMore:In a heat wave, some people wait too long to turn on the AC. Smart data use could help\nMayor Kate Gallego also attributed progress on heat initiatives to collaborative action between Hondula's team and the city's Offices of Homeless Solutions, Public Health, Emergency Management and the Fire Department.\nThis year, these efforts included: expanding a network of more than sixty cooling centers and hydration stations; extending hours at certain respite centers to include overnight access; providing transitional shelter space cooled using solar-generated power; the phased opening of the new \"Phoenix Navigation Center\" homeless shelter that was controversial with nearby residents; and managing the \"Safe Outdoor Space\" campground with basic services.\nIn March, the Phoenix City Council passed an ordinance to shield city-contracted workers from extreme heat, in contrast with delayed action on worker protections by the state and nationwide. Throughout the summer, the city also distributed heat relief supplies and grant funding originating from $1.8 million in federal funds from the American Rescue Plan Act, $500,000 from the state and $1.6 million from the county, Gallego said on Thursday.\nMore:Arizona workers one step closer to extreme heat protections with proposed Biden rules\n'The weather is not working in our favor'\nAmid these indications of progress, speakers at Thursday's city news briefing and at the Maricopa County Department of Public Health underscored that more must be done to address the hundreds of preventable heat deaths that occur locally each year.\n\u201cAcross our state, we have to treat extreme heat as a public health hazard, just like other states and communities have to prepare for harsh weather such as blizzards, hurricanes, and flooding,\u201d Gallego said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we need other levels of government to provide additional resources and support to this cause. Our summers are only growing hotter and more intense, and it\u2019s past due that we treat heat like the emergency it is.\u201d \u00a0\nOne way this must happen, scientists say, is through action to address the warming influences of climate change. Burning fossil fuels for energy releases molecules into the air known as greenhouse gases, the most common of which is carbon dioxide. There, they absorb heat from the sun and alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere, which scientists have consistently concluded leads directly to more chaotic and extreme storms, drought and heat waves.\nThe destruction wrought by the most major of these \"not-so-natural\" disasters has already cost the American economy more than $61 billion in 2024, a figure that doesn't include extreme heat events and may triple after the price tags of supercharged Hurricanes Helene and Milton are confirmed. Grocery bills are also spiking in response to crop losses caused by drought and rising temperatures.\nA climate action progress report recently published by Gallego's team tracks Phoenix's recent efforts to address this root cause. But the global problem is exacerbated by other leaders, like members of the Arizona Legislature who have not engaged with climate-based solutions to heat illness and inflation. The most obvious of those solutions, experts say, is to shift energy use to clean and renewable sources. In the past two years, Arizona's solar, battery storage and electric vehicle industries have leveraged nearly $12 billion in investments and more than 18,000 jobs facilitated by President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act toward this goal, though increases in energy demand threaten overall progress.\nMore:In its first climate plan report card, Phoenix claims some progress, with work still to do\nPolitics could also play a role in how Maricopa County's scientists are able to track and study the environmental causes of local heat-related deaths. Staab of the County's Public Health Department told The Republic that insight into heat health impacts has benefitted from the use of publicly available data from the National Weather Service.\n\u201cWith data sources expanding so much, our (epidemiologists) are looking at National Weather Service data and all sorts of stuff to bring into our analysis and that power communicating it out,\" Staab said.\nThat data source has been targeted by the Project 2025 agenda for a second Donald Trump administration. While Trump has distanced himself from this 900-page plan to dismantle many federal and scientific agencies and environmental protections, its creation by members of his prior administration leads many to believe he would enact many of its suggestions, complicating Arizona's efforts to study and address heat-caused deaths.\n\u201cThere is an obvious benefit to having a public, reliable National Weather Service that is funded collectively by taxpayer dollars,\" David Kieve, president of Environmental Defense Fund Action, told The Republic in August. \"The idea that you\u2019re going to privatize that and it will run better as a private business, that\u2019s not going to work. And it\u2019s not going to work for Arizonans at a time when we\u2019re seeing a rising number of extraordinarily hot days.\"\nMore:Climate was barely mentioned in the debate, but Harris and Trump showed wide differences\nRising average temperatures and increasingly frequent extreme heat waves are, Staab also noted, not the only contributors to deaths coded by the medical examiner as heat-related. Drug use, particularly meth, is a growing problem in Phoenix and can \"shut down the body's heat defense system,\" according to reporting by The Republic this summer.\n\u201cWe continue to see a lot of our heat-related deaths amongst those who are unsheltered and those who are using substances, whether that\u2019s drugs or alcohol,\" Staab said. \"As we move forward in our efforts to reach these individuals, we need to focus on partnering with community-based organizations working with those high-risk communities.\"\nAt Thursday's heat relief briefing, Rachel Milne, director of Phoenix's Office of Homeless Solutions, highlighted efforts the city has made to \"help individuals connect with resources beyond heat relief, like housing or shelter.\" Data from the Heat Relief Network showed that 92% of more than 35,000 visitors to cooling centers during summer 2024 reported they were experiencing homelessness. More than 1,000 of them then received direct onsite assistance from Community Bridges Inc, a partner organization working with Milne.\nRead our climate series:The latest from Joan Meiners at azcentral on climate change\nBut while the progress made in 2024 to reduce preventable heat deaths \u2014 through the smart use of data sources, the application of federal, state and county funding, the body bags of ice, the heat-aware changes to medical examining protocols and more \u2014 is promising and inspiring and likely saved lives, innumerable more water bottles, cooling centers and heat ordinances may be needed if climate change is not brought under control.\n\u201cThe weather is not working in our favor,\u201d Staab said.\nJoan Meiners is the climate news and storytelling reporter at The Arizona Republic and\u00a0azcentral.com.

Over the past 12 months, the increase in the CPI has surpassed the median estimate in 5 months, matched the median estimate in 2 months, and fallen short of the median estimate in 5 months. It is interesting to note that actual CPI number has been below the estimate over the past four months (May 2024 through August 2024). Over the past 5 years (60 months), the increase in the CPI has surpassed the median estimate 52% of the time, matched the median estimate 15% of the time, and fallen short of the median estimate 33% of the time.\nThe median estimate of 2.3% is based on 17 estimates collected by FactSet. These CPI estimates range from a low of 2.20% to a high of 2.40%, for a spread of 20 bps. This spread is smaller than the trailing 12-month average spread between the low and high estimate of 27 bps and smaller than the 5-year (60 month) average spread between the low and high estimate 49 bps.\nThe median estimate (year-over-year, not seasonally adjusted) for the consumer price index excluding food & energy (Core CPI) is 3.2%.\nTomorrow (October 10) the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release the CPI and Core CPI numbers for September.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThis blog post is for informational purposes only.

      "Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of March 2024 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $16.2 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 593 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $11.1 billion has been announced for transportation \u2013 to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports \u2013 and roughly $995 million has been announced for clean water and water infrastructure. Florida received $2.1 billion to connect everyone in the state to reliable high-speed internet and, as of today, more than 1,708,000 Florida households are already saving on their monthly internet bill due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida \u2013 including rural communities and historically underserved populations \u2013 the law makes critical investments that will improve the lives of Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $8.5 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $7.7 billion in highway formula funding and $158 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges to date. o $117.1 million through the RAISE program to date. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $207 million through the INFRA program to date. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet over 272,962 homes and small businesses in Florida do not have access to high-speed internet infrastructure. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to everyone in America. The Biden-Harris Administration worked with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program \u2014 meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. Now, the Biden-Harris Administration is calling on Congress to extend this program through 2024. Without action from Congress, millions of Americans will lose their internet connection and the economic opportunities that come with it. See ACP enrollment for every state and territory here. \u25cf Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received $2.1 billion for high-speed internet. Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program to provide access to high-speed internet to everyone in Florida. Florida also received $2.8 million in funding to expand middle-mile infrastructure in the state. In addition, about 1,708,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in water infrastructure in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $995 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: \u25cb $995 million available to date to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $229.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation and 19% of transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $1.3 billion to improve public transportation options across the state. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Announced funding to date will double the number of clean transit buses on America\u2019s roads. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Schools in Florida have been awarded $45 million through the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean School Bus Program. Communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT\u2019s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $113.7 million has been announced in Florida to date to build out a network of EV chargers in the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy about $150 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $392.4 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power. This includes: o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; o $162.8 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received approximately $1 billion for airports. Ports and Waterways: Our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports\u2013 ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Florida has received roughly $128.3 million for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $24.9 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. \u25cf Announced funding to date: Approximately $1.5 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience, including $51.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity \u2014 and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. \u25cf Announced funding to date: $123 million has been allocated to cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites. Approximately $25 million has been allocated to Florida for capping orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaiming abandoned mine lands.

Florida Project Spotlights INFRA Award Spotlight I-4 Truck Parking Facilities The Florida Department of Transportation has received $180 million to add approximately 917 truck parking spaces across four sites along I-4 in District Five in Central Florida, which includes locations in Volusia County, Seminole County and Osceola Counties. This project addresses the shortage of overnight parking for commercial vehicles in this region, which also reduces safety issues such as fatigue and unauthorized parking. The project will also incorporate electric charging stations. See here for a full list of INFRA awards. Resilience Project Spotlight Everglades Restoration The Army Corps of Engineers awarded nearly $1.1 billion to the Everglades for ecosystem restoration activities. Years of human development have isolated portions of the Everglades and altered natural flow patterns for freshwater. These projects will help regulate the inflows and outflows of water that are the lifeline of this ecosystem, helping restore the rich biodiversity of the Everglades\u2019 two million acres of wetlands. Thriving wetlands will also filter out pollution to improve water quality for the one-third of Floridians who rely on the Everglades for drinking water, and will help improve resilience to flooding that impacts the state. This historic funding marks the single largest investment in Everglades\u2019 history. See here for the full list of U.S. Army Corps projects announced in 2022. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 Grid Innovation Spotlight Improving Reliability Through Grid Hardening in Florida The Department of Energy is awarding $52.9 million to the Sumter Electric Cooperative to improve reliability of its power grid. This project consists of multiple inter-related components that SECO Energy has developed in response to the need for accelerated resilience efforts. Multiple tropical storms and hurricanes have crossed directly through SECO Energy\u2019s service territory with winds and flooding causing damage and disruptions. SECO Energy\u2019s proposed project will enhance resilience by undergrounding overhead utility lines; hardening existing poles and increasing line capacity; replacing aging, inefficient equipment; and expanding load capacity with a new distribution substation. See here for a full list of Grid Resilience Innovation and Partnership (GRIP) program awardees. Rail Project Spotlight Florida Panhandle Rail Resiliency and Connectivity Project The Department of Transportation has awarded $23.1 million to the Florida Gulf & Atlantic Railroad, LLC for rail infrastructure and safety improvements in Florida through the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) program.

The cleanup will restore the site and prevent the contaminants from migrating to other areas. See here for more information on EPA Superfund cleanup work. Rail Project Spotlight Broward County Sealed Corridor Project The Department of Transportation awarded the Broward Metropolitan Planning Organization over $15 million for enhancements at 21 grade crossings along Florida East Coast Railway's rail line, a freight rail corridor shared with Brightline's intercity passenger rail service. Enhancements include exit gates and medians to improve safety at the crossings. See here for a full list of FY22 Railroad Crossing Elimination Program grants awards. Rail Project Spotlight South Florida Regional Transportation Authority Rail Vehicle Replacement Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 The Department of Transportation awarded nearly $72 million to the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority, which operates the Tri-Rail commuter rail service in Miami along a 72-mile South Florida Rail Corridor, to replace approximately 24 rail vehicles (or 32% of its fleet). The funding will support new locomotives and passenger cars, that have exceeded, or are near the end of their useful life. This project will ensure safe, reliable, and efficient transportation for Tri-Rail's 12,500 daily riders. See here for a full list of FY22 and FY23 Rail Vehicle Replacement Program selections. Airport Project Spotlight Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood Airport The Department of Transportation awarded $50 million to the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood Airport. This award partially funds passenger terminal improvements, including the expansion of the existing hold room and bathroom facility upgrades. This award partially funds a portion of the T1\u2010T2\u2010T3 Terminal Connector, which will complete post\u2010security connectivity between all terminals at the airport. The project consists of the construction of two connector walkways and modifications to the existing terminals including enhanced security checkpoints, a renovated bag hall, an expanded hold room, and additional retail space.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nSeptember 2024 Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks\n\nNOAA and its partners have released the latest Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks, which recap summer conditions and provide insight into what might be expected this fall.\nSummer Temperature Recap\nThe meteorological summer (June\u2013August) average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 73.8\u00b0F, 2.5\u00b0F above average, which is the fourth-warmest summer in the 130-year record. Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.The Alaska summer temperature was 51.7\u00b0F, 1.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.For the January\u2013August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9\u00b0F, 3.0\u00b0F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January\u2013August period on record.\nThe Alaska January\u2013August temperature was 31.2\u00b0F, 2.4\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June\u2013August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.For summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.The January\u2013August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January\u2013August period.The January\u2013August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month\u2019s consolidation.\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October. Precipitation consolidation guidance has trended wetter across the northern tier of the CONUS, resulting in an expansion of elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the northern High Plains and Great Lakes relative to last month. Above-normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska.\u00a0\n\n\nImpacts and Outlooks for Your Region\nMap of the United States depicting the Seasonal Precipitation Outlook for October\u2013December 2024.\u00a0\nCreating These Quarterly Summaries\u00a0\nNOAA\u2019s Regional Climate Services lead the production of these quarterly summaries of climate impacts and outlooks for various regions of the United States as well as parts of Canada along the border.

In the North Sea, fish have been comprehensively monitored throughout this period and resulting data provide a unique record of changes in distribution and abundance in response to climate change2,3. We use these data to demonstrate the remarkable power of generalized additive models (GAMs), trained on data earlier in the time series, to reliably predict trends in distribution and abundance in later years. Then, challenging process-based models that predict substantial and ongoing poleward shifts of cold-water species4,5, we find that GAMs coupled with climate projections predict future distributions of demersal (bottom-dwelling) fish species over the next 50 years will be strongly constrained by availability of habitat of suitable depth. This will lead to pronounced changes in community structure, species interactions and commercial fisheries, unless individual acclimation or population-level evolutionary adaptations enable fish to tolerate warmer conditions or move to previously uninhabitable locations.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\n        Receive 12 print issues and online access\n      \n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nShifting fish distributions in warming sub-Arctic oceans\n                                        \n\n\nFuture trends of marine fish biomass distributions from the North Sea to the Barents Sea\n                                        \n\n\nMarine fish traits follow fast-slow continuum across oceans\n                                        \n\nReferences\nSherman, K. & Hempel, G.

INTRODUCTION The dynamics of marine fish populations are typi-cally categorized as regulated primarily by top-down processes (i.e. predation) or by bottom-up processes (i.e. resource production) (Wollrab et al. 2012, Heath et al. 2014, Vinueza et al. 2014). For example, fish population dynamics in the North Sea were long thought to be driven by bottom-up processes (Lynam et al. 2017). In bottom-up regulated systems, the lowest-level driver is formed by abiotic factors (e.g.\ntemperature, salinity, etc.) and their influence on plankton biomass. The available plankton biomass in turn leads to cascades upwards through the food web (Gregory et al. 2009, Kirby & Beaugrand 2009, Olsen et al. 2011). Top-down interactions, represented by predation pressure from predators and fisheries ex -ploitation, have also been shown to have a large impact on the dynamics of several North Sea fish populations (Fauchald et al. 2011, Engelhard et al.\n2014). Furthermore, the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes in the North Sea eco-system can give rise to highly complex and non-linear dynamics in fish populations (Lynam et al.\n\u00a9 The authors 2021.

We explored the relationship between seascapes and trends in the biomass density of several North Sea fish species. We divided the North Sea into 10 seascapes using standardized methods. Time series of fish biomass density were derived from the North Sea International Bottom-Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) and aggregated to the seascape level. We analysed the inter -dependencies between these time series using a causal association network and found independ-ent biomass density trends between adjacent seascapes at a time interval of 0 yr in all species as -sessed. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density occurred at time lags of 1\u22122 yr across different gradients of exchange: (1) both directions from North to South; (2) unidirectional, North\u2212South; (3) unidirectional, South\u2212North; (4) unidirectional, East\u2212West; and (5) no clear direc-tion. Our findings indicate that the separation in (a)biotic conditions between North Sea seascapes can represent relevant barriers to the processes determining the observed fish biomass density.\nWe found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat preferences best explained short-term causal dependencies. This combination is particular to the flatfish and ray species included in the present study. Contrarily, the movement of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species best explained long-term causal dependencies. Our work highlights how causal association networks can be used to study the temporal dependencies between spatial time series in ecology.\nKEY WORDS: IBTS \u00b7 International Bottom-Trawl Survey \u00b7 PCMCI \u00b7 Seascapes \u00b7 Spatiotemporal analysis \u00b7 Time series \u00b7 Bottom-trawl OPEN PEN ACCESS CCESS Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 2017). To attain a better understanding of the com-plexity emerging from such interactions, it is impor-tant to have a complete overview of the bottom-up and top-down processes acting upon fish populations in the North Sea.\nOne potentially important bottom-up process that is often overlooked in regulating fish populations is seabed morphology. Physically distinct areas of sea -bed, also called seascapes, can act as a bottom-up controlling mechanism by shaping abiotic conditions, leading to the formation of different types of benthic habitat and associated species assemblages (Harris & Baker 2012). Due to the strong link between seabed morphology and community structure of benthic in -vertebrates (Beaman et al. 2005, Kaskela et al. 2017), seascapes are often used as a proxy for mapping marine benthic habitats (Kostylev et al. 2001, Brown & Collier 2008). Yet, we know little about the extent to which seascapes affect the dynamics of fish popu-lations, despite the fact that the few case studies available show it could help explain the spatial dis-tribution of fish resources (Pittman & Brown 2011, Getsiv-Clemons et al. 2012). Recent research revealed that the central and lower part of the North Sea com-prises 8 distinct seascapes excluding the coastal zone (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018), and that these were selectively targeted by commercial fishing vessels.\nAlthough this preferential selection provides some indirect link to the availability and distribution of fish resources, a more complete study exploring the rela-tionship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish is missing. If seascapes are important, this changes the commonly held perspec-tive on the types of bottom-up processes affecting North Sea fish populations.\nTo understand the relationship between seascapes and the population trends of North Sea fish, we in -vestigated the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes. We hypothesized that if seascapes are not related to trends in fish pop-ulations in the North Sea, biomass densities in sepa-rate seascapes will be directly dependent on each other. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the \u2018borders\u2019 between separate seascapes being dif-fuse, i.e. not relevant, to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed. In contrast, if seascapes define distinct abiotic environments that are important for the distribution of fish populations, we expect biomass densities in different seascapes to be unrelated to each other, although they can still be related across longer time lags. Ecologically, this result could be interpreted as the separation in conditions between seascapes representing relevant barriers to the processes determining the amount of fish biomass observed.\nTo examine the temporal interdependencies in fish biomass density between seascapes, we used a re cently developed causal association network ap -proach (Runge et al. 2019a). The advantage of this data-driven method is that it learns causal associa-tions at various time lags directly from aggregated sets of time series, rather than establishing causality through computer simulation experiments on correl-ative relationships found in observational data (Runge et al. 2019b). As such, our study also tests a new ap -proach to examine intraspecific dependencies in the biomass trends of North Sea fish.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study area The North Sea is a semi-enclosed shelf extending from 4\u00b0 W and 62\u00b0 N (Fig. 1a) (Daan et al. 2005). In this study, we focussed on the region that includes International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) statistical rectangles 4a, b and c. We excluded the Norwegian trench, the Skagerrak and the waters south of the English Channel, as their distinctiveness is well recognized (Bergstad 1990, ICES 2018). Ex -tending the method of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018), we derived 10 separate seascapes (Fig. 1b). These seascapes were identified based on the weighted sum of 5 bathymetry positioning indices (BPIs), which express the depth of a pixel relative to the depth of its surroundings. The specific weighted-sum BPI used (Eq. 1) highlights large-scale patterns in seabed mor-phology and is strongly linked to benthic communities (Reiss et al. 2010). A full description of the weighted BPI can be found in van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018).\nBPI 75 km + (0.9 \u00d7 BPI 50 km) + (0.8 \u00d7 BPI 30 km) + (0.7 \u00d7 BPI 10 km) + (0.6 \u00d7 BPI 5 km) (1) 2.2. Data preparation We extracted data on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 9 species of fish collected in the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (NS-IBTS) from 1978 to 2019 (ICES 2019) (Table 1). We chose 1978 as the starting year of the time series as all seascapes were systematically sampled within the NS-IBTS from this year onward. The 9 selected species cov-ered a variety of different life history strategies and 130 Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed had sufficient positive catch data available in all sea-scapes across selected years. To minimize bias from potential variability in sampling gear and timing, we only included observations that had been sampled in the same quarter of the year and using the GOV trawl. Next, we determined in which seascape each haul was performed based on the shoot longitude and latitude. We estimated the biomass in kg for a given species for each haul by multiplying the num-ber of individuals of a given length class by their length\u2212weight relationship, as derived from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019), and summing over all length classes present in the haul. We then aggregated the data to a single time series per seascape and species, representing the average biomass in kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121.\nWe refer to this metric as biomass density.\n2.3.

Fish species, records and length to weight conversion used in the study. All length\u2212weight (L\u2212W) relationships were taken directly from FishBase (Froese & Pauly 2019). Slight differences in the number of filtered (unique) hauls between spe-cies originate from small differences in the raw North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey CPUE-length-per-hour datasets pulled from the ICES/DATRAS online database (ICES 2019) for each species (mean \u00b1 SD:13 667.2 \u00b1 104.9 filtered hauls, range 13 430\u221213 760 filtered hauls) Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 dependencies in fish biomass density between sea-scapes. If seascapes are not related to fish popula-tions in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities between separate seascapes are causally related to each other at the time interval of zero. Contrarily, if seascapes are related to fish populations in the North Sea, we expect that the time series in fish biomass densities in separate seascapes are independent of each other at the time interval of zero, although they can be causally dependent across longer time scales.\nWe applied a causal association network approach recently developed by Runge et al. (2019a), to evalu-ate the underlying causal dependency structure be -tween the fish biomass density time series from dif-ferent seascapes (Fig. 2). The linear and non-linear time-lagged dependencies between sets of time series can cause inflated or spurious associations to be included when analysing their interdependence (Pearl 2009). These need to be accounted for in order to arrive at an approximation of the \u2018true\u2019 underlying dependency structure. The causal association net-work utilizes the PCMCI algorithm, as implemented in the package \u2018TIGRAMITE\u2019 in Python (Runge 2019), that arrives at a solution of the underlying depend-ency structure through iterative conditional inde-pendence testing. Internally, the PCMCI algorithm takes 2 processing steps. First, given a set of time se-ries, the PC1 algorithm constructs a graphical model in which all time series and their time-lagged compo-nents form separate nodes. For each of these nodes or time series variables, the PC1 algorithm then identi-fies all relevant conditions or \u2018preliminary parents\u2019 in the set , through iterative con-ditional independence testing. This conditional de-pendence can be interpreted as the relation between time series variables 1 and 2, after accounting for the relations existing between all time series variables within the set. The time series variables with signifi-cant relations to the focal time series after accounting for all relationships in the set form the preliminary parents of that focal time series. This first step reduces dimensionality, i.e. it identifies all relevant connections in the graph for a given time series vari-able and a first estimation of their strength, and will thereby increase the detection power for underlying causal relations. In the second step, the MCI algo-rithm addresses the false positives, i.e. spurious or inflated links found between the time series variables.\nIt does so by repeating the iterative conditional inde-pendence tests, but now conditioning on both the preliminary parents of and the time-shifted parents of (Runge et al. 2019b). Thus the graphi-cal model contains the focal time series variable, its preliminary parents and their preliminary parents.\nThis second step is therefore well suited to identifying spurious or in flated relationships originating from common drivers. Those time series variables with sig-nificant relations to the focal time series variable after this second iterative testing phase are included in the final causal association network. The final causal association network thus represents the algorithm\u2019s approximation of the underlying causal dependency structure existing between the set of time series.\nOur time series covered 42 yr, which is extensive in ecology, but relatively limited in data science. We therefore used the linear partial correlation test, a maximum time lag of 2 yr, and let the PC1 algorithm choose the optimal \u03b1 level for condition selection. As the linear partial correlation test is sensitive to out-liers, we applied a 95% winsorization to the data prior to analysis (Reifman & Keyton 2010). Confi-dence intervals were generated using bootstrapping, and inferences on the conditional dependence be -,..., 1 X X X t j t t N { } \u03b5 \u02c6 P Xt j ( ) Xt j Xt i \u2212\u03c4 132 Fig. 2. (a) Each of the 10 seascapes (green circles) has (b) an associated time series of fish biomass density, e.g. S1\u2212S4, of which we estimate the underlying causal dependency structure in (c) a causal association network. Common drivers and in direct ef-fects can yield spurious associations that are accounted for in our approach. The dots in panel b represent observed biomass density values, the blue line is a fitted trend with 95% confidence bounds indicated in gray shading. Figure adapted from Runge et al. (2019a) Rademaker et al.: Links between fish trends and seabed tween time series were made using a shuffle test with 3000 trials. We further corrected the results for the total number of pairwise tests performed by ap -plying the false discovery rate procedure of Benja -mini & Hochberg (1995). The final causal association network included those links between time series significant at an \u03b1 level of 0.05. If links occurred between 2 time series at multiple lags, the strongest link was included in the network. Rather than print-ing the full causal association network found for each species, which would result in a cluttered and un -clear overview, we report the results as follows: (1) For each species, we report the number of seascapes with biomass density trends independent of their adjacent seascapes at time lag zero. This provides a link back to our initial hypothesis that the contrasting conditions in seascapes are reflected in contrasting biomass density trends. (2) We produce a species-specific map where relationships at time lag zero are indicated by the borders between adjacent seascapes, and relationships over longer time lags between all seascapes are indicated by arrows.\n2.3.2. Post-hoc test to link life histories to causal relationships We conducted a post-hoc test to better understand the variables driving the observed dependencies in biomass density between seascapes at different time lags. More specifically, we used a random forest clas-sifier (RFC) model to predict the presence of causal relationships between seascapes based on a set of 17 variables pertaining to life history, the biomass den-sity of different life stages and environmental condi-tions (see Table S1 in the Supplement at www. int-res. com/ articles/ suppl/ m677 p129 _ supp .pdf).\n2.3.3. Variable collection We extracted 9 features related to life-history strate-gies from the marine fish trait database of Beukhof et al. (2019). Next, for every year and seascape combi-nation, we calculated the absolute dif ference in bio-mass density of small and large size classes in the juvenile and adult life stages. To do this, we first determined the length at maturation to split the IBTS data between adult and juvenile biomass density.\nNext, for each of these groups, we made an equal split between the 50% largest and 50% smallest individuals in terms of length. We then aggregated the data into a single data frame listing the biomass density of the 4 groups (small juveniles, large juve-niles, small adults, large adults) in each haul. Next, we computed the mean biomass density of each group per haul per year. Finally, we calculated the difference in mean biomass density per haul per year between different seascapes for each group. This dataframe was combined with the life-history trait dataframe to produce the final feature dataset for training. As there was a class imbalance in the label data between the number of samples with and with-out causal lag, we used a cost-sensitive learning ap -proach and weighted the classes according to their representation in the dataset (Weiss et al. 2007).\n2.3.4. Model training and performance We further optimised hyperparameters of the RFC through a grid search on the maximum depth, mini-mum samples per split, minimum samples per leaf and the number of trees. The final RFC model with causal lag zero as the label feature included 300 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits, a minimum 10 samples per leaf and split. The final RFC model with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature consisted of 500 trees, with a maximum depth of 40 splits and a minimum of 10 samples per leaf and 15 per split.\nBefore training, we split 50% of the data into a vali-dation set, and, during training, we used stratified K-fold cross validation with 5 splits (Refaeilzadeh et al.\n2009). We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values and a confusion matrix, from which we could calculate recall and pre-cision, to evaluate model performance. The model was run twice, once with causal lag zero as the label feature, and once with causal lag 1\u22122 as the label feature. The model performed well on the validation set in both runs, with an AUC of 98.0 and 98.2%, a recall of 95.2 and 97.1% and precision of 93.0 and 91.6%, respectively. This is further illustrated in the confusion matrixes in Fig. S1.\n2.3.5. Variable importance We calculated the importance of each of the 17 variables in predicting the presence of a causal de - pendency between seascapes at various time lags using the \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 function in the \u2018SHAP\u2019 pack-age (Lundberg et al. 2020). \u2018TreeExplainer\u2019 is based on game theory and approximates Shapley values to compute the contribution of a target variable to the predicted output of tree-based machine learning 133 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 models (Shapley 1953, Lundberg & Lee 2017). It does so by re-running model predictions on the test data-set using all different combinations between vari-ables excluding the target variable, and then repeats this process, now including the target variable. The algorithm then computes the contribution of the tar-get variable based on the average difference in pre-dicted outcomes (Molnar 2020).\n3. RESULTS 3.1. Causal associations The final causal association networks of all 9 spe-cies indicated the existence of independent trends in fish biomass between adjacent seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr. The mean number of seascapes with bio-mass density trends that were independent of adja-cent seascapes at a time lag of zero was 4.7 \u00b1 2.4 SD.\nThis level of independence in biomass density trends at a time lag of zero was highest for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua (8 out of 10 seascapes), European plaice Pleuronectes platessa (7 out of 10 seascapes) and Atlantic herring Clupea harengus (7 out of 10 sea -scapes). It was lowest for starry ray Amblyraja radi-ata (1 out of 10 seascapes) and dragonet Callionymus lyra (2 out of 10 seascapes). This result was inter-preted as the separation between seascapes repre-senting relevant barriers to the processes determin-ing the observed biomass density of Atlantic cod, European plaice and Atlantic herring, but not to those of the starry ray and dragonet. In the remaining 4 species, independence in fish biomass density trends be tween adjacent sites at a time lag of zero ranged be tween 3 and 6 out of 10 seascapes. In these cases, only certain seascapes represented relevant borders to the processes determining the ob -served biomass density, whereas the biomass density trends were directly dependent on each other in the re -maining ad jacent seascapes. An addi-tional type of relationship observed was a temporal dependency at a time lag of zero be tween non-adjacent sea-scapes (Table 2).\nSpecies could be further subdivided based on the level of causal depend-encies in biomass density trends be -tween seascapes at longer time lags of 1\u22122 yr, and the directional gradient in these dynamics. Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting Merlangius merlangus and starry ray were characterized by time-lagged causal dependencies be tween distant seascapes in both directions along the North\u2212South gradient (Fig. 3). In grey gurnard Eu trigla gurnardus and At -lantic herring, exchanges were predominantly uni-directional from South to North (Fig. 4a,b). In drag-onet, ex changes occurred from East to West and from North to South (Fig. 4c). Finally, there was only a sin-gle time-lagged ex change in European sprat Sprat-tus sprattus (Fig. 5a), and no time-lagged ex changes in common dab Limanda limanda (Fig. 5b).\n3.2. Post-hoc test The RFC found that species with a non-fusiform body type, that are strictly demersal, with low to inter-mediate fecundity and maximum age, were most im -portant in predicting the presence of a causal relation-ship between seascapes at a time lag of 0 yr (Fig. 6a).\nThis is opposite to those variables best explaining longer-term causal dependencies at time lags of 1\u2212 2 yr (Fig. 6b). In that case, long-lived, benthopelagic species of large maximum size best predict the pres-ence of causal relationships between seascapes. Fur-thermore, the probability of long-term causal depend-encies between seascapes was positively impacted by small differences in juvenile biomass density and negatively impacted by large differences.\n4. DISCUSSION We found evidence for relationships between the spatial organisation of the seabed structure, i.e. sea-scapes, and population trends of several fish species in the North Sea.

This finding provides the insight that seascapes can function as a bottom-up driver of North Sea fish population dynamics. However, a con-siderable level of caution is warranted in interpreting 135 Fig. 3. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes for (a) Atlantic cod, (b) whiting, (c) starry ray and (d) European plaice. In all 4 species, time-lagged exchanges occur predominantly in both directions between more northern and southern seascapes. Arrow colour and width represent the type and strength of the relationship (red = positive, blue = negative, thin = weak, thick = strong) between different areas. The associated time-lag is listed on the arrow, and if a contemporaneous relationship was present, the border between the areas was removed Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 the results, as the relative standard error in estimated biomass density over time frequently exceeded 30% for species and seascape combinations (Table S2).\nWe further found both positive and negative causal dependencies between seascapes at time lags of 1\u22122 yr in most species. Species such as Atlantic cod, European plaice, whiting and starry ray dis-played clear directional gradients in these longer-term dependencies along a North\u2212South gradient.\nPositive long-term dependencies can potentially be explained by both movement of adult biomass to, and recruitment of juvenile biomass in, the depend-ent seascapes. Negative long-term dependencies cannot be explained by the process of recruitment.\nHowever, they can still be explained by movement of biomass away from a dependent seascape to sur-136 Fig. 4.

The dependent seascape could in this case be considered suboptimal, and the driv-ing seascape more optimal. This would be the in -verse process of that described by the basin model theory (McCall 1990), in which there is adult move-ment away from optimal basins, or seascapes in this case, to suboptimal surrounding basins following the buildup of biomass in the former (Bertrand et al. 2008, Hintzen et al. 2014).\nOur post-hoc test provided a deeper understanding of the ecological meaning of the observed depend-encies at different time lags. We found that non-fusiform morphology and demersal habitat prefer-ences best explained short-term causal dependencies.\nThis combination is particular to the flatfish and ray included in the present study. This might be due to multiple factors. Flatfish such as European plaice ex -hibit more restricted movement patterns and stronger selection of small-scale variations in sediment type compared to benthopelagic species such as Atlantic cod (Gibson & Robb 2000, Hinz et al. 2006, Griffiths et al. 2018). Therefore, smaller-scale processes than those delineated by the seascapes might be more important in these species at the 0 yr time lag. Long-term causal dependencies in biomass density be -tween seascapes were best explained by the adults of large, long-lived, benthopelagic species. In these species, the recruitment of juveniles is unlikely to drive the observed dynamics because differences in juvenile biomass negatively affected the probability of long-term causal dependencies.\nIn this study, we also addressed a missing link be -tween seascape-specific fisheries activities in the North Sea (van der Re\u0133den et al. 2018) and the bio-mass of harvested stocks. van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018, their Fig. 3) showed fishing intensity with a beam trawl to target plaice was highest in seascapes 10 and 7, and the northern part of seascape 6, while otter-mix fishing was highest in the centre of seascape 9 and along the northern and southern borders of sea-scape 8. If these fishing activities affect the distribu-tion of fish biomass, we might have expected to see some effect of this in the post-hoc test. An example would be that short-term ex changes in (adult) bio-mass between intensively and less intensively fished adjacent seascapes are important in explaining the observed causal dependencies. However, no specific combination of seascape pairs was found to be im -portant in explaining the ob served dependencies.\nAlthough it might be tentative to place an explicit link between seascape-specific fisheries activities and exchanges in fish biomass, separate quantitative analysis, including North Sea-wide fishing intensity, 137 Fig. 5. Causal relationships in mean fish biomass density (kg haul\u22121 yr\u22121) between different seascapes. (a) In European sprat, there is a single time-lagged exchange and (b) in common dab, there is no time-lagged exchange; both species therefore lack a clear gradient of exchange. Other details as in Fig. 3 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 677: 129\u2013140, 2021 would be required to provide more conclusive evi-dence. The study of van der Re\u0133den et al. (2018) was based on Dutch fishing fleet data. Consequently, sea-scapes that are assumed to be free from high fishing pressure, based on Dutch data, might turn out to be intensively used by the fleets of other nations.\nThe methodological novelty of our study lies in the application of a causal association network for hypo -thesis testing using ecological time series. These types of data are typical of long-term monitoring programmes, and causal association networks there-fore have a potentially wide applica-bility in ecology. The advantage of this specific causality-based approach is that it explicitly accounts for in -flated or spurious correlations be -tween time series (Pearl 2009). Using a method that accounts for this con-founding effect differentiates our work from other, recent research examin-ing dependencies between time series of fish populations and the environ-ment. For example, Milligan et al.\n(2020) examined time-lagged depend-encies between resource productiv-ity and abundances in deep-sea fish using additive models in combination with cross-correlation analysis. Addi-tive models are a popular tool in ecol-ogy because they can include the effects of categorical and continuous covariates in fitting statistical trends to population time series (Zuur et al.\n2017, Pedersen et al. 2019). Cross-correlating such fitted statistical trends to extract time-lagged dependencies increases the risk of finding spurious relationships inherent to time series analysis (Yule 1926, Olden & Neff 2001, Runge et al. 2014). Although causal association networks explicitly account for this confounding effect, they are not able to include both cat-egorical and continuous covariates a priori. Additional insights can be gained indirectly through post-hoc testing as was done in the present study. However, this approach does not provide the explanatory power on the effects of environmental covariates that additive modelling provides. Therefore, a decision on which combination of methods to apply in future ecological 138 Fig. 6. Ordered variable importance plots for random forest classifier models predicting the presence of a causal relationship between seascapes at a time-lag of (a) 0 yr or (b) 1\u22122 yr. Each dot represents an individual sample from the validation dataset. Dot colour indicates the value of the variable. The position on the x-axis indicates the impact on the predicted probability of a causal lag existing between seascapes.

The presence of causal dependencies between seascapes was best explained by different types of life history traits at different time lags. In a qualitative comparison with previous research, we did not find a clear link be -tween seascape-specific fishery activities and bio-mass trends. Finally, the suitability of using causal association networks to model spatial time series in ecology will depend both on the types of effects a researcher wants to include and the need to model time-lagged dependencies.\nAcknowledgements.

With telemedicine, patients can now receive medical advice, diagnosis, disease management and treatment from the comfort of their homes, increasing their access to care and eliminating physical barriers created by hospital capacity, distance or transportation.\nThis report examines the continued adoption of telemedicine, its applications across various specialties and health care services, and its effects on physician well-being, patient access, and continuity of care. Study findings show that 88% of physicians surveyed believe telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, with many reporting reduced wait times, improved adherence to treatment plans, and decreased no-show rates. Additionally, a consider- able portion of physicians surveyed reported that telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules and positively impacted their feelings of autonomy and work-life balance. Beyond expanding access to health care, telemedicine may also be increasing patients\u2019 willingness to seek medical attention. The majority of all patients surveyed (70%) said they may be more likely to consult with a doctor if they can do so virtually, with convenience and efficiency being primary drivers of adoption. Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year, 85% said it resulted in equivalent or superior quality of care, with the majority reporting increased satisfaction. As the digitization of health care continues, telemedicine is poised to main- tain a pivotal role in health care delivery. Telemedicine and in-person care are not mutually exclusive, and uniting both can help reduce costs, expand access, and improve care for everyone. With further identification and im- plementation of best practices, telemedicine\u2019s capacity to personalize care models, promote continuity of care, and improve patient outcomes will only get stronger.\nReport Introduction 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Introduction 03 Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 04 An analysis of fee-for-service Medicare telemedicine claims throughout 2022 revealed that nearly 47% of billing physicians were users of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform. In the last quarter of 2022 (October to December) alone, Doximity's telemedicine tools were used by over 375,000 unique clinicians.* To gain a deeper understanding of the progression and sustained utilization of telemedicine, Doximity conducted an analysis of how its physician members, across all specialties and practice areas, used its telemedicine tools throughout 2022. To supplement this data, Doximity conducted a survey of over 1,200 of its physician telemedicine users across nine specialties: cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology, endocrinology, rheumatology, pulmonology, and psychiatry.\n*As reported on February 9, 2023 during Doximity\u2019s Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter earnings call 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 05 Physician Insights Telemedicine Insights from Doximity's Physician Membership 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 06 The metro areas with the highest physician adoption of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform in 2022 ranged across all regions of the U.S. New York had the highest overall adoption of telemedicine among physicians, followed by Chicago and Boston.\nMetro Areas with the HIGHEST HIGHEST Adoption 1.

This trend may be attributed to telemedicine\u2019s ability to promote continuity of care and long-term patient-physician relationships. Among all physicians surveyed, over 83% reported they found telemedicine useful in enhancing continuity of care for patients with complex or chronic conditions, and nearly two-thirds (65%) said telemedicine improved communication with their patients. 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 08 Adoption by Specialty Adoption of Telemedicine Highest in Specialties that Manage Chronic Illness 1.

Psychiatry Top Specialty by Adoption Rate \"I\u2019m an advanced heart failure cardiologist, and there are not many of us in the state. With telemedicine, patients now have access to subspecialists which may not be available in their area. In addition, follow ups for things like adjusting a heart failure therapy can be done via telemedicine, eliminating the need for patients to drive long distances for a short office visit. Over the past few years, we\u2019ve learned telemedicine is not a replacement, but a complement to our practices. \u2013 Munir Janmohamed, MD, Medical Director Heart Failure, Dignity Health Medical Foundation 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 09 As health care becomes more digitized, physicians across specialties are integrating telemedicine into their practices. In a survey of Doximity's telemedicine users, nearly 84% of physicians reported using telemedicine at least weekly, with 40% incorporating it into their daily clinical practice. The highest reports of daily use were among psych- iatrists at 84%, followed by endocrinologists at 57%. Looking ahead, the increasing popularity of mobile medicine and remote patient monitoring devices \u2014 estimated to reach 60.6 million U.S. patients by 20243 \u2014\u00ad is likely to drive further demand for reliable and complementary telemedicine solutions.\nFrequency of Use Many Physicians Incorporating Telemedicine into Daily, Weekly Practice *May not sum to 100 due to rounding numbers.\nHow often do you use telemedicine (via voice, video, text, etc.) in your practice?* Monthly 11% Quarterly 3% None of the Above 3% Participant None of the Ab Quarterly Monthly Daily Weekly 44% 40% 11% 3% 3% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 1 Daily 40% Weekly 44% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine As physicians lean into digital, they are embracing multiple telemedicine modalities, with video emerging as the most predominant among physicians surveyed. Audio-only phone visits are also widely employed, demonstrating the need for telemedicine tools that are versatile and adaptable to patients\u2019 needs. According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, Medicare patients with less technology access, lack of video experience, Latinx ethnicity, or limited English pro- ficiency, were all more likely to be offered telephone visits compared to video visits.4 These findings underscore the importance of audio-only options and the ongoing need for inclusive, flexible, and accessible telemedicine and product features that meet the needs of an increasingly diverse patient population.

While one of the most predominant applications among physicians is routine follow-up visits (92% of physicians surveyed), the majority of physicians surveyed (57%) use telemedicine to discuss lab and test results and treatment options with their patients, and this is even higher among oncologists (70%). Telemedicine also offers an important channel for prescription refills and timely follow-ups after a missed in-person visit, while playing a non-trivial role in remote patient monitoring, patient triage and urgent care. Notably, a recent study conducted by Epic Research found that most patients who had a telemedicine visit did not require an in-person follow-up appointment within the same specialty for three months. These findings suggest that telemedicine can provide effective medical attention without the need for additional in-person visits.5 Adoption by Use Case Telemedicine's Role Extends Beyond Routine Care How Physicians Apply Telemedicine in Clinical Practice: Routine Follow-Up Patient Visits Patient Consults Patient Triage Remote Patient Monitoring Test Results and Treatment Options Follow-Ups After Missed In-Person Visits Medication Management Urgent Care 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 12 While the pandemic certainly increased telemedicine use, the opportunity for better time management could help explain its continued adoption. Two-thirds of all physicians surveyed (66%) reported at least one time management benefit, such as greater autonomy and work-life balance, increased productivity, and easier schedule management. In fact, the majority of physicians surveyed reported telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules. As physicians continue to navigate burnout and overwork, these benefits could drive even greater adoption of telemedicine in the future.\nEffects on Productivity, Work-Life Balance Physicians Report Better Time Management \"Telemedicine has made it easier to manage my schedule.\" \"Telemedicine helps me be more productive and better serve my patients.\" \"Telemedicine has provided me with greater autonomy and work-life balance.\" \"Telemedicine helps me to provide care to more patients per day.\" Physician-Reported Benefits of Telemedicine Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 13 Telemedicine is also instrumental in addressing the costly and disruptive issue of patient no-shows for doctor visits. Approximately 61% of physicians surveyed reported a reduction in their patient no-show rates as a result of telemedicine, likely due to the increased convenience, accessibility, and flexibility of virtual care visits. Importantly, 77% of physicians said they have observed either equivalent or improved patient adherence to treatment plans through telemedicine, with less than 2% reporting decreased adherence.\nEffects on Patient Visit, Treatment Adherence Reduces No-Show Rates, Improves or Maintains Adherence to Treatment Plans How has telemedicine affected your patients' adherence to treatment plans?* Not applicable 1 Not applicable 1% Decreased adherence 2% Unsure 21% Increased adherence 37% No change 40% 1 Decreased adherence 2% No change in adherence 40% Increased adherence 37% *May not sum to 100, due to rounding numbers.\nUnsure 21% Not applicable 1% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 14 Patient access also appears to be a leading contributor to telemedicine adoption. Nearly 88% of physicians surveyed said telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, particularly among populations that may have faced barriers to care previously. Similarly, 87% of physicians reported telemedicine has enabled them to provide care to patients who face obstacles visiting their office in person. As additional benefits, nearly 44% of physicians found that telemedicine has actually reduced wait times for their patients, while 41% said telemedicine has expanded their community reach and referral networks.\nEffects on Patient Access Physicians Report Improved Access, Reduced Wait Times for Patients Physicians Who Agree Telemedicine Has Increased Patient Access to Health Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree 88 Neutral 10 Disagree 3 Disagree 3% Neutral 10% Agree 87% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Approximately 92% of physicians surveyed identified ease of use as a key factor in promoting patient access, followed by cross-device compatibility, allowing access from both desktop and mobile devices. Notably, the majority of physicians surveyed identified the ability to avoid application downloads and login-protected patient portals as important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine.\nFactors Influencing Patient Access Ease of Use, Cross-Device Compatibility Key Attributes for Patient Access Which of the following features are important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine?\nEase of use Accessibility across desktop and mobile No application download required No patient portal log-in required Ability to add family member or care partner Language support (translation or interpreter service) 0 100 75 50 25 92% 81% 71% 56% 55% 42% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 16 As telemedicine\u2019s role in U.S. health care continues to evolve, pay parity and the ability to offer telemedicine services across state lines will continue to be two issues that can greatly impact patient access. Among all physicians surveyed, over 78% indicated they believe there should be pay parity between telemedicine and in-person visits, and nearly 84% said the ability to practice telemedicine across state lines is critical to improving patient access to specialists and other timely care. With a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034,1 telemedicine is likely to play a significant role in promoting patient access to care, particularly in rural or underserved areas.\nPolicies to Preserve Patient Access Pay Parity, Licensing Across State Lines Critical to Patient Access Percentage of Physicians Who Agree There Should Be Pay Parity Between Telemedicine and In-Person Visits Percentage of Physicians Who Agree Ability to Practice Telemedicine Across State Lines is Critical to Improving Patient Access to Specialists, Other Timely Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree Neutral Disagree Disagree 4% Neutral 12% Agree 84% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Survey respondents included 1,200 patients who identified as having a chronic illness and 1,200 patients who did not. Among all respondents surveyed, the majority reported participating in a telemedicine visit within the last year (between March 2022 to March 2023). The following analyses examine these patients' direct experiences with telemedicine, as well as broader trends and preferences among the full patient cohort.\nPatient Insights Tracking Patient Perception and Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 19 In 2022, telemedicine reached the 80% adoption mark overall, becoming the preferred channel for prescription care and minor illness.6 While this is a significant milestone, the frequency of telemedicine use is also noteworthy. Based on survey results, nearly 60% of patients who had a telemedicine visit in the past year participated in a minimum of three virtual visits. Over one in five (21%) participated in six or more visits, and this frequency was similar among patients with and without chronic illnesses. Further, nearly 76% of patients who had a telemedicine visit reported it improved their access to health care services.\nTelemedicine Use Among Patients Patients Report Recurring Use of Telemedicine Within One-Year Period In the past year, how many times did you meet with a doctor virtually?* Has virtual care improved your access to health care services?* *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nFundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold 6+ times 21 3-5 times 38 1-2 times 41 41% 38% 21% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Fundrais Participant Unsure No No Change Yes 76% 17% 5% 2% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 3-5 Times 38% No 5% Unsure 2% 1-2 Times 41% Yes 76% 6+ Times 21% No Change 17% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 20 Patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year identified a number of reasons for adoption, with efficiency and convenience being primary drivers. Telemedicine enables patients to consult with their doctors from the comfort of their homes, eliminating the need to interrupt their daily routines or commute to a doctor's office. Importantly, more than one in four patients with a telemedicine visit in the past year reported opting for a virtual visit because they did not believe their situation warranted an in-person appointment. This suggests that telemedicine could play a vital role in ensuring patients less inclined to visit a doctor's office still receive timely medical evaluation. In fact, the majority of all patients surveyed (70%) indicated they may be more likely to consult with a doctor in a non-emergency situation if the visit could be conducted virtually.\nFactors Driving Telemedicine Adoption Efficiency, Convenience Leading Drivers of Patient Adoption *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nWhy did you see your doctor virtually within the past year?* Easier than in-person visit (more convenient) Faster than in-person visit Concerns about COVID-19 and other infections Didn't feel in-person was needed (didn't feel bad enough) Difficulty getting to doctors office Couldn't miss work 0 60 45 30 15 53% 43% 31% 27% 26% 16% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 21 Over the past year, patients participated in telemedicine visits to receive a number of health care services, ranging from routine check-ups to appointments to discuss test results and treatment options. While follow-up appointments appear to be one of the primary applications of telemedicine use, this is likely due to the comprehensive nature of these visits, which can encompass various health care services. Among all patients who had a virtual care visit in the past year, approximately one in three patients (34%) used telemedicine to discuss their medications with their doctor or to refill their prescriptions, while roughly one in five used telemedicine to review test or treatment options. Notably, some of the highest use of telemedicine for these services was among patients with chronic illnesses.\nAdoption by Health Care Service Strong Telemedicine Adoption for Routine Visits, Medication Management What type(s) of care have you received virtually in the past year?\nFollow-ups after an in-person visit Regular check-ups Medication management and refills Review of test or lab results Mental health appointments Review of test or treatment options Same-day appointments (non-emergency) Urgent or emergency care Remote monitoring device check-up 0 50 38 25 13 46% 36% 34% 32% 25% 20% 17% 11% 9% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 22 Patients are also embracing a variety of telemedicine modalities to cater to their diverse needs and preferences. These modalities include video consultations, audio-only phone calls, and chat or text messaging. Among all patients surveyed, video emerged as the most preferred modality, with audio- only phone visits closely behind. These relatively strong preferences across modalities underscore the need for adaptable and flexible telemedicine solutions that can promote a positive patient experience for all.\nPreferences by Modality Patients Report Similar Preferences for Video, Audio-Only Visits Which types of virtual care formats do you prefer?\nAll Patients Patients with Telemedicine Visit in Past Year Video Phone (audio only) Chat or text messaging I prefer to meet with my doctor in person 15 0 30 45 60 42% 56% 39% 46% 27% 31% 27% 13% Computer (laptop/desktop) 51% Tablet or iPad 38% Home phone or basic cell phone 20% Wi-Fi or Internet 54% Among all patients surveyed, the majority (77%) reported having regular access to a smartphone, making it the most commonly available device for virtual health care visits. This was followed by computers at 51% and tablets at 38%. Importantly, only 54% of respondents reported having reg- ular access to Wi-Fi, underscoring the need for flexible telemedicine solutions that can easily adapt to meet individual patients\u2019 needs, including adjusting for no or low internet connection. In terms of patient preferences, 60% of respondents indicated a strong preference for using mobile devices for telemedicine visits, with less than one-fourth (24%) reporting a preference for computers.\n2023 State of Telemedicine Report 23 Device Access and Preferences Patients Continue to Favor, Depend on Smartphones Which of the following resources do you have regular access to for virtual health care visits?\nSmartphone 0 20 40 60 80 77% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 24 Consistent with prior year findings, patients continue to report equivalent or superior quality of care as the result of their experience with telemedicine. Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit within the past year, 85% reported their overall care was better or about the same with virtual care, and over half indicated increased satisfaction. These results underscore telemedicine\u2019s ability to enhance patient experiences and outcomes, making it a valuable tool in modern health care delivery.\nTelemedicine Satisfaction, Quality of Care Patients Report Increased Satisfaction, Equivalent or Superior Quality of Care Which of the following best represents your experience with virtual care overall?* How has virtual care affected your satisfaction with your care?* F Participant My overall care My overall care My overall care same Unsure 9% 46% 39% 6% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold My overall care is worse 7 My overall care is better 34 Increased Satisfaction 54 Unsure 5 5% 54% 34% 7% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Increased satisfaction 54% Unsure 9% Unsure 5% Decreased satisfaction 7% My overall care is worse 6% No change in satisfaction 34% My overall care is about the same 46% My overall care is better 39% *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\n2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 25 Expectations for Future Use Patients Emphasize Importance of Virtual Care Options Nearly 67% of patients with a telemedicine visit in the past year emphasized the importance of their doctor providing virtual care options, and this number was even higher among patients who had three or more telemedicine visits (72%). Notably, the large majority of patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year (83%) indicated they expect to maintain or increase their usage of telemedicine in the future.\nof patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year indicated they expect to maintain or increase their usage of telemedicine in the future 83% Conclusion, Methodology, & Sources 26 With strong adoption among physicians and patients, telemedicine is poised to maintain an important role in health care delivery, particularly as the U.S. contin- ues to grapple with physician burnout and shortage and an aging population. Moving forward, uniting telemedicine with in-person care will help personalize care models, promote more equitable access to care, and strengthen the overall health care system for all. By leveraging the advantages of both telemedicine and in-person care, physicians as well as care teams can create flexible and adaptable models that better meet the diverse needs of their patients. This flexibility could also provide much- needed support for physicians and other medical professionals, as they continue to navigate a complex and evolving health care landscape.\nConclusion, Methodology & Sources Conclusion 27 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Conclusion, Methodology & Sources 28 Physician Insights Medicare Telemedicine Insights: Doximity partnered with CareJourney, a health analytics organization, to measure the number of physicians billing a set of Medicare telemedicine codes throughout 2022. The corresponding national provider identifier (NPI) numbers were compared to Doximity user data to assess the rate at which this cohort used Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform.

With telemedicine, patients can now receive medical advice, diagnosis, disease management and treatment from the comfort of their homes, increasing their access to care and eliminating physical barriers created by hospital capacity, distance or transportation.\nThis report examines the continued adoption of telemedicine, its applications across various specialties and health care services, and its effects on physician well-being, patient access, and continuity of care. Study findings show that 88% of physicians surveyed believe telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, with many reporting reduced wait times, improved adherence to treatment plans, and decreased no-show rates. Additionally, a consider- able portion of physicians surveyed reported that telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules and positively impacted their feelings of autonomy and work-life balance. Beyond expanding access to health care, telemedicine may also be increasing patients\u2019 willingness to seek medical attention. The majority of all patients surveyed (70%) said they may be more likely to consult with a doctor if they can do so virtually, with convenience and efficiency being primary drivers of adoption. Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year, 85% said it resulted in equivalent or superior quality of care, with the majority reporting increased satisfaction. As the digitization of health care continues, telemedicine is poised to main- tain a pivotal role in health care delivery. Telemedicine and in-person care are not mutually exclusive, and uniting both can help reduce costs, expand access, and improve care for everyone. With further identification and im- plementation of best practices, telemedicine\u2019s capacity to personalize care models, promote continuity of care, and improve patient outcomes will only get stronger.\nReport Introduction 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Introduction 03 Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 04 An analysis of fee-for-service Medicare telemedicine claims throughout 2022 revealed that nearly 47% of billing physicians were users of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform. In the last quarter of 2022 (October to December) alone, Doximity's telemedicine tools were used by over 375,000 unique clinicians.* To gain a deeper understanding of the progression and sustained utilization of telemedicine, Doximity conducted an analysis of how its physician members, across all specialties and practice areas, used its telemedicine tools throughout 2022. To supplement this data, Doximity conducted a survey of over 1,200 of its physician telemedicine users across nine specialties: cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology, endocrinology, rheumatology, pulmonology, and psychiatry.\n*As reported on February 9, 2023 during Doximity\u2019s Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter earnings call 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 05 Physician Insights Telemedicine Insights from Doximity's Physician Membership 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 06 The metro areas with the highest physician adoption of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform in 2022 ranged across all regions of the U.S. New York had the highest overall adoption of telemedicine among physicians, followed by Chicago and Boston.\nMetro Areas with the HIGHEST HIGHEST Adoption 1.

This trend may be attributed to telemedicine\u2019s ability to promote continuity of care and long-term patient-physician relationships. Among all physicians surveyed, over 83% reported they found telemedicine useful in enhancing continuity of care for patients with complex or chronic conditions, and nearly two-thirds (65%) said telemedicine improved communication with their patients. 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 08 Adoption by Specialty Adoption of Telemedicine Highest in Specialties that Manage Chronic Illness 1.

With telemedicine, patients now have access to subspecialists which may not be available in their area. In addition, follow ups for things like adjusting a heart failure therapy can be done via telemedicine, eliminating the need for patients to drive long distances for a short office visit. Over the past few years, we\u2019ve learned telemedicine is not a replacement, but a complement to our practices. \u2013 Munir Janmohamed, MD, Medical Director Heart Failure, Dignity Health Medical Foundation 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 09 As health care becomes more digitized, physicians across specialties are integrating telemedicine into their practices. In a survey of Doximity's telemedicine users, nearly 84% of physicians reported using telemedicine at least weekly, with 40% incorporating it into their daily clinical practice. The highest reports of daily use were among psych- iatrists at 84%, followed by endocrinologists at 57%. Looking ahead, the increasing popularity of mobile medicine and remote patient monitoring devices \u2014 estimated to reach 60.6 million U.S. patients by 20243 \u2014\u00ad is likely to drive further demand for reliable and complementary telemedicine solutions.\nFrequency of Use Many Physicians Incorporating Telemedicine into Daily, Weekly Practice *May not sum to 100 due to rounding numbers.\nHow often do you use telemedicine (via voice, video, text, etc.) in your practice?* Monthly 11% Quarterly 3% None of the Above 3% Participant None of the Ab Quarterly Monthly Daily Weekly 44% 40% 11% 3% 3% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 1 Daily 40% Weekly 44% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine As physicians lean into digital, they are embracing multiple telemedicine modalities, with video emerging as the most predominant among physicians surveyed. Audio-only phone visits are also widely employed, demonstrating the need for telemedicine tools that are versatile and adaptable to patients\u2019 needs. According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, Medicare patients with less technology access, lack of video experience, Latinx ethnicity, or limited English pro- ficiency, were all more likely to be offered telephone visits compared to video visits.4 These findings underscore the importance of audio-only options and the ongoing need for inclusive, flexible, and accessible telemedicine and product features that meet the needs of an increasingly diverse patient population.

While one of the most predominant applications among physicians is routine follow-up visits (92% of physicians surveyed), the majority of physicians surveyed (57%) use telemedicine to discuss lab and test results and treatment options with their patients, and this is even higher among oncologists (70%). Telemedicine also offers an important channel for prescription refills and timely follow-ups after a missed in-person visit, while playing a non-trivial role in remote patient monitoring, patient triage and urgent care. Notably, a recent study conducted by Epic Research found that most patients who had a telemedicine visit did not require an in-person follow-up appointment within the same specialty for three months. These findings suggest that telemedicine can provide effective medical attention without the need for additional in-person visits.5 Adoption by Use Case Telemedicine's Role Extends Beyond Routine Care How Physicians Apply Telemedicine in Clinical Practice: Routine Follow-Up Patient Visits Patient Consults Patient Triage Remote Patient Monitoring Test Results and Treatment Options Follow-Ups After Missed In-Person Visits Medication Management Urgent Care 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 12 While the pandemic certainly increased telemedicine use, the opportunity for better time management could help explain its continued adoption. Two-thirds of all physicians surveyed (66%) reported at least one time management benefit, such as greater autonomy and work-life balance, increased productivity, and easier schedule management. In fact, the majority of physicians surveyed reported telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules. As physicians continue to navigate burnout and overwork, these benefits could drive even greater adoption of telemedicine in the future.\nEffects on Productivity, Work-Life Balance Physicians Report Better Time Management \"Telemedicine has made it easier to manage my schedule.\" \"Telemedicine helps me be more productive and better serve my patients.\" \"Telemedicine has provided me with greater autonomy and work-life balance.\" \"Telemedicine helps me to provide care to more patients per day.\" Physician-Reported Benefits of Telemedicine Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 13 Telemedicine is also instrumental in addressing the costly and disruptive issue of patient no-shows for doctor visits. Approximately 61% of physicians surveyed reported a reduction in their patient no-show rates as a result of telemedicine, likely due to the increased convenience, accessibility, and flexibility of virtual care visits. Importantly, 77% of physicians said they have observed either equivalent or improved patient adherence to treatment plans through telemedicine, with less than 2% reporting decreased adherence.\nEffects on Patient Visit, Treatment Adherence Reduces No-Show Rates, Improves or Maintains Adherence to Treatment Plans How has telemedicine affected your patients' adherence to treatment plans?* Not applicable 1 Not applicable 1% Decreased adherence 2% Unsure 21% Increased adherence 37% No change 40% 1 Decreased adherence 2% No change in adherence 40% Increased adherence 37% *May not sum to 100, due to rounding numbers.\nUnsure 21% Not applicable 1% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 14 Patient access also appears to be a leading contributor to telemedicine adoption. Nearly 88% of physicians surveyed said telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, particularly among populations that may have faced barriers to care previously. Similarly, 87% of physicians reported telemedicine has enabled them to provide care to patients who face obstacles visiting their office in person. As additional benefits, nearly 44% of physicians found that telemedicine has actually reduced wait times for their patients, while 41% said telemedicine has expanded their community reach and referral networks.\nEffects on Patient Access Physicians Report Improved Access, Reduced Wait Times for Patients Physicians Who Agree Telemedicine Has Increased Patient Access to Health Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree 88 Neutral 10 Disagree 3 Disagree 3% Neutral 10% Agree 87% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Approximately 92% of physicians surveyed identified ease of use as a key factor in promoting patient access, followed by cross-device compatibility, allowing access from both desktop and mobile devices. Notably, the majority of physicians surveyed identified the ability to avoid application downloads and login-protected patient portals as important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine.\nFactors Influencing Patient Access Ease of Use, Cross-Device Compatibility Key Attributes for Patient Access Which of the following features are important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine?\nEase of use Accessibility across desktop and mobile No application download required No patient portal log-in required Ability to add family member or care partner Language support (translation or interpreter service) 0 100 75 50 25 92% 81% 71% 56% 55% 42% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 16 As telemedicine\u2019s role in U.S. health care continues to evolve, pay parity and the ability to offer telemedicine services across state lines will continue to be two issues that can greatly impact patient access. Among all physicians surveyed, over 78% indicated they believe there should be pay parity between telemedicine and in-person visits, and nearly 84% said the ability to practice telemedicine across state lines is critical to improving patient access to specialists and other timely care. With a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034,1 telemedicine is likely to play a significant role in promoting patient access to care, particularly in rural or underserved areas.\nPolicies to Preserve Patient Access Pay Parity, Licensing Across State Lines Critical to Patient Access Percentage of Physicians Who Agree There Should Be Pay Parity Between Telemedicine and In-Person Visits Percentage of Physicians Who Agree Ability to Practice Telemedicine Across State Lines is Critical to Improving Patient Access to Specialists, Other Timely Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree Neutral Disagree Disagree 4% Neutral 12% Agree 84% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Survey respondents included 1,200 patients who identified as having a chronic illness and 1,200 patients who did not. Among all respondents surveyed, the majority reported participating in a telemedicine visit within the last year (between March 2022 to March 2023). The following analyses examine these patients' direct experiences with telemedicine, as well as broader trends and preferences among the full patient cohort.\nPatient Insights Tracking Patient Perception and Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 19 In 2022, telemedicine reached the 80% adoption mark overall, becoming the preferred channel for prescription care and minor illness.6 While this is a significant milestone, the frequency of telemedicine use is also noteworthy. Based on survey results, nearly 60% of patients who had a telemedicine visit in the past year participated in a minimum of three virtual visits. Over one in five (21%) participated in six or more visits, and this frequency was similar among patients with and without chronic illnesses. Further, nearly 76% of patients who had a telemedicine visit reported it improved their access to health care services.\nTelemedicine Use Among Patients Patients Report Recurring Use of Telemedicine Within One-Year Period In the past year, how many times did you meet with a doctor virtually?* Has virtual care improved your access to health care services?* *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nFundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold 6+ times 21 3-5 times 38 1-2 times 41 41% 38% 21% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Fundrais Participant Unsure No No Change Yes 76% 17% 5% 2% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 3-5 Times 38% No 5% Unsure 2% 1-2 Times 41% Yes 76% 6+ Times 21% No Change 17% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 20 Patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year identified a number of reasons for adoption, with efficiency and convenience being primary drivers. Telemedicine enables patients to consult with their doctors from the comfort of their homes, eliminating the need to interrupt their daily routines or commute to a doctor's office. Importantly, more than one in four patients with a telemedicine visit in the past year reported opting for a virtual visit because they did not believe their situation warranted an in-person appointment. This suggests that telemedicine could play a vital role in ensuring patients less inclined to visit a doctor's office still receive timely medical evaluation. In fact, the majority of all patients surveyed (70%) indicated they may be more likely to consult with a doctor in a non-emergency situation if the visit could be conducted virtually.\nFactors Driving Telemedicine Adoption Efficiency, Convenience Leading Drivers of Patient Adoption *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nWhy did you see your doctor virtually within the past year?* Easier than in-person visit (more convenient) Faster than in-person visit Concerns about COVID-19 and other infections Didn't feel in-person was needed (didn't feel bad enough) Difficulty getting to doctors office Couldn't miss work 0 60 45 30 15 53% 43% 31% 27% 26% 16% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 21 Over the past year, patients participated in telemedicine visits to receive a number of health care services, ranging from routine check-ups to appointments to discuss test results and treatment options. While follow-up appointments appear to be one of the primary applications of telemedicine use, this is likely due to the comprehensive nature of these visits, which can encompass various health care services. Among all patients who had a virtual care visit in the past year, approximately one in three patients (34%) used telemedicine to discuss their medications with their doctor or to refill their prescriptions, while roughly one in five used telemedicine to review test or treatment options. Notably, some of the highest use of telemedicine for these services was among patients with chronic illnesses.\nAdoption by Health Care Service Strong Telemedicine Adoption for Routine Visits, Medication Management What type(s) of care have you received virtually in the past year?\nFollow-ups after an in-person visit Regular check-ups Medication management and refills Review of test or lab results Mental health appointments Review of test or treatment options Same-day appointments (non-emergency) Urgent or emergency care Remote monitoring device check-up 0 50 38 25 13 46% 36% 34% 32% 25% 20% 17% 11% 9% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 22 Patients are also embracing a variety of telemedicine modalities to cater to their diverse needs and preferences. These modalities include video consultations, audio-only phone calls, and chat or text messaging. Among all patients surveyed, video emerged as the most preferred modality, with audio- only phone visits closely behind. These relatively strong preferences across modalities underscore the need for adaptable and flexible telemedicine solutions that can promote a positive patient experience for all.\nPreferences by Modality Patients Report Similar Preferences for Video, Audio-Only Visits Which types of virtual care formats do you prefer?\nAll Patients Patients with Telemedicine Visit in Past Year Video Phone (audio only) Chat or text messaging I prefer to meet with my doctor in person 15 0 30 45 60 42% 56% 39% 46% 27% 31% 27% 13% Computer (laptop/desktop) 51% Tablet or iPad 38% Home phone or basic cell phone 20% Wi-Fi or Internet 54% Among all patients surveyed, the majority (77%) reported having regular access to a smartphone, making it the most commonly available device for virtual health care visits. This was followed by computers at 51% and tablets at 38%. Importantly, only 54% of respondents reported having reg- ular access to Wi-Fi, underscoring the need for flexible telemedicine solutions that can easily adapt to meet individual patients\u2019 needs, including adjusting for no or low internet connection. In terms of patient preferences, 60% of respondents indicated a strong preference for using mobile devices for telemedicine visits, with less than one-fourth (24%) reporting a preference for computers.\n2023 State of Telemedicine Report 23 Device Access and Preferences Patients Continue to Favor, Depend on Smartphones Which of the following resources do you have regular access to for virtual health care visits?\nSmartphone 0 20 40 60 80 77% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 24 Consistent with prior year findings, patients continue to report equivalent or superior quality of care as the result of their experience with telemedicine. Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit within the past year, 85% reported their overall care was better or about the same with virtual care, and over half indicated increased satisfaction. These results underscore telemedicine\u2019s ability to enhance patient experiences and outcomes, making it a valuable tool in modern health care delivery.\nTelemedicine Satisfaction, Quality of Care Patients Report Increased Satisfaction, Equivalent or Superior Quality of Care Which of the following best represents your experience with virtual care overall?* How has virtual care affected your satisfaction with your care?* F Participant My overall care My overall care My overall care same Unsure 9% 46% 39% 6% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold My overall care is worse 7 My overall care is better 34 Increased Satisfaction 54 Unsure 5 5% 54% 34% 7% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Increased satisfaction 54% Unsure 9% Unsure 5% Decreased satisfaction 7% My overall care is worse 6% No change in satisfaction 34% My overall care is about the same 46% My overall care is better 39% *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\n2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 25 Expectations for Future Use Patients Emphasize Importance of Virtual Care Options Nearly 67% of patients with a telemedicine visit in the past year emphasized the importance of their doctor providing virtual care options, and this number was even higher among patients who had three or more telemedicine visits (72%). Notably, the large majority of patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year (83%) indicated they expect to maintain or increase their usage of telemedicine in the future.\nof patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year indicated they expect to maintain or increase their usage of telemedicine in the future 83% Conclusion, Methodology, & Sources 26 With strong adoption among physicians and patients, telemedicine is poised to maintain an important role in health care delivery, particularly as the U.S. contin- ues to grapple with physician burnout and shortage and an aging population. Moving forward, uniting telemedicine with in-person care will help personalize care models, promote more equitable access to care, and strengthen the overall health care system for all. By leveraging the advantages of both telemedicine and in-person care, physicians as well as care teams can create flexible and adaptable models that better meet the diverse needs of their patients. This flexibility could also provide much- needed support for physicians and other medical professionals, as they continue to navigate a complex and evolving health care landscape.\nConclusion, Methodology & Sources Conclusion 27 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Conclusion, Methodology & Sources 28 Physician Insights Medicare Telemedicine Insights: Doximity partnered with CareJourney, a health analytics organization, to measure the number of physicians billing a set of Medicare telemedicine codes throughout 2022. The corresponding national provider identifier (NPI) numbers were compared to Doximity user data to assess the rate at which this cohort used Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform. Adoption by Age and Metro Areas: Responses were drawn from physicians who were users of Doximity\u2019s telemedicine platform in 2022. Data was mapped across metropolitan statistical areas.\nSpecialty Rank: The specialty rank list was drawn from physicians who were users of our telemedicine platform in 2022. Pediatric specialties and some adult subspecialties were folded into their adult general specialty. For example, colorectal surgery was included in general surgery.\nPhysician Survey: Doximity conducted a survey of its physician telemedicine users via SurveyMonkey to supplement its existing physician adoption insights. This survey was completed by over 1,200 U.S. physicians across nine different specialties: cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology, oncology, pulmonology, psychiatry, and rheumatology. Doximity conducted the survey in March 2023. Survey participant demographics are not population-based and findings therefore may not be able to be extrapolated to the broader physician population.\nPatient Insights Doximity powered this section from a patient survey conducted via Pollfish. This survey included 2,400 U.S. adults. The survey was distributed to two respondent groups: 1,200 respondents who identified as having a chronic illness and 1,200 respondents who identified as not having a chronic illness. Doximity conducted the survey in March 2023. Survey participant demographics are not population-based and findings therefore may not be able to be extrapolated to the general population.\nMethodology 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Conclusion, Methodology & Sources 29 \u00b9 The Complexities of Physician Supply and Demand: Projections From 2019 to 2034.

More information is available at the\u202fCDC\u2019s website.\nWhere can I get a vaccine?\nVaccines are administered at retail pharmacies, including Walgreens, Walmart and CVS, clinics and other locations, such as doctor\u2019s offices. Use the federal government\u2019s website Vaccines.gov to search for vaccination sites by ZIP code. Get the same information by texting your ZIP code to 438829 or by calling 800-232-0233. You can check with your primary care physician\u2019s office to see if COVID-19 vaccinations are offered. If you are a veteran, the Department of Veterans Affairs offers COVID-19 vaccinations at VA facilities. Sign up online or call 800-827-1000 to make an appointment.More information about COVID-19 vaccines is available at the Florida Department of Health\u2019s Florida COVID-19 Response website and on the department\u2019s Facebook page. You can also call one of the department\u2019s local health offices, which are listed at the top right-hand side of the department\u2019s home page under \u201cCounties.\u201d Get advice for finding or requesting your vaccination records on the Florida Department of Health\u2019s website or visit Florida SHOTS, a free, online, statewide immunization system.\nDo I have to pay for the vaccination?\nThe federal government no longer covers the cost of the vaccines, but most people with Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance will not have to pay out of pocket for the shot.If you are uninsured, contact your local or state public health department or a nearby federally qualified health center about vaccination opportunities.Children 18 and younger may qualify to receive no-cost or low-cost vaccines through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program.Florida residents can check whether they qualify for the Vaccines for Adults (VFA) Program or Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program.\nWhat should I bring to my vaccine appointment?\nSome vaccination sites ask for proof of identity or eligibility. Bring a driver\u2019s license or other state-issued ID that shows your name, age and state residency, along with your health insurance card.\nDo I need to bring my vaccine card?\n The CDC no longer distributes vaccine cards, and\u202fthey are not required to receive a vaccine. If you\u2019ve lost your vaccine card, you can call the site where you were vaccinated to request a new one or a copy of your vaccination record. You can also contact the Florida Department of Health to get a copy of your record.\nWhat are the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine?\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to experience mild to moderate side effects after getting vaccinated, such as soreness in the arm, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, nausea, fever or chills \u2014 but these are temporary \u201cand normal signs that your body is building protection,\u201d the CDC says.A small number of vaccine recipients have experienced adverse reactions to the shots.\nCan I get the COVID-19, RSV and flu vaccines at the same time?\nAccording to the CDC, it is safe to receive the flu vaccine and updated COVID-19 vaccines simultaneously, although you are a little more likely to experience side effects, such as a headache and fatigue. Adults 75 or older (and those 60 to 74 with certain underlying health conditions) who are encouraged to get the RSV vaccine may receive that at the same time as the others, but some health experts suggest\u202fspacing them out. If you had the RSV vaccine last year, you don\u2019t need another one this year.Contact your health care provider for more information.\nHow are vaccinations working in nursing homes and long-term care facilities?\nThe U.S. government no longer distributes COVID-19 vaccines to long-term care facilities. That means nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other long-term care settings are responsible for coordinating COVID-19 vaccination programs for their residents and staff. Most long-term care facilities have partnerships with pharmacies or health departments to provide vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and other illnesses. Long-term care facilities that receive Medicare and/or Medicaid dollars are required by\u202ffederal law\u202fto educate residents, their representatives and staff about COVID-19 vaccines and offer a COVID-19 vaccine to residents, resident representatives and staff.\nHow protected am I postvaccination?\nAll vaccines reduce the risk of COVID-19 infections and are highly effective at preventing severe illness and death from the disease. No vaccine is 100 percent effective, and infections can still occur postvaccination.\nHow can I avoid COVID-19 scams?\u00a0\nBe aware that scammers often purport to offer COVID-19 vaccines and treatments and try to charge for them. The \u202fAARP Fraud Watch Network is tracking the latest scams.Florida residents who believe they\u2019ve encountered a COVID-19 scam can report it to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General by calling 800-447-8477 or by submitting a complaint online.Editor's note: This guide was last published Oct. 5, 2023, and has been updated with new information.Michelle Tuccitto Sullo is a contributing writer covering state and federal policy.

Updated COVID vaccines are chosen to target the variants currently circulating and are recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older.\nIn this Q&A, Andy Pekosz, PhD, a professor in Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, discusses who the updated vaccine is recommended for, when to get yours, whether it\u2019s safe to get it alongside other seasonal vaccines.\nWhat\u2019s new about this year\u2019s updated COVID vaccines?\nThe updated mRNA COVID vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer are based on the KP.2 strain, one of the FLiRT variants that have been spreading since early spring. These variants and their sub-variants have caused the majority of infections during this summer\u2019s COVID wave.\nWho should be getting an updated COVID vaccine?\nEveryone 6 months and older should get vaccinated against COVID, according to the CDC\u2019s recommendations.\nFor children ages 6 months to 4 years: Vaccination is recommended, but the number of vaccinations is based on which vaccine they receive, their age, and whether they\u2019ve received a previous COVID vaccine. Parents and guardians should refer to CDC guidance and check with their pediatrician to see what\u2019s recommended for their child.\nFor people ages 5 years and up: One dose of the updated COVID vaccine is recommended, regardless of whether they\u2019ve been vaccinated previously. If someone has received a COVID vaccine recently, they should wait at least two months before getting the updated one for this season.\nAccording to updated CDC guidelines, individuals who are immunocompromised may receive additional doses with their health care provider\u2019s guidance.\nWhen is the best time to get vaccinated?\nThis summer\u2019s surge has been larger and lasted longer than many experts anticipated, making it a little trickier than years past to determine the best time to get vaccinated.\nPeople who have not had COVID in the past few months have a couple options:\n\nGet the updated COVID vaccine as soon as it\u2019s available\u00a0(late August, early September) to protect yourself as the wave of summer infections continues.\nGet the updated COVID vaccine around mid-October to build protection in time for the rise of cases that typically occur around November through January.\n\nPeople at higher risk of severe illness should consider getting an updated COVID vaccine as soon as possible. Everyone who is eligible should get an updated COVID vaccine by mid-October in order to build immunity ahead of holiday travel and gatherings. Remember, it takes about two weeks to build up immunity following a vaccine, so schedule your vaccination accordingly.\nHow long does protection last after I'm vaccinated?\nBroadly speaking, the COVID vaccine provides strong protection against infection for up to three months and protection against severe disease out to six months. That said, there are a lot of variables that can affect duration and strength of protection, including any new variants that may emerge and how different they are from the vaccine formulation.\nIf I had COVID recently, when should I get the updated vaccine?\nIf you\u2019ve had COVID this summer, you\u2019ll have strong infection-based immunity and can wait a few months after your infection before getting the vaccine. According to the CDC, you can wait three months since your symptoms began or, for asymptomatic cases, since you first tested positive.\nThere\u2019s some evidence to support waiting as long as six months after a COVID infection to receive an updated vaccine. Waiting longer than the CDC\u2019s guidance of three months is not recommended for high-risk groups, but it\u2019s something people can discuss with their doctor.\nHow should I choose which COVID vaccine to get?\nBetween the two mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer, there is no reason to get one over the other. They target the same KP.2 variant, are similarly effective, and elicit similar side effects.\nIs the COVID vaccine free?\nThe COVID vaccine is free under most health insurance plans and Medicare.\nIf you don\u2019t have insurance to cover the cost of the COVID vaccine, look for vaccination clinics run by your local or state health department. Children under 18 may also be eligible to get a free COVID vaccine through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program.\nYou can find local pharmacies offering COVID vaccines at Vaccines.gov or by contacting your health care provider or local health department.\nAre there any side effects to the updated COVID vaccine?\nThe common side effects are the same as with previous COVID vaccines. Symptoms like soreness at the injection site, achiness or joint pain, fatigue, slight fever, chills, or nausea are normal and not cause for concern. These side effects are a sign that your body is mounting an immune response\u2014exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do following a vaccine. Side effects generally subside within a day or two.\nIf I haven\u2019t gotten any COVID vaccines yet, can I start with this one?\nIf you\u2019ve never been vaccinated against COVID, now is a great time to start. People 5 years of age and older are considered up to date on COVID vaccination once they receive one dose of an updated mRNA COVID vaccine.\nHow well does the vaccine protect against the variants currently circulating?\nThe vaccine is a close match to variants currently circulating and provides good protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. While KP.2 is not causing a significant number of infections, the most prevalent variants circulating right now are very closely related to them. The vaccine will never be a perfect match to the circulating variants because it takes 2-4 months to make the vaccine, and during that time the virus continues to change as it infects people.\nIs vaccine-induced immunity better than immunity from infection?\nVaccine-induced immunity is better because it\u2019s safer. When you get infected with COVID, symptoms from the infection wreak havoc on your body. Whether or not you\u2019ve been infected or vaccinated previously, the updated COVID vaccine is going to strengthen your immune responses to high levels and do so in a safe way.\nCan I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated?\nPeople who are vaccinated can still get COVID, but it is much more likely they will experience mild symptoms. Vaccinated people are much less likely to experience severe illness or get so sick that they need to be hospitalized. Data continue to show that those who are hospitalized with COVID are largely people who have not received a COVID vaccine within the past 12 months.\nParticularly for people at higher risk of severe COVID, vaccination is an essential tool for reducing COVID complications, hospitalization, and death.\nCan you get the flu shot and the COVID vaccine at the same time?\nYes! In fact, studies have shown that people who decide to spread out their vaccines into separate appointments often don\u2019t follow through with getting both. We\u2019ve also seen that the immune response generated by each vaccine does not change based on whether they are administered at the same time or separately.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that many of the same populations at high risk of experiencing severe illness from COVID are also at high risk of severe influenza. Especially for these vulnerable populations, it\u2019s a good idea to time your vaccines together.\nWhen might we see a combined COVID and flu vaccine?\nSome vaccine manufacturers have been working on developing a combined vaccine for COVID and flu, but we\u2019re not there yet. We certainly won\u2019t see a combined vaccine this year. It\u2019s possible one will be ready in time for fall 2025, but we won\u2019t know for sure until more clinical trial results are available.\nAliza Rosen is a digital content strategist in the Office of External Affairs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nRelated Articles:\n\nUnderstanding the CDC\u2019s Updated COVID Isolation Guidance\nWhat to Know About COVID FLiRT Variants\nThe Long History of mRNA Vaccines\n\nRelated Content\n\nA \u2018Critical Pathogen\u2019: The Rise of Drug-Resistant Fungal Diseases\nAugust 27, 2024\n\nWhy We\u2019re Still Waiting for a Pandemic Treaty\nAugust 12, 2024\n\nWhy COVID Surges in the Summer\nAugust 07, 2024\n\nThe Visible and Unseen Dangers Lurking in Floodwater\nJuly 30, 2024\n\nPublic Health Prep for the 2024 Paris Olympics\nJuly 24, 2024\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\n615 N.

      "The Cost of Common Surgeries Compared\nUpdated: 13 September 2024\nAustralia\u2019s healthcare system is divided into two distinct sectors. Private and public. With the public system, public patients are covered by Medicare and often do not have many out-of-pocket fees. The downside to Medicare is that they do not cover every procedure. The private system has more freedom in choice and a faster expectation regarding the surgery date. The downside to this system is that it is often expensive and requires a good health insurance policy that will cover all the associated costs that Medicare cannot.\nKey facts\nCompare Health Insurance Quotes\nProtect what\u2019s most important to you.

Please consider the PDS before purchasing any products.\nUnderstanding Surgery Costs in Australia\nSurgeries are classified into three distinct groups. Urgent, elective and cosmetic.\u00a0Understanding each surgery type will assist you in knowing if your health insurance policy covers it.\u00a0Let\u2019s look closely at these surgery types, the difference between each and why they are necessary.\nMedicare and surgery\nMedicare is free health insurance for all Australian residents. Medicare assists in covering most fees at a public hospital and some at a private hospital.\u00a0Medicare\u00a0does not cover the costs of accommodation and theatre at private hospitals. Private health insurance is important because it creates a safety blanket between you and unforeseen costs. Different health insurance policies are tailored to different requirements. Before any procedure, you must speak to your health insurance provider to\u00a0understand the associated coverage and what out-of-pocket costs can be expected.\nPrivate Surgery and Associated Costs\nPrivate health insurance\u00a0covers any costs that Medicare does not. This may include accommodation, theatre and ambulance costs. Private health insurance offers three packages: Hospital, Extras and Combined. Hospital policies cover costs associated with being a private patient in a private hospital. Extras policies cover out-of-hospital costs that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover, as well as ambulance cover for those who live in a state that does not provide ambulance cover. Combined cover is an option that merges both hospital and extras policies. Identifying your personal requirements will assist you in choosing the health insurance policy that meets your needs.\nWhen the costs of your procedure are larger than your policy\u2019s coverage, you will often need to pay for it out-of-pocket or as a copayment. The medical gap scheme assists you in this situation. This is usually a result of specialist fees, bulk billing availability and the services you need. The amount owed is referred to as \u2018the gap\u2019.

      "The Cost of Common Surgeries Compared\nUpdated: 13 September 2024\nAustralia\u2019s healthcare system is divided into two distinct sectors. Private and public. With the public system, public patients are covered by Medicare and often do not have many out-of-pocket fees. The downside to Medicare is that they do not cover every procedure. The private system has more freedom in choice and a faster expectation regarding the surgery date. The downside to this system is that it is often expensive and requires a good health insurance policy that will cover all the associated costs that Medicare cannot.\nKey facts\nCompare Health Insurance Quotes\nProtect what\u2019s most important to you.

Please consider the PDS before purchasing any products.\nUnderstanding Surgery Costs in Australia\nSurgeries are classified into three distinct groups. Urgent, elective and cosmetic.\u00a0Understanding each surgery type will assist you in knowing if your health insurance policy covers it.\u00a0Let\u2019s look closely at these surgery types, the difference between each and why they are necessary.\nMedicare and surgery\nMedicare is free health insurance for all Australian residents. Medicare assists in covering most fees at a public hospital and some at a private hospital.\u00a0Medicare\u00a0does not cover the costs of accommodation and theatre at private hospitals. Private health insurance is important because it creates a safety blanket between you and unforeseen costs. Different health insurance policies are tailored to different requirements. Before any procedure, you must speak to your health insurance provider to\u00a0understand the associated coverage and what out-of-pocket costs can be expected.\nPrivate Surgery and Associated Costs\nPrivate health insurance\u00a0covers any costs that Medicare does not. This may include accommodation, theatre and ambulance costs. Private health insurance offers three packages: Hospital, Extras and Combined. Hospital policies cover costs associated with being a private patient in a private hospital. Extras policies cover out-of-hospital costs that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover, as well as ambulance cover for those who live in a state that does not provide ambulance cover. Combined cover is an option that merges both hospital and extras policies. Identifying your personal requirements will assist you in choosing the health insurance policy that meets your needs.\nWhen the costs of your procedure are larger than your policy\u2019s coverage, you will often need to pay for it out-of-pocket or as a copayment. The medical gap scheme assists you in this situation. This is usually a result of specialist fees, bulk billing availability and the services you need. The amount owed is referred to as \u2018the gap\u2019. Most private health insurance providers have policies that include coverage for any gaps that may occur.\u00a0The amount of assistance provided for gap costs varies between health insurance providers.\nAdvantages of private health insurance\nAnalysis of Costs for Top 10 Surgical Procedures\nCataract Surgery\nCataract surgery is a procedure that involves the removal of the eye\u2019s lens and replacing it with an artificial lens.\u00a0The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $2000 in specialist fees and $2400 in hospital fees.

      "The Cost of Common Surgeries Compared\nUpdated: 13 September 2024\nAustralia\u2019s healthcare system is divided into two distinct sectors. Private and public. With the public system, public patients are covered by Medicare and often do not have many out-of-pocket fees. The downside to Medicare is that they do not cover every procedure. The private system has more freedom in choice and a faster expectation regarding the surgery date. The downside to this system is that it is often expensive and requires a good health insurance policy that will cover all the associated costs that Medicare cannot.\nKey facts\nCompare Health Insurance Quotes\nProtect what\u2019s most important to you. It\u2019s easy, convenient and free!\nBy clicking \u2018Compare & Save Now\u2019, you are accepting our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and consenting to us contacting you about the products and services provided. Please consider the PDS before purchasing any products.\nUnderstanding Surgery Costs in Australia\nSurgeries are classified into three distinct groups. Urgent, elective and cosmetic.\u00a0Understanding each surgery type will assist you in knowing if your health insurance policy covers it.\u00a0Let\u2019s look closely at these surgery types, the difference between each and why they are necessary.\nMedicare and surgery\nMedicare is free health insurance for all Australian residents. Medicare assists in covering most fees at a public hospital and some at a private hospital.\u00a0Medicare\u00a0does not cover the costs of accommodation and theatre at private hospitals. Private health insurance is important because it creates a safety blanket between you and unforeseen costs. Different health insurance policies are tailored to different requirements. Before any procedure, you must speak to your health insurance provider to\u00a0understand the associated coverage and what out-of-pocket costs can be expected.\nPrivate Surgery and Associated Costs\nPrivate health insurance\u00a0covers any costs that Medicare does not. This may include accommodation, theatre and ambulance costs. Private health insurance offers three packages: Hospital, Extras and Combined. Hospital policies cover costs associated with being a private patient in a private hospital. Extras policies cover out-of-hospital costs that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover, as well as ambulance cover for those who live in a state that does not provide ambulance cover. Combined cover is an option that merges both hospital and extras policies. Identifying your personal requirements will assist you in choosing the health insurance policy that meets your needs.\nWhen the costs of your procedure are larger than your policy\u2019s coverage, you will often need to pay for it out-of-pocket or as a copayment. The medical gap scheme assists you in this situation. This is usually a result of specialist fees, bulk billing availability and the services you need. The amount owed is referred to as \u2018the gap\u2019. Most private health insurance providers have policies that include coverage for any gaps that may occur.\u00a0The amount of assistance provided for gap costs varies between health insurance providers.\nAdvantages of private health insurance\nAnalysis of Costs for Top 10 Surgical Procedures\nCataract Surgery\nCataract surgery is a procedure that involves the removal of the eye\u2019s lens and replacing it with an artificial lens.\u00a0The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $2000 in specialist fees and $2400 in hospital fees. Private health insurance will typically cover the full hospital fee, depending on your coverage type.\u00a0\nFor private patients requiring cataract surgery with a glaucoma stent in a private hospital, the average out-of-pocket payment is $490 and $370 for private patients needing general cataract surgery. The average expected costs for uninsured patients can range from $1700 to $2500 per eye. The cost may fluctuate depending on the chosen artificial lens, hospital, and location. Medicare provides cover for this procedure.\u00a0Medicare will pay for 80% of the involved costs, with the patient needing to pay the remaining 20%.\nGastroscopy\nGastroscopy is a procedure that utilises a small and thin flexible tube to examine the upper digestive tract.\u00a0This procedure is used to visualise the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and rule out possible conditions such as peptic ulcers and gastritis. The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $940 for specialist fees and $530 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure receive an average out-of-pocket cost of $140.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $370. This out-of-pocket cost will fluctuate based on your policy. Medicare will pay an average of $420 towards the procedure, with the rest being covered by your private health insurer.\nKnee Replacement\nKnee replacement surgery involves the removal and replacement of diseased, worn-out or damaged knee joint areas.\u00a0The replacement is usually an artificial piece that acts just as a knee joint would and lowers the overall pain a patient may feel while restoring movement to the designated area. The average out-of-pocket cost of this procedure in Australia is around $4,800 for specialist fees and $ 18,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $680.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $3900 but fluctuates based on the chosen policy.\nHeart Angiogram with or without Heart Catheterization\nA heart angiogram is a procedure in which an X-ray is used to view the blood supply to the heart.\u00a0This is to check if the patient has any heart-related issues that need rectifying. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2000 for specialist fees and $ 4,200 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $40.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $490.\nCesarean Section\nA cesarean section, also known as a C-section, is a\u00a0pregnancy-related procedure that allows the baby to be delivered through an incision made on the mother\u2019s abdomen.\u00a0This usually occurs when the healthcare provider believes it is safer for the mother, baby, or both. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 3,500 for specialist fees and $ 7,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $450.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $570.\nCholecystectomy\nA cholecystectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a patient\u2019s gallbladder.\u00a0This surgery is often done to remove gallstones and any complications they may cause. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2,800 for specialist fees and $4,500 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $400.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,200.\nCoronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)\nA coronary artery bypass graft is a surgical procedure that improves oxygen supply and blood flow to the heart.\u00a0\u00a0This surgery is usually done to assist with coronary artery disease, which causes a buildup of plaque in the heart\u2019s arteries. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $15000 for specialist fees and $ 35,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $470.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,600.\nHip Replacement Surgery\nA hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which\u00a0damaged, diseased or worn-out hip joint areas are removed and replaced with an artificial piece.\u00a0The artificial piece works in the same manner that a healthy hip joint would and aims to reduce pain in the patient\u2019s hip area while also increasing the area\u2019s mobility. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 5,000 for specialist fees and $ 20,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $690.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 4,000.\nBreast Biopsy\nA breast biopsy is a procedure in which\u00a0a sample of the breast tissue is removed and tested for abnormal cells.\u00a0This test rules out the possibility of breast cancer or any other condition. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 2,400 for specialist fees and $1,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $500.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 100.\nVentral Hernia Repair\nA ventral hernia repair is a surgical procedure in which the surgeon makes an\u00a0incision into the abdomen above the hernia and pushes any protruding intestines back into the abdomen to repair the muscle wall.\u00a0The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 800 for specialist fees and $3 300 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $380.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 1,000.\nCompare common surgeries\nSource: Medical Costs Finder (October 2023; The prices above are estimates for specialists fees; Please refer to your medical professional for an accurate cost estimation)\nHow Private Health Insurance Can Assist with Surgery Costs\nPrivate health insurance is designed to assist patients with any fees that they may have during the course of the necessary procedure.\u00a0Depending on the coverage type, this may include ambulance, extras, and hospital cover.\nThere may be an instance in which the total cost of the procedure is higher than the coverage provided by both Medicare and your Private Health Insurance Provider. Depending on your chosen provider, the policy\u00a0will often provide assistance in the form of gap cover that partially or completely lowers the final amount that you will have to\u00a0pay out-of-pocket.\u00a0The assistance amount will vary based on the provider and policy that you have chosen.\nHow Medicare Works with Private Health Insurance\nMedicare typically covers 75% of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee for procedures performed in private hospitals, but this doesn\u2019t include hospital accommodation or theater fees. Private health insurance helps cover the remaining costs, but the level of coverage depends on your plan. It\u2019s crucial to understand the limits of your policy, including any gaps you might need to pay out of pocket.\nWhat is the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS)?\nThe Medicare Benefits Schedule is a list of medical services covered by Medicare, including surgery, and specifies the amount Medicare will pay for each service. When you have surgery, Medicare covers 75% of the MBS fee, and private health insurance typically covers the rest, though you may still have out-of-pocket costs if your specialist charges more than the MBS fee.\nFrequently Asked Questions and Answers\nThree main types of surgeries could occur. Elective, emergency or cosmetic. Depending on the type of surgery needed, the location, the specialist, and the hospital itself, these factors will increase or decrease the overall cost of surgery in Australia.\nMedicare is a free Health Insurance that is provided to all residents of Australia. It covers the costs associated with public hospitals and most general procedures. Medicare also assists in lowering the total out-of-pocket cost that a patient may need to pay after their procedure.\nTalking to your specialist beforehand will assist you in understanding the costs involved. It is also important to speak with your health insurance provider to ensure that the costs are covered and to verify the estimated amount that may be required.\nPrivate health insurers cover the costs that Medicare does not. For private hospitals, this may include ambulance fees, theatre and accommodation. Each policy is tailor-made to fit specific requirements and as such, there may be certain limitations for each policy type. Understanding these limitations will ensure you are not caught off-guard with unexpected fees and out-of-pocket costs.\nPublic hospitals are often cheaper than private hospitals. The downside to a public hospital is that the wait time is often longer and the patient does not have the option to choose their own specialist. Private hospitals are often more expensive but have faster surgery times and grants the patient the ability to choose their own specialist.\nOther Topics\nFind out more with our useful guides\nHave a question?

Urgent, elective and cosmetic.\u00a0Understanding each surgery type will assist you in knowing if your health insurance policy covers it.\u00a0Let\u2019s look closely at these surgery types, the difference between each and why they are necessary.\nMedicare and surgery\nMedicare is free health insurance for all Australian residents. Medicare assists in covering most fees at a public hospital and some at a private hospital.\u00a0Medicare\u00a0does not cover the costs of accommodation and theatre at private hospitals. Private health insurance is important because it creates a safety blanket between you and unforeseen costs. Different health insurance policies are tailored to different requirements. Before any procedure, you must speak to your health insurance provider to\u00a0understand the associated coverage and what out-of-pocket costs can be expected.\nPrivate Surgery and Associated Costs\nPrivate health insurance\u00a0covers any costs that Medicare does not. This may include accommodation, theatre and ambulance costs. Private health insurance offers three packages: Hospital, Extras and Combined. Hospital policies cover costs associated with being a private patient in a private hospital. Extras policies cover out-of-hospital costs that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover, as well as ambulance cover for those who live in a state that does not provide ambulance cover. Combined cover is an option that merges both hospital and extras policies. Identifying your personal requirements will assist you in choosing the health insurance policy that meets your needs.\nWhen the costs of your procedure are larger than your policy\u2019s coverage, you will often need to pay for it out-of-pocket or as a copayment. The medical gap scheme assists you in this situation. This is usually a result of specialist fees, bulk billing availability and the services you need. The amount owed is referred to as \u2018the gap\u2019. Most private health insurance providers have policies that include coverage for any gaps that may occur.\u00a0The amount of assistance provided for gap costs varies between health insurance providers.\nAdvantages of private health insurance\nAnalysis of Costs for Top 10 Surgical Procedures\nCataract Surgery\nCataract surgery is a procedure that involves the removal of the eye\u2019s lens and replacing it with an artificial lens.\u00a0The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $2000 in specialist fees and $2400 in hospital fees. Private health insurance will typically cover the full hospital fee, depending on your coverage type.\u00a0\nFor private patients requiring cataract surgery with a glaucoma stent in a private hospital, the average out-of-pocket payment is $490 and $370 for private patients needing general cataract surgery. The average expected costs for uninsured patients can range from $1700 to $2500 per eye. The cost may fluctuate depending on the chosen artificial lens, hospital, and location. Medicare provides cover for this procedure.\u00a0Medicare will pay for 80% of the involved costs, with the patient needing to pay the remaining 20%.\nGastroscopy\nGastroscopy is a procedure that utilises a small and thin flexible tube to examine the upper digestive tract.\u00a0This procedure is used to visualise the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and rule out possible conditions such as peptic ulcers and gastritis. The average cost of this procedure in Australia is around $940 for specialist fees and $530 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure receive an average out-of-pocket cost of $140.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $370. This out-of-pocket cost will fluctuate based on your policy. Medicare will pay an average of $420 towards the procedure, with the rest being covered by your private health insurer.\nKnee Replacement\nKnee replacement surgery involves the removal and replacement of diseased, worn-out or damaged knee joint areas.\u00a0The replacement is usually an artificial piece that acts just as a knee joint would and lowers the overall pain a patient may feel while restoring movement to the designated area. The average out-of-pocket cost of this procedure in Australia is around $4,800 for specialist fees and $ 18,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $680.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $3900 but fluctuates based on the chosen policy.\nHeart Angiogram with or without Heart Catheterization\nA heart angiogram is a procedure in which an X-ray is used to view the blood supply to the heart.\u00a0This is to check if the patient has any heart-related issues that need rectifying. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2000 for specialist fees and $ 4,200 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $40.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $490.\nCesarean Section\nA cesarean section, also known as a C-section, is a\u00a0pregnancy-related procedure that allows the baby to be delivered through an incision made on the mother\u2019s abdomen.\u00a0This usually occurs when the healthcare provider believes it is safer for the mother, baby, or both. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 3,500 for specialist fees and $ 7,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $450.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for the procedure is $570.\nCholecystectomy\nA cholecystectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a patient\u2019s gallbladder.\u00a0This surgery is often done to remove gallstones and any complications they may cause. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $2,800 for specialist fees and $4,500 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $400.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,200.\nCoronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)\nA coronary artery bypass graft is a surgical procedure that improves oxygen supply and blood flow to the heart.\u00a0\u00a0This surgery is usually done to assist with coronary artery disease, which causes a buildup of plaque in the heart\u2019s arteries. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $15000 for specialist fees and $ 35,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $470.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1,600.\nHip Replacement Surgery\nA hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which\u00a0damaged, diseased or worn-out hip joint areas are removed and replaced with an artificial piece.\u00a0The artificial piece works in the same manner that a healthy hip joint would and aims to reduce pain in the patient\u2019s hip area while also increasing the area\u2019s mobility. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is around $ 5,000 for specialist fees and $ 20,000 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $690.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 4,000.\nBreast Biopsy\nA breast biopsy is a procedure in which\u00a0a sample of the breast tissue is removed and tested for abnormal cells.\u00a0This test rules out the possibility of breast cancer or any other condition. The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 2,400 for specialist fees and $1,900 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $500.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 100.\nVentral Hernia Repair\nA ventral hernia repair is a surgical procedure in which the surgeon makes an\u00a0incision into the abdomen above the hernia and pushes any protruding intestines back into the abdomen to repair the muscle wall.\u00a0The average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $1 800 for specialist fees and $3 300 for hospital fees.\nPrivate patients requiring this procedure have an average out-of-pocket cost of $380.\u00a0The highest average out-of-pocket cost for this procedure is $ 1,000.\nCompare common surgeries\nSource: Medical Costs Finder (October 2023; The prices above are estimates for specialists fees; Please refer to your medical professional for an accurate cost estimation)\nHow Private Health Insurance Can Assist with Surgery Costs\nPrivate health insurance is designed to assist patients with any fees that they may have during the course of the necessary procedure.\u00a0Depending on the coverage type, this may include ambulance, extras, and hospital cover.\nThere may be an instance in which the total cost of the procedure is higher than the coverage provided by both Medicare and your Private Health Insurance Provider. Depending on your chosen provider, the policy\u00a0will often provide assistance in the form of gap cover that partially or completely lowers the final amount that you will have to\u00a0pay out-of-pocket.\u00a0The assistance amount will vary based on the provider and policy that you have chosen.\nHow Medicare Works with Private Health Insurance\nMedicare typically covers 75% of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee for procedures performed in private hospitals, but this doesn\u2019t include hospital accommodation or theater fees. Private health insurance helps cover the remaining costs, but the level of coverage depends on your plan. It\u2019s crucial to understand the limits of your policy, including any gaps you might need to pay out of pocket.\nWhat is the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS)?\nThe Medicare Benefits Schedule is a list of medical services covered by Medicare, including surgery, and specifies the amount Medicare will pay for each service. When you have surgery, Medicare covers 75% of the MBS fee, and private health insurance typically covers the rest, though you may still have out-of-pocket costs if your specialist charges more than the MBS fee.\nFrequently Asked Questions and Answers\nThree main types of surgeries could occur. Elective, emergency or cosmetic. Depending on the type of surgery needed, the location, the specialist, and the hospital itself, these factors will increase or decrease the overall cost of surgery in Australia.\nMedicare is a free Health Insurance that is provided to all residents of Australia. It covers the costs associated with public hospitals and most general procedures. Medicare also assists in lowering the total out-of-pocket cost that a patient may need to pay after their procedure.\nTalking to your specialist beforehand will assist you in understanding the costs involved. It is also important to speak with your health insurance provider to ensure that the costs are covered and to verify the estimated amount that may be required.\nPrivate health insurers cover the costs that Medicare does not. For private hospitals, this may include ambulance fees, theatre and accommodation. Each policy is tailor-made to fit specific requirements and as such, there may be certain limitations for each policy type. Understanding these limitations will ensure you are not caught off-guard with unexpected fees and out-of-pocket costs.\nPublic hospitals are often cheaper than private hospitals. The downside to a public hospital is that the wait time is often longer and the patient does not have the option to choose their own specialist. Private hospitals are often more expensive but have faster surgery times and grants the patient the ability to choose their own specialist.\nOther Topics\nFind out more with our useful guides\nHave a question?

It should take 8 minutes for the ambulance to arrive if the call is life threatening or an emergency. Ambulance services often send more than one vehicle to try to meet the 8 minute target.\nWhy are ambulance response times so long?\nPlus, despite the increased workforce, ambulance crews have less capacity, as ambulances now have to wait longer with patients outside hospitals. According to one Health Foundation report, more than 10% of ambulances had to wait for over an hour outside hospitals in July 2022.\nWhat is the average EMS response time in Chicago?\nThe state standard is six minutes. At the current fleet level of 80 ambulances, Chicago ranks last in number of ambulances per one thousand people when compared to other big cities.\nHow long does it take for an ambulance to arrive in NYC?\nEmergency medical services (EMS) teams, a subsection of FDNY, also remained steady throughout the same time period, taking between 7 and 8 minutes to arrive on the scene for life-threatening medical emergencies.\nHow long is too long for an ambulance?\nEach has a different response time standard: Category 1: An immediate response to a life-threatening condition, such as cardiac or respiratory arrest. The average response time should be under 7 minutes and 90% of ambulances should arrive within 15 minutes.\nShould you always wait for an ambulance?\nWait for no longer than 10 minutes when you are dealing with an emergency situation. Service providers should be there within eight minutes in optimal circumstances. The eight-minute window is the time when receiving medical services is the most critical for patient survival.\nHow fast should paramedics arrive?\nNFPA Standard On all EMS calls, the NFPA 1710 standard establishes a turnout time of one minute, and four minutes or less for the arrival of a unit with first responder or higher level capability at an emergency medical incident.\nWhy are emergency wait times so long in Canada?\n1. We need more staff and doctors. There are record-high staffing pressures across Ontario and Canada, including at HHS, affecting all areas of hospital operations including our EDs. These staffing pressures existed before COVID-19, but were made worse by the pandemic and persist across our healthcare system.\nDo Canadians pay for ambulance?\nPayment for ambulance services is the responsibility of the patient unless they are covered by a government program or private insurance.\nAre hospital wait times longer in Canada?\nWaiting Your Turn: Wait Times for Health Care in Canada, 2022 is a new study that finds Canada's health-care wait times reached 27.4 weeks in 2022\u2014the longest ever recorded\u2014and 195 per cent higher than the 9.3 weeks Canadians waited in 1993, when the Fraser Institute began tracking medical wait times.\nWhat is the average FDNY response time?\nThe average response time was nine minutes and 30 seconds in the 2022 fiscal year. The average response time was eight minutes and 28 seconds in 2019. The 2022 fiscal year spanned from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022. \"Clinical death begins after four minutes.\nWhat is the US average fire department response time?\nIn most of the analyses done here, response times were less than 5 minutes nearly 50% of the time and less than 8 minutes about 75% of the time. Nationally, average response times were generally less than 8 minutes. The overall 90th percentile, a level often cited in the industry, was less than 11 minutes.\nWhat is the average ambulance response time in Los Angeles?\nOur average response time should be anywhere for three to four minutes; 10 minutes, you're lucky. Fifteen is common, and 20 is going to be the norm.\" The LAFD serves the second-largest city in the nation with nearly 4 million people, not including the large number of tourists.\nHow long is the wait for ambulance in Europe?\nResponse times can differ between countries from five to twenty minutes for life-threatening events. Ambulance services collaborate with various other service-types, e.g. hospitals, general practices, mental healthcare institutions, fire brigades, and police departments.\nWhat is the emergency waiting time in the UK?\nTime spent by patients in A&E For patients who required admission to hospital, the median A&E waiting time remained below four hours until September 2019. In December 2019, the median wait increased to a high of 5 hours 21 minutes.\nWhy do paramedics walk so slow?\nNever move faster than your ability to make good decisions Running to a patient prevents us from spotting hazards on the way in. Remember, we're walking into an unknown. We must carefully observe and assess for danger.\nWhat percentage of ambulance calls are life threatening?\nIn 2021/22 a higher proportion of incidents were life-threatening (category 1, 12%) or emergency (category 2, 66%) compared with 2018/19 (9% and 60%, respectively).

      "Mayors blast 'terrible' rural ambulance response times\nAuditor general report shows poor rural response times masked by urban data\nSocial Sharing\nMayors and community leaders in small\u2013town New Brunswick say they weren't surprised at all by this week's scathing report by the auditor general about ambulance response times.\nThe audit shows that in many rural and remote communities, Ambulance New Brunswick fails to respond to 90 per cent of calls within its target of 22 minutes.\n\"It's terrible,\" said\u00a0Belledune Mayor Joe Noel. \"It shouldn't be allowed and there's no need for it.\"\nBut those shortfalls are obscured, and don't count against ANB's performance payments, because they're combined with better response times in urban centres for measuring performance--which is allowed under the company's contract.\nBlackville Mayor Chris Hennessy said\u00a0the report is a vindication for him.\n\"They basically bury the rural stats in the urban numbers so they never show the bad with the good,\" he said.\n\"I know people thought I was crazy when I was preaching about this for the last five years \u2026 so I'm glad somebody uncovered that.\"\u00a0\nRural vs. urban response\nThe aggregation of the numbers allows Medavie Health Services New Brunswick, which operates the ambulance service, to collect $650,000 a year for hitting the broader 90-percent target in four large zones that include cities and towns.\u00a0\n\"They're meeting them on the backs of the rural areas,\" Noel said.\n\"That's exactly what happens here. When an ambulance goes out in Campbellton or Bathurst, they take the ambulance from Belledune and send it to Bathurst or Campbellton to sit there, whether it gets a call or not...\n\"That's where the calls are and that's why they're doing it: because it makes their numbers look good.\"\u00a0\nHarvey Mayor Winston Gamblin said\u00a0response times in the village are good when the ambulance happens to be at its local station.\u00a0\nBut when it's been shifting elsewhere, paramedics have a hard time reaching some locations within 22 minutes.\n\"We feel that if you live in a rural area, you have to take second best, and that's the way it came out in the report yesterday -- that we're second class citizens and [they say] 'we'll get there when we can,'\" he said.\nAmbulance targets\nUnder Medavie's contract with the province, ambulances must hit response targets 90 per cent of the time for the organization to receive performance payments.\nThe targets are to reach the scene of a call within nine minutes in 16 urban areas and within 22 minutes everywhere else in New Brunswick.\nThe audit found that in 19 out of 67 communities, ANB fell short of the 90 per cent goal.\u00a0\nBut because response times are blended together within four large zones, it \"masked\" the poor numbers in those rural, remote communities, Auditor General Kim Adair-MacPherson said Tuesday.\nHer audit said the system \"has introduced a bias toward achieving high performance in areas of greater population density, to the detriment of rural or remote communities where 911 calls occur less frequently.\"\nRural areas were at a disadvantage because the system is \"reducing the emphasis on improving performance in those areas,\" allowing Medavie \"to focus resources on urban areas while having decreased performance in outlying communities.\"\nIn a statement released Tuesday, Medavie Health Services New Brunswick president Richard Losier agreed the average response time \"varies from community to community.\"\nBut he pointed out what Adair-MacPherson's audit acknowledged: that the contract doesn't rate performance community by community but in four large zones.\n\"MHSNB is always open and willing to work with our government partners to improve the services to the people of New Brunswick,\" he said.\nMedavie mum\nMedavie did not respond to a request Wednesday for an interview with Losier.\nOn Tuesday Health Minister Dorothy Shephard said she was talking to Medavie officials about renegotiating the contract, which was renewed in 2017 for another 10 years.\nNoel said\u00a0rural response times should carry more weight in measuring ambulance performance.\n\"When you're 25 minutes away from a hospital to start with, that's where you need the response times,\" he said.\nBelledune had the lowest number of any community measured by the auditor general: ambulances reached their destination within 22 minutes in only 69 per cent of calls.\nMarc Henrie, the former chair of the Saint-Paul local service district north of Moncton, said\u00a0he was not surprised to see the Fords Mills ambulance station with the second-worst rate in the report.\nAmbulances based there reach calls within 22 minutes in only 70 per cent of cases.\n\"The auditor general just released proof that rural citizens are sadly taken as citizens of a second-class,\" he said.\nHenrie chaired the LSD when Ambulance New Brunswick decided to put its bay in Fords Mills rather than in another location closer to Saint-Paul and Route 126, where he says most people in the area live.\n\"The numbers are not surprising at all,\" he said.\nSometimes ambulances responding to calls in the Saint-Paul area are sent from Salisbury, even though Moncton is closer. Henrie believes it's so ambulances based in Moncton can stay there and respond to calls in and around the city.\u00a0\n\"It's clear that it's not strategic and it's not what's for the well-being in an emergency situation,\" he says.\nGamblin says he's glad to see the auditor general put the spotlight on the problem but worries it will discourage people from moving to smaller communities. \"It's not an advertisement for rural areas,\" he says.\u00a0\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nProvincial Affairs reporter\nJacques Poitras has been CBC's provincial affairs reporter in New Brunswick since 2000.

      "Boston Subway Map 2024 \u2013 Timetable, Tickets & Prices\n  \nSubway Boston (MTBA) \u2013 The route network\nThe Boston subway is a true monument to American history. The metro system is the oldest subway in the USA. It opened on September 1, 1887, just before the Chicago subway.\nOpened at the time as the \u201cStreet Subway\u201d, the route is still part of the so-called Green Line with the oldest subway tunnel in the USA. Alongside the three modern metro lines, it is a special feature on the Boston Metro Map. The Green Line is actually an S-Bahn line, but a large part of it runs underground. At 37 kilometers, it is not only the longest, but also the busiest subway line in Boston, carrying around 230,000 passengers a day.\nAll lines are operated by Massachusetts Bay Transportation (MBTA). The subway network, affectionately known by Bostonians as \u201cThe T\u201d or \u201cBoston T\u201d, stretches over a total length of around 120.3 kilometers. With 200,000 passengers per day, the Orange Line has the second largest passenger volume after the Green Line. The metro lines on the Boston Metro Map can only be distinguished by their color. To avoid confusion with other public transport lines, travelers should therefore remember the Red Line, the Blue Line, the Orange Line and the Green Line.\nInhaltsverzeichnis\nThe Boston subway lines at a glance\nInformation for tourists about the Boston Metro\nBoston owes its popularity as a travel destination and place to work and study not least to its famous universities. Harvard University and the New England Conservatory are particularly famous. However, it is not just students and commuters who use the transportation services of the \u201cBoston T\u201d. There are also plenty of tourists who want to see historically significant sites such as the Old State House, the Freedom Trail, Faneuil Hall or the USS Constitution.\nAccordingly, the number of people in Boston who use the Metro Map is also increasing. This is comparatively easy to accomplish due to the small number of lines. The most important connection for tourists is undoubtedly the Blue Line between the airport and the city center at the Government Center stop.\nBoston subway tickets & prices\nWith a population of just over 600,000, Boston is not exactly a small town. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the tariff system is very reminiscent of this. Instead of a complex system with several tariff zones, a flat-rate billing system is used. This also makes it much easier for non-residents to use the metro in Boston. This also limits the choice of tickets to a minimum.\nThey are valid for both the subway and the bus lines. In addition to one-way tickets, the operating company MTBA only offers daily, weekly and monthly tickets. Tickets are cheaper for senior citizens, the disabled and students. Boston\u2019s subway is also very family-friendly. Children up to the age of 11 can travel free of charge on the metro.\nThe most important metro tickets in Boston\nIf you want to buy a metro ticket in Boston, you have several options. The most common option is to buy classic paper tickets, known as Charlie tickets. They are available from the ticket machines in front of the entrances to the subway platforms. If there is no ticket machine and validator to be found on a subway platform, tickets can often also be purchased on board the trains. However, only tickets with a value of up to 20 US dollars can be purchased at the ticket machines on board.\nUsing the CharlieCard is much more convenient. This is a rechargeable chip card that can be used to book tickets and also serves as a travel pass. It can be used as a one-way ticket, day ticket, weekly ticket and monthly ticket. The CharlieCard is particularly attractive because of the discount on the price of single trips. The CharlieCard is also validated or activated at the electronic access barriers to the platforms. There are no smartphone tickets for the metro in Boston, nor are there any special combined tickets for tourists. Such tickets are usually associated with discounts for attractions.\nBoston subway schedule\nThe Green Line starts its service at around 5:00 am. Service on the three remaining lines on the Boston Metro Map begins between 5:15 and 5:30 a.m. This regulation applies on the Green Line and Blue Line seven days a week. On the Red Line and the Orange Line, however, the first trains on Sundays do not depart until an hour later at around 6:00 am. Both during the week and at weekends, all lines run until around 1:00 a.m. or 1:30 a.m. at night.\nThe frequency of the four metro lines on the Boston Metro Map varies throughout the day between a 3-minute interval during rush hour and a 9-15-minute interval in the late evening and night hours. So if you want to be out and about in Boston after 1:00 a.m., you have to use one of the city\u2019s many cabs or the Uber service.\nRed Line, Orange Line, Blue Line, Green Line\nFurther information on the Boston Metro\nThe saying \u201cother countries, other customs\u201d applies not only to the USA in general, but also to the metro in Boston. There are some rules that may seem strange to the average European at first. Eating on the Boston subway is not prohibited, but if the food smells too strong, the employees of the operating company can issue a warning. Incidentally, no one should put up any resistance, as these employees are official security guards from the MBTA Police Department.\nSo safety on board is also well taken care of. Very loud conversations that disturb the other passengers are also worthy of a warning. Playing music loudly is prohibited both at subway stations and on the trains themselves. No less unusual is the clear permission to put your feet up on the seat, provided the subway carriage is largely empty.\n (No Ratings Yet)Loading...\n",

Provisional estimates are published quarterly and remain provisional until after they have been constrained by the final annual estimates each year. These provisional estimates are based on traffic data collected continuously from a network of around 300 automatic traffic counters. Final annual figures also incorporate manual traffic count data.\nTraffic shows a seasonal pattern at the national level, being highest in summer and lowest in winter. This publication focuses on rolling annual traffic totals, which better illustrate medium and long term trends in traffic.\nAnnual traffic estimates are usually published between May and June of the following year. The next provisional figures, for the year ending June 2024, are due to be released in September 2024.\nThese are accredited official statistics[footnote 1] and were independently reviewed by the Office for Statistics Regulation in February 2013. For more information, see the background information on provisional road traffic estimates.\nHeadline figures\nOverall traffic levels in the year ending March 2024 were higher than in year ending March 2023 and below pre-pandemic levels.\nChart 1: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 1 is a line chart showing that 332.4 billion vehicle miles were driven on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was up 2.1% compared to the year ending March 2023. Motor vehicle traffic levels fell during the pandemic but have since increased. This is the case for all vehicle types and road types. Traffic levels for the year ending March 2024 were 1.8% below pre-pandemic levels.\nRoad traffic by vehicle type\nChart 2: Share of traffic by vehicle type for the year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 2 is a bar chart which shows that cars accounted for 76% of all motor vehicle traffic on Great Britain\u2019s roads over the year ending March 2024. Therefore, cars continue to be the main contributor to changes in overall motor vehicle traffic.\nThe proportion of van traffic has increased in recent years, accounting for 18% of all motor vehicle traffic in this 12 month period.\nLorries accounted for 5% of all motor vehicle traffic and 1% of traffic came from other motor vehicles including motorcycles and buses.\nIn the year ending March 2024:\nTable 1: Vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain by vehicle type in the year ending March 2024, and percentage change compared to previous 12 month periods (from TRA2501a)\nTable 1 shows how traffic in the year ending March 2024 compares to a selection of earlier years for different vehicle types. For example, car and taxi traffic was 2.6% higher in the year ending March 2024 than the year ending March 2023. Note that any differences between -0.5% and +0.5% are considered negligible.\nCars and taxis\nChart 3: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by cars and taxis in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 3 is a line chart which illustrates that cars and taxis travelled 252.5 billion vehicle miles in the 12 months ending March 2024. Car and taxi traffic rose 2.6% from the year ending March 2023.

      "Harsher penalties, civil suits possible for speeding drivers in DC under newly passed bill\n\nThomas Robertson  | trobertson@wtop.com\n\nFebruary 7, 2024, 6:12 AM\nD.C. would have the authority to boot and tow vehicles repeatedly caught speeding by cameras under new legislation unanimously passed by the city\u2019s council Tuesday.\nCouncil member Charles Allen introduced the Strengthening Traffic Enforcement, Education, and Responsibility (STEER) Act of 2024. The bill would also allow for \u201cspeed governors,\u201d devices that can prevent drivers from exceeding a certain speed, to be installed in certain vehicles.\nPassage of the STEER Act comes after the District saw 52 traffic deaths in 2023, an increase from 35 in 2022.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious right now that a significant number of drivers do not fear accountability for speeding, driving recklessly, or driving drunk. And why should they? Nothing about their experience tells them there are consequences,\u201d Allen said in a news release. \u201cThat\u2019s about to change now that the Council has spoken clearly.\u201d\nThe STEER Act would establish a new points system for vehicles repeatedly caught speeding. If a vehicle accumulates 10 points in a six-month window, it immediately becomes eligible for booting and towing. Under the bill, points are accumulated as follows:\nAllen\u2019s office said in a news release that D.C. cameras issued more than 1 million tickets for cars going 11-15 mph over the speed limit.\nThe point system would apply to any vehicle, regardless of where it\u2019s registered.\n\u201cSpeed governors\u201d would come into play for drivers whose license was suspended or revoked because of excessive speeding, including reckless driving. The first time a driver is required to enroll in the program, they would have to use the device for one year. The length of enrollment increases by one year for each subsequent conviction, with a fourth conviction resulting in lifelong enrollment.\nThe STEER Act would also empower D.C.\u2019s Office of the Attorney General to bring civil suits against drivers from anywhere who have large balances of unpaid moving violations.\n\u201cWe must redouble our efforts to crack down on dangerous drivers who put pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers at risk,\u201d D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb said.\nIt was revealed in November that 335 drivers who should have been enrolled in D.C.\u2019s Ignition Interlock Program did not have the devices installed in their vehicles. Allen\u2019s office said the bill would address the Department of Motor Vehicles\u2019 notification failures that led to offending drivers slipping through the cracks.\n\u201cDangerous driving is far too common in every DC neighborhood,\u201d Allen said in a news release. \u201cThe bill approved today will create real, common sense accountability measures to reduce speeding and reckless behavior in our neighborhoods and close loopholes blocking accountability.\u201d\nMayor Muriel Bowser and Congress still need to sign off on the legislation before it becomes law.\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\u00a9 2024 WTOP.

Tech, Ph.D, Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology Chennai, India Abstract AI-powered transportation systems represent a transformative leap in urban mobility management, leveraging real-time data processing to dynamically adjust traffic flow, significantly reducing fuel consumption, emissions, and idling times. These systems excel in swiftly responding to potential hazards at intersections, minimizing accidents by identifying risks and prioritizing emergency vehicles for immediate clearance, potentially saving lives. Their adaptability and learning capabilities optimize commute times, energy consumption, and traffic efficiency at intersections, fostering sustainable urban environments. Through machine learning algorithms, they pre-emptively address bottlenecks, refining traffic dynamics, and enhancing economic productivity. Additionally, by facilitating seamless vehicle-infrastructure communication, these systems enable personalized route recommendations, optimized traffic signal timings, and rerouting strategies, paving the way for a smart, interconnected urban ecosystem prioritizing efficiency, safety, and sustainability, revolutionizing urban transportation management. Keywords: Traffic System, Management, Vehicle Monitoring, Intelligent Traffic Monitoring System, Fuzzy Logic, Machine Learning. I. INTRODUCTION Achieving a more precise and adaptive estimate of green signal time is crucial for optimizing traffic flow and minimizing delays in metropolitan cities. To achieve it a unique approach is used, dividing vehicles into distinct categories and employing advanced object detection techniques like YOLO (You Only Look Once). Object detection algorithms like YOLO enable the system to accurately identify and count the number of vehicles in real-time. This process provides valuable data on the volume and distribution of vehicles in each direction at a particular intersection. By categorizing vehicles, the system gains a nuanced understanding of the diverse traffic mix, considering the varying sizes, speeds, and acceleration characteristics of different vehicle types. Once this real-time data is obtained, the system becomes adaptive, dynamically adjusting the timers of traffic signals based on the observed volume of vehicles in each category and direction. This adaptability is a key feature that distinguishes the system from traditional static traffic signal setups. Rather than relying on predetermined signal timings, the system responds in real-time to the actual traffic conditions, maximizing the efficiency of the green light duration. The adaptive adjustment of signal timings has several advantages. Firstly, it minimizes unnecessary International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240214871 Volume 6, Issue 2, March-April 2024 2 delays and waiting times for vehicles at the intersection. By precisely tailoring the green signal duration to the current traffic demands, the system ensures that traffic is cleared more swiftly than it would be under a static signal system. This not only reduces congestion but also enhances overall traffic throughput. Furthermore, the dynamic adjustment of signal timings has a cascading effect on fuel consumption and pollution. With reduced waiting times and smoother traffic flow, vehicles spend less time idling at intersections, leading to lower fuel consumption and emissions. This environmental benefit aligns with the broader goal of creating a more sustainable and eco-friendly urban transportation system.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW 1. proposes a solution using video processing. The video from the live feed is processed before being sent to the servers where a C++ based algorithm is used to generate the results. Hard code and Dynamic coded methodologies are compared, in which the dynamic algorithm showed an improvement of 35%. 2. The paper [4] has proposed an MPC (Model predictive control) which will be used on the highway and focuses on roadside control. The pa- per basically provides information on how MPC can be applied for speed control and lane allocation. It basically works with the lane requirements and speed allocation. x The paper states that every car running on the highway can be allocated a certain speed for the particular time. x The time span given and the lane given to the vehicle is independent. 3. System developed for the main intersections of the road. Microcontroller used is Beagle Bone Black/Rasp Pi, algorithm used is Haar Cascade. The system proves that it can minimize traffic mobbing and reduce waiting time of vehicles in front of traffic signals. To make real time analysis of traffic in modern cities,the authors of this project have configured and coupled actual traffic images taken with micro controller and guarantees that the average waiting time of vehicles in front of traffic signal will be lesser than the present traffic control system. 4. Smart Traffic the board framework is a one of the significant elements for a brilliant city. As of now traffic the executives and ready frameworks are not fulfilling the needs of STMS. It is more costly and profoundly configurable to offer better assistance for traffic executives. This paper proposes a minimal expense Real-Time brilliant traffic Management System to offer better support by sending traffic markers to refresh the traffic subtleties right away. Minimal expense vehicle identifying sensors are implants in the street for each 500 meters or 1000 meters. IoT is being utilized to get traffic information rapidly and send it for handling. 5. In order to perform intelligent decision- making based on the traffic circumstances on the present lane and its neighboring lane in a four-lane intersection, Mittal and Chawla (2020) proposed a hybrid neuro- fuzzy adaptive traffic light system. The ANFIS system was implemented using Sugeno. The system was broken down into three parts: lane selection, timing adjustments for the green signal extension, and system training. ANFIS model performance was compared to those of fuzzy systems and fixed timing systems. The experimental findings demonstrated that the suggested ANFIS system International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240214871 Volume 6, Issue 2, March-April 2024 3 outperformed other systems in terms of efficiency. III. EXISTING SYSTEM Real-time Adaptability and Responsiveness: Traditional traffic management systems often operate on fixed schedules, lacking the agility to swiftly respond to dynamically changing traffic conditions. This limitation results in suboptimal traffic flow, heightened congestion, and prolonged wait times at intersections The introduction of real-time adaptability revolutionizes this landscape by enabling traffic signals to dynamically adjust based on the current volume and distribution of vehicles. This not only improves overall traffic efficiency but also significantly reduces delays, leading to a more responsive and adaptive urban transportation system. Environmental Efficiency One of the critical drawbacks of existing traffic systems is their reliance on predetermined schedules, which may lead to inefficiencies during unexpected traffic congestion or periods of low vehicle volumes. Real-time adaptability in traffic signals addresses this issue by optimizing green light durations based on actual demand. This dynamic adjustment minimizes unnecessary stops and idling, contributing to improved environmental efficiency. Reduced fuel consumption and emissions become tangible benefits of this adaptive approach, aligning with broader sustainability goals for urban environments. Enhanced Safety Features: The reliance of traditional traffic management on basic sensors and manual interventions poses challenges in rapidly changing or emergency situations. Real-time adaptive systems, however, enhance safety features by quickly analyzing and responding to evolving traffic conditions. This proactive approach significantly lowers the likelihood of accidents, fostering a safer urban transportation landscape. The integration of advanced technologies for real-time decision-making marks a crucial step toward achieving a transportation system that prioritizes the well-being of commuters and pedestrians. Automated Response to Emergency Vehicles: Existing traffic systems often rely on manual activation of emergency signals and limited pre- emption systems, which can be insufficient in heavy traffic or densely populated areas. Real-time adaptive systems bring a transformative shift by autonomously detecting and prioritizing emergency vehicles. This automated response ensures immediate and seamless clearance at intersections, facilitating the swift movement of emergency services through traffic. In emergency situations, this capability can prove critical, potentially saving lives by expediting the timely arrival of crucial services. In conclusion, the shift from fixed-schedule traffic management systems to real-time adaptive systems represents a significant advancement in urban transportation. This evolution addresses inefficiencies, enhances environmental sustainability, improves safety features, and automates responses to emergency situations, collectively contributing to a more efficient, responsive, and safer urban transportation infrastructure.

It dynamically adjusts estimations based on the current volume, distribution of vehicles, and other relevant factors. This ensures a more accurate and responsive assessment of the time needed for vehicles to traverse specific routes. Following implementation, a crucial step involves comparing the time periods before and after the introduction of the model.

      "Harsher penalties, civil suits possible for speeding drivers in DC under newly passed bill\n\nThomas Robertson  | trobertson@wtop.com\n\nFebruary 7, 2024, 6:12 AM\nD.C. would have the authority to boot and tow vehicles repeatedly caught speeding by cameras under new legislation unanimously passed by the city\u2019s council Tuesday.\nCouncil member Charles Allen introduced the Strengthening Traffic Enforcement, Education, and Responsibility (STEER) Act of 2024. The bill would also allow for \u201cspeed governors,\u201d devices that can prevent drivers from exceeding a certain speed, to be installed in certain vehicles.\nPassage of the STEER Act comes after the District saw 52 traffic deaths in 2023, an increase from 35 in 2022.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious right now that a significant number of drivers do not fear accountability for speeding, driving recklessly, or driving drunk. And why should they? Nothing about their experience tells them there are consequences,\u201d Allen said in a news release. \u201cThat\u2019s about to change now that the Council has spoken clearly.\u201d\nThe STEER Act would establish a new points system for vehicles repeatedly caught speeding. If a vehicle accumulates 10 points in a six-month window, it immediately becomes eligible for booting and towing. Under the bill, points are accumulated as follows:\nAllen\u2019s office said in a news release that D.C. cameras issued more than 1 million tickets for cars going 11-15 mph over the speed limit.\nThe point system would apply to any vehicle, regardless of where it\u2019s registered.\n\u201cSpeed governors\u201d would come into play for drivers whose license was suspended or revoked because of excessive speeding, including reckless driving. The first time a driver is required to enroll in the program, they would have to use the device for one year. The length of enrollment increases by one year for each subsequent conviction, with a fourth conviction resulting in lifelong enrollment.\nThe STEER Act would also empower D.C.\u2019s Office of the Attorney General to bring civil suits against drivers from anywhere who have large balances of unpaid moving violations.\n\u201cWe must redouble our efforts to crack down on dangerous drivers who put pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers at risk,\u201d D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb said.\nIt was revealed in November that 335 drivers who should have been enrolled in D.C.\u2019s Ignition Interlock Program did not have the devices installed in their vehicles. Allen\u2019s office said the bill would address the Department of Motor Vehicles\u2019 notification failures that led to offending drivers slipping through the cracks.\n\u201cDangerous driving is far too common in every DC neighborhood,\u201d Allen said in a news release. \u201cThe bill approved today will create real, common sense accountability measures to reduce speeding and reckless behavior in our neighborhoods and close loopholes blocking accountability.\u201d\nMayor Muriel Bowser and Congress still need to sign off on the legislation before it becomes law.\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\u00a9 2024 WTOP.

Keywords: Traffic System, Management, Vehicle Monitoring, Intelligent Traffic Monitoring System, Fuzzy Logic, Machine Learning. I. INTRODUCTION Achieving a more precise and adaptive estimate of green signal time is crucial for optimizing traffic flow and minimizing delays in metropolitan cities. To achieve it a unique approach is used, dividing vehicles into distinct categories and employing advanced object detection techniques like YOLO (You Only Look Once). Object detection algorithms like YOLO enable the system to accurately identify and count the number of vehicles in real-time. This process provides valuable data on the volume and distribution of vehicles in each direction at a particular intersection. By categorizing vehicles, the system gains a nuanced understanding of the diverse traffic mix, considering the varying sizes, speeds, and acceleration characteristics of different vehicle types. Once this real-time data is obtained, the system becomes adaptive, dynamically adjusting the timers of traffic signals based on the observed volume of vehicles in each category and direction. This adaptability is a key feature that distinguishes the system from traditional static traffic signal setups. Rather than relying on predetermined signal timings, the system responds in real-time to the actual traffic conditions, maximizing the efficiency of the green light duration. The adaptive adjustment of signal timings has several advantages. Firstly, it minimizes unnecessary International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240214871 Volume 6, Issue 2, March-April 2024 2 delays and waiting times for vehicles at the intersection. By precisely tailoring the green signal duration to the current traffic demands, the system ensures that traffic is cleared more swiftly than it would be under a static signal system. This not only reduces congestion but also enhances overall traffic throughput. Furthermore, the dynamic adjustment of signal timings has a cascading effect on fuel consumption and pollution. With reduced waiting times and smoother traffic flow, vehicles spend less time idling at intersections, leading to lower fuel consumption and emissions. This environmental benefit aligns with the broader goal of creating a more sustainable and eco-friendly urban transportation system. In summary, the integration of object detection techniques and adaptive signal timing based on real- time traffic data represents a sophisticated and effective approach to traffic management. By leveraging technology to categorize and quantify vehicles, and subsequently optimizing signal timings, the system significantly improves traffic efficiency, reduces congestion, lowers fuel use, and contributes to a cleaner and more sustainable urban environment. II. LITERATURE REVIEW 1. proposes a solution using video processing. The video from the live feed is processed before being sent to the servers where a C++ based algorithm is used to generate the results. Hard code and Dynamic coded methodologies are compared, in which the dynamic algorithm showed an improvement of 35%. 2. The paper [4] has proposed an MPC (Model predictive control) which will be used on the highway and focuses on roadside control. The pa- per basically provides information on how MPC can be applied for speed control and lane allocation. It basically works with the lane requirements and speed allocation. x The paper states that every car running on the highway can be allocated a certain speed for the particular time. x The time span given and the lane given to the vehicle is independent. 3. System developed for the main intersections of the road. Microcontroller used is Beagle Bone Black/Rasp Pi, algorithm used is Haar Cascade. The system proves that it can minimize traffic mobbing and reduce waiting time of vehicles in front of traffic signals. To make real time analysis of traffic in modern cities,the authors of this project have configured and coupled actual traffic images taken with micro controller and guarantees that the average waiting time of vehicles in front of traffic signal will be lesser than the present traffic control system. 4. Smart Traffic the board framework is a one of the significant elements for a brilliant city. As of now traffic the executives and ready frameworks are not fulfilling the needs of STMS. It is more costly and profoundly configurable to offer better assistance for traffic executives. This paper proposes a minimal expense Real-Time brilliant traffic Management System to offer better support by sending traffic markers to refresh the traffic subtleties right away. Minimal expense vehicle identifying sensors are implants in the street for each 500 meters or 1000 meters. IoT is being utilized to get traffic information rapidly and send it for handling. 5. In order to perform intelligent decision- making based on the traffic circumstances on the present lane and its neighboring lane in a four-lane intersection, Mittal and Chawla (2020) proposed a hybrid neuro- fuzzy adaptive traffic light system. The ANFIS system was implemented using Sugeno. The system was broken down into three parts: lane selection, timing adjustments for the green signal extension, and system training. ANFIS model performance was compared to those of fuzzy systems and fixed timing systems. The experimental findings demonstrated that the suggested ANFIS system International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240214871 Volume 6, Issue 2, March-April 2024 3 outperformed other systems in terms of efficiency. III. EXISTING SYSTEM Real-time Adaptability and Responsiveness: Traditional traffic management systems often operate on fixed schedules, lacking the agility to swiftly respond to dynamically changing traffic conditions. This limitation results in suboptimal traffic flow, heightened congestion, and prolonged wait times at intersections The introduction of real-time adaptability revolutionizes this landscape by enabling traffic signals to dynamically adjust based on the current volume and distribution of vehicles. This not only improves overall traffic efficiency but also significantly reduces delays, leading to a more responsive and adaptive urban transportation system. Environmental Efficiency One of the critical drawbacks of existing traffic systems is their reliance on predetermined schedules, which may lead to inefficiencies during unexpected traffic congestion or periods of low vehicle volumes. Real-time adaptability in traffic signals addresses this issue by optimizing green light durations based on actual demand. This dynamic adjustment minimizes unnecessary stops and idling, contributing to improved environmental efficiency. Reduced fuel consumption and emissions become tangible benefits of this adaptive approach, aligning with broader sustainability goals for urban environments. Enhanced Safety Features: The reliance of traditional traffic management on basic sensors and manual interventions poses challenges in rapidly changing or emergency situations. Real-time adaptive systems, however, enhance safety features by quickly analyzing and responding to evolving traffic conditions. This proactive approach significantly lowers the likelihood of accidents, fostering a safer urban transportation landscape. The integration of advanced technologies for real-time decision-making marks a crucial step toward achieving a transportation system that prioritizes the well-being of commuters and pedestrians. Automated Response to Emergency Vehicles: Existing traffic systems often rely on manual activation of emergency signals and limited pre- emption systems, which can be insufficient in heavy traffic or densely populated areas. Real-time adaptive systems bring a transformative shift by autonomously detecting and prioritizing emergency vehicles. This automated response ensures immediate and seamless clearance at intersections, facilitating the swift movement of emergency services through traffic. In emergency situations, this capability can prove critical, potentially saving lives by expediting the timely arrival of crucial services. In conclusion, the shift from fixed-schedule traffic management systems to real-time adaptive systems represents a significant advancement in urban transportation. This evolution addresses inefficiencies, enhances environmental sustainability, improves safety features, and automates responses to emergency situations, collectively contributing to a more efficient, responsive, and safer urban transportation infrastructure. IV. PROPOSED SYSTEM Upon implementing the proposed model, a paradigm shift occurs in the way we assess the time for a vehicle to reach its destination. The system utilizes advanced technologies, such as real-time traffic International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) E-ISSN: 2582-2160 \u25cf Website: www.ijfmr.com \u25cf Email: editor@ijfmr.com IJFMR240214871 Volume 6, Issue 2, March-April 2024 4 data, object detection techniques, and adaptive signal timings. It dynamically adjusts estimations based on the current volume, distribution of vehicles, and other relevant factors. This ensures a more accurate and responsive assessment of the time needed for vehicles to traverse specific routes. Following implementation, a crucial step involves comparing the time periods before and after the introduction of the model. This comparative analysis allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's effectiveness in optimizing traffic flow, reducing delays, and improving overall transportation efficiency. By identifying the areas of improvement, city planners and traffic management authorities can fine-tune the model for further enhancements. A notable feature of the proposed model is its ability to create a \"Green Corridor\" for emergency vehicles. Traditional systems may require manual activation of emergency signals or face limitations in heavy traffic. The new model, however, autonomously detects and prioritizes emergency vehicles, dynamically adjusting traffic signal timings to facilitate their swift passage. This not only ensures rapid response times during emergencies but also contributes to enhanced safety and potentially life- saving intervention. 1.

Ultimately, this is the story of a city with a relentless belief in its people.\n\n\n\tWhen the novel coronavirus swept across the United States in March 2020, officials in Phoenix were faced with some unique challenges. For one, the surrounding Maricopa County had a public health department, but the city did not. City Manager Ed Zuercher charged Milton Dohoney Jr, recently retired assistant city manager *, with overseeing Phoenix\u2019s COVID-19 response; he got to work navigating infection reports, convening an emergency response team, and hiring an external epidemiologist to advise the city in lieu of a health department. Phoenix has a racially, economically, and politically diverse constituency which also made a cohesive COVID-19 response more challenging. With more than 14,000 city employees, Zuercher and Dohoney knew that this situation would require a big change in how the city operated. In order to make sure the changes had the most impact, they would have to be based on data and shared with the whole workforce in an efficient way, including an internal podcast and live interactive Webex events, both hosted with Zuercher. Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego and the Phoenix City Council convened multiple weekly council meetings to direct the city\u2019s response, and all were televised and streamed live.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTo effect the most important changes, Dohoney knew the emergency response team would need data, a difficult task as Phoenix \u2014 like many cities \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a data-sharing agreement with the county. Instead, Phoenix would have to get creative: enter Brent Olson, director of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, who had started his new position on March 2, 2020. Immediately thrown into the deep end, Olson helped the city start tracking cases by collecting the state health department\u2019s case and death data, scanning the county\u2019s public COVID-19 dashboard, and even filtering the regional school district\u2019s dashboard to the city level. As Olson describes it, this was a constantly evolving process with more data every month; eventually Phoenix settled on collecting, monitoring, and sharing three important benchmarks for the city. These were 1: positivity rates, 2: COVID-19 cases out of 100,000 people, and 3: the percentage of COVID patients in city hospitals.\n\n\n\tIn addition to the data-driven decision-making, Dohoney knew that data could be used to refine external messaging. More than 34 percent of households in Phoenix speak a language other than English at home and 18 percent of residents live in poverty, according to the most recent Census Bureau data. And, although it is obviously difficult to get exact numbers, there is a significant population of undocumented residents in Phoenix, who are exponentially more vulnerable to COVID-19 and related economic disruptions. Based on the data, Mayor Gallego and members of the Phoenix City Council approved a plan to quickly provide support, information, and tests to these populations.\n\n\n\tFor this he turned to Interim Communications Director Shelly Jamison and Michael Hammett, interim deputy communications director. Hammett helped the city achieve What Works Cities Certification, and as a result Phoenix was recognized nationally at the Silver level for its leadership in data-driven decision-making at the very start of the pandemic. The city\u2019s communications team quickly got to work on streamlining both internal and external communications. Thanks to the city\u2019s innovative data collection, city officials could easily determine where and when to communicate to residents. The city wanted to target areas where folks were disconnected from traditional government messaging and directly reach out to communities that were now especially vulnerable. In addition to streaming city meetings, utilizing the Phoenix public TV station, and working with mainstream media, the team also went to social media like Facebook, Twitter, and NextDoor, a neighborhood app. This allowed them to reach directly out to communities with multilingual messages about mask wearing, social distancing, and stay-at-home orders.\n\n\n\tHowever, aware of the digital divide, they city didn\u2019t want to rely solely on digital communications. So, the communications team also helped produce messaging for grocery stores that would pop up at point-of-sale transactions and displays in other areas of the stores. They made sure to put these multilingual messages in stores that were located in areas with high refugee and immigrant populations, and communities of color, and explicitly stated that no identification was needed to be tested in order to assuage fears among undocumented residents. According to the data, \u201cwe were reaching the communities we wanted to reach \u2014 Spanish-speaking was incredibly important to us, as a large portion of the demographic was Spanish-speaking only,\u201d said Hammett. The messages ran for three months at 21 different stores, and immediately showed results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\u201cWithin two weeks, we saw an increase of about 100 percent\u201d in COVID-19 tests, according to Hammett; the city could measure the relationship between the messaging and the tests, because they were running both. Thanks to federal relief funding, the city\u2019s Public Works Department purchased a van and converted it into a mobile testing site. Partnering with trusted community clinics, Phoenix officials set up the site, logistics, communications, and security so the contracted clinical partners could perform tests. Using Olson\u2019s data, the city would identify infection hotspots to determine where to conduct tests, staying in each place for a day or two at a time. \u201cWe do 5,000 people a week from the van,\u201d said Dohoney. \u201cThe data is fine, but the data has to drive you to do something. This data told us that there was still a demand for testing, so we bought a second van.\u201d The second van travelled to hotspot areas and stayed for longer, testing the community for multiple days at a time thanks to data-driven planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAnother population that Phoenix officials were especially concerned about was residents experiencing homelessness. Due to the extreme heat in the summer and the ease with which COVID-19 spreads in dense communities, the city turned its convention center into a socially-distant homelessness respite center. Unhoused residents were provided with bus transportation so they could access the facility, and connected with wrap-around services once there. This initiative lasted through September 2020 and, thanks to data collection, the city was able to efficiently calculate how many people would come through, how many meals needed to be served, and how many staff were required. Doubling down on its commitment to supporting the most vulnerable, January 2021, the city completed a hotel purchase, which will be used as housing for veterans experiencing homelessness \u2014 a particularly crucial mission as the COVID-19 cases continued to rise in 2021.\n\n\n\tOf course, all of this work has been complicated by extremely divisive political rhetoric, the spread of virus misinformation, and an exhausting presidential election that resulted in Arizona turning blue for the first time since 1996. Dohoney, Olson, and Hammett were candid about the toll that these interrelated crises and the political divisiveness took on the city. Early in the pandemic, city officials had to field calls from both pro- and anti-mask wearers, and they were even challenged by some city employees who initially resisted the mask mandates. According to Hammett, the city didn\u2019t consciously set messages for anti-maskers, but instead focused on educating the public about the importance of masks in general, in alignment with Maricopa County\u2019s mask regulation and the city\u2019s contracted epidemiologist. The \u201cMask Up Phoenix\u201d campaign focused on educational, data-driven positive messaging across all avenues of communication, like social media, billboards, and television.\n\n\n\t\u201cWhen we step back and look at all that\u2019s happened, essentially we have transformed the way that government services occur,\u201d said Dohoney when reflecting back on 2020. \u201cWe\u2019ve changed the way that we do business as a result of the pandemic. We have really tested our ability to adapt.\u201d Adaptation is exhausting, and no city is out of the woods yet. But Phoenix \u2014 and its residents \u2014 are resilient. Despite the challenges that COVID-19 has brought, the city will rise back stronger with data and the wellbeing of its community as a guide.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n* Milton Dohoney Jr. retired from the city of Phoenix in February 2021.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\tTopics\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBetsy Gardner\n\n\n\tBetsy Gardner is the editor of Data-Smart City Solutions and the producer of the Data-Smart City Pod.

While this is slightly lower than the Q3 growth of 4.9%, it remains above estimates of long-term potential growth. The slowdown in growth reflects a downturn in private inventory investment and federal government spending. However, consumption spending remained a key component in growth, contributing two percentage points to the overall growth. Government spending increased 4.2% over Q4 compared to the 5.8% increase in Q3 and private investment increased 0.9% over Q4 compared to the 10.0% increase in Q3. Residential investment remained positive but slowed down from the 6.7% quarter-over-quarter increase in Q3 to 2.9% in Q4 2023. As of writing, the latest nowcasts for Q1 2024 GDP growth from the New York Federal Reserve Bank1 and the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank2 are tracking 2.1% and 2.5% respectively. In total these estimates point to an economy that continues to expand, but at a moderating pace.\nThe labor market remains resilient with nonfarm payroll employment increasing by 275,000 in February 2024. Total nonfarm payroll for December 2023 and January 2024 were revised down by a combined 167,000 jobs. But, even with the downward revisions, the economy still added an average of 252,000 jobs in the last two months.3 The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9% in February, up 0.2 percentage points from January. While this is the highest level of unemployment rate since January 2022, it remains below 4% for the twenty-fifth consecutive month, the longest streak since the 1960s.\nJob openings remained steady at around 8.9 million in January 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). The ratio of job openings to unemployed, a metric that the Federal Reserve has been tracking to gauge the strength of the labor market, changed little at 1.45 in January, up from 1.42 in December 2023 indicating more job openings than unemployed. Historically, smaller firms (<250 employees) have generated more jobs (Exhibit 1). Post the pandemic, with technological advancements and increase in remote work, there has been tremendous growth in small businesses adding more labor demand by smaller firms.4 However, small businesses have been struggling to fill open positions as per the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). As of January 2024, 39% of all owners reported job openings they could not fill.5\nEnlarge Image\nInflation as measured by the price index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) excluding food and energy rose 2.8% year-over-year in January 2024 and remains at its lowest level since early 2021. So called \u201csupercore\u201d inflation\u2014measured with the PCE price index excluding food, energy and housing\u2014another metric that the Federal Reserve started tracking to gauge progress on inflation, picked up again in January 2024 with 3.5% year-over-year growth after cooling in December. While inflation has been moderating, the overall level of inflation remains above the Federal Reserve target and there is a risk that progress could halt or reverse, which may increase the amount of time before the Federal Reserve\u2019s next rate cut.\nOverall, the U.S. economy continues to follow the path it has been on in recent months. Economic growth remains robust, job growth is also strong, and inflation, while moderating, remains elevated relative to the Federal Reserve\u2019s long-run target.\nU.S. housing and mortgage market:\u00a0The drop in mortgage rates from an average of 7.4% in November 2023 to an average of 6.8% and 6.6% in December 2023 and January 2024, respectively helped home sales recover from the lows of 2023. Total (existing + new) home sales for January 2024 were at 4.66 million, up 2.9% from December 2023 but were down 1.2% from January 2023. Existing home sales grew 3.1% from December 2023 to 4.0 million in January, the largest monthly gain in a year. While month-over-month existing sales increased, they are still 1.7% below the levels of January 2023. The existing housing inventory in January 2024 increased slightly by 2% from December 2023 and was at 1.01 million units representing 3.0 months of supply at the current monthly sales pace. The median price was $379,100, up 5.1% from last year. This increase contributes to the ongoing affordability struggle in the housing market. Affordability is at a nearly 30-year low which is keeping many potential homebuyers on the sidelines.\nNew home sales for January 2024 were at 661,000, 1.5% above December 2023 sales. With affordability becoming increasingly challenging, 62% of builders reported providing sales incentives in January while 25% reported price cutting according to National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).6 Housing starts were down 14.8% from December 2023.7 The decline was largely due to a 35.8% decline in the multifamily unit construction.\nHome prices continue to exhibit strength. The FHFA Purchase-Only Home Price Index for December 2023 rose 0.1% month-over-month compared to 0.4% in November 2023 and was up 6.6% year-over-year. Despite the deceleration in December, house prices continue to outpace overall consumer prices.\nMortgage rates resumed their upward trajectory in February and averaged 6.8% for the month, as measured by Freddie Mac\u2019s Primary Mortgage Market Survey\u00ae. This increase was mainly due to the stronger than expected inflation measures with the markets pushing out the expectation of the Fed pivot to the second half of the year. Mortgage activity declined over the month on these higher rates. Overall activity was down 8.8% year-over-year on average in February. Refinance activity was up 2.9% as compared to last year and purchase applications were down 13.7% year-over-year.8\nBanks, on balance, reported tightening lending standards for most loan categories during Q4 2023, according to the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS).9 For commercial and industrial (C&I) loans as well as for all commercial real estate (CRE) loans, banks reported tighter standards and weaker demand during Q4 2023. Banks also reported tighter lending standards and weaker demand for all categories of residential real estate (RRE) loan categories, with the exception of government residential mortgages and government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) eligible residential mortgages. Regarding banks\u2019 future expectations, they are expecting the lending standards to tighten for CRE, credit card and auto loans but for C&I and RRE loans, they expect lending standards to remain unchanged. Banks also reported that they are expecting a deterioration in credit quality\u2014as measured by delinquencies and chargeoffs- across most loan types over 2024.\nTo summarize, the stability in rates brought back some activity into the housing market in January, with increases in existing and new home sales. However, tight inventory is still a key barrier to home sale volumes.\nOutlook\nThe U.S. economic outlook remains broadly positive. We continue to expect modest economic growth, albeit at a slower pace than the previous year, resulting in moderating payroll employment growth and a modest uptick in the unemployment rate. While we expect inflation to eventually moderate, in the short run, a growing economy will keep inflation above the 2% target level. Therefore, we expect the Federal Reserve to not cut rates until the summer at the earliest and potential upside surprises on inflation could push rate cuts out even further. As a result, treasury yields will remain elevated in the near term, keeping mortgage rates elevated. We forecast mortgage rates to stay above 6.5% through this quarter and next.\nThe housing market remains challenged due to high mortgage rates and a lack of inventory for sale. However, we expect a modest recovery in home sales as mortgage rates drift down in the latter half of the year which is under a scenario where inflation moves closer to the target, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut the federal funds rate. The recovery, however, will be limited as the rate lock effect will prevent homes from coming on the market. We expect upward pressure on home prices to remain as more first-time homebuyers continue to flood the housing market that is plagued by a lack of supply. As a result, we forecast home prices to increase 2.5% in 2024 and 2.1% 2025.\nUnder our baseline scenario, we expect the dollar volume of purchase origination to improve modestly in 2024 and 2025. Despite firm price growth, our view on originations is subdued since a modest recovery in home sales coupled with a rising share of cash purchases will restrict purchase origination volumes from growing significantly. Although we expect mortgage rates to drift down, there will be limited refinance activity as many homeowners have locked in historically low mortgage rates and the incentive to refinance is close to non-existent for a large share of homeowners. Together, we expect total mortgage origination to remain low through most of 2024 but start to increase at the end of the year and see modest increases in 2025.\nWhile our outlook remains optimistic, caution is warranted considering the fight against stubborn inflation may drag on longer. And if the expectation of deteriorating credit quality is realized, it could be detrimental to housing demand, however we do not expect any major negative credit event under our baseline scenario.\nMARCH 2024 SPOTLIGHT:\nThe cost of homeowners\u2019 insurance\nThe cost of homeownership has risen significantly in recent years. This is largely driven by high mortgage payments fueled by elevated mortgage rates, but homeowners\u2019 (HO) insurance costs also have a part to play \u2013 although at a smaller scale compared to mortgage principal and interest payments. HO insurance provides financial protection against physical damage to a property.10 As such, it helps safeguard home values, especially in the event of large, unexpected losses resulting from natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes and wildfires. However, as a recurring cost of owning a home, albeit a relatively smaller component, surging insurance premiums could add extra cost burdens on many households in this high borrowing cost environment. Using data from Uniform Closing Database (UCD)11 we estimate the cost of HO insurance over time and across the U.S.\nBased on our estimates, the average annual HO insurance premium (without adjustment) was $1,081 in 2018 among Freddie Mac borrowers for a single-family owner-occupied home with a conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. By 2023, the average borrower had to pay an annual premium of $1,522, which was 10.8% higher than in 2022, and 40.8% higher than in 2018 (Exhibit 2).\nOver the last five years, the value of homes owned by Freddie Mac borrowers, and therefore the value insured by HO insurance policies, has also changed. To facilitate comparison, we calculated the effective rate paid by each borrower by scaling the annual HO insurance premium over the home value. Note that the value of a home also includes the value of the land it sits on. Therefore, the actual effective HO insurance rates paid by policyholders are likely to be higher than our estimates, considering that HO insurance premiums are set based on the cost of rebuilding the home.\nOn average, the effective HO insurance rates have remained fairly stable. In 2023, the average borrower paid $4.90 in HO insurance premium for every $1,000 of their home\u2019s value, compared to the 2018 rate of $4.70 per $1,000,12 showing a slight increase of $0.20.\nEnlarge Image\nThere is a large difference in the effective HO insurance rates paid by mortgage borrowers across the U.S. (Exhibit 3A). In 2023, mortgage borrowers from LA, OK, KS, NE, and MS paid an average HO insurance premium of over $8 for every $1,000 home value, whereas borrowers from CA, WA, NV, OR, UT, and DC paid less than $2.5 for every $1,000 home value. The higher rates observed in the central U.S. are consistent with aggregated statistics collected by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).13 While exposure to natural hazards is one of many factors that affect HO insurance rates across different states, varying regulatory environments may also play a role.14 In CA, for instance, insurance companies offering HO insurance are subject to strict regulation, which limits the rates they can charge. This may in part explain why we observe a relatively lower HO insurance rate in CA, compared to other similarly disaster-prone states such as LA and MS.\nEnlarge Image\nEnlarge Image\nAs HO insurance premiums continue to rise, one question of interest is how much of a financial burden these costs place on borrowers. To quantify the extent of associated cost burdens, we calculated the share of a borrower\u2019s monthly income that was paid toward HO insurance premiums. Our analysis in Exhibit 4 shows that, in 2018, HO insurance premiums accounted for an average of 1.49% of a borrower\u2019s monthly income. In 2023 the share had moved up by 10% to 1.64% of an average borrower\u2019s income. The impacts were particularly significant in certain states such as LA, OK, KS, NE, and MS, where borrowers paid over 2.5% of their monthly income towards HO insurance premiums (Exhibit 3B). During the same period, borrowers also had to allocate a greater share of their income towards mortgage principal and interest payments, resulting in high housing cost burdens. Note that while we control for the type of property and occupancy status over time the average Freddie Mac borrower profile has changed between 2018 and 2023 and therefore the variation in insurance cost and P&I may arise from the changing borrower mix. Nevertheless,\u00a0Exhibit 4 demonstrates that while insurance costs have added to cost burdens, the net impact is much smaller than the impact of higher mortgage principal and interest payments.\nEnlarge Image\nDespite widespread cost burdens across geographies, some homeowners, especially those with lower income, are affected more by increased costs of HO insurance. We find that between 2018 and 2023, very low-income borrowers (those with an income no greater than 50% of area median income) were consistently most burdened by such costs. As shown in Exhibit 5, in 2023, the HO insurance premiums took up 3.1% of their monthly income, which was significantly higher than low-income (2.1%), middle-income (1.5%), and high-income groups (1.1%).15\nEnlarge Image\nTo conclude, as a component of ongoing housing expenses, HO insurance costs are growing but are a small fraction compared to the mortgage principal and interest payment. However, even a small incremental increase in HO insurance cost will impact those at the margin. Our findings highlight substantial heterogeneity in such costs and the cost burdens experienced by borrowers. We find that the effective HO insurance rates were the highest in the central U.S., leading to notable cost burdens in several states within this region. Among all income groups, lower-income borrowers were more challenged. While the costs of HO insurance remain a small fraction of housing expenses, it\u2019s a trend that we will continue to track going forward.\nPrepared by the Economic & Housing Research group\nSam Khater, Chief Economist\u00a0\u00a0Len Kiefer, Deputy Chief Economist\u00a0\u00a0Ajita Atreya, Macro & Housing Economics Manager\u00a0\u00a0Rama Yanamandra, Macro & Housing Economics Manager\u00a0\u00a0Penka Trentcheva, Macro & Housing Economics Senior\u00a0\u00a0Genaro Villa, Macro & Housing Economics Senior\u00a0Song You, Macro & Housing Economics Senior\u00a0Jessica Donadio, Finance Analyst\u00a0\u00a0\nhttps://www.freddiemac.com/research\nOpinions, estimates, forecasts, and other views contained in this document are those of Freddie Mac\u2019s economists and other researchers, do not necessarily represent the views of Freddie Mac or its management, and should not be construed as indicating Freddie Mac\u2019s business prospects or expected results.

The widely followed index finally hit a record high after two years in January, as momentum from late 2023 continued into the new year.\nEnthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI) continued to boost technology stocks, in particular semiconductor companies. However, unlike last year, the rally broadened out to the more cyclical areas of the market.\nThe strongest sectors included communication services, industrials, materials, energy, and financials. The broadening, driven by strong economic data, resilient corporate earnings, and expectations for rate cuts propelled the S&P 500 to new record highs 22 times during the quarter.\nMoss Adams Wealth Advisors Market View\nHere are our key takeaways on the economy and markets:\nRate Cut Expectations and the Fed\nOptimism was high heading into the new year with inflation having made significant progress toward the Fed\u2019s target in 2023. Heading into Q1, the bond market was pricing in a total of five interest rate cuts this year, with the first expected to be in March.\nHowever, the economy was stronger than expected, which is good news, but inflation turned out to be stickier than expected, which was not good news. This means Fed rate cuts have been pushed out to at least June 2024, with the market now pricing in just three rate cuts at best for 2024.\nStill, in our view, the number of rate cuts isn\u2019t as important as the fact that the Fed is able and willing to cut rates if needed or when they see more progress on inflation.\nAt the Fed\u2019s March open market meeting, the committee left rates unchanged as was expected and upgraded its economic outlook. The statement reiterated the Fed needs greater confidence that inflation is returning to target before easing.\nThe highly watched dot plot continued to show the majority of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members expecting as many as three rate cuts in 2024; however, the number of expected rate cuts in 2025 was reduced from four to three, highlighting that policy easing is likely to be gradual.\nInvestors quickly adjusted to the idea of fewer rate cuts and longer-term interest rates moved higher, causing fixed rate bonds to decline in price. Even with the uptick in interest rates, equities charged higher setting multiple new highs, underscoring the strength in the economy and attractive fundamentals for corporate earnings.\nWith market expectations and Fed messaging now looking aligned for rate cut expectations, it will take a significant change in the economic outlook, particularly inflation trends, to significantly move rates meaningfully one way or the other in the near term.\nFixed Income\nInterest-rate volatility increased in Q1 as strong economic data, stubborn inflation, and reduced rate-cut expectations pushed yields higher, stalling the bond rally seen in late 2023.\nFor the longer term, we expect bonds to resume their rally as inflation and rates decline later this year, albeit at a much slower rate. Within the credit segment, we continue to favor high quality bonds.\nInflation\nHeadline inflation has declined significantly since mid-2022.\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index,\u00a0which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, fell from a peak of 7.1% year-over-year growth in June 2022, to just 2.4% as of February 2024, putting it very near the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\nWhile progress in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which has some methodological differences from PCE, has been dramatic, moving from 8.9% at the peak to 3.2% year-over-year as of February, improvements for this indicator have stalled. The CPI has stubbornly hovered around 3.2% since October, sparking concern that it won\u2019t have further meaningful decline.\nWe believe there were seasonal factors elevating the CPI readings in Q1 and the disinflationary forces we saw in 2023 are still intact.\nCore goods prices trended lower in 2023, as supply chain distortions related to the pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine continued to fade.\nEven with the recent conflict in the Middle East, supply chains are still in good shape, and goods prices should remain well behaved. Within the more volatile components, energy prices have risen in recent months while food prices continue to ease.\nOverall, the disinflationary trend established in 2023 should continue into 2024. While the ride down may take slightly longer than anticipated, the Fed should feel reasonably confident that inflation can fall to close to their 2% target later this year.\nA Soft Landing Is Our Base Case\nOur base case is that inflation will return to normal in 2024, even as real gross domestic product (GDP) growth remains positive.\nOver the past year, inflation has fallen significantly, even as real GDP growth has accelerated, defying predictions that an economic slump or recession would be needed to resolve entrenched inflation.\nThe most recent measure of real GDP quarter-over-quarter of 3.4% was higher than the long-term average of 3.19%, so quite strong even as inflation trends improved.\nWhile the lagged effects of higher for longer interest rates will likely slow GDP growth in 2024, we believe the trend will continue to be positive\u2014meaning no recession\u2014as inflation recedes toward the 2% target.\nEmployment\nWhile the labor market has normalized from its post-pandemic boom, the US economy still added 250,000 jobs per month in 2023 and sustained this pace into early 2024.\nThe unemployment rate has remained at or below 4% since December 2022\u2014the longest streak of low unemployment since the late 1960s.\nDespite fears of an economic slowdown, strong growth in the US labor supply has allowed employers to steadily hire workers and narrow the gap between supply and demand.\nAfter falling sharply during the pandemic, labor supply in the US staged an impressive recovery over the last two years, largely due to increased immigration.\nLabor market resiliency is key to our soft-landing narrative.\nLooking Forward\nA positive January for US stocks is typically a prelude to a positive year, with that correlation holding true 80% of the time since 1928.\nIn our view, 2024 looks set to be another year of economic expansion supported by:\nTailwinds from federal government initiatives supporting infrastructure spending. We believe the historical signal of a strong start, combined with what\u2019s likely to be peak interest rates, economic expansion, and positive earnings guidance, bodes well for risk assets for the balance of 2024.\nPotential Opportunities\nCash has built up in money market funds over the past two years as the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates to the most attractive levels in over a decade. With central banks around the world indicating their intention to cut rates, there\u2019s an opportunity cost to holding too much cash. Money intended for the long term should be invested in longer-duration assets.\nEconomies around the world continue to grow as inflation wanes and secular tailwinds should continue to support long-term assets such as stocks and bonds.\nThe potential for AI, both for the companies who produce the infrastructure as well as for the companies who will benefit from its potential productivity enhancements is expected to be wide ranging.\nWe believe the market rally can broaden beyond technology as more sectors adopt AI, and as market confidence is buoyed by recent Fed messaging and falling inflation. Some portions of the market are richly valued versus history, so diversification is key.\nIn addition to publicly traded assets, private investment opportunities can provide diversification through different and less correlated sources of return, while lowering overall volatility of a portfolio.\u00a0 We see opportunities in private equity, credit, and real assets.\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to predict what will happen to markets in the short term, markets have historically done well following a peak in inflation, the conclusion of a Fed tightening cycle, and a trough in consumer confidence.\nWe\u2019re constructive on both stocks and bonds as the economy normalizes and deflationary tailwinds continue.\nWe\u2019re Here to Help\nFor more information about the economic landscape and what it means for investors, contact your Moss Adams professional.\n\n                                Moss Adams Private Client services may include investment advisory services provided by Moss Adams Wealth Advisors LLC, an SEC-registered investment adviser, and/or accounting, tax, and related services provided by Moss Adams LLP.

      "The State of Fashion 2024 report | McKinsey\nSkip to main content\nThe State of Fashion 2024: Finding pockets of growth as uncertainty reigns\n==============================================================================\nNovember 29, 2023 | Report\nFashion companies will face economic headwinds, technology shifts, and an evolving competitive landscape in 2024. However, shifting consumer priorities will continue to offer opportunities.\n\nThe State of Fashion 2024\n(128 pages)\nStorm clouds are gathering, but the experience of recent years shows how the fashion industry may ride out the challenges ahead. In 2022, the industry again showed its resilience, almost equaling the record economic profit of 2021, the McKinsey Global Fashion Index shows. Echoing the pattern of the previous year, the luxury sector outperformed, with a 36 percent rise in economic profit that offset weakness in other segments. Yet even the non-luxury sector was ahead of its long-term average. Strong margin performance meant the industry in 2022 achieved more than double the economic profit than in all years between 2011 and 2020, except for one.\nIn 2023, the industry faced challenges that were both persistent and deepening. On a regional basis, Europe and the United States saw slow growth throughout the year, while China\u2019s initially strong performance faded in the second half. Though the luxury segment initially fared well, it too began to feel the effects of weaker demand in the latter part of the year, leading to slowing sales and uneven performance.\nAbout the authors\n\nThis article is a collaborative effort by Imran Amed, representing views of Business of Fashion, and Anita Balchandani, David Barrelet, Achim Berg, Gemma D\u2019Auria, Felix R\u00f6lkens, and Ewa Starzynska, representing views from McKinsey\u2019s Retail Practice.\nLooking toward 2024, the most prominent sentiment among fashion industry leaders is uncertainty, reflecting the prospect of subdued economic growth, persistent inflation, and weak consumer confidence. Against this backdrop, businesses will be challenged to identify pockets of value and unlock new drivers of performance.\nAccording to McKinsey\u2019s analysis of fashion forecasts, the global industry will post top-line growth of 2 to 4 percent in 2024 (exhibit), with regional and country-level variations. Once again, the luxury segment is expected to generate the biggest share of economic profit. However, even there, companies will be challenged by the tough economic environment. The segment is forecast to grow globally by 3 to 5 percent, compared with 5 to 7 percent in 2023, as consumers rein in spending after a postpandemic surge. European and Chinese growth is set to slow, while US growth is expected to pick up after a relatively weak 2023, reflecting the slightly more optimistic outlook there.\n\nBeyond luxury, growth of 2 to 4 percent is predicted for the year ahead, in line with the probable outcome in 2023. The European market will likely expand by just 1 to 3 percent, compared with 5 percent in the first half of 2023 and 1 to 3 percent in the second half. Slumping consumer confidence and declining household savings are expected to be the most probable causes of restrained spending. In the United States, nonluxury sector growth of 0 to 2 percent is forecast. And China is expected to be similarly challenged amid 4 to 6 percent growth, which is a slight uptick from the end of 2023 but slow when considered on a historical basis.\nThese are just some of the findings from The State of Fashion 2024, published by the Business of Fashion (BoF) and McKinsey. The eighth report in the annual series discusses the major themes shaping the fashion economy and assesses the industry\u2019s potential responses. Reflecting in-depth research and many conversations with industry leaders, it reveals the key trends that could shape the fashion landscape in the year ahead.\n\n\nExplore COP29 with McKinsey\nJoin our series of dynamic virtual events during COP29.

Some 62 percent of executives in this year\u2019s survey, conducted in September, cite geopolitical instability as the top risk to growth. Economic volatility is cited by 55 percent and inflation is mentioned by 51 percent (compared with 78 percent last year). The global average headline rate of inflation is predicted to moderate to 5.8 percent\u2014still high on a historical basis\u2014from 6.9 percent in 2023.1_World economic outlook update: Near-term resilience, persistent challenges_, International Monetary Fund, July 2023.\nAgainst a challenging economic backdrop, executive views of the industry\u2019s prospects are more divided than in any year since the launch of the BoF\u2013McKinsey Executive Survey in 2017. While 26 percent of survey respondents say they expect conditions to improve year on year, 37 percent see them remaining the same and 38 percent think they will worsen.\nUncertainty within the industry reflects the broader economic situation, albeit with regional divergence. Going into 2024, pressure on household incomes is expected to dampen demand for apparel and prompt trading down across categories. Still, there are geographic outliers that may offer comfort. One is India, where consumer confidence hit a four-year high in September 2023.2\u201cConsumer confidence survey,\u201d Reserve Bank of India, October 6, 2023. India-based executives are more optimistic than those in Western countries, with 85 percent of respondents to McKinsey\u2019s Global Economics Intelligence survey\u00a0saying that conditions have improved in the past six months.3Ryosuke Hanada, \u201cIndia\u2019s consumer sentiment rebounds past pre-COVID levels,\u201d Nikkei Asia, July 18, 2023. China\u2019s economy is facing challenges, but the country\u2019s consumers show a higher intent to shop for fashion in 2024 than consumers in both the United States and Europe.\nTen themes for 2024\nTo prepare for challenges and be alert to opportunities, leading fashion companies will likely prioritize contingency planning for the coming year. A key theme will be companies keeping a firm grip on costs and inventories while driving growth by precisely managing prices. Brands and suppliers can expect an increasingly competitive environment. But they will also have opportunities, with consumers discovering new styles, tastes, and priorities\u2014all presenting routes to value creation. As previously done, this year\u2019s report highlights ten emerging themes that will be high on leadership agendas.\n\n\nGlobal economy:\n\nFragmented future. In 2024, the global economic outlook will continue to be unsettled, as financial, geopolitical, and other challenges weigh on consumer confidence. Fashion markets in China, Europe, and the United States will likely face headwinds, some of which reflect individual regional dynamics. Suppliers, brands, and retailers may need to bolster contingency planning and manage for uncertainty.\nClimate urgency. The frequency and intensity of extreme weather-related events in 2023 mean the climate crisis is an even more urgent priority than in previous years. With physical and transition risks rising across continents, the industry must not delay in tackling emissions and building resilience into supply chains.\n\nConsumer shifts:\n\n\nVacation mode. Consumers are gearing up for the biggest year of travel since before the pandemic. But a shift in values means expectations are evolving, even as shopping remains a priority. Brands and retailers should refresh distribution and category strategies to reflect the new reality.\n\nThe new face of influence. It\u2019s time for brand marketers to update their influencer playbooks, as a new guard of creative personalities wins fans. Working with opinion leaders in 2024 will require a different type of partnership, an emphasis on video, and a willingness to loosen the reins on creative control.\nOutdoors reinvented. Technical outdoor clothing and \u201cgorpcore\u201d are in demand as consumers embrace healthier lifestyles. In 2024, more outdoor brands are expected to launch lifestyle collections. At the same time, lifestyle brands will likely embed technical elements into collections, blurring the lines between functionality and style.\n\nFashion system:\n\n\nGenerative AI\u2019s creative crossroads. After generative AI\u2019s (gen AI) breakout year in 2023, more use cases are emerging across the industry. Capturing value will require fashion players to look beyond automation and explore gen AI\u2019s potential to enhance the work of human creatives.\n\nFast fashion\u2019s power play. Fast-fashion competition is set to be fiercer than ever. Challengers, led by Shein and Temu, are bringing new tactics on price, customer experience, and speed. Success for disruptors and incumbents could hinge on adapting to new consumer preferences while navigating the regulatory agenda.\nAll eyes on brand. Brand marketing is expected to be back in the spotlight as the fashion industry manages a switch away from performance marketing. Brands may benefit from forging emotional connections with consumers as marketers rewrite playbooks to emphasise long-term brand building.\nSustainability rules. The era of fashion industry self-regulation is drawing to a close. Across jurisdictions, new rules will have significant effects on both consumers and fashion players. Brands and manufacturers may consider revamping business models to align with the changes ahead.\nBullwhip snaps back. Shifts in consumer demand have created a \u201cbullwhip effect,\u201d by which order volatility reverberates unpredictably through supply chains. Suppliers will likely face pressure as brands and retailers focus on transparency and strategic partnerships.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead\nAs the industry continues to be challenged by geopolitical and economic headwinds, fashion leaders in 2024 will look to strike a careful balance between managing uncertainty and seizing opportunities. With cost-saving tactics mostly exhausted, companies may focus on growing sales, underpinned by new pricing and promotion strategies. Across the industry, net intent to raise prices is more than 50 percent, according to the BoF\u2013McKinsey Executive Survey. At the same time, reduced cost pressures could provide a potential boost to performance.\nAs climate change brings increasingly extreme weather events and global temperatures rise, the coming year is likely to mark a heightened industry focus on environmental, social, and governance issues. Our survey shows that the topic is seen as both the number-one priority and number-one challenge for industry executives. The most successful companies will find a balance between sustainability initiatives, risk management, and commercial imperatives.\nIn an uncertain world, consumer discretionary spend will be weighted toward trusted categories and brands. Hard luxury goods\u2014jewelry, watches, and leather\u2014will likely be in demand, reflecting their potential investment value in tough economic times. Consumers are expected to travel more and continue spending more time outdoors. And they prefer emotional connections and authenticity over celebrity endorsements.\nAll told, executives are bracing for a strategically complex year ahead. To counter uncertainty, leading companies will prepare for a range of outcomes. The most successful will become more resilient, better equipped to manage the challenges, and ready to accelerate when the storm clouds begin to clear.\nAnita Balchandani is a senior partner in McKinsey\u2019s London office, where Ewa Starzynska is a consultant; David Barrelet is an associate partner in the Munich office; Achim Berg is a senior partner in the Frankfurt office; Gemma D\u2019Auria is a senior partner in the Milan office; and Felix R\u00f6lkens is a partner in the Berlin office.

      "U.S. Department of Transportation Updates DBE and ACDBE Regulations\nShare\nThe DBE and ACDBE programs are designed to allow small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to compete fairly for DOT-funded contracts led by state and local transportation agencies and in airport concession opportunities. As recipients of DOT funding, states implement the federal DBE program and transportation agencies and airports, called \u201cSponsors,\u201d develop their own DBE contracting goals in accordance with DOT regulations, found at 49 C.F.R. Parts 23 and 26.[1] The DOT reports nearly 50,000 certified DBEs and 3,500 certified ACDBEs.[2] State and local agencies that implement the DBE program\u2014which includes 53 departments of transportation, more than 500 transit agencies, and 3,200 eligible airport sponsors[3]\u2014certify these firms.\nThe rules governing DBE certification in every state are set in 49 C.F.R. Parts 26. For the first time in a decade, the DOT has modernized the DBE program, including streamlining the DBE and ACDBE certification and eligibility process, aligning DBE and ACDBE program definitions, implementing COVID-19 flexibilities, and expanding reporting requirements for DOT-funding recipients.\nThis GT Alert summarizes some of the key changes to the DBE program that DBE firms and applicants should be aware of.\nA. Personal Net Worth\nThe changes include an update to the personal net worth and program size thresholds for the DBE program. Taking into account inflation and most common forms of wealth, DOT has increased the personal net worth limit from $1.32 million to $2.047 million.[4] Furthermore, personal net worth will now exclude retirement assets and 100% of the personal property in a DBE-owner\u2019s primary residence (which is lowered to 50% if the owner lives with a spouse or domestic partner).[5] State marital and community property laws will also no longer have an effect on personal net worth, a change that may increase predictability and level the playing field for DBEs in every jurisdiction.[6]\nB. DBE/ACDBE Size Standards\nGenerally, a firm and its affiliates must be a small business, as defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA).[7] It must not have annual gross receipts in excess of the DBE size limits and must meet the size standard appropriate to the type of work to be performed on the specific DOT-assisted contract, which continues to be determined by the applicable NAICS Code.[8] Starting March 1, 2024, DOT adjusted the business size limit for applicants and certified DBEs seeking FHWA and FTA-assisted contracts for inflation from $30.40 million to $30.72 million.[9] The adjusted gross receipts cap does not apply to determining a firm\u2019s eligibility for FAA-assisted projects.[10]\nFor the ACDBE program, DOT considers a firm a small business if its gross receipts, in accordance with 13 CFR 121.104, averaged over the firm\u2019s previous five fiscal years, does not exceed $56.42 million.[11] The new final rule requires ACDBEs that are parties to a joint venture to now include the proportionate share of joint venture receipts in its gross receipt calculation.[12]\u00a0\nC.\u00a0Ownership\nAdditional key updates to the DBE program include an overhaul of the ownership requirements for certification eligibility. The new DBE rules frame ownership in terms of \u201cinvestments\u201d and provide detailed guidance on which types of investments in ownership make a firm eligible for certification.[13] DOT considers transactions/transfers such as purchases, capital contributions, and certain gifts ownership investments.[14]\nNotably, the final rule clarifies that contributions of time, labor, and services (also referred to as \u201csweat equity\u201d) do not qualify as investments.[15] Purchases, capital contributions, and gifts are considered investments if they have real economic effect and meet specified standards regarding maintenance and proportionality.[16] The disadvantaged owner cannot withdraw their investment and must maintain its proportion relative to those of other owners.[17] Moreover, no owner can derive benefits and burdens disproportionate to their ownership share.[18] The new rule also removes the marital property provisions, previously codified at 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 26.69(i), from the determination of DBE ownership.\nLastly, the final rule addresses debt-financed investments, which have presented a practical challenge to certifiers. Borrowing to finance a disadvantaged owner\u2019s investment in the DBE firm is acceptable and will not prevent certification, provided it does not exceed 85% of the total value of the investment, the firm itself is not the lender or guarantor, and the loan is arms-length and enforceable.[19]\nD. Control\nThe amendments related to control of a DBE firm have a dual objective of removing obstacles from applicant firms while ensuring that states and local agencies only certify those firms that are genuinely controlled by disadvantaged owners.[20] The primary question certifiers must now ask is: does the disadvantaged owner run the show?[21] The final rule puts this responsibility on the certifier, recommending more in-depth inquiries (including interviewing employees) over a simple review of an operating agreement. DOT encourages certifiers to make the following inquiries:\nThe final rule includes specific governance requirements, e.g., the disadvantaged owner must hold the highest officer position, as well as prohibitions, e.g., quorum requirements for a board of directors must not block the disadvantaged owner from calling a meeting to act on business of the firm.[22]\nE. Implications for DBE Firms and Applicants\nThe changes discussed here include only a handful of the modifications made to the DBE and ACDBE programs. Consult the full text of the final rule, along with a summary, webinars, and training sessions from DOT, for more information.\u00a0\nWhile DOT believes the rule does not change the underlying programs or projects carried out with department funds, the modifications may impact who is eligible for the DBE program.[23] These changes may also open opportunities for more disadvantaged small businesses to take advantage of the programs and streamline the certification process. Those wishing to learn more about the full extent of changes to the DBE and ACDBE programs and how they may affect a business\u2019s certification or eligibility should consult an experienced government contract attorney.\n[1] David Keen et al., Compendium of Successful Practices, Strategies, and Resources in the U.S. DOT Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program 14, 36 (Nat\u2019l Acad. of Sci., Eng\u2019g, and Med., 2019).\n[2]\u00a0USDOT Significantly Modernizes the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program and Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program Regulations, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp.

      "2024 Preview: Four New Trucking Regulations to Watch\nThere are some major changes on the horizon for commercial trucking. Is your fleet prepared? As 2023 draws to a close, it\u2019s critical that organizations set aside time research the many regulatory updates that could take place throughout 2024.\nBelow, we explore some of the most significant regulations and the proactive steps you can take to ready your commercial drivers.\u00a0\n1. FMCSA Safety Measurement System (SMS) Updates\u00a0\nPerhaps the largest potential shift in commercial transportation is the\u00a0updated\u00a0FMCSA Safety Measurement System (SMS). The FMCSA has proposed nine major changes to their methodology, including (but not limited to): \u00a0\nThese wide-reaching changes will have major impacts on all carriers. We explore some of the finer details in a recent webinar, \u201cExpert Perspectives: Navigating FMCSA\u2019s Proposed Methodology Changes.\u201d\u00a0\n2. CDL Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse: Return to Duty Process \u00a0\nPer Title 49 CFR parts 40 and 382, drivers with drug or alcohol violations are given \u201cprohibited\u201d status in the FMCSA\u2019s Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse. As of November 18, 2024, all prohibited drivers will lose either existing commercial driving privileges or their approval for a Commercial Learners Permit (CLP). \u00a0\nDrivers will be required to undergo a rigorous re-evaluation to return to good standing. Prohibited drivers must: \u00a0\nTo prevent potential suspension, drivers and fleet managers alike must learn the ins and outs of Clearinghouse procedures, including pre-employment drug and alcohol testing, how to access records and what data must be reported to the FMCSA.\u00a0\n3. Mandatory Speed Limiters\nA redacted DOT report ruffled feathers this fall, suggesting that commercial vehicle speeds would soon be limited to 68 mph on interstates and highways. The organization quickly backtracked and explained that the specific speed limit was yet to be determined. Evaluation is still underway, however, and the official proposal will be published on Friday, December 29, 2023. In addition to the maximum speed limit, the documentation will also outline which types of vehicles are subject to the new regulations. It\u2019s widely believed that speed limiters will only be required for vehicles made after 2003 that weigh 26,000 pounds or more.\nIt will likely take a while before speed limiters affect day-to-day operations, but it\u2019s always a good idea to remind drivers about safe driving practices like speed management. These seven safety messages can help create positive habits.\n4. Competency and Skills Testing\nIn 2009, the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety submitted a proposal urging the FMCSA to implement a competency test for commercial drivers, ensuring that all commercial drivers on American roadways are qualified, properly trained and well-versed in federal regulations. The petition sat in limbo for the next 14 years. In\u00a0August of 2023, to the surprise of many, the FMCSA issued an Advance Notice of Potential Rule Making (ANPRM) indicating their intent to pursue the motion. \u00a0\nAlthough this new regulation has not yet gone into effect, it\u2019s in commercial carriers\u2019 best interest to revisit their approach to training and hiring in 2024. Routine training is valuable for new drivers and seasoned professionals alike. In fact, SambaSafety data shows that fleets who undergo monthly training have 50% fewer violations that those who train twice a year. An effective driver training program should incorporate a healthy blend of topics \u2014 like space management, distracted driving and defensive driving \u2014 that are relevant to people of all skill levels. \u00a0\nCommercial carriers should also maintain strict hiring practices to mitigate problems before they happen. Vetting drivers carefully will quickly identify high-risk candidates, ensuring only the safest and most skilled drivers are behind the wheel. \u00a0\nNavigating New Trucking Regulations\nDon\u2019t underestimate the power of advanced preparation. Dedicating time to explore all new trucking regulations the only way fleet managers can set their organizations up for ongoing success in the coming year. Luckily, we\u2019ve done some of the heavy lifting for you.

      "The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value\nIf 2023 was the year the world discovered generative AI (gen AI), 2024 is the year organizations truly began using\u2014and deriving business value from\u2014this new technology. In the latest McKinsey Global Survey\u00a0on AI, 65 percent of respondents report that their organizations are regularly using gen AI, nearly double the percentage from our previous survey just ten months ago. Respondents\u2019 expectations for gen AI\u2019s impact remain as high as they were last year, with three-quarters predicting that gen AI will lead to significant or disruptive change in their industries in the years ahead.\nAbout the authors\nThis article is a collaborative effort by Alex Singla, Alexander Sukharevsky, Lareina Yee, and Michael Chui, with Bryce Hall, representing views from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and McKinsey Digital.\nOrganizations are already seeing material benefits from gen AI use, reporting both cost decreases and revenue jumps in the business units deploying the technology. The survey also provides insights into the kinds of risks presented by gen AI\u2014most notably, inaccuracy\u2014as well as the emerging practices of top performers to mitigate those challenges and capture value.\nAI adoption surges\nInterest in generative AI has also brightened the spotlight on a broader set of AI capabilities. For the past six years, AI adoption by respondents\u2019 organizations has hovered at about 50 percent. This year, the survey finds that adoption has jumped to 72 percent (Exhibit 1). And the interest is truly global in scope. Our 2023 survey found that AI adoption did not reach 66 percent in any region; however, this year more than two-thirds of respondents in nearly every region say their organizations are using AI.1Organizations based in Central and South America are the exception, with 58 percent of respondents working for organizations based in Central and South America reporting AI adoption. Looking by industry, the biggest increase in adoption can be found in professional services.2Includes respondents working for organizations focused on human resources, legal services, management consulting, market research, R&D, tax preparation, and training.\nAlso, responses suggest that companies are now using AI in more parts of the business. Half of respondents say their organizations have adopted AI in two or more business functions, up from less than a third of respondents in 2023 (Exhibit 2).\nGen AI adoption is most common in the functions where it can create the most value\nMost respondents now report that their organizations\u2014and they as individuals\u2014are using gen AI. Sixty-five percent of respondents say their organizations are regularly using gen AI in at least one business function, up from one-third last year. The average organization using gen AI is doing so in two functions, most often in marketing and sales and in product and service development\u2014two functions in which previous research\u00a0determined that gen AI adoption could generate the most value3\u201cThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,\u201d McKinsey, June 14, 2023.\u2014as well as in IT (Exhibit 3). The biggest increase from 2023 is found in marketing and sales, where reported adoption has more than doubled. Yet across functions, only two use cases, both within marketing and sales, are reported by 15 percent or more of respondents.\nGen AI also is weaving its way into respondents\u2019 personal lives. Compared with 2023, respondents are much more likely to be using gen AI at work and even more likely to be using gen AI both at work and in their personal lives (Exhibit 4). The survey finds upticks in gen AI use across all regions, with the largest increases in Asia\u2013Pacific and Greater China. Respondents at the highest seniority levels, meanwhile, show larger jumps in the use of gen Al tools for work and outside of work compared with their midlevel-management peers. Looking at specific industries, respondents working in energy and materials and in professional services report the largest increase in gen AI use.\nInvestments in gen AI and analytical AI are beginning to create value\nThe latest survey also shows how different industries are budgeting for gen AI. Responses suggest that, in many industries, organizations are about equally as likely to be investing more than 5 percent of their digital budgets in gen AI as they are in nongenerative, analytical-AI solutions (Exhibit 5). Yet in most industries, larger shares of respondents report that their organizations spend more than 20 percent on analytical AI than on gen AI. Looking ahead, most respondents\u201467 percent\u2014expect their organizations to invest more in AI over the next three years.\nWhere are those investments paying off? For the first time, our latest survey explored the value created by gen AI use by business function. The function in which the largest share of respondents report seeing cost decreases is human resources. Respondents most commonly report meaningful revenue increases (of more than 5 percent) in supply chain and inventory management (Exhibit 6). For analytical AI, respondents most often report seeing cost benefits in service operations\u2014in line with what we found last year\u2014as well as meaningful revenue increases from AI use in marketing and sales.\nInaccuracy: The most recognized and experienced risk of gen AI use\nAs businesses begin to see the benefits of gen AI, they\u2019re also recognizing the diverse risks associated with the technology. These can range from data management risks such as data privacy, bias, or intellectual property (IP) infringement to model management risks, which tend to focus on inaccurate output or lack of explainability. A third big risk category is security and incorrect use.\nRespondents to the latest survey are more likely than they were last year to say their organizations consider inaccuracy and IP infringement to be relevant to their use of gen AI, and about half continue to view cybersecurity as a risk (Exhibit 7).\nConversely, respondents are less likely than they were last year to say their organizations consider workforce and labor displacement to be relevant risks and are not increasing efforts to mitigate them.\nIn fact, inaccuracy\u2014which can affect use cases across the gen AI value chain, ranging from customer journeys and summarization to coding and creative content\u2014is the only risk that respondents are significantly more likely than last year to say their organizations are actively working to mitigate.\nSome organizations have already experienced negative consequences from the use of gen AI, with 44 percent of respondents saying their organizations have experienced at least one consequence (Exhibit 8). Respondents most often report inaccuracy as a risk that has affected their organizations, followed by cybersecurity and explainability.\nOur previous research has found that there are several elements of governance that can help in scaling gen AI use responsibly, yet few respondents report having these risk-related practices in place.4\u201cImplementing generative AI with speed and safety,\u201d McKinsey Quarterly, March 13, 2024. For example, just 18 percent say their organizations have an enterprise-wide council or board with the authority to make decisions involving responsible AI governance, and only one-third say gen AI risk awareness and risk mitigation controls are required skill sets for technical talent.\nBringing gen AI capabilities to bear\nThe latest survey also sought to understand how, and how quickly, organizations are deploying these new gen AI tools. We have found three archetypes for implementing gen AI solutions: takers use off-the-shelf, publicly available solutions; shapers customize those tools with proprietary data and systems; and makers develop their own foundation models from scratch.5\u201cTechnology\u2019s generational moment with generative AI: A CIO and CTO guide,\u201d McKinsey, July 11, 2023. Across most industries, the survey results suggest that organizations are finding off-the-shelf offerings applicable to their business needs\u2014though many are pursuing opportunities to customize models or even develop their own (Exhibit 9). About half of reported gen AI uses within respondents\u2019 business functions are utilizing off-the-shelf, publicly available models or tools, with little or no customization. Respondents in energy and materials, technology, and media and telecommunications are more likely to report significant customization or tuning of publicly available models or developing their own proprietary models to address specific business needs.\nRespondents most often report that their organizations required one to four months from the start of a project to put gen AI into production, though the time it takes varies by business function (Exhibit 10). It also depends upon the approach for acquiring those capabilities. Not surprisingly, reported uses of highly customized or proprietary models are 1.5 times more likely than off-the-shelf, publicly available models to take five months or more to implement.\nGen AI high performers are excelling despite facing challenges\nGen AI is a new technology, and organizations are still early in the journey of pursuing its opportunities and scaling it across functions. So it\u2019s little surprise that only a small subset of respondents (46 out of 876) report that a meaningful share of their organizations\u2019 EBIT can be attributed to their deployment of gen AI. Still, these gen AI leaders are worth examining closely. These, after all, are the early movers, who already attribute more than 10 percent of their organizations\u2019 EBIT to their use of gen AI. Forty-two percent of these high performers say more than 20 percent of their EBIT is attributable to their use of nongenerative, analytical AI, and they span industries and regions\u2014though most are at organizations with less than $1 billion in annual revenue. The AI-related practices at these organizations can offer guidance to those looking to create value from gen AI adoption at their own organizations.\nTo start, gen AI high performers are using gen AI in more business functions\u2014an average of three functions, while others average two. They, like other organizations, are most likely to use gen AI in marketing and sales and product or service development, but they\u2019re much more likely than others to use gen AI solutions in risk, legal, and compliance; in strategy and corporate finance; and in supply chain and inventory management. They\u2019re more than three times as likely as others to be using gen AI in activities ranging from processing of accounting documents and risk assessment to R&D testing and pricing and promotions. While, overall, about half of reported gen AI applications within business functions are utilizing publicly available models or tools, gen AI high performers are less likely to use those off-the-shelf options than to either implement significantly customized versions of those tools or to develop their own proprietary foundation models.\nWhat else are these high performers doing differently? For one thing, they are paying more attention to gen-AI-related risks. Perhaps because they are further along on their journeys, they are more likely than others to say their organizations have experienced every negative consequence from gen AI we asked about, from cybersecurity and personal privacy to explainability and IP infringement. Given that, they are more likely than others to report that their organizations consider those risks, as well as regulatory compliance, environmental impacts, and political stability, to be relevant to their gen AI use, and they say they take steps to mitigate more risks than others do.\nGen AI high performers are also much more likely to say their organizations follow a set of risk-related best practices (Exhibit 11). For example, they are nearly twice as likely as others to involve the legal function and embed risk reviews early on in the development of gen AI solutions\u2014that is, to \u201cshift left.\u201d They\u2019re also much more likely than others to employ a wide range of other best practices, from strategy-related practices to those related to scaling.\nIn addition to experiencing the risks of gen AI adoption, high performers have encountered other challenges that can serve as warnings to others (Exhibit 12). Seventy percent say they have experienced difficulties with data, including defining processes for data governance, developing the ability to quickly integrate data into AI models, and an insufficient amount of training data, highlighting the essential role that data play in capturing value. High performers are also more likely than others to report experiencing challenges with their operating models, such as implementing agile ways of working and effective sprint performance management.\nAbout the research\nThe online survey was in the field from February 22 to March 5, 2024, and garnered responses from 1,363 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. Of those respondents, 981 said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one business function, and 878 said their organizations were regularly using gen AI in at least one function. To adjust for differences in response rates, the data are weighted by the contribution of each respondent\u2019s nation to global GDP.\nAlex Singla and Alexander Sukharevsky\u00a0are global coleaders of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and senior partners in McKinsey\u2019s Chicago and London offices, respectively; Lareina Yee\u00a0is a senior partner in the Bay Area office, where Michael Chui, a McKinsey Global Institute partner, is a partner; and Bryce Hall\u00a0is an associate partner in the Washington, DC, office.\nThey wish to thank Kaitlin Noe, Larry Kanter, Mallika Jhamb, and Shinjini Srivastava for their contributions to this work.\nThis article was edited by Heather Hanselman, a senior editor in McKinsey\u2019s Atlanta office."

      "Japan's GDP grows 0.9% in July-Sept. on solid consumption\n\n\n        \n                    By Satoshi Iizuka,        \n                    KYODO NEWS\n        \n                    -\n        \n                Nov 15, 2024 - 14:14 |  All, Japan\n\nJapan's economy grew an annualized real 0.9 percent in the three months through September, supported by solid consumer spending due to a one-off income tax cut and higher summer bonuses, government data showed Friday, but whether the momentum will continue is unclear.\nReal gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, expanded for the second consecutive quarter, but growth decelerated from the prior quarter's revised 2.2 percent amid sluggish capital spending and exports.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, real GDP increased 0.2 percent from the April-June period. GDP is the total value of goods and services produced in a country.\nPrivate consumption, which accounts for more than half of the economy, rose 0.9 percent, marking the second consecutive quarter of increase, the Cabinet Office said in a preliminary report.\nConsumer spending rose as vehicle sales grew after the resumption of some domestic auto plants that were halted due to noncompliant vehicle tests. A surge in emergency food buying also contributed as people stockpiled after an August advisory on a potential megaquake along the Nankai Trough, the Cabinet Office said.\n\"Private spending has accelerated from the April-June period, due to special factors, including the tax cut and summer bonuses,\" Shinichiro Kobayashi, a senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, said. The government implemented the income and residence levy reduction worth 40,000 yen ($255) per person in June.\nBut Kobayashi cast doubt on whether the upward momentum would continue into the next quarter or later without those special positive factors, as consumers tend to tighten their purse strings amid rising prices.\nA recent weakening of the yen could rekindle concerns over a surge in imported product prices, with the Japanese currency falling to a four-month low against the U.S. dollar in the 156 level on Friday.\nReal wages, which take into account the impact of inflation, dropped for the second consecutive month in September after rising in June and July, even as domestic companies agreed to their biggest wage hikes in three decades during this year's labor-management negotiations.\nAmong other key components of GDP, capital investment declined 0.2 percent, after an expansion in the previous quarter, the report said. Japanese companies curbed investment in manufacturing machinery amid concerns over the outlook for the global economy, a Cabinet Office official said.\nExports were up 0.4 percent, compared with a rise of 2.6 percent in the previous quarter, amid a lull in the number of foreign travelers to Japan.\nJapan has benefited from an influx of overseas visitors, fueled in part by a weaker yen that makes travel and shopping in the country more affordable. Their spending is considered an export in the GDP data.\nMeanwhile, imports, whose growth impacts GDP negatively, saw an uptick of 2.1 percent, boosted by demand for overseas-made smartphones.\nAs for foreign factors, \"it is necessary to keep tabs on various uncertain factors, including a slowdown in the Chinese economy and economic policies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump,\" Kobayashi said.\nAnalysts said that Trump's proposed policies, including tax cuts, may drive up inflation and broaden the U.S.-Japan interest rate gap, strengthening the dollar against the yen and denting Japanese consumer spending through higher import costs.\nNominal GDP increased 0.5 percent from the previous quarter, or 2.1 percent at an annualized rate.\nRelated coverage:\nJapan's GDP growth surprisingly strong per working-age adult: study\nBOJ keeps rates on hold, Ueda tempers another hike speculation\nBOJ likely to forgo rate hike amid concerns over borrowing cost rise\n\n            Nov 15, 2024\n                            | KYODO NEWS\n\nPopular\nAmerican man arrested for defacing Tokyo's Meiji Jingu shrine\n\n                    Nov 13, 2024\n                                            | KYODO NEWS\n\nJapan minor party head apologizes for \"uterus removal\" remark\n\n                    Nov 10, 2024\n                                            | KYODO NEWS\n\nIshiba formally reelected as Japan PM, eyes minority gov't\n\n                    Nov 12, 2024\n                                            | KYODO NEWS\n\nJapan's Princess Yuriko, great-aunt of emperor, dies at 101\n\n                    Nov 15, 2024\n                                            | KYODO NEWS\n\nJapanese comedian drops suit vs. publisher over sex scandal report\n\n                    Nov 8, 2024\n                                            | KYODO NEWS\n\nMore from Japan\nKyodo News Digest: Nov. 18, 2024\n\n        27 minutes ago\n                | KYODO NEWS\n\nMt.

It represents all the energy required to supply end users in the country. Some of these energy sources are used directly while most are transformed into fuels or electricity for final consumption.\nEnergy production includes any fossil fuels drilled and mined, which can be burned to produce electricity or used as fuels, as well as energy produced by nuclear fission and renewable power sources such as hydro, wind and solar PV. Bioenergy - which here includes both modern and traditional sources, including the burning of municipal waste - is also an important domestic energy source in many countries.\nImports, particularly of fossil fuels like oil, natural gas and coal, make up an important part of the energy supply in many countries. Countries that rely heavily on imported energy may be vulnerable to supply disruption from external events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. In countries that export large amounts of energy, falling energy prices can also cause major economic shocks.\nEnergy sources, particularly fossil fuels, are often transformed into more useful or practical forms before being used. For example, crude oil is refined into many different kinds of fuels and products, while coal, oil and natural gas can be burned to generate electricity and heat. Other forms of transformation, such as extracting gas or oil from coal, play a relatively minor role in the energy systems of most countries.\nOne of the most important types of transformation for the energy system is the refining of crude oil into oil products, such as the fuels that power automobiles, ships and planes.\nAnother important form of transformation is the generation of electricity. Thermal power plants generate electricity by harnessing the heat of burning fuels or nuclear reactions \u2013 during which up to half of their energy content is lost. Renewable power sources generate electricity directly from natural forces such as the sun, wind, or the movement of water.\nTotal final consumption (TFC) is the energy consumed by end users such as individuals and businesses to heat and cool buildings, to run lights, devices, and appliances, and to power vehicles, machines and factories. It also includes non-energy uses of energy products, such as fossil fuels used to make chemicals.\nSome of the energy found in primary sources is lost when converting them to useable final products, especially electricity. As a result, the breakdown of final consumption can look very different from that of the primary energy supply (TES). Both are needed to fully understand the energy system.\nThe sectoral breakdown of a country's energy demand, which is based on its economy, geography and history, can greatly impact its energy needs and which energy sources it relies on to meet those needs \u2013 such as fueling automobiles, heating or cooling homes or running factories.\n\n        Related content\n    \nIEA provides analysis on wide range of fuels and technologies for Japan\u2019s G7 Presidency\n\n                        News \u2014 13 April 2023\n                    \nExecutive Director meets with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan on energy crisis and G7\n\n                        News \u2014 09 January 2023\n                    \nIEA Contribution to G20 Energy in 2019\n\n                        Conference \u2014 28 Jun 2019\n                    \nUK government and IEA spearhead largest ever global initiative to make products more energy efficient\n\n                        News \u2014 04 November 2021\n                    \nLeveraging carbon pricing to accelerate power sector decarbonisation in Asia Pacific\n\n                        Event \u2014 08 Jul 2021 10:00\u201411:00\n                    \nJapan will have to tread a unique pathway to net zero, but it can get there through innovation and investment\n\n                        Commentary \u2014 28 June 2021\n                    \nIEA welcomes G7 Leaders\u2019 commitment to reach net zero by 2050\n\n                        News \u2014 14 June 2021\n                    \nInnovation and market reform needed to drive Japan\u2019s clean energy transition, IEA policy review finds\n\n                        Press release \u2014 04 March 2021\n                    \nJapan 2021\nEnergy Policy Review\n\n                        Country report \u2014 March 2021\n                    \nMultilateral Meeting strengthens IEA\u2019s global leadership role\n\n                        News \u2014 01 December 2020\n                    \nRenewables 2020\nAnalysis and forecast to 2025\n\n                        Fuel report \u2014 November 2020\n                    \nIEA hosts high-level meeting on ways to scale up low-carbon hydrogen industries\n\n                        News \u2014 05 December 2019\n                    \nTransition to a Low-Carbon Economy: Socio-Economic Considerations\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 24 May 2011\n                    \nTransforming Innovation into Realistic Market Implementation Programmes\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 27 Apr 2010\n                    \nThe Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy: Socio-Economic Considerations\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 24 May 2011\n                    \nTechnical Workshop on Climate-Energy Policy Approaches for the Industrial Sector\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 16 Jan 2015\n                    \nScaling Up Financing to Expand the Renewables Portfolio\n\n                        Workshop \u2014  9 Apr 2013\n                    \nRenewables in the Mainstream: Towards a \"Third Way\" for electricity market design?\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 24 Mar 2015\n                    \nModelling and Analyses in R&D Priority-Setting and Innovation\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 23 Apr 2014\n                    \nInternational Conference on Efficient Power Generation\n\n                        Conference \u2014 19 Sep 2011\n                    \nIntegrating Carbon Pricing with Energy Policies\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 18 Mar 2013\n                    \nIndustry/business use of \u2018complementary measures\u2019 for decarbonisation: \r\r\nLooking beyond pricing and regulation to voluntary and other approaches\n\n                        Workshop \u2014 22 Jun 2015\n                    \nOil Market Report -

Credit: Copernicus Climate Change Service/ECMWF.\u00a0\n\n          September 2024\n  \n\nAccording to the ERA5 dataset, globally September 2024 was:\nSeptember 2024 was the 14th month in a 15-month period for which the global-average surface air temperature exceeded 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Eight of these 14 months, from September 2023 to April 2024, were substantially above 1.5\u00b0C, ranging from 1.58\u00b0C to 1.78\u00b0C. However, the values for May, June, August and September 2024, as well as those for July and August 2023, were very close to 1.5\u00b0C (between 1.50\u00b0C and 1.54\u00b0C). For this reason, and given the small differences among global temperature datasets, the 14 months in a 15-month period highlighted here may differ in datasets other than ERA5. Furthermore, there is inherent uncertainty in estimating monthly temperature changes above the pre-industrial levels.\n\n          The last 12 months - October 2023 to September 2024\n  \n\nAveraging over 12-month periods smooths out shorter-term variations in regional- and global-average temperatures.\nGlobally, the average for the latest 12-month period (October 2023 to September 2024) was:\nFor reference, the warmest calendar year (January to December) on record to date, 2023, had a temperature of 0.60\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average.\nRead more\u00a0about how the temperature change above the pre-industrial level is estimated and the differences between global temperature datasets.\n\n          Year to date - January to September 2024\n  \n\nGlobal-average surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1991\u20132020 averaged over the first nine months of the year (January to September, or \u2018year-to-date') from 1979 to 2024. Use the grey and yellow toggles to change the temporal sampling. Data source: ERA5. Credit: Copernicus Climate Change Service/ECMWF. \nThe year-to-date global-average temperature anomaly (for January\u2013September) is 0.71\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average; this is 0.19\u00b0C warmer than for the same period in 2023, the current warmest calendar year. Given the large positive global temperature anomalies observed in the latter part of 2023 and the transition to La Ni\u00f1a conditions expected in the coming months, the margin between 2024 and 2023 is expected to decrease by the end of the year. Nevertheless, an average anomaly of only 0.30\u00b0C for the remaining months of this year would make 2024 warmer than 2023. In other words, the average anomaly for October\u2013December 2024 would need to drop by at least 0.41\u00b0C for 2024 not to be warmer than 2023. A drop of this magnitude in October\u2013December has never occurred in the ERA5 dataset, which starts in 1940 (the largest drop was 0.25\u00b0C in 1998). Therefore, it is almost certain that 2024 will be warmer than 2023, and thus the warmest calendar year on record.\n\n          European average\n  \n\n\nEuropean-mean surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1991-2020 for each September, all months, and running 12-month averages from 1979 to 2024.

Credit: Copernicus Climate Change Service/ECMWF.\nIn September 2024, air temperatures were above their 1991-2020 average over eastern and northeastern Europe. Heatwaves occurred across Norway and Sweden, and Finland experienced above-average temperatures; a marine heatwave has also affected the coastal waters around Finland. Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula in Northwest Russia had its record September temperature of 21\u00b0C. Italy and eastern parts of the Mediterranean had temperatures slightly above average. In contrast, a large part of western of Europe had below-average temperatures, including most of the Iberian Peninsula, France, and Iceland. Near-average temperatures occurred in the United Kingdom.\nOutside Europe, temperatures were well above average over Manitoba, Canada, and most of the rest of Canada, the central and western United States, and South America, where drought conditions and wildfires have been prevalent. Northeast Africa experienced heatwave conditions, especially in Egypt. China had above-average temperatures, with Sichuan and Chongqing notably affected by heatwaves. Japan had its second-warmest September on record (since 1898), while Australia had its fourth-warmest September on record (since 1910). Eastern Antarctica also had above-average temperatures. Conversely, below-average temperatures occurred over parts of the Sahel and southern Africa, along the eastern United States, and in parts of central Asia. West Antarctica had the most below-average temperatures.\n\n          Sea surface temperature\n  \n\n\nDaily sea surface temperature (\u00b0C) averaged over the extra-polar global ocean (60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N) for 2023 (orange) and 2024 (dark red). All other years between 1979 and 2022 are shown with grey lines. The daily average for the 1991\u20132020 reference period is shown with a dashed grey line. Data source: ERA5. Credit: Copernicus Climate Change Service/ECMWF.\nHigh surface air temperatures over ocean areas were associated with continuing near-record sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) for 60\u00b0S\u201360\u00b0N for the time of year. In mid-July, the daily SST fell below the values observed in 2023 after staying continuously at record levels for the first half of 2024; however, both 2024 and 2023 are markedly above all previous years. The average SST for September 2024 was 20.83\u00b0C, 0.48\u00b0C above average, the second highest on record for September, and only 0.09\u00b0C lower than the monthly value for September 2023.\n\nAnomalies and extremes in sea surface temperature for September 2024. Colour categories refer to the percentiles of the temperature distributions for the 1991\u20132020 reference period. The extreme (\u201cCoolest\u201d and \u201cWarmest\u201d) categories are based on rankings for the period 1979\u20132024. Values are calculated only for the ice-free oceans. Areas covered with sea ice and ice shelves in September 2024 are shown in light grey. Data source: ERA5. Credit: Copernicus Climate Change Service/ECMWF\nThe recent El Ni\u00f1o event has been an important contributor to the high global SSTs observed over the past year. Although SSTs in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific were mainly below the 1991-2020 average during September, reflecting the move from El Ni\u00f1o to La Ni\u00f1a conditions, SSTs remained the highest on record in the western part of the tropical Pacific, as shown in the above map of anomalies and extremes. Moreover, high SSTs in oceanic regions outside of the equatorial Pacific are a key contributor to the near-record global-average SST in September. The map shows that SSTs also reached record high values for September in many parts of the Atlantic Ocean (subtropical and extratropical North Atlantic, subtropical South Atlantic, and the Caribbean Sea), in many parts of the Indian Ocean, in the Southern Ocean sector south of Africa, and in various parts of the extratropical Pacific Ocean. The Mediterranean Sea, Barents Sea, eastern Baltic Sea, and the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico also recorded record SSTs, with the latter region being in the path of Hurricane Helene.\nFrom July 2024\u00a0onward the 1981-2010 reference period will not be displayed any more in the Climate Bulletin pages.

The world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first coal-fired generator was opened in 1882 in East London. \nIn the week succeeding the coal closure, ~24.7% of demand was met by gas, ~4.4% by solar, ~34.7% by wind, ~15.3% by nuclear, ~7.1% by biomass and the remainder was hydro and imports. \nThe UK has been transitioning away from coal since 1990 when 80% of electricity generated came from black coal. This transition was accelerated in 2015 when the government announced plans to close all coal within the next decade, which it has now achieved. Britain is now the first of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cG7\u00e2\u0080\u009d countries to phase out coal.\nDespite the closure of its last coal plant, the national energy system operator expects Britain's winter power supplies to outstrip demand by almost 9% in its base case scenario, with the risk of blackouts reducing to the lowest level seen in four years. \nGas fired generation has also followed a downward trend since 2016, albeit marginally, encouraging the continued decline of UK emissions intensity as seen in the figure to the right.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nWhat this month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developments mean for Australian business\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nEnergy market \nThe energy market saw significantly subdued pricing across all NEM regions through September, with most states experiencing oversupply during daylight hours. This was influenced by several factors, including an increase in rooftop solar generation, minimal coal outages and seasonality-led low demand. \nThis creates a challenging environment for, for renewable energy assets where below average market prices drive DWAPs close to and even below $0/MWh as well as BESS assets as price spikes have been relatively subdued.\nOn the sell-side of the market, these shifting conditions emphasise potential risks for spot-market exposed entities. Asset owners are likely to rely on alternate revenue streams such as PPAs, financial swaps, firm blocks, virtual and physical tolls amongst other offtake mechanisms. Lower merchant revenues for renewable energy projects may see a sell-off of LGCs as asset owners look to manage cashflow. These contract mechanisms and in-depth market insights are outlined in CORE Markets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offtake market report. \nSimilarly, potential buyers should look to establish appropriate hedging and contracting strategies, to minimise some of the seasonal risk. \u00c2\u00a0Compared to the significant volatility observed in winter, spring can present opportunities for buyers, highlighting the need to lock in sound hedging strategies with appropriate timing. \nThis month also saw considerable variation in asset performance between states, highlighting regional differences and the importance of informed investment decisions.\nThe CORE Markets team works with renewable energy project developers and corporate energy buyers to help both sides of the market manage risk. \u00c2\u00a0Get in touch to discuss your strategy.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nCarbon market \nFor the second month in a row the ACCU market saw a significant increase in traded volumes reaching a new high for 2024, at 2.5 million certificates. Alongside this traded volume increase spot prices for Generic ACCUs also rose to a new 2024 high of $37.40, Uni\nImportantly, the market continued to show signs of increasing maturity with notable volumes of Put Options trading.\nThe increase in interest in the ACCU market is also seen through primary market engagement where buyers engage with project developers as part of their strategic carbon procurement. This may be through carbon offtake agreements, co-investment or partnership opportunities with values-aligned projects.\nTo explore your carbon procurement strategy and market engagement mix, get in touch with our advisory team.

City authorities have also warned of a risk of water shortages and the power grid tripping. \nDelhi\u2019s city record of 49.2\u00baC from 2002 had been broken the day before, with temperatures reaching 49.9\u00baC on May 27, 2024.\nClimate change, predominantly caused by burning fossil fuels and exacerbated by human interference, is making heatwaves hotter and more likely to happen everywhere in the world, according to scientists who study how extreme events are changing. Cities are more vulnerable to the compounding effects of urbanisation and climate change.\nAccording to the IPCC, heatwaves that occurred once every 10 years without human-caused warming are now likely to occur 2.8 times more often (or once every 3.6 years) and are 1.5\u00baC warmer because of climate change caused by burning fossil fuels. \n\n \n\n\n\nSince last week, the entire Northwest India, especially parts of Rajasthan and the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR), have been under the grip of severe heat waves.

If emissions are not cut much faster than planned, they will become 2-3 times more common again.\nExtreme heatwaves that occurred once every 50 years without human-caused warming are now likely to occur 4.8 times more often (or once every 10.4 years) and are 1.5\u00baC warmer. If emissions are not cut much faster than planned, they will become 2-3 times more common again.\nDr. Krishna AchutaRao, Professor and Dean, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, says, \"The widespread, long-lasting, and intense heatwave conditions over India and many other parts of the world are the direct result of climate change caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases. There is an urgent need to take adaptation steps to control the rising global average temperatures; else, the result is in front of us.\"\nExtreme heat forced schools to close early for the summer in India. Temperatures in at least 37 cities exceeded 45\u00baC, with warnings of a \u201cvery high likelihood\u201d of heat illnesses for the entire population. Nighttime temperatures remained as high as 36\u00baC in some locations, which is particularly dangerous as it means people cannot cool off at night. There have been over 16,000 heat stroke cases and 60 heat-related deaths since March 2024, although this number is likely a huge underestimate. The dangerous impact\nThe dangerous impact\nHeat in India and South Asia is characterised by being extremely humid, which makes it more dangerous for human health. High humidity levels prevent the body from cooling itself through sweating, raising the risk of heat strokes and other life-threatening conditions. The combination of intense heat and humidity poses life-threatening risks to the population, exposing them to conditions that exceed human tolerance. This risk is further increased in cities, as they are often warmer than rural areas.\nAarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends, says, \"Heatwaves are clearly the single largest threat to India's well-being today. Record-breaking heat of over 48\u00baC across north, west, and central India shows that the climate crisis is a nice-to-push rhetoric as long as one hasn't experienced a 50\u00baC heatwave. Temperatures in Delhi and neighboring National Capital Region (NCR) states since the last two days are proof that the issue is now about survivability, and it\u2019s no longer a problem 'elsewhere'. As more and more Indian cities develop faster, climate resilience needs to be incorporated immediately to reduce the compounding impacts of extreme heat on human health, the economy, and livelihoods.\"\nA dedicated study is no longer necessary to understand whether climate change made a particular heatwave hotter, as this is now the case for all heatwaves. Extreme event attribution studies have evaluated how much hotter and more likely climate change made past heatwaves in India in 2022, 2023, and 2024; all concluded that burning fossil fuels made these events dramatically more likely to happen. Human-induced climate change is also increasing the temperatures that are reached during each heat episode, putting millions of lives at risk.\n\n \n\n\n\nHeat in India and South Asia is characterised by being extremely humid.

Between 1970 and 2018, India's urban population has increased fourfold to 460 million. That's more than one-third of Indians living in extreme vulnerability to climate threats, impacting both productivity and health,\" says Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends.\nDr. Friederike Otto, Imperial College London and Director of World Weather Attribution, says, \"This devastating heat is not a natural disaster. The suffering India is facing this week is worse because of climate change caused by burning coal, oil, and gas, and deforestation. What we are seeing in India is exactly what scientists said would happen if we didn\u2019t stop heating the planet. To avoid making the problem worse, the world needs to end fossil fuel use. Unless we do it, terrible heat like this will happen more and more often, and it will get even hotter. The heat will become worse, and the death toll will continue to rise fast.\u201d\nMahesh Palawat, Vice President of Meteorology and Climate Change at Skymet Weather, says, \u201cSince last week, the entire Northwest India, especially parts of Rajasthan and the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR), have been under the grip of severe heat waves. Maximum temperatures have been constantly above the 45\u00baC mark, which has made the current heatwave a prolonged one.\n\u201cWe saw a similar spike in temperatures in 2016 on account of El Ni\u00f1o, which is a natural and temporary driver of global warming. However, climate change has made things worse for India. El Ni\u00f1o will continue to form in the Pacific Ocean, but we need to limit average global temperatures at any cost; otherwise, similar situations will arise again and again.\n\u201cClimate change has been making heat waves more intense and frequent. 2024 is again a reminder of this.\u201d \nDr. Akshay Deoras, Research Scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Reading, UK, says, \u201cThis year\u2019s summer season in India is very unique. While frequent thunderstorms and cloud cover prevented the onset of high temperatures and heat waves over most of the country between March and mid-May, a stable weather pattern has been instigating heat waves for the last couple of days. With a persistent maximum temperature above 45\u00baC, a crunched summer season is turning out to be deadly across northwestern India, and El Ni\u00f1o is playing an important role in boosting temperatures this year.\n\u201cWe already have clear evidence of global warming increasing the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves across the globe, and El Ni\u00f1o is adding more to this effect.\u201d\nProf. Vidhya Venugopal, Country Director at Sri Ram Institute of Higher Education & Research, Chennai, says, \u201cThe unequal impacts of heat waves, especially with temperatures beyond 50\u00baC in dry environments like Delhi, will affect the most vulnerable, such as the elderly, young children, workers exerting outdoors, people with comorbidities, and the poor with minimal cooling interventions.\n\u201cWhen an individual is dehydrated, extreme heat exposure will thicken their blood and cause organs to shut down, resulting in death within hours, popularly called 'heat stroke'.\n\n \n\n\n\nExtreme heatwaves that occurred once every 50 years without human-caused warming are now likely to occur 4.8 times more often. (Photo: Getty)\n\n\u201cWe urgently need customized interventions for various stakeholders, preparedness to handle health emergencies, and action to protect exposed populations. With or without evidence, action is urgent.\u201d\nAditya Valiathan Pillai, Fellow, Sustainable Futures Collaborative, says, \u201cDelhi\u2019s sustained high temperatures nearing the 50s bring the focus back on its Heat Action Plan. In this infernal heat, millions of heat-exposed workers without access to cooling will struggle to earn their wages, protect their families, and stay safe. Heatwave preparedness and response measures in Delhi\u2019s newly minted Heat Action Plan must be implemented immediately.\n\u201cOf equal importance are long-term solutions like trees, changing how buildings are structured, and reducing the density of built areas to combat the urban heat island effect. Today\u2019s heat is yet another reminder of the terrible toll climate change will exact on India\u2019s most vulnerable.\u201d\nDr. Arun Sharma, Professor of Community Medicine, suggests, \u201cExposure to high atmospheric temperatures is harmful to the human body. Prolonged exposure to such high temperatures can cause heat stroke. It is recognized by fever above 104\u00b0F, dry skin, and loss of consciousness. High temperatures may also cause sunburn, irritation in the eyes, and dehydration. To protect yourself, avoid exposure to direct sunlight, use an umbrella and sunglasses. Keep the body hydrated with frequent, small intakes of water, fruit juice, coconut water, lemon drinks, etc. Avoid going out in extreme heat conditions. Sunscreen lotions also help in protecting against adverse effects on the skin. If eyes start itching, wash them frequently with clean, cold water. Avoid sudden changes in temperature, like walking out of air-conditioned rooms straight into sunlight and vice versa.\u201dPublished By: Sibu Kumar TripathiPublished On: May 30, 2024Must Watch \n\nAlso Watch\nArshdeep Dalla seeks bail in Canadian court\nAmit Shah attacks JMM over infiltration issue in Jharkhand\nUPPSC bows to students' demands, now PCS exam to be held in single shift\nHow Greater Noida man grew cannabis in his flat to sell on the dark web\nKanhaiya Kumar's inappropriate remark about Fadnavis's wife sparks debate\nRead This\nKhawaja reveals plans to handle Bumrah: \u2018Will not think about getting out\u2019\nHow Arsh Dalla, a Punjab gangster, turned into Khalistani terrorist in Canada\nSpecial probe team set up to investigate Kolkata tablet money scam case\nSunburn Goa 2024: Venue, date, artist lineup and all the details\nHow design thinking is solving climate, healthcare, and social challenges\nPUBLICATIONS\nTELEVISION\nEVENTS\nRADIO\nGAMING\nUSEFUL LINKS\nPRINTING\nWELFARE\nDISTRIBUTION\nSYNDICATIONS\nWEBSITES\nEDUCATION\n",
      "A Narrative on Urban Heat Island (UHI) in India\na need for a system thinking approach to integrate technologies and policies for climate and humankind\nIntroduction\nThe global temperatures are on the rise. Current data[1] show that global temperatures have been increasing by 0.360 C per decade since industrialization, and the warmest year on record is just a year ago[2]- 2023, with average temperatures 1.350 C above the pre-industrial average. It\u2019s now a known fact that climate change is happening and its effects are being felt across the globe. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and melting ice caps all point towards climate change. Humanity is responsible for exacerbating climate change and is the most impacted due to climate change. Scientists predict rising sea levels could displace 250-400 million[3] people in the next 80 years. Currently, the world\u2019s urban areas are coastal, hosting around 37% of the world\u2019s population at a population density twice the global average[4]. The predicted increase in urban population[5] to 68% by 2050 from the current 55% could only mean worse. Urbanization is shown to be one of the leading causes that alter urban climate and add to global GHG emissions. Studies[6] show that 70% of global CO2 emissions occur due to human anthropogenic activities within urban regions. Therefore, urban areas of the world are both at the creating and receiving end of this global climate change phenomenon, and one of the most dominant impacts of urbanization on climate is the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon.\nUrban Heat Islands (UHI)\nFactors contributing to UHI formation\nSeveral natural and human-modified changes impact the urban climate across temporal and spatial scales. From small-scale turbulences at the micro-scale to macro-scale jet streams and hurricanes, the climatic system is altered by the natural and human-modified characteristics of the earth's surface. While natural impacts of the earth's surface on climate may or may not be interfered with, it is crucial to understand and limit the negative impact of the human-modified environment on climate. Urban areas are the best examples of human-modified environments. Human-made modifications of urban areas, such as their function, texture, and form. All of which could influence the urban climate and lead to the formation of Urban Heat Islands.\nThe Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, characterized by higher temperatures in urban areas compared to their rural surroundings, is one of the most frequently observed urban climate modifications. The earliest UHI studies date back to the 1800s when Luke Howard noted that air temperatures in urban regions of London were higher than those in rural areas. Since then, UHI research has quantified the extent of the effect by measuring the temperature difference between urban and rural areas.\nUHI types\nBased on the location of the temperature measurement addressing different spatial scales, there are three different types of UHI: Surface UHI (SUHI), Canopy UHI (CUHI), and Boundary Layer UHI.\nWhile SUHI and CUHI are most relevant when referring to UHI's impact on human well-being and building energy consumption, boundary layer UHI reflects macro-scale weather changes happening across urban areas[8][9].\nSome characteristics of urban areas that could lead to UHI formation are:\nAll these heat exchanges occurring within the urban environment differ in magnitude compared to rural areas, where there is less development and more greenery, leading to lower temperatures than those found in urban areas.\nFigure 4: Differences in energy exchanges between urban and rural areas attributed to the UHI formation\nImpacts of UHI\nIrrespective of the type of UHI, this phenomenon is shown to impact urban climate, human well-being, energy consumption, and water availability. UHI increases cooling energy consumption by approximately 19% and it intensifies the heat stress, especially during the nighttime. The average nighttime SUHI intensity across 42 highly populated cities in India was 1.20C[10] which could impact human comfort and well-being. Studies show that even a small (less than 10C) rise in temperatures could power extreme weather events[11]. In addition, exposed surfaces in urban areas can be 30\u02daC to 40\u02daC hotter than the ambient air temperature during peak summers. As a result, the UHI phenomenon has numerous adverse effects. At a micro-scale, it increases building energy consumption and reduces occupant comfort. At the city level, it leads to elevated air temperatures, air pollution, and smog. Research also suggests that UHI can alter weather patterns and water quality, thereby impacting the environment, human health, and economic prosperity. Among its impacts on people, peak summer events can be fatal for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, urban workers, and the impoverished. Therefore, understanding UHI in the urban context of India is crucial. It not only helps in improving overall urban well-being and reducing energy consumption but could also improve the liveability and comfort of the homeless and economically disadvantaged populations in the country.\nUHI in India\nUrban Heat and UHI\nLike global averages, temperatures in India are rising. As shown in Figure 5, the increase in temperatures over the last 20 years is evident, using Hyderabad as an example. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) dry bulb temperature data indicate that from 2000 to 2019, temperatures in Hyderabad have risen by at least 1.0\u00b0C during the post-monsoon season and up to 1.8\u00b0C in the summer. This upward trend continues, as evidenced by the numerous heat waves in 2024, with temperatures reaching between 44\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C across the country. According to a recent study[12], India could experience a temperature rise of 1.1-5.1\u00b0C by 2100.\nAdditionally, land surface temperatures across 42 cities in India indicate that, although urban areas appear cooler than rural areas during daytime in the summer, this is not true for the rest of the seasons, particularly at night. During night time, the average UHI magnitude can reach up to 1.3\u00b0C, as seen in Figure 6. In another recent study[13], the authors showed that the average UHI magnitude in Bangalore and Hyderabad is 1.90C and 2.440C over the past two decades. All the existing research and data across cities in India show that UHI magnitude is increasing and is higher in the night time compared to the daytime. The already high temperatures and the high anthropogenic heat in the form of vehicles, humans, and building cooling, all add to a dense urban built environment that cannot cool off overnight, leading to an increased night time UHI magnitude.\nGrowing cities, hotspots, and heatsinks across Indian cities\nAs of 2023, while only 3.06% of land use in India is built-up areas, more than 40% of the Indian population lives in cities, and this is increasing[14]. By 2050, it is projected that around 60% of Indians are to live in urban areas. Today, urban areas of India contribute up to 44% of its GHG emissions[15]. The average increase in impervious surface area across 42 megacities in India is 68%, over 15 years from 2003 \u2013 2018. Shown in Figure 7 is an example of Hyderabad, India which had a 58% increase in artificial (humanmade) impervious surfaces over 15 years.[10]\nWith cities expanding, the anthropogenic heat emissions of cities are also increasing. Expanding cities are also responsible for decreasing urban vegetation that could lead to UHI formation. In India, the quality and quantity of urban vegetation seem to impact the UHI formation.[16] A decrease in vegetation reduces the latent heat transfer impacting the micro-climate and reducing human comfort. The land surface temperature maps of different cities in India show that some of the hotspots within cities are densely built-up areas. Airport runways, dark roof industrial buildings, and other densely built-up areas are all prominent hotspots across all climate zones of India. On the other hand, urban parks and urban trees are the heatsinks. Further, in India, the vacant barren land parcels within urban regions could add to UHI formation. Densely built-up areas are on average 0.50C cooler compared to built-up areas with neighboring non-green vacant lands, and 1.30C warmer compared to built-up areas with neighboring vegetative land use.[10]\nWhile urban land use and planning play a crucial role in the formation of UHI, the urban geometry and the urban building material properties are also important. Narrow urban canopies blocking the escape of the anthropogenic heat back into the cooler skies, increased population, and vehicular traffic on streets, also contribute to UHI formation.\nUrban Heat and Equity\nIndia is home to the largest urban homeless population globally. While specific estimates vary across studies, the consensus remains clear: India faces a significant challenge with homelessness, urban street dwellers, and slum populations. This reality underscores the acute vulnerability of these communities to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. A recent survey conducted in Delhi, India, revealed that the urban poor typically spend approximately 9.6 hours working outdoors, with 47% of respondents reporting suffering from heat-related losses and damages. Shockingly, none of those surveyed claimed to have adequate shelter capable of shielding them from extreme heat and weather conditions.\nIndependent research supports these findings, showing that most deaths occur during the summer months rather than in winter or the monsoon season. These statistics highlight the urgent need to address heat-related disparities and promote equity. In response, there is a pressing demand for inclusive strategies and policies designed for vulnerable populations to mitigate the adverse health effects of heat in urban communities.\nOne notable initiative is the establishment of cooling centers. Ahmedabad stands as a pioneering example, being the first city in India to implement a Heat Action Plan (HAP). Subsequently, several other cities have adopted similar plans. Under the Ahmedabad HAP, various public buildings such as temples, government structures, and shopping malls have been designated as cooling centers, offering temporary shelter to underprivileged urban residents during hot nights.\nSimilarly, HAPs implemented across different states emphasize the importance of cooling centers, heat health advisories, and enhancing public awareness. The UHI phenomenon exacerbates already elevated temperatures in Indian cities, significantly impacting urban populations, particularly those spending substantial time outdoors, thereby affecting overall health and well-being.\nIn conclusion, addressing the challenges posed by urban heat and its disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations is essential for ensuring the health and well-being of urban communities across India. Establishing cooling centers and implementing Heat Action Plans are crucial steps toward mitigating these risks. However, sustained efforts are necessary to expand and strengthen these initiatives.\nUHI Mitigation Measures and Relevant Policies\nThe mitigation of Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects primarily revolves around two key categories: vegetation and urban built-up surface treatments.\nThe evapotranspiration process occurring during urban trees and vegetation is crucial in cooling the temperatures. In this process, the plants absorb water through the roots that eventually get evaporated through the leaves, adding moisture into the atmosphere and reducing the temperatures. In a city like Bangalore, the air temperatures in streets with trees can be up to 5.60C lower compared to the streets not shaded by trees[17]. Further, green roofs and green walls are proven to improve the comfort and well-being of the urban population by reducing temperatures. Vegetation not only reduces temperatures but is also shown to improve air quality. Urban agriculture is another solution to urban cooling and a solution that could implemented without depending on regional policies. With the increase in high rises, individual home gardens are shrinking. Scientists and policymakers should work towards bringing in the technologies and incentives that encourage citizens to grow plants at both individual capacity and community scale. Examples of such initiatives are the Community in Bloom initiative and the Skyrise Greenery incentive scheme of Singapore. The \u2018Community in Bloom\u2019 is a national gardening movement that promotes community gardening and active citizen participation in greening efforts. It encourages residents to cultivate gardens, plant trees, and beautify public spaces, fostering a sense of ownership and stewardship towards the environment. The \u2018Skyrise Greenery Incentive Scheme\u2019 encourages building owners to incorporate green roofs and vertical greenery systems into their properties. It provides funding support and incentives to promote the adoption of greenery on building surfaces, contributing to urban biodiversity and thermal comfort.\nIn terms of urban vegetation, Singapore stands out as a best-case scenario. Further, since India and Singapore are both tropical countries, learning from each other\u2019s knowledge and experiences could be beneficial. Added to the need for urban vegetation incentives, schemes, policies, and awareness activities, creating an inventory and maps of existing trees within urban regions could serve as a baseline for identifying the areas with the lowest vegetation and exploring how vegetation could be improved. Identifying local tree species with wide canopies to provide shade, and require minimal irrigation would be key for countries like India. Urban greening policies in India should also consider the existing water scarcity and air pollution impacts on maintaining urban greenery. To overcome such challenges, UHI mitigation measures need to be diverse and cannot be just focused on urban greening activities.\nAccording to the Cool Roof Rating Council, a cool roof reflects and emits the sun's heat back into the sky rather than transferring it into the building. The coolness of the roof is determined by two properties: solar reflectance and thermal emittance. Both properties are measured on a scale from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating cooler roofs. For conventional grey roofs, the solar reflectance value is typically around 0.3, whereas for a cool roof, it's about 0.7. Previous research indicates that conventional grey roofs can be 31-47\u00b0C hotter than the surrounding air temperature, while cool roofs tend to remain between 6-11\u00b0C warmer than the air temperature. In unconditioned spaces, cool roofs have been shown to enhance comfort, while in conditioned spaces, they reduce cooling energy consumption by 5%, thereby decreasing heat absorption into the immediate micro-climate and lessening the need for energy production, which in turn affects the macro-climate.\nThe advantages of cool roofs extend beyond merely reducing cooling energy consumption or enhancing thermal comfort. They have global implications for decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollution, thus helping to mitigate Urban Heat Island (UHI) formation in various ways. While cool roof technology is well-established with numerous options available in the market, costs remain higher compared to conventional roofs. However, the payback period for cool roofs is typically within five years at most. Although the use of cool roofs is more common in green buildings, a pioneering statewide policy on cool roofs was only introduced in 2023 in Telangana, a state where 47% of the population resides in urban areas. While such policies should be more widespread, it is crucial to ensure their adaptation and effective implementation. Working toward the appropriate implementation of such policies is essential for mitigating the UHI phenomenon.\nAdding to the cool roof programs will be the cool pavement initiatives that promote the use of high solar reflectance material and/or green pavements across the sidewalk and impervious areas of the city. An example of such board policies including multiple surfaces from the city is the \u2018Cooling Singapore\u2019 initiative. Improving the permeability of surfaces and reducing the non-impervious surfaces in urban areas could make a difference in reducing overall temperatures in urban regions, and hence mitigating the UHI effect. Cool coatings on conventional asphalt, permeable asphalt, permeable concrete, grass pavers, brick pavers, etc. are all examples of cool pavements. Just like all the other mitigation measures, the magnitude of the impact of such technologies and measures could be location-specific, they are overall shown to mitigate the UHI effect by reducing air temperatures and improving air quality. Cool pavements are also great for reducing storm water run-off and therefore in addressing issues such as water quality and availability. Chicago\u2019s Green Alley program is one such initiative that promotes cool pavements.\nA green roof is a vegetative layer on the rooftop, that could either be intensive or extensive in style. Intensive green roofs have deep soil layers that could go beyond 15\u201d deep while extensive ones are around 6\u201d deep. Based on the building type, location, and use of the roof, either intensive, extensive, or semi-extensive roofs are to be chosen. Irrespective of the type all green roofs are shown to reduce surrounding air temperatures, improve comfort, and reduce the cooling energy consumption within the building on which the green roof has been installed. Added to these benefits is the reduction in stormwater runoff and an improvement in the overall quality of life of the occupants of the building. Currently, in India, there aren\u2019t any specific policies focusing towards green roofs. The \u2018Greening Enhancement\u2019 initiative of Singapore encourages the planting of trees, the creation of parks and gardens, and the implementation of green roofs and walls on buildings and stands as an example of the policy measures that could increase the adoption of green roofs across cities and communities. While cool roofs and green roofs at the building level or community level are both encouraged and credited through rating systems such as the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC), till date, there aren\u2019t any state-wide or national-level green roof policies in place for India.\nOther UHI mitigation measures\nIn addition to these conventional UHI mitigation measures, there are a few other built-environment measures that could help in mitigating UHI. These include:\nBy incorporating these additional measures alongside traditional vegetation and surface treatments, cities can adopt a multifaceted approach to UHI mitigation, promoting resilience and sustainability in urban environments.\nCurrent Challenges and Future Opportunities\nNeed for a holistic and integrated approach in designing buildings and urban spaces \nWhile the aforementioned UHI mitigation measures have been demonstrated to directly reduce temperatures and thus mitigate UHI formation, the overall enhancement of urban areas and building design and planning also plays a crucial role in UHI mitigation. On the latter front, one significant impact of UHI on buildings is the increase in cooling energy consumption \u2013 a topic that has been extensively studied by building scientists. However, this represents just one facet of the equation. It is equally essential to understand how buildings and the built environment as a whole contribute to UHI. Research in this domain is still nascent, primarily due to the limitations in analysis tools and methodologies. Traditionally, while building and urban designers focused on enhancing the indoor performance and functionality of spaces, urban climatologists and meteorologists delved into atmospheric phenomenon like UHI, with minimal interaction between these two groups.\nMoreover, UHI studies have typically been conducted on larger spatial scales such as local, meso, and macro scales, rather than the micro-scale where the impact on and by the buildings could be most significant. Nevertheless, this paradigm is evolving. Now, two centuries after Howard\u2019s pioneering research on UHI London, with more than half of the world\u2019s population residing in urban areas, and the then warmest years on record occurring with the past decade (2014-2023), understanding UHI dynamics and mitigating its effects has become imperative even for building scientist.\nGaining insights into the factors within the built environment and their magnitude of impact on UHI, particularly at varying spatial scales, could mark a significant stride toward leveraging buildings as tools for UHI mitigation. Similar to the evaluation of buildings' indoor and energy performance, assessing their outdoor thermal performance is essential to create 'micro-climate neutral' or 'zero UHI impact' buildings and communities. Integrating urban micro-climatic models with whole-building simulations should become the new standard.\nOne approach to achieving this is adopting a systems integration approach to whole-building performance. For instance, while vegetation aids in temperature reduction, urban greenery remains sparse in India. Given the potential water stress associated with maintaining urban greenery in India, enhancing and preserving greenery at the individual building or urban community level through systems integration might be more feasible. Implementing measures like reusing greywater and collecting rainwater for irrigation are examples of utilizing site water resources efficiently.\nTherefore, systems thinking approach is needed to establish a built environment as a potential UHI mitigation measure, and this needs a wealth of knowledge from several disciplines.\nAwareness and Outreach Activities\nEnhancing research to identify localized mitigation measures is crucial, but alongside, raising awareness is paramount for improving urban environments. It is vital to establish public awareness and community outreach programs and involve citizen scientists in mitigating UHI. Such involvement of communities can significantly influence the success of policy development and implementation. Some of the suggested awareness and outreach activities in the field of UHI could be:\nAddressing Urban Heat for Urban Poor \u2013 An India-specific problem and possible solutions\nAs urban India embraces air-conditioned buildings, the adverse impact of such structures on outdoor temperatures exacerbates, disproportionately affecting vulnerable urban dwellers. Construction workers, the urban poor, pedestrians, and users of non-air-conditioned public transportation systems collectively constitute a significant portion of the urban population in India, and they bear the brunt of rising temperatures. To tackle these challenges, UHI mitigation strategies must be multifaceted:\nBy implementing these multifaceted strategies, such as increasing vegetation, reducing impervious surfaces, and promoting sustainable building and urban design practices, India can effectively mitigate the impacts of Urban Heat Islands. An integrated approach not only helps in cooling urban areas but could contribute to a resilient and inclusive urban environment focused towards the well-being of all its residents, particularly the vulnerable populations. Systems integration and a bottom-up approach could therefore be key for cities in India to mitigate UHI and foster a healthier environment amidst the urban growth and climate challenges.\nGreen Building Market in India\nThe Green Buildings Market in India is registering positive growth with every passing quarter. We have conducted an in-depth\u00a0market progress study\u00a0on the growth potential of green buildings in India. Compared to the past quarter (October 2023 to December 2023), the quarter (January 2024 to March 2024) has registered a growth in green building registrations with each agency clearly indicating a bolstering economic recovery and a positive development of green footprint across the country. \nFor integrative analysis, the data for green building ratings project received from GBCI LEED and GRIHA, has been separately represented in the following sections.\nGBCI LEED\nThe green building projects have demonstrated exceptional commitment to sustainability over the past quarter, as evidenced by their GBCI LEED certification ratings. The distribution of these certifications includes 63% Gold, 36% Platinum, and 1% Silver (Source: Public LEED Directory). This highlights the dedication to achieving high standards in energy efficiency and environmental performance, with the majority of projects earning Gold and a significant portion reaching Platinum status. \nGRIHA\nGRIHA certification ratings have demonstrated its projects with the distribution of ratings as: 5 stars (7%), 4 stars (60%), 3 stars (27%), and 2 stars  (6%) in Quarter 4: 2023-2024 (Source: GRIHA). As is evident with GRIHA-rated government projects, the State and Central projects are establishing great benchmarks of sustainability for a positive impact on the green buildings industry. \nIn-house Experts Comment\nAfter the analysis of the challenges posed by Urban Heat Islands (UHI) and their implications for urban environments, UHIs are not merely an environmental issue but a critical public health and economic concern too. The proactive measures, such as the adoption of cool roofing materials, the creation of green spaces, and the implementation of urban planning policies that prioritize sustainability, are essential in mitigating UHI effects. The insights provided in this newsletter aim to equip policymakers, urban planners, and the general public with actionable knowledge to combat the adverse effects of UHIs effectively.\n[1] National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n[2] National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n[3] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n[4] Coastal zone management, UNEP - UN Environment Programme\n[5] United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs\n[6] Cities and Climate Change, UNEP - UN Environment Programme\n[7] C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group\n[8] A comparative analysis of surface and canopy layer urban heat island at the micro level using a data-driven approach, \n[9] Urban Heat Island studies: current status in India and a comparison with the international studies\n[10] Surface Urban Heat Island: A Comparative Study Between India and the United States\n[11] National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n[12] Enhanced surface temperature over India during 1980\u20132020 and future projections: causal links of the drivers and trends\n[13] Geospatial and statistical analysis of urban heat islands and thermally vulnerable zones in Bangalore and Hyderabad cities in India\n[14] Land Use Statistics \u2013 At a Glance | Official website of Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India\n[15] Assessment Framework | Climate Centre for Cities\n[16] A multicity analysis of daytime Surface Urban Heat Islands in India and the US.\n[17] Lionel Sujay Vailshery, Madhumitha Jaganmohan, Harini Nagendra.

      "Electric Vehicle Adoption Statistics in Canada\nWith the world striving towards a more sustainable future and many drivers looking to reduce their carbon footprint, electric vehicles have grown in popularity. In recent years, the registrations of electric vehicles have been on the rise in Canada and more people are considering getting one.\nThis article explores the electric vehicle adoption statistics in Canada, including the number of registered electric vehicles, Canadian consumers\u2019 attitudes towards them, and how the government is supporting the switch to more electric vehicles.\nElectric Vehicle Adoption Statistics for Canadians\nElectric Vehicle Registrations in Canada\nThe number of electric vehicles registered is increasing year by year and 2021 saw a record number of electric vehicles registered in Canada. According to Statistics Canada, the total number of road motor vehicle registrations was up 1.9% from 2020, with 26.2 million vehicles registered in 2021 and nine out of ten vehicles were light-duty vehicles, making up 24.1 million of the total.\nIn 2021, 94.9% of all light-duty vehicles registered in Canada were still powered by gasoline. The number of hybrid vehicles was 303,073, battery vehicles 152,685, and plug-in electric vehicles 95,896. While that may not sound like much, it is a lot more than just four years earlier.\nAccording to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER), there were 86,032 new electric vehicles registered in 2021. In 2019, there were only 56,165 registrations and in 2017, just 19,696 electric vehicles were registered. In addition, the registrations of electric vehicles reached a new high in the first quarter of 2022, when 26,018 electric vehicles were registered. This represented a record 7.7% of registrations within the first quarter.\nWhich Province Has the Most Electric Vehicles?\nIt is not surprising that the most populous provinces in Canada had the most new electric vehicle registrations in 2021. 43% of all new electric vehicle registrations were from Quebec, while British Columbia and Ontario represented 28% and 23% of the total registrations.\nRegistration of Electric Vehicles Almost Doubled Between 2020 and 2021\nWhile the number of new registrations for electric vehicles fell slightly in 2020 because of the impact of COVID-19, they almost doubled from 2020 to 2021. And while the data for the last two quarters of 2022 has not been published yet, the records from the first half of the year indicate that it was likely to be another record-breaking year.\nBy the half-point of the year, the registrations of electric vehicles had already exceeded the total number registered in 2020 and were not far behind the total registrations in 2019. In contrast, data from CER also shows that registrations for non-electric vehicles fell by 23% between 2017 and 2021.\nBattery-Electric Vehicles Are More Popular Than Hybrids in Canada\nDuring the same period, battery-electric vehicles have proved to be more popular among Canadians than plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. In 2017, both types of vehicles represented just 0.4% of the total registrations, but by the end of 2018, battery-electric vehicles were increasing their share of the total more than hybrid vehicles. In the last two quarters of 2022, the share of battery-electric vehicles was 5.4% compared to 1.9% of hybrid vehicles.\nThe Contribution of Electric Vehicles to Canada\u2019s Net Zero Target\nIn 2019, the transport sector accounted for approximately 25% of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. 18% of the transportation greenhouse gases come from passenger cards, which represents 4.5% of the total emissions. Since electric vehicles emit very little or nothing at all if they are charged using carbon-free options, the increased adoption of electric vehicles will represent a significant move towards net zero.\nConsumer Views on Electric Cars\nWhile the increasing number of registrations is a clear sign Canadians are making the shift from gas and diesel-powered vehicles to electric vehicles, what are the Canadian consumers\u2019 views on electric vehicles? Knowing how the consumers feel and think can help marketers and retailers to increase their sales.\nMost Canadians Say They Would Buy an Electric Vehicle Next\nAccording to a consumer poll, 71% of Canadians would rather buy an electric than a non-electric vehicle when they next purchase a car. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that they will all end up buying an electric vehicle, but it is a good indicator of how opinions have shifted favourably toward electric cars.\nIn March 2022, internet searches for electric cars were up by 89% compared to the previous year. The number of inquiries Canadians sent to electric vehicle sellers shot up by 567% during the same period.\nCanadians Are More Likely to Consider Getting an Electric Vehicle Than Before\nThe above statistic is supported by the statistic that almost half (49%) of Canadians in 2022, said they were more likely to buy an electric vehicle now than they had been the year before. In addition, 32% said their interest in plug-in hybrids had increased.\nWhile there are a range of reasons for the increased interest, which we explore a little later in the article, one key factor for more positive views on electric vehicles has been the improved technology, which has made the vehicles better suited for the Canadian climate.\nThe Vehicle\u2019s Range is a Key Factor When Purchasing an Electric Vehicle\nOne technological improvement is the better range, which has a significant impact on Canadian\u2019s buying decisions when looking for their next car. 79% of Canadians say they would only consider electric vehicles that can travel 400 kilometres or more on a single charge.\nOther Reasons Some Canadians Would Not Consider an Electric Vehicle\nThere are additional reasons besides the limited range why some Canadians are not yet considering an electric vehicle as a viable option. While 90% of Canadians said they needed to do more research before they could commit to purchasing an electric vehicle, 64% had concerns about the vehicles being reliable during Canada\u2019s harsh winters.\nSome Canadians, just over half at 51% are also concerned about the availability of fast charging stations and say they would not want to wait for over twenty minutes to recharge. Others wanted even faster service. 18% said they would not wait more than five minutes to charge their electric vehicle at a public charging station.\nSome Canadians Are More Likely to Consider an Electric Vehicle\nSome demographics are more likely to get an electric vehicle compared to the population on the whole. Over 75% of millennials, 79% of households with two cars, and 75% of households with an annual income between $50,000 and CAD 150,000 would consider buying an electric car.\nCanadians living in highly populated provinces are also more likely to consider an electric car. The highest percentages are in British Columbia and Ontario, with 77% and 74% respectively.\nWhy Are Electric Vehicles Becoming More Popular in Canada?\nThere are several reasons Canadians are more interested in buying an electric vehicle now than before, including the improved technology mentioned earlier. One key reason is that the prices of electric vehicles have fallen by 50% since 2012, making them more affordable.\nIn addition, there are financial incentives for consumers buying an electric vehicle. Others are also persuaded by the cheaper running costs of electric vehicles and the reduced environmental impact of electric compared to combustion engine vehicles.\nCanada is Aiming to Reduce Vehicle Emissions by 2030\nCanada has set itself a very ambitious goal to reduce emissions from light-duty vehicles by seven mega tonnes by 2030. In practice, this will mean replacing 1.8 million combustion engine vehicles with electric ones, representing roughly 7% of all light-duty vehicles.\nTo support this transition, the country has set new sales goals, which include 10% of electric vehicles by 2025, which would replace 3% of combustion engine vehicles. By 2030, the target is 11%, meaning 40% of all light-duty vehicles would be electric. The aim is to have 100% of light-duty vehicles replaced with electric vehicles by 2050.\nHow Could This Be Achieved?\nTo achieve the ambitious target, the Canadian government is offering financial incentives for consumers to purchase an electric vehicle. The incentive is up to $, 5,000 CAD and is valid for eligible electric vehicle models. Some provinces also offer their own incentives, besides the ones issued by the federal government.\nSome examples of additional incentives include British Columbia and Quebec. British Columbia has a program based on household income. Depending on their income, buyers can get 1,000-4,000 CAD rebates for electric vehicles. In Quebec, residents may be eligible for a rebate of up to 8,000 CAD on electric vehicles costing less than 60,000 CAD.\nWhat Are the Challenges to Canada\u2019s Electric Vehicle Target?\nOvercoming the hesitations of some Canadian consumers is not the only challenge to meeting the electric vehicle target set by the government. There are also long waiting times, up to three years for some cars, due to low stocks. In March 2021, 50% of dealerships in Canada had no electric car stocks and 31% of them had waiting lists of longer than six months.\nWhile batteries in electric cars last 8-15 years, some are concerned about what happens with the batteries when they run out. In response, there will be programs to recycle electric vehicle batteries. Another key issue that needs to be addressed is the supply of electricity as more people switch to electric vehicles.\nThis will put the electric grid under pressure. Some Canadians, living in older homes, would need to upgrade their electrical systems, which can cost several thousand dollars. And when several households on the same grid would do this, it would blow the local transformer. More pressure on the grid will also come from the increased number of public charging stations.\nConclusion\nThe popularity of electric vehicles in Canada is increasing year by year and 2022 looked to be another record year for new electric vehicle registrations based on the data from the first half of the year.\nThe Canadian government has set an ambitious target for switching to electric vehicles and has set up incentives to reach it. However, the change is not without challenges, most notably the extra demand for electricity and the long waiting times for electric vehicles.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAnyone can apply for government incentives for electric vehicles as long as the vehicle is eligible. Depending on where you live, you might also be eligible for additional financial incentives.\nWhile most vehicles are still powered by diesel or gasoline, the number of electric vehicles is growing. Compared to 2017, when there were 19,696 new electric vehicle registrations, in 2021, there were 86,032 registrations. In addition, the portion of electric vehicle registrations was 7.7% in the first quarter of 2022, which was the highest percentage up to that point.\nIn 2021, the country with the most electric vehicles was Norway, with an uptake of 87%. This has been extremely quick adoption since in 2015 the adoption rate of electric vehicles was only 22%.\nThe rapid change was made possible by the Norwegian government stopping registration fees and taxes on electric vehicles. Other incentives include reduced road tolls, cheaper public parking, and access to bus lanes.\nSources\nStatistics Canada\nElectric Autonomy\nIEA\nPWC\nCanada Energy Regulator\nImpact Net Zero\nMy Choice\nCanadian Vehicle Manufacturers\u2019 Association\nIEA \u2013 EV Initiative\nTransport Canada\nAs Canadians, we grew tired of the tariff battles with the US and unfair practices of other partners.

Secondary energy production was down\u00a00.4%. \nChart\u00a01\u00a0\n\n\r\nPrimary and secondary energy production \r\n\nFor more information on energy in Canada, including production, consumption, international trade, and much more, please visit the Canadian Centre for Energy Information portal and follow #energynews on social media.\nElectricity imports continue to outweigh exports in March\nTotal Canadian electricity generation fell\u00a09.2% year over year in March to\u00a051.9\u00a0million megawatt-hours (MWh), the ninth month of year-over-year decreases in the last ten months. The decline was primarily attributable to a\u00a017.9% drop in hydroelectric generation, which totalled\u00a029.5\u00a0million MWh in March. Quebec (-23.3%), British Columbia (-22.0%) and Manitoba (-31.6%), provinces which rely heavily on hydroelectric generation, continued to be afflicted by prolonged dry conditions.\nChart\u00a02\u00a0\n\n\r\nCanadian hydroelectric generation \r\n\nImports of electricity from the United States soared\u00a0127.8% year over year to\u00a03.3\u00a0million MWh in March, while exports (-57.0%) fell to\u00a02.0\u00a0million MWh. This marked the second consecutive month when imports were higher than exports, as well as both the highest level of imports and the lowest level of exports since this series was redesigned in\u00a02016. \nCanada is generally a net electricity exporter and Quebec is usually Canada's single largest electricity exporter, but this province's exports have been reduced significantly in the last year due to a sharp drop in water inflows to hydroelectric reservoirs. In March, Quebec's exports were down\u00a083.7% year over year. Ontario (-52.2%), New Brunswick (-51.2%), Manitoba (-40.5%), and British Columbia (-20.7%) also contributed to the drop.\nChart\u00a03\u00a0\n\n\r\nCanadian imports and exports of electricity\r\n\nThe jump in imports in March was primarily attributable to British Columbia (+62.6%), which accounted for\u00a060.8% of all electricity imports. \nCrude oil exports to the United States by pipeline reach a new high\nProduction of crude oil and equivalent products rose\u00a04.3% to\u00a025.5\u00a0million cubic metres in March, the sixth consecutive month of year-over-year increases. As crude oil producers continued to ramp up output in preparation for the opening of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, exports through the existing pipelines to the United States reached a new series high in March, up\u00a09.6% to\u00a019.0\u00a0million cubic metres. This exceeded the previous high in December\u00a02023\u00a0by\u00a0310,000\u00a0cubic metres. \nChart\u00a04\u00a0\n\n\r\nCrude oil exports to the United States by pipeline\r\n\nOil sands extraction increased\u00a04.9% to\u00a016.8\u00a0million cubic metres in March\u00a02024, almost entirely driven by production of crude bitumen (up\u00a07.9% to\u00a010.5\u00a0million cubic metres). March marked the start of the\u00a02024\u00a0spring turnarounds with some oil sands upgraders beginning maintenance activities near the end of the month. As a result, production of synthetic crude slowed, edging up\u00a00.4% to\u00a06.4\u00a0million cubic metres.\nProduction and inventory levels of natural gas climb in March\nProduction of marketable natural gas edged up\u00a00.7% year over year to\u00a0684.6\u00a0million gigajoules in March. This was the second highest production level ever seen in this data series, behind the record of\u00a0695.5\u00a0million gigajoules in December\u00a02023.\nTotal deliveries of natural gas to Canadian consumers rose\u00a01.2% year over year to\u00a0499.6\u00a0million gigajoules in March\u00a02024. The increase was largely due to industrial consumption (+9.2%), which includes natural gas used for oil production and electricity generation.\nWarmer than average winter temperatures continued to reduce domestic demand for natural gas in March. This, combined with lower exports, resulted in natural gas inventories totalling\u00a0819.1\u00a0million gigajoules,\u00a053.6% above the March average for the past five years. \nChart\u00a05\u00a0\n\n\r\nCanadian natural gas production and closing inventory levels\r\n\nProduction and consumption of refined petroleum products down in March\nBoth production (-2.5%) and consumption (-7.9%) of refined petroleum products declined year over year in March, to\u00a010.1\u00a0million cubic metres for production and\u00a07.8\u00a0million cubic metres for consumption.\nChart\u00a06\u00a0\n\n\r\nProduction and consumption of finished petroleum products\r\n\nDid you know we have a mobile app?\nDownload our mobile app and get timely access to data at your fingertips!

In the period 2002\u20132015, Spain carried out an intense irrigation modernization process with the aim of achieving significant water savings and higher flexibility and to guarantee supply, among other favourable outcomes (e.g. environmental and socio-economic). Nevertheless, certain unfavourable effects of irrigation modernization also need to be discussed. This study analyses these effects in Spain based upon a DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, States, Impacts, and Responses) framework and a wide-ranging review of the existing empirical literature. Our findings are highly relevant to inform decision-makers in the planning of future irrigation modernization programmes worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDrivers of Irrigation Water Productivity and Basin Closure Process: Analysis of the Guadalquivir River Basin (Spain)\n                                        \n\n\nHalf of twenty-first century global irrigation expansion has been in water-stressed regions\n                                        \n\n\nWater supply and water allocation strategy in the arid US West: evidence from the Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer\n                                        \n\nReferences\nAbadia R, Rocamora MC, Corcoles JI, Ruiz-Canales A, Martinez-Romero A, Moreno MA (2010) Comparative analysis of energy efficiency in water users associations.

      "THIS REPORT CONTAINS ASSESSMENTS OF COMMODITY AND TRADE ISSUES MADE BY USDA STAFF AND NOT NECESSARILY STATEMENTS OF OFFICIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICY Required Report: Required - Public Distribution Date: March 15, 2024 Report Number: SP2024-0003 Report Name: Food Processing Ingredients Annual Country: Spain Post: Madrid Report Category: Food Processing Ingredients Prepared By: Arantxa Medina Approved By: Karisha Kuypers Report Highlights: In 2023, Spain imported $2.2 billion worth of agricultural, seafood and forest products from the United States, up 3 percent compared to the previous year. Even though inflation rates declined in 2023 as compared to the record highs registered in 2022, they remained higher compared to pre-pandemic levels. The high energy cost of raw materials and labor, as well as the effects of the drought, have increased the inflationary situation with repercussions for the productivity of companies and their margins, as well as for household consumption. Despite the economic and political uncertainties, Spain\u2019s food and beverage sector continues to show a constant and positive performance. With one of the most competitive food processing industries in Europe, Spain\u2019s demand for ingredients continues to increase, as well as its demand for distilled spirits, beef and beef products, seafood, pulses, and tree nuts. Spain Food Processing Ingredients 2024 2 Market Fact Sheet: Spain Spain is a major producer and exporter of food and agricultural products, with other EU countries as its primary export destination. Spanish producers, processors, wholesalers, retailers, food service operators, and importers are all part of a well-developed agribusiness sector, contributing to a competitive and dynamic domestic scenario. In 2023, Spain\u2019s total imports of agricultural and related products reached $65.4 billion, up 2.4 percent compared to 2022; 57 percent of these imports originated from the European Union. Goods imported into Spain must meet the EU sanitary and phytosanitary requirements to protect human and animal health, as well as requirements under the customs union. Hence, U.S. exporters already exporting to other EU member states will likely meet most of the Spanish import requirements. For the export of animal products, the production plant must be approved for export to the EU. Total Imports of Consumer-Oriented Products 2023 In 2023, the food-processing sector consolidated its position as an important industrial sector. Spain enjoys a modern food-processing sector that pays special attention to the quality, safety, and traceability of the food products it produces. It has one of the most competitive food processing industries in Europe, which makes this sector an important target for U.S. exports of food ingredients. Industry\u2019s interest in developing new products continues to present opportunities for food ingredients. The retail competitive landscape remained highly fragmented in 2023, led by major grocery retailers. Within grocery store-based retailing, the competitive environment is concentrated, with Mercadona retaining its leadership, followed by Carrefour. In 2024, due to new consumption habits, internet retailing is expected to continue growing, as retailers continue to invest in eCommerce platforms.

MARKET SUMMARY Under the current complex macroeconomic environment, the Spanish food and beverage industry has carried out its activity under the pressure of rising production costs and the consequent effects on business results. Even though inflation rates declined in 2023 as compared to the record highs registered in 2022, they remained higher compared to pre-pandemic levels. In 2022, in nominal terms, industry's production grew extraordinarily to above 17 percent, but once the price factor is applied this figure is reduced to 1.5 percent. This indicates the strong impact that inflation has had on business margins, in addition to the brake imposed on production, which had managed to maintain a constant line in the previous crises. However, despite the economic and political uncertainties, Spain\u2019s food and beverage sector has continued its positive performance. In 2022, the food and beverage industry continued to be the strongest industrial sector in Spain. Its gross added value, estimated at close to $30 billion, represented 19.3 percent of the manufacturing industry and close to 2.5 percent of the total Spanish economy. 2023 has once again proven to be a very demanding year for small and medium companies. The food and beverage industry maintained its business network above 30,159 companies, demonstrating during this year some increase in the number of medium and large companies. This trajectory shows an improvement in the size of the industry, although small and medium companies continue to represent the majority of the sector, representing more than 96 percent of the sector. Table 1. Advantages and Challenges Facing U.S. Food Processing Ingredients Advantages Challenges Spanish consumers are increasingly open to new products. The United States is a favorite destination for Spanish travelers outside the EU, increasing the popularity and interest in U.S. food products. Adjustments to the overall domestic and international economy situation (inflation, international conflicts, drought, logistics challenges). Spain\u2019s food industry relies on imported ingredients, many from the United States, which have a good image and reputation. Food imported from third countries, including the U.S., must comply with EU food law, labeling, traceability, and packaging laws, which vary from U.S. regulation and practice. Increased demand in retail channels is pushing food processors to be more innovative to provide new offerings. High transportation costs. In addition, small exporters face difficulties in shipping mixed/smaller container loads vs EU competitors or big exporters. Good network of agents and importers to help get products into the market. Competition from EU countries, where tastes and traditional products may be better known. New generation of consumers demand healthy, innovative, sustainable products, creating new opportunities. Lack of consumer awareness of U.S. brands, applicability, and varieties of U.S. products. Distribution structure is modern and many companies cover both Spain and Portugal. High import tariffs and import regulations impose a price disadvantage on non-EU based companies. Spain Food Processing Ingredients 2024 4 SECTION II. ROAD MAP FOR MARKET ENTRY Entry Strategy Success in introducing products in the Spanish market requires local representation and personal contact. A local representative can provide up-to-date market intelligence, guidance on business practices and trade related laws, sales contact with existing and potential buyers, and market development expertise. The Office of Agricultural Affairs in Madrid maintains listings of potential importers and develops sector-specific information to help introduce your product in Spain. Customs are involved in the implementation and enforcement of European legislation relating to external trade, not only for customs duties and commercial policy measures, but also as regards security, environmental, anti-dumping, consumer protection, cultural and agricultural controls. Goods imported into the EU must meet the sanitary and phytosanitary requirements to protect human and animal health and as part of the custom union. Though Spain implements harmonized EU rules and regulations, there are subtleties that exporters should learn about when considering exporting to Spain. For more information, we invite potential U.S. exporters to contact our office for additional sector-specific information. U.S. exporters already exporting to other member states will likely meet most of the requirements for exporting to Spain. Typically, operators buy food ingredients from importers or wholesalers. Some large companies buy directly from foreign suppliers. Other companies concentrate on the domestic or on export markets, but most will have mixed customers. Companies supplying the domestic market frequently sell their products directly and have their own logistics infrastructure. However, their customers will vary from wholesalers to buying groups and retailers. Companies producing for re-export may have their own marketing office overseas, local agents, or may work with local importers. U.S. exporters also face challenges with EU labeling and traceability regulations. Labeling is required for any product that contains genetically modified ingredients. For details, visit the EU labeling requirements section of the USEU Mission webpage. Import Procedures The local importer has primary responsibility with the Spanish Government for imported food products once they enter Spain. It is recommended that that U.S. exporters verify all import requirements with their Spanish buyer. The buyer and local freight forwarder are in the best position to research such matters and assist with local authorities. The final authorization to import any product is subject to the Spanish rules and regulations as interpreted by border officials at the time of product entry. Spain follows the Harmonized Nomenclature and Classification System (HS) and applies EU import duties according to a maximum and minimum rate schedule. If your product is or contains plant or animal products, it will require a phytosanitary or health certificate issued by the competent U.S. authority. In addition, if you are exporting animal products, your production plant must be approved to export into the EU. Spain Food Processing Ingredients 2024 5 The following documents are required for ocean or air cargo shipments of food products into Spain: \uf0b7 Bill of Lading and/or Airway Bill \uf0b7 Commercial Invoice \uf0b7 Phytosanitary Certificate and/or Health Certificate, when applicable \uf0b7 Import Certificate For all details, please check the Food and Agricultural Import Regulations and Standards Report (FAIRS) and the FAIRS Export Certificate Report for the EU and Spain, and the U.S. Mission to the European Union (USEU Mission) website for helpful information on exporting U.S. food and agricultural products into the EU. Please keep in mind that if the product you are exporting into Spain does not comply with EU harmonized regulations, Spanish customs or health authorities may not allow entry of the product. Trade Shows Trade shows in Spain continue to offer excellent opportunities for U.S. exporters to contact potential clients or business partners from Spain, Portugal, other EU countries and other continents. The most important trade shows are: Alimentaria, in Barcelona March 18-21, 2024, and the USDA-endorsed show Seafood Expo Global, in Barcelona April 23-25, 2024.

This report (in English) contains useful and up to date information on Spain\u2019s economy, reforms to increase competitiveness, employment trends, and foreign investment, among other topics to understand the Spanish business climate. Many U.S. companies are present in Spain, either through joint ventures, acquisitions, etc. Some examples of U.S. companies in the Spanish food and beverage industry are (in alphabetical order): Bunge Iberica - fats and oils; Cargill - fats, oils, additives, pet food; Coca Cola Espa\u00f1a - beverages, snacks; H.J. Heinz Foods Spain - prepared vegetables; Mondelez International - cheese, snacks; Kellogg\u2019s Espa\u00f1a - breakfast cereal; Pepsico Espa\u00f1a - beverages, juices, snacks. Major Consumer Trends: \uf0b7 Price sensitivity: 75 percent of Spanish consumers look for a bargain before making a final purchasing decision, while a quarter leave their regular retailer if they find lower prices elsewhere. Price sensitivity also results in a lack of loyalty to brands. \uf0b7 Environmental shift and pressure: increasing awareness of environmental challenges are having a powerful impact on consumer behavior and purchasing decision making. \uf0b7 Population changes: trends such as urbanization, migration, and aging are reshaping consumer lifestyles and shopping decisions. Single/two person households are growing and households of four or more persons are declining. The low birth rate and the increasing percentage of elderly people is another trend that will require adjustments in market supply. SECTION III. COMPETITION Spain\u2019s main trading partner is the EU-27. The lack of trade tariffs, trade barriers and other restrictions make European goods more attractive and competitive, particularly to price sensitive goods. Product Category (TMT; million USD) Major Supply Sources in 2023 (in value) Strengths of Key Supply Countries Advantages and Disadvantages of Local Suppliers Frozen Fish Imports: 259 Value: $695 1.Portugal-13% 2.Netherlands-8% 3.Morocco\u20136% Other major suppliers offer high quality fish products at competitive prices. Large competition from local producers. Domestic consumption and exports largely exceed local supply. Almonds Imports: 126 Value: $437 1.USA-73% 2.Portugal-11% 3.Australia - 8% Limited competition from other countries. Spanish demand is high, and production is insufficient to satisfy demand. Spain produces almonds, mostly used roasted as a snack. U.S. almonds are processed, both used domestically or exported. Pulses Imports: 792 Value: $421 1. USA - 15% 2. Canada -12% 3. Argentina- 10% Strong competition from Argentina, who greatly increased its presence in recent years, and Canada, a traditional supplier. Spain is a traditional consumer of pulses, and a net importer, as local production is insufficient to fulfill internal demand. Spain Food Processing Ingredients 2024 9 Pistachios Imports: 15 Value: $145 1.USA-72% 2. Iran -11% 3. Germany - 10% Germany is the main entry point for U.S. pistachios. Iranian pistachios are the competitor in the Spanish market and offer lower prices. Local pistachio production is growing, but still very limited. Demand continues to grow significantly. Sunflower Seeds Imports: 301 Value: $339 1.France-52% 2.China-19% 3.Romania-8% Used for confectionery. Growing competition from China on price; Argentina competitor on quality. Traditional snack.

In 2023, seven cases of locally acquired malaria have been reported. Advisories/Alerts: Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Polk, and Walton counties are currently under a mosquito-borne illness advisory. Broward, Escambia, Hardee, and Miami-Dade counties are currently under a mosquito-borne illness alert. No other counties are currently under a mosquito-borne illness advisory or alert. 2 There are currently multiple travel health notices from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention related to mosquito-borne diseases. Level 1 Travel Health Notice, Level 2 Travel Health Alert: wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices. For a map of arboviral disease activity in the United States visit: https://www.cdc.gov/fight-the-bite/at-risk/index.html. 2023 Human Case Summary Eastern Equine Encephalitis Acquired in Florida: In 2023, two cases of EEEV acquired in Florida have been reported in St. Johns (June) and Suwannee (July) counties. West Nile Virus Illnesses Acquired in Florida: In 2023, ten cases of WNV illness acquired in Florida have been reported in 2023 from Brevard (October), Escambia (July (2) and August (3), December), Okaloosa (September), Sarasota (September), and Wakulla (October) counties. Three asymptomatic positive blood donors have been reported in Bay (August), Hillsborough (August), and Walton (September) counties. 2023 International Travel-Associated Chikungunya cases: Four cases with onset in 2023 have been reported in individuals with travel history to a chikungunya-endemic area in the two weeks prior to onset. Counties reporting cases were: Broward (2), Duval, and Lee. Countries of origin were: Brazil (2) and India (2). 2023 International Travel-Associated Dengue Cases: Six hundred and nine cases with onset in 2023 have been reported in individuals with travel history to a dengue-endemic area in the two weeks prior to onset. Counties reporting cases were: Alachua (3), Bay, Brevard (2), Broward (59), Charlotte, Collier (8), Duval (6), Escambia, Hendry (2), Hernando, Highlands, Hillsborough (35), Indian River (2), Lee (16), Leon, Manatee (2), Marion, Miami-Dade (352), Monroe (5), Nassau, Okaloosa, Orange (21), Osceola (9), Palm Beach (34), Pasco (4), Pinellas (5), Polk (9), Sarasota (4), Seminole (5), St. Johns (4), St. Lucie (8), and Volusia (5). Thirty-two cases were reported in non-Florida residents. Seven cases met the criteria for severe dengue (dengue shock syndrome [DSS] or dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF]). Those at greater risk for DSS and DHF include persons with previous dengue infection, pregnant women, infants, the elderly, and those with co-morbidities.

Suspect cases are not included. Activity is mapped by county of exposure rather than county of residence. Case definitions being used in Florida are consistent with national criteria provided by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) and may be viewed at: www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/disease-reporting-and-management/disease-reporting-and-surveillance/index.html. Case tallies reported by CDC do not include suspect cases and cases are reported by patient state of residence rather than where the exposure occurred. Data is provided by county health departments, Department of Health Bureau of Public Health Laboratories, Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, mosquito control agencies, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, medical providers and veterinarians. Equine cases are provided by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services."

These estimates are calculated based on data collected through CDC\u2019s\u00a0In4uenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) and are\u00a0preliminary preliminary.\nThis web page provides weekly, preliminary estimates of the cumulative in-season numbers of 4u illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States. It is not possible to know the exact number of people who have experienced 4u illness in the United States because not everyone who gets sick with 4u will seek medical care or be tested for in4uenza. Given this, not all 4u illnesses will be identiYed through our surveillance systems. This is why we use mathematical models to estimate the impact of 4u on the population. CDC has estimated the burden of 4u since 2010 using a mathematical model that is based on data collected through the In4uenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), a network that\u00a0covers approximately 9% of the U.S. population.\nAdditionally, CDC assesses the current season\u2019s severity each week and information about this season\u2019s severity assessment can be found at United States Flu Season: Preliminary In-Season Severity Assessment.\nEach week CDC calculates a lower estimate and an upper estimate of 4u-related hospitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the season (October 1, 2023). These are updated each week and are compared to end-of-season estimates of 4u-related hospitalizations from previous 4u seasons.\nLimitations The estimates of the preliminary, cumulative burden of seasonal in4uenza are subject to several limitations: 1. The cumulative rate of lab-conYrmed 4u-related hospitalizations reported during the season may be an underestimate of the rate at the end of the season because of identiYcation and reporting delays.\n2. Rates of lab-conYrmed 4u-related hospitalizations are adjusted for the frequency of 4u testing and the sensitivity of 4u diagnostic assays. However, data on testing practices during the current 4u season are not available in real-time. To make these estimates, CDC uses data on testing practices from the past 4u seasons as a proxy. If more testing is being done compared to past 4u seasons, these estimates may be in4ated. Preliminary in-season burden estimates are Ynalized when data on contemporary testing practices become available, and the estimates may decrease if testing has increased.\n3. Estimates of medical visits for 4u-like illnesses are based on data from prior seasons, which may not be accurate if the severity of illness or patterns of health behavior have changed.\n0K 100K 200K 300K 400K 500K 600K 700K Week End Date Number of Hospitalizations October 7 October 14 October 21 October 28 November 4 November \u2026 November \u2026 November \u2026 December 2 December 9 December \u2026 December \u2026 December \u2026 January 6 January 13 January 20 January 27 February 3 February 10 February 17 February 24 March 2 March 9 March 16 March 23 March 30 April 6 April 13 April 20 April 27 0K 100K 200K 300K 400K 500K 600K 700K 2022/2023 2021/2022 2017/2018 2016/2017 2015/2016 2014/2015 2013/2014 2012/2013 2023/2024 2019/2020 Total Hospitalizations at the end of past seasons Figure.

The\u00a0in-season in-season\u00a0preliminary burden estimates are provided weekly during 4u season when suacient data are available to make an estimate, and\u00a0end-of-season end-of-season preliminary estimates are given at the end of each 4u season. End-of-season preliminary estimates will be updated year-to-year and are considered Ynal when all data are available (usually within two years of the preliminary estimate).\nHow CDC estimates the cumulative burden of seasonal Bu Preliminary estimates of the cumulative burden of seasonal 4u are based on crude rates of lab-conYrmed 4u-related hospitalizations, reported through the\u00a0In4uenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET),\u00a0which are adjusted for the frequency of 4u testing during recent prior seasons and the sensitivity of 4u diagnostic tests. Rates of hospitalization are then multiplied by the previously estimated ratio of hospitalizations to symptomatic illnesses, and the frequency of patients seeking medical care to calculate symptomatic illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths associated with seasonal 4u, respectively.\nHow preliminary, in-season estimate of Bu burden change each week The in-season estimates of 4u burden are preliminary and change week-by-week as new 4u hospitalizations are reported to CDC. New reports include both new admissions that have occurred during the reporting week and also patients admitted in previous weeks that have been newly reported to CDC.\nHow the number of Bu hospitalizations estimated so far this season compares with previous end-of-season hospitalization estimates The estimates on this page are preliminary, cumulative and will increase as the season progresses. Past end-of-season estimates of 4u-related hospitalizations (2010-2023) have ranged from 100,000-710,000.\nLast Reviewed: March 21, 2024 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)",

This project collects forecasts for weekly new hospitalizations due to confirmed influenza. Anyone interested in using these data for additional research or publications is requested to contact flusight@cdc.gov for information regarding attribution of the source forecasts.'\nNowcasts and Forecasts of Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations Admissions During the 2024-2025 Influenza Season\nInfluenza-related hospitalizations are a major contributor to the overall burden of influenza in the United States. Accurate predictions of influenza hospital admissions will help support public health planning and interventions during the 2024-2025 season as COVID-19, RSV, and other respiratory pathogens continue to circulate. CDC will coordinate a collaborative nowcasting and forecasting challenge for weekly laboratory confirmed influenza hospital admissions during the 2024-2025 influenza season, currently planned to begin November 20, 2024. Each week during the challenge (November through May 31st), participating teams will be asked to provide national and jurisdiction-specific (all 50 states, Washington DC, and Puerto Rico) probabilistic nowcasts and forecasts of the weekly number of confirmed influenza hospital admissions during the preceding week, the current week, and the following three weeks. This predicted timespan is planned to include the four weeks after the most recent hospital admissions data are officially released by CDC (details here). Prediction activities may begin or end later depending on reported influenza activity and availability of data. Teams can but are not required to submit predictions for all week horizons or for all locations. Predictions will be compared with the number of confirmed influenza admissions from the NHSN Weekly Hospital Respiratory Dataset. Previously collected influenza data from the 2020-2021, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 influenza seasons and the number of hospitals reporting these data each day are included in the NHSN Weekly Hospital Respiratory Dataset as well.\nDates: The Challenge Period will begin November 20, 2024, and will run until May 31, 2025. Participants are asked to submit weekly nowcasts and forecasts by 11PM Eastern Time each Wednesday (herein referred to as the Forecast Due Date). The Forecast Due Date has been designated based on the release of hospitalization data on Wednesdays. Weekly submissions (including file names) will be specified in terms of the reference date, which is the Saturday following the Forecast Due Date. The reference date is the last day of the epidemiological week (EW) (Sunday to Saturday) containing the Forecast Due Date.\nPrediction Targets\nParticipating teams are asked to provide national and jurisdiction-specific (all 50 states, Washington DC, and Puerto Rico) predictions for one primary target, quantile predictions for weekly laboratory confirmed influenza hospital admissions, and three other potential targets: category probability predictions for the direction and magnitude of changes in hospitalization rates per 100k population, probability predictions of peak week of laboratory confirmed influenza hospitalizations, and quantile predictions for peak incidence of laboratory confirmed influenza hospital admissions. All targets are optional. Additionally, teams may submit sample trajectories for the primary target of weekly laboratory confirmed influenza hospital admissions in addition to quantile format predictions.\nFor the primary target, teams will submit quantile nowcasts and forecasts of the weekly number of confirmed influenza hospital admissions for the epidemiological week (EW) ending on the reference date as well as the three following weeks. Hindcasts may also be submitted for the preceding week (see Note below). Please note that starting in the 2024-2025 season, FluSight will strongly recommend integer submissions for incidence forecasts. Teams can but are not required to submit forecasts for all weekly horizons or for all locations. The evaluation data for forecasts will be the weekly number of confirmed influenza admissions data from the NHSN Weekly Hospital Respiratory Dataset. We will use the specification of EWs defined by the CDC, which run Sunday through Saturday. The target end date for a prediction is the Saturday that ends an EW of interest, and can be calculated using the expression:\ntarget end date = reference date + horizon * (7 days).\nThere are standard software packages to convert from dates to epidemic weeks and vice versa (e.g. MMWRweek and lubridate for R and pymmwr and epiweeks for Python).\nSample trajectories:\nIn addition to the quantile forecasts for incident hospital admissions, this season teams may submit samples for 0- to 3- week ahead forecasts. We use the term \u201cmodel task\u201d below to refer to a prediction for a specific horizon, location, and reference date. For teams submitting samples, the FluSight hub will require exactly 100 samples for each model task. We request that samples only be submitted when they are structured into temporally connected samples across horizons (i.e., samples should not be submitted that are solely drawn from the distribution of quantile forecasts). In particular, a common sample ID (specified in the \u2018output_type_id\u2019 field) will be used in multiple rows of the submission file with values of target date.\nDetails on formatting and the submission procedure are provided in the model-output subfolder README file and include details on specification of \u2018output_type_id\u2019.\nTeams submitting sample trajectories corresponding to the primary forecast target will be requested to include information on how the trajectories were constructed in their metadata file (e.g., the primary output of forecasts which are then aggregated into quantile distributions). Teams should note that for this pilot submission target samples should retain an element of the temporal structure of 0 to 3-week ahead forecasts, rather than just submitting posthoc samples generated from their quantile forecasts.\nRate-trend categories:\nThe objective of the optional rate trend target is to characterize the trajectory of confirmed influenza hospital admissions as \"large increase\", \"increase\", \"stable\", \"decrease\" or \"large decrease\" over the 1- to 4 -week forecast period following the most recent official hospital admissions data. Predictions for these targets will be in the form of probabilities for each rate trend category, and will be submitted in the same file as a team's weekly hospital admissions forecasts using a target name of \"wk flu hosp rate change\".\nRate-trend categories are defined by binning state-level changes in weekly hospital admission incidence on a rate scale (counts per 100k people). A change is defined as the difference between the finalized reported weekly hospitalization rates in the EW ending on the target end date and the baseline EW ending one week prior to the reference date. At the time that nowcasts and forecasts are generated, this baseline week will be the most recent week for which the official data released on healthdata.gov include reported hospital admission values for at least some days (see Figures 1 and 2). Let $t$ denote the reference date and $y_s$ denote the finalized hospitalization rate in units of counts/100k population on the week ending on date $s$. The change in hospitalization rates at a weekly horizon $h$ is rate_change = $y_{t+h*7} - y_{t}$ .\nThe date ranges used in these calculations are illustrated in an example in Table 2. Corresponding count changes are based on state-level population sizes (i.e., count_change = rate_change*state_population / 100,000). See the locations.csv file in auxiliary-data/ for the population sizes that will be used to calculate rates.\nRate thresholds separating categories of change (e.g., separating \"stable\" trends from \"increase\" trends) will be the same across states, but are translatable into counts using the state's population size (see locations.csv, in the auxiliary-data subfolder of this repository). Any week pairs with a difference of fewer than 10 hospital admissions will be classified as having a \"stable\" trend.  Specific rate-difference thresholds for changes have been developed for each prediction horizon, based on past distributions observed in FluSurv-NET and HHS-Protect. These are provided below in the model-outputs directory README file.\nNote: The threshold levels for rate_change that define the categories have been modified slightly for the 2024-25 season. These updated thresholds are derived from the distribution of previously observed data and are expected to capture a slightly larger range of increases and decreases, that previously would have been considered stable.\nSeasonal Forecast Targets:\nTeams may also submit probability forecasts for peak week. Peak week will be defined as the epidemiologic week with the highest count of confirmed influenza hospital admissions during the 2024-2025 season. In the case multiple weeks observe the same highest count of confirmed influenza hospital admissions for a particular location, peak week forecasts for that location will not be scored. Based on analysis of previously observed influenza hospital admission data, we do not anticipate that this will happen frequently if at all. Separately, teams may submit quantile forecasts predicting peak incidence of influenza hospitalizations. Peak Incidence is defined as the highest count of confirmed influenza hospital admissions reach during any epidemiological week of the 2024-2025 season.\nThe objective of these seasonal targets is to provide actionable and intuitive forecasts for public health decision makers. These targets will characterize the season as a whole and predict the intensity and timing of the highest severity segment of the season to expand public health utility.\nIf you have questions about this season\u2019s FluSight Collaboration, please reach out to Rebecca Borchering, Sarabeth Mathis, and the CDC FluSight team (flusight@cdc.gov).\nAcknowledgments\nThis repository follows the guidelines and standards outlined by the hubverse, which provides a set of data formats and open source tools for modeling hubs.\nAbout\nResources\nLicense\nStars\nWatchers\nForks\n\n\n    Releases\n      1\n\n\n\n    Packages\n      0\n\n\n\n    Contributors\n      46\n\nLanguages\nFooter\nFooter navigation\n"

This is the first month that arrivals to O\u2018ahu decreased since March 2021. The decrease was partially due to Easter falling on March 31, which pushed spring break travel into March instead of April. Easter 2023 was on April 9, which affected the year-over-year performance. In reviewing a forecast provided by Jerry Gibson of the Hawai\u2018i Hotel Alliance, spring bookings are not picking up as indicated by previous estimates.\nThe cruise market performed well in April with visitors who came via out-of-state cruise ships registering the second highest monthly arrival on record. This market typically has less impact on the destination than visitors who travel by air as cruise travelers often participate in group tour activities versus exploring the islands individually and renting cars.\nWith the Hawai\u02bbi Tourism Authority\u2019s M\u0101kaukau Maui campaign and targeted efforts showcasing Maui\u2019s readiness to welcome visitors, DBEDT is committed to supporting the state and Maui\u2019s economic recovery.\n# # #\u00a0\nMedia Contacts:\u00a0\nLaci Goshi\nDepartment of Business, Economic Development and Tourism\n808-518-5480\n[email\u00a0protected]\nJennifer Chun\nDirector of Tourism Research\nDepartment of Business, Economic Development and Tourism\n808-973-9446\n[email\u00a0protected]\nPolicies\n",

Final 2023 Statistics: The 2023 visitor data presented in this news release are the final numbers and reflect updated immigration statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO), updated air seat statistics from the Diio Mi airline database (DIIO), and final reports from airlines. These statistics are published in the DBEDT 2023 Annual Visitor Research Report, which is posted on the DBEDT website: dbedt.hawaii.gov/visitor/visitor-research/ Statement by DBEDT Director James Kunane Tokioka Though our visitor industry is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and Maui wildfires, the July visitor statistics showed some reasons for encouragement. Visitor arrivals from the U.S. West market at more than half of a million in July 2024 were the highest during the past two years. The 66,557 visitors from Japan in July were the third highest since March 2020 for this market. Visitation to the island of Maui continued to improve in July 2024 with 237,495 visitor arrivals; the highest since the wildfires, which represents a recovery rate of 79.9 percent from the pre-wildfire level. It is expected that visitor arrivals from the U.S. markets will remain above the 2019 levels for the remainder of the year and arrivals from Japan will continue recovering as the Japanese exchange rate has been improving during the past few weeks. # # # Media Contacts: Laci Goshi Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism 808-518-5480 lacianne.a.goshi@hawaii.gov Jennifer Chun Director of Tourism Research Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism 808-973-9446 jennifer.e.chun@hawaii.gov JULY 2024 ARRIVALS AT A GLANCE 2024P 2023 % change 2024P YTD 2023 YTD % change TOTAL EXPENDITURES ($ MILLION) 2,068.0 2,014.8 2.6 12,332.8 12,838.3 -3.9 Total by air 2,067.8 2,012.5 2.7 12,287.6 12,798.1 -4.0 U.S. Total 1,615.9 1,563.9 3.3 9,599.0 10,067.7 -4.7 U.S. West 1,010.8 932.3 8.4 5,804.8 6,024.5 -3.6 U.S. East 605.1 631.6 -4.2 3,794.2 4,043.2 -6.2 Japan 101.3 78.3 29.4 582.7 407.3 43.1 Canada 49.8 71.5 -30.4 645.6 759.5 -15.0 All Others 300.8 298.8 0.6 1,460.3 1,563.6 -6.6 Visitor arrivals by cruise ships 0.2 2.4 -93.1 45.2 40.2 12.4 TOTAL VISITOR DAYS 8,161,726 8,464,568 -3.6 50,352,731 53,377,593 -5.7 Total by air 8,160,274 8,442,787 -3.3 49,929,730 52,957,356 -5.7 U.S. Total 6,466,986 6,712,038 -3.7 38,947,809 41,864,184 -7.0 U.S. West 4,227,601 4,289,008 -1.4 24,777,567 26,541,516 -6.6 U.S. East 2,239,385 2,423,030 -7.6 14,170,242 15,322,668 -7.5 Japan 421,058 326,386 29.0 2,438,970 1,709,643 42.7 Canada 222,018 312,494 -29.0 2,935,569 3,511,671 -16.4 All Others 1,050,212 1,091,869 -3.8 5,607,382 5,871,858 -4.5 Visitor arrivals by cruise ships 1,451 21,781 -93.3 423,000 420,237 0.7 VISITOR ARRIVALS 925,935 935,139 -1.0 5,706,863 5,902,238 -3.3 Total by air 925,263 930,204 -0.5 5,619,443 5,816,287 -3.4 U.S. Total 734,867 749,050 -1.9 4,377,897 4,673,348 -6.3 U.S. West 503,378 499,561 0.8 2,927,644 3,110,387 -5.9 U.S. East 231,490 249,489 -7.2 1,450,253 1,562,961 -7.2 Japan 66,557 50,310 32.3 393,117 255,133 54.1 Canada 21,551 27,790 -22.5 261,333 298,187 -12.4 All Others 102,289 103,054 -0.7 587,095 589,619 -0.4 Visitor arrivals by cruise ships 672 4,935 -86.4 87,420 85,951 1.7 AVERAGE DAILY CENSUS 263,281 273,051 -3.6 236,398 251,781 -6.1 Total by air 263,235 272,348 -3.3 234,412 249,799 -6.2 U.S. Total 208,612 216,517 -3.7 182,854 197,473 -7.4 U.S. West 136,374 138,355 -1.4 116,327 125,196 -7.1 U.S. East 72,238 78,162 -7.6 66,527 72,277 -8.0 Japan 13,583 10,529 29.0 11,451 8,064 42.0 Canada 7,162 10,080 -29.0 13,782 16,564 -16.8 All Others 33,878 35,222 -3.8 26,326 27,697 -5.0 Visitor arrivals by cruise ships 47 703 -93.3 1,986 1,982 0.2 AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY 8.81 9.05 -2.6 8.82 9.04 -2.4 Total by air 8.82 9.08 -2.8 8.89 9.11 -2.4 U.S. Total 8.80 8.96 -1.8 8.90 8.96 -0.7 U.S. West 8.40 8.59 -2.2 8.46 8.53 -0.8 U.S. East 9.67 9.71 -0.4 9.77 9.80 -0.3 Japan 6.33 6.49 -2.5 6.20 6.70 -7.4 Canada 10.30 11.24 -8.4 11.23 11.78 -4.6 All Others 10.27 10.60 -3.1 9.55 9.96 -4.1 Visitor arrivals by cruise ships 2.16 4.41 -51.1 4.84 4.89 -1.0 PER PERSON PER DAY SPENDING ($) 253.4 238.0 6.4 244.9 240.5 1.8 Total by air 253.4 238.4 6.3 246.1 241.7 1.8 U.S. Total 249.9 233.0 7.2 246.5 240.5 2.5 U.S. West 239.1 217.4 10.0 234.3 227.0 3.2 U.S. East 270.2 260.7 3.7 267.8 263.9 1.5 Japan 240.7 239.9 0.3 238.9 238.2 0.3 Canada 224.2 228.7 -2.0 219.9 216.3 1.7 All Others 286.4 273.7 4.6 260.4 266.3 -2.2 Visitor arrivals by cruise ships 112.1 108.8 3.1 106.8 95.6 11.7 PER PERSON PER TRIP SPENDING ($) 2,233.4 2,154.6 3.7 2,161.0 2,175.1 -0.6 Total by air 2,234.8 2,163.5 3.3 2,186.6 2,200.4 -0.6 U.S. Total 2,198.9 2,087.8 5.3 2,192.6 2,154.3 1.8 U.S. West 2,008.0 1,866.2 7.6 1,982.7 1,936.9 2.4 U.S. East 2,614.1 2,531.4 3.3 2,616.3 2,586.9 1.1 Japan 1,522.6 1,556.6 -2.2 1,482.3 1,596.3 -7.1 Canada 2,309.8 2,571.7 -10.2 2,470.4 2,547.1 -3.0 All Others 2,940.3 2,899.9 1.4 2,487.4 2,651.9 -6.2 Visitor arrivals by cruise ships 242.1 480.0 -49.6 516.7 467.6 10.5 P=Preliminary data.

Urea was 7% more expensive than last month. The nitrogen fertilizer had an average price of $566 per ton.\nThe remaining seven fertilizers were all slightly higher in price. DAP had an average price of $771 per ton, MAP $817/ton, potash $505/ton, 10-34-0 $622/ton, anhydrous $789/ton, UAN28 $355/ton and UAN32 $397/ton.\nOn a price per pound of nitrogen basis, the average urea price was $0.62/lb.N, anhydrous $0.48/lb.N, UAN28 $0.63/lb.N and UAN32 $0.62/lb.N.\n\n                    More Recommended for You\n                \n\n                    Recommended for You\n                \nA fertilizer spill in southwestern Iowa led to a fish kill in a nearby river, according to an Iowa Department of Natural Resources news release. The spill happened early March 11 at the New Cooperative facility near Red Oak in Montgomery County.\nApproximately 1,500 tons of liquid nitrogen fertilizer (UAN32%) was discharged into a drainage ditch and then into the East Nishnabotna River. The release was due to a valve left open on an aboveground storage tank overnight.\nDue to low water levels in the river, the concentration of fertilizer is higher than during normal stream flows, causing some concern for all animals due to high nitrate and urea levels. Dead fish were observed in the river.\nIowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine toxicologist Scott Radke recommends keeping all animals away from the river until the plume of contaminant moves out of the area. The investigation is ongoing, according to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. \nAll fertilizers except two are now lower by double digits compared to one year ago. MAP is 1% lower, DAP is 7% less expensive, urea is 11% lower, 10-34-0 16% less expensive, UAN28 is 17% lower, potash is 23% less expensive, UAN32 are 24% lower and anhydrous is 26% less expensive compared to a year prior.\nDTN gathers fertilizer price bids from agriculture retailers each week to compile the DTN Fertilizer Index. DTN first began reporting data in November 2008.\nIn addition to national averages, MyDTN subscribers can access the full DTN Fertilizer Index, which includes state averages, here: https://www.mydtn.com/\u2026.\nAn early spring means farmers might be considering changes to their fertilizer plans, according to the University of Minnesota Extension.

      "\n\n\nThree fertilizer prices down significantly in second week of September\n\n\u00a0\nFor the first time in eight weeks, multiple average retail fertilizer prices showed considerable declines during the second week of September 2024, according to sellers surveyed by DTN.\nPrices for seven of the eight major fertilizers were lower compared to last month. In addition, three fertilizers had sizeable price declines. DTN designates a significant move as anything 5% or more.\nPotash led the way lower, down 8% from a month ago, with an average price of $464. Both 10-34-0 and UAN32 were 7% less expensive with 10-34-0 having an average price of $596 per ton and UAN32 $351/ton. 10-34-0 was below the $600/ton level for the first since the first week of January 2024. That week the average price was $599/ton.\nFour other fertilizers were slightly lower compared to last month. DAP had an average price of $735/ton, MAP $808/ton, urea $489/ton and UAN28 $329/ton.\nOne fertilizer was slightly more expensive. Anhydrous had an average price of $684/ton, up $6 per ton from last month.\nOn a price per pound of nitrogen basis, the average urea price was $0.53/lb.N, anhydrous $0.42/lb.N, UAN28 $0.59/lb.N and UAN32 $0.55/lb.N.\nRabobank recently released its semiannual fertilizer outlook. As one might expect, the outlook is less than positive for nutrient prices.\nThe company's fertilizer affordability index, which incorporates fertilizer and commodity prices, was 0.03 in July 2024, down from 0.07 in the previous update in May 2024. Right now, the index is considered neutral at 0.00.\nFor the nitrogen and the potash index, there is some stability, moving slightly lower from 0.02 to -0.02, remaining in the neutral range. However, the affordability of phosphate worsened from May to July 2024. The global phosphate affordability index fell from -0.04 to -0.19.\nAnd there are signals that more drops are coming in fertilizer affordability.\n\"In the coming months, projections indicate a downward price trend for some commodities,\" the report stated. \"Combined with expected shifts in fertilizer prices, this has the potential to push the affordability index back into negative territory.\"\nDTN wrote in more detail about Rabobank's semiannual fertilizer outlook last week.\nPrices for all except two fertilizers are lower compared to one year ago. DAP is 4% higher while MAP is 9% higher looking back to last year.\nPrices for the remaining six fertilizers are lower. 10-34-0 is 1% lower, anhydrous is 2% less expensive, both potash and UAN28 are 7% lower, UAN32 is 10% lower and urea is 12% lower compared to last year.\n\n                \n                Now trending\n                \n            \nOUR MISSION: We are committed to the economic well-being of Illinois agriculture and enriching the quality of farm family life.

March 29, 2024\nArkansas Rice Update 2024-01\nMarch 29, 2024\nJarrod Hardke, Trent Roberts, and Bob Scott\n\u201cWelcome back my friends to the show that never ends.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nSurvey Says\nThe Prospective Plantings report is in.\u00a0 Check out the tables later in the report for full details across states.\nFor Arkansas, my expectation is that we\u2019ll end up with 1.4-1.5 million total acres.\u00a0\n                              The decline in medium-grain acres combined with the long-grain seed situation puts\n                              a cap on my total possible expectation.\u00a0 While anything is possible, it seems difficult\n                              to climb north of 1.5 million total acres (1.4 million long-grain).\nFall of 2023 and certain windows in late winter / early spring 2024 have a great deal\n                              of ground ready for planting.\u00a0 Some rice planting began in the central and northern\n                              areas of the state beginning last week (~March 20) while the southern area can\u2019t miss\n                              a rain.\u00a0 The unfortunate comment at this time is that the current overall forecast\n                              for April is wetter than normal (Fig. 1).\nIt appears we\u2019ll need to be geared up for whatever window we\u2019re given to take off\n                              planting.\u00a0 Right now, there are conflicting expectations for next week, but local\n                              forecasts and the NOAA precipitation outlook (Fig. 2) are showing declining rain totals for Monday-Tuesday.\u00a0 If we escape that event,\n                              hold onto your hat, next week\u2019s rice planting progress is going to get wild.\nFig. 1.\u00a0 Monthly precipitation outlook for April 2024.\n\nFig. 2.\u00a0 NOAA 7-day precipitation forecast.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2024 Rice Management Guide now available\nThe 2024 Rice Management Guide publication is made possible by the rice growers of Arkansas through the Arkansas\n                              Rice Check-Off administered by the Arkansas Rice Research and Promotion Board and\n                              support from the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.\u00a0 It contains\n                              the most requested production recommendations for rice in a single, easy-to-reference\n                              PDF.\u00a0 It is now available for download, and copies are now available at local county\n                              Extension offices.\n\u00a0\nNitrogen Starter / Early Post-Emergence Fertilizer\nJarrod Hardke and Trent Roberts\nEveryone is looking for an edge this growing season, and several questions regarding\n                              early season (starter) nitrogen (N) applications have come up.\u00a0 Whether we\u2019re talking\n                              ammonium sulfate (AMS), diammonium phosphate (DAP), poultry litter, or liquid N forms,\n                              here are some thoughts.\nPoultry litter is a little different animal so let\u2019s get it out of the way first.\n                                    If litter is applied and incorporated at planting, there will still be some N available\n                                    to rice.\u00a0 We recommend counting 25% of the litter\u2019s N (on an as-is basis) toward your\n                                    preflood N rate.\u00a0 If litter is surface-applied and not incorporated, N loss via ammonia\n                                    volatilization and surface runoff is more of a concern and less N would be available.\nIn general, do not apply starter N fertilizers at planting. Rice plants live off of\n                                    the seed until around the 2-leaf growth stage.\u00a0 Preplant, at-planting, and early post-emergent\n                                    (1-2 leaf) applications of N can be unavailable or lost before rice has a large enough\n                                    root system to take up any of the applied N.\nIf applying an early post-emergence fertilizer, the 2-3 leaf stage is the earliest you should consider making this application. By this time the plant has more of a\n                                    root system and is beginning to rely on the soil N rather than the seed for its nutrient\n                                    demands.\nOn silt loam soils, when applying early post-emergence N at 2-3 leaf or beyond, there\n                                    should be no expectation of a growth or yield response, and any yield response is\n                                    unlikely to cover the cost of fertilizer and application ($35 or 5.2 bu at $6.75 rice).\nOn clay soils, we can expect to see a growth increase of possibly 1-2 inches in plant\n                                    height compared to no early N applied. While a yield increase is still not expected,\n                                    greater plant size may help with flooding fields earlier and saving on herbicide applications\n                                    while also harvesting earlier.\u00a0 The better the growing conditions, the less likely\n                                    a positive growth response will occur when applying early post-emergence N to rice.\nIf rice is progressing slowly or injured, it may be worth considering an early post-emergence\n                                    N application on a field-specific basis. However, in most cases, the rainfall/flush\n                                    incorporating the fertilizer is most beneficial rather than the actual fertilizer\n                                    itself.\nIf you decide to apply early post-emergence N at 2-3 leaf rice or later, do not count\n                                    any of the N toward your preflood N rate. We could possibly count 5-10 lbs N but the\n                                    actual number is highly variable so it is best to not count it towards the preflood\n                                    N rate.\nThere have been some questions about using a liquid N form to go out with herbicide\n                                    at planting. The same arguments apply as above \u2013 it\u2019s too early to be useful and prone\n                                    to loss.\nMake starter/early post-emergence N decisions on a field-specific basis and keep in\n                              mind that environmental conditions will affect what, if any, response is observed\n                              from them.\n\u00a0\nResults of 2022-2023 Planting Date Studies\nJarrod Hardke\nBelow in Figures 3 and 4 are results of planting date studies averaged across 2022 and 2023 for the RREC at\n                              Stuttgart and the NERREC at Harrisburg.\u00a0 Other cultivars that have been included (and\n                              full 2023 results) can be found in the results of the Arkansas Rice Performance Trials publication.\nOne thing that continues to stand out for the study at RREC is that yields are generally\n                              highest planted early (into mid or late April) and begin to decline after we hit early\n                              May.\u00a0 At NERREC, the past two years things have looked a little different, with very\n                              early not being that great while all of April looked optimal with a decline in early\n                              May before a steep drop after that.\nWith the acres we need to cover, getting started on the early side continues to look\n                              good, but if we can end up with most of our rice planted in April we\u2019re going to be\n                              in great shape.\u00a0 The goal is to get rice in by the first week of May if possible.\nFigure 3.\u00a0 Average grain yield by planting date for selected cultivars at the Rice\n                                 Research and Extension Center, Stuttgart, 2022-2023.\n\nFigure 4.\u00a0 Average grain yield by planting date for selected cultivars at the Northeast\n                                 Rice Research and Extension Center, Harrisburg, 2022-2023.\n\n\u00a0\nHerbicide Plant-Back Restrictions\nJarrod Hardke and Bob Scott\nAs we gear up for a hopefully nearing planting window, some fields have been sprayed\n                              with burndown applications somewhat recently. \u00a0A few notable plant-back intervals\n                              to rice for our burndown herbicides are included in Table 1.\u00a0 For additional information see MP519 Row Crop Plant-Back Intervals for Common Herbicides.\nOne herbicide not listed here, but that has been mentioned repeatedly at winter meetings,\n                                 is Dual (s-metolachlor) \u2013 if it was applied in the fall it is not safe to plant rice\n                                 on that field this spring.\nTable 1.\u00a0 Notable burn-down herbicides with plant-back intervals to rice.\n2,4-D\n21 days\nDicamba1\n22 days\nElevore\n14 days\nGoal\n10 months\nLeadoff\n10 months\nMetribuzin\n12 months\nPython\n6 months\nReviton\n120 days\nSelect Max\n30 days\nValor / Afforia\n30 days\nZidua SC (3.25 oz)\n12 months\n1 Plant-back days are rate dependent, days presented are for lowest labeled rate.\nAlways read and follow label directions.\n\u00a0\nThoughts on Prospective Plantings Report\nJarrod Hardke\nIn late November and early December, we seemed destined for a slight decline in Arkansas\n                              to around 1.3 million acres.\u00a0 Since then, prices of competing crops rapidly declined\n                              and changed the game.\u00a0 Since January it has looked as though we would plant similar\n                              acres or more compared to last year\u2019s 1.4+ million acres.\u00a0 So, the total acreage (Table 2) number puts us right in that neighborhood.\u00a0 From a national standpoint, some are\n                              slightly increasing while others and slightly decreasing resulting in not much change.\nMore on Arkansas though:\u00a0 long-grain acres are showing a dramatic increase (Table 3) while medium-grain acres are showing a dramatic decrease (Table 4).\u00a0 It was thought long-grain could go higher but seed shortages seem to be holding\n                              it back.\u00a0 Medium-grain, however, may still be projected a little high in this estimate\n                              but with the long-grain seed shortage some are looking to medium-grain seed as a way\n                              to get more rice acres in.\nOverall, at this point in time, the acreage projection is right in the wheelhouse\n                              for Arkansas though a little higher number toward 1.5 million total acres was where\n                              I was leaning.\u00a0 Spring weather will tell the story on what actually gets planted of\n                              course.\nTable 2.

Scott\n\u201cThe moon is bright and you\u2019re alright down here.\u201d\n\nClimbing the Harvest Ladder\nCrops are disappearing fast in certain areas while others are just really starting\n                              to pick up steam this week.\u00a0 Harvest progress should easily top 20% in Monday\u2019s upcoming\n                              report.\u00a0 Given the outlook for the next week, it will be amazing how much gets out\n                              of the field as grain moistures are beginning to fall rapidly on the heels of the\n                              cooler, dry air we enjoyed for much of this week.\u00a0 Now we\u2019ll get more sun and heat\n                              to cook out the rest.\nThe longer outlook in the 8-14 day range calls for more average temperatures and the\n                              potential for some rainfall.\u00a0 As dry as some of this rice is already starting to get\n                              in places that could spell bad news for quality.\nInterestingly so far, milling yields have continued to be underwhelming.\u00a0 At this\n                              early stage, I still don\u2019t have an answer for that.\u00a0 As far as an idea, the couple\n                              periods of milder temperatures with overcast conditions that occurred over the past\n                              month may have prevented grains from finishing up as firmly and strongly as we would\n                              normally expect.\u00a0 We\u2019ll study on this topic more as we get deeper into harvest \u2013 with\n                              low stink bug numbers and limited periods of high nighttime temperature concern we\n                              would expect better milling yields.\nOn the positive side \u2013 early yields continue to be strong around the state.\u00a0 There\n                              are always hiccup fields, but the vast majority of yield reports are very positive.\nLet us know if we can help.\nFig. 1.\u00a0 NOAA 7-day precipitation forecast.\n\nFig. 2.\u00a0 2012-2024 Arkansas rice harvest progress by week (USDA-NASS).\n\nUSA Rice Leadership

estimate of converting rice kernel counts to harvest loss.\u00a0\n                              There\u2019s a process for arriving at an accurate average number though.\nThe most accurate way to do the count is to count a 10 ft2 area across the entire header width.\u00a0 For a 30 ft header, that\u2019s an area 30 ft wide\n                              x 4 inches.\u00a0 Not a real feasible or convenient count to make.\nInstead, it may be much more straightforward to take a few simple counts from respective\n                              areas behind the machine.\nFor a 30-ft header, think of it as having three 10-ft sections.\u00a0 Take a single square\n                              foot count in the center of each of these 10-ft sections.\u00a0 Add the three counts and\n                              divide them by three to give you an average per square foot.\nRemember to count any kernels already on the ground in an unharvested area to deduct\n                              from your count that has already shattered on the ground.\nTable 2.\u00a0 Converting rice field loss counts into bushels per acre.\n25\n1.3\n50\n2.5\n75\n3.7\n100\n5.1\n125\n6.4\n250\n12.8\n\u00a0\nHerbicide-Resistant Weed Samples\nJason Norsworthy & Bob Scott\nAs harvest gets in full swing, now is often a good time to collect samples from possible\n                              herbicide-resistant weed populations.\u00a0 The primary weeds to be evaluated are barnyardgrass,\n                              Pennsylvania smartweed, weedy rice, and white-margined flatsedge.\nBarnyardgrass samples will be screened against Roundup, Command, Facet, Newpath, Regiment,\n                              Ricestar, and Propanil.\nSmartweed samples will be screened against Gambit and Regiment.\nWeedy rice samples will be screened against Newpath, Provisia, and Rogue.\nTo submit samples:\nCollect 40-50 seedheads from a field.\nPlace seedheads in a paper bag.\nIf submitting multiple samples, keep in separate, labeled bags.\nAllow seedheads to dry for ~7 days.\nDo not use plastic bags or sealed bags as seeds can rot.\nComplete a herbicide resistance screening form for each sample (obtain at county Extension\n                                    office).\nSubmit samples and forms to county Extension office.\nSamples must be received by Nov. 15 \u2013 anything after that date will not be screened.\u00a0\n                                 Results are typically ready in early March.\n\u00a0\nRice Market Update\nScott Stiles\nRice Market Update\nScott Stiles\nMonday\u2019s Crop Progress report from NASS included harvest estimates as of August 18th.\u00a0 Harvest of the 2024 crop continues to advance faster than last year as well as\n                              the 5-year average.\u00a0 Tropical activity in the U.S. Gulf has been surprisingly low-key\n                              this year considering earlier forecasts.\u00a0 Currently there are no organized systems\n                              in the Atlantic.\nTable 3.\u00a0 Rice Harvest - Selected States (%

When reviewing the rally that occurred from July 19th to August 1st, trading this week has retraced 50% to 62% of that price move.\u00a0 For the time being,\n                              $14.80 is initial support.\nFig. 3.\u00a0 CME November 2024 Rough Rice Futures.\n\nThursday\u2019s Export Sales report didn\u2019t provide much fuel as long-grain business was quiet last week.\u00a0 There\n                              were two rough rice sales of 5,000 tons each reported to Guatemala and Honduras. \u00a0Thus\n                              far, rough rice sales are off to a very strong start in 24/25 with just over 331,000\n                              tons sold compared to 142,893 a year ago.\nThere was one rough rice shipment last week of 25,092 tons to Mexico.\u00a0 Regarding rail\n                              shipping to Mexico, effective from August 21 to September 20, BNSF Railway (BNSF)\n                              will not issue any permits for grain shuttle trains destined to Mexico. \u00a0Service to\n                              Mexico by other railroads (i.e., Union Pacific Railroad or CPKC) is expected to continue\n                              during the Aug. 21 to Sept. 20 timeframe.\nMilled rice sales last week were limited with Haiti, Iraq and Saudi Arabia all absent.\u00a0\n                              A total of 1,924 tons were sold to four (4) markets, most of which was to Mexico.\n                              \u00a0Milled rice sales are 39% behind last year with 132,258 tons sold compared with 216,779\n                              a year ago.\nOptimism from early yield reports and the open stretch of weather for harvest will\n                              be a fundamental headwind for the rice market.\u00a0 However, the cash basis for rice has\n                              remained steady this month.\u00a0 As of Friday, spot delivery bids at mills were hovering\n                              around $6.50/bu for August to October delivery.\nAs the Mississippi River continues to slide lower, the basis for corn and soybeans\n                              has turned weaker this month.\u00a0 At some locations along the Mississippi River, the\n                              corn basis has weakened about 30 cents this month and soybeans 43 cents.\u00a0 Current\n                              forecasts have the Mississippi River at Memphis dropping to its \u201clow threshold\u201d of\n                              -5 feet by September 6th.\u00a0 The weather outlook has Midsouth harvest advancing well into next week without\n                              interruption. \u00a0Barge freight rates are increasing.\u00a0 And, if the Mississippi River\n                              continues to head lower, expect additional weakness in corn and soybean basis over\n                              the upcoming month.\nFuel Market:\nThe chart below provides a look at nearby diesel futures over the past year.\u00a0 This\n                              week\u2019s trading has been in the $2.23 to $2.33 range.\u00a0 The $2.23 trade is the lowest\n                              point diesel has traded since late May 2023. \u00a0The energy markets tend to be volatile\n                              and can turn sharply higher on unforeseen geopolitical events.\u00a0 Plus, with harvest\n                              ramping up in the U.S. there will be increased demand for diesel over the next few\n                              months.\nFig. 4.\u00a0 Diesel nearby futures.\n\n\u00a0\nDD50 Rice Management Program is Live\nThe

March 29, 2024\nArkansas Rice Update 2024-01\nMarch 29, 2024\nJarrod Hardke, Trent Roberts, and Bob Scott\n\u201cWelcome back my friends to the show that never ends.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nSurvey Says\nThe Prospective Plantings report is in.\u00a0 Check out the tables later in the report for full details across states.\nFor Arkansas, my expectation is that we\u2019ll end up with 1.4-1.5 million total acres.\u00a0\n                              The decline in medium-grain acres combined with the long-grain seed situation puts\n                              a cap on my total possible expectation.\u00a0 While anything is possible, it seems difficult\n                              to climb north of 1.5 million total acres (1.4 million long-grain).\nFall of 2023 and certain windows in late winter / early spring 2024 have a great deal\n                              of ground ready for planting.\u00a0 Some rice planting began in the central and northern\n                              areas of the state beginning last week (~March 20) while the southern area can\u2019t miss\n                              a rain.\u00a0 The unfortunate comment at this time is that the current overall forecast\n                              for April is wetter than normal (Fig. 1).\nIt appears we\u2019ll need to be geared up for whatever window we\u2019re given to take off\n                              planting.\u00a0 Right now, there are conflicting expectations for next week, but local\n                              forecasts and the NOAA precipitation outlook (Fig. 2) are showing declining rain totals for Monday-Tuesday.\u00a0 If we escape that event,\n                              hold onto your hat, next week\u2019s rice planting progress is going to get wild.\nFig. 1.\u00a0 Monthly precipitation outlook for April 2024.\n\nFig. 2.\u00a0 NOAA 7-day precipitation forecast.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2024 Rice Management Guide now available\nThe 2024 Rice Management Guide publication is made possible by the rice growers of Arkansas through the Arkansas\n                              Rice Check-Off administered by the Arkansas Rice Research and Promotion Board and\n                              support from the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.\u00a0 It contains\n                              the most requested production recommendations for rice in a single, easy-to-reference\n                              PDF.\u00a0 It is now available for download, and copies are now available at local county\n                              Extension offices.\n\u00a0\nNitrogen Starter / Early Post-Emergence Fertilizer\nJarrod Hardke and Trent Roberts\nEveryone is looking for an edge this growing season, and several questions regarding\n                              early season (starter) nitrogen (N) applications have come up.\u00a0 Whether we\u2019re talking\n                              ammonium sulfate (AMS), diammonium phosphate (DAP), poultry litter, or liquid N forms,\n                              here are some thoughts.\nPoultry litter is a little different animal so let\u2019s get it out of the way first.\n                                    If litter is applied and incorporated at planting, there will still be some N available\n                                    to rice.\u00a0 We recommend counting 25% of the litter\u2019s N (on an as-is basis) toward your\n                                    preflood N rate.\u00a0 If litter is surface-applied and not incorporated, N loss via ammonia\n                                    volatilization and surface runoff is more of a concern and less N would be available.\nIn general, do not apply starter N fertilizers at planting. Rice plants live off of\n                                    the seed until around the 2-leaf growth stage.\u00a0 Preplant, at-planting, and early post-emergent\n                                    (1-2 leaf) applications of N can be unavailable or lost before rice has a large enough\n                                    root system to take up any of the applied N.\nIf applying an early post-emergence fertilizer, the 2-3 leaf stage is the earliest you should consider making this application. By this time the plant has more of a\n                                    root system and is beginning to rely on the soil N rather than the seed for its nutrient\n                                    demands.\nOn silt loam soils, when applying early post-emergence N at 2-3 leaf or beyond, there\n                                    should be no expectation of a growth or yield response, and any yield response is\n                                    unlikely to cover the cost of fertilizer and application ($35 or 5.2 bu at $6.75 rice).\nOn clay soils, we can expect to see a growth increase of possibly 1-2 inches in plant\n                                    height compared to no early N applied. While a yield increase is still not expected,\n                                    greater plant size may help with flooding fields earlier and saving on herbicide applications\n                                    while also harvesting earlier.\u00a0 The better the growing conditions, the less likely\n                                    a positive growth response will occur when applying early post-emergence N to rice.\nIf rice is progressing slowly or injured, it may be worth considering an early post-emergence\n                                    N application on a field-specific basis. However, in most cases, the rainfall/flush\n                                    incorporating the fertilizer is most beneficial rather than the actual fertilizer\n                                    itself.\nIf you decide to apply early post-emergence N at 2-3 leaf rice or later, do not count\n                                    any of the N toward your preflood N rate. We could possibly count 5-10 lbs N but the\n                                    actual number is highly variable so it is best to not count it towards the preflood\n                                    N rate.\nThere have been some questions about using a liquid N form to go out with herbicide\n                                    at planting. The same arguments apply as above \u2013 it\u2019s too early to be useful and prone\n                                    to loss.\nMake starter/early post-emergence N decisions on a field-specific basis and keep in\n                              mind that environmental conditions will affect what, if any, response is observed\n                              from them.\n\u00a0\nResults of 2022-2023 Planting Date Studies\nJarrod Hardke\nBelow in Figures 3 and 4 are results of planting date studies averaged across 2022 and 2023 for the RREC at\n                              Stuttgart and the NERREC at Harrisburg.\u00a0 Other cultivars that have been included (and\n                              full 2023 results) can be found in the results of the Arkansas Rice Performance Trials publication.\nOne thing that continues to stand out for the study at RREC is that yields are generally\n                              highest planted early (into mid or late April) and begin to decline after we hit early\n                              May.\u00a0 At NERREC, the past two years things have looked a little different, with very\n                              early not being that great while all of April looked optimal with a decline in early\n                              May before a steep drop after that.\nWith the acres we need to cover, getting started on the early side continues to look\n                              good, but if we can end up with most of our rice planted in April we\u2019re going to be\n                              in great shape.\u00a0 The goal is to get rice in by the first week of May if possible.\nFigure 3.\u00a0 Average grain yield by planting date for selected cultivars at the Rice\n                                 Research and Extension Center, Stuttgart, 2022-2023.\n\nFigure 4.\u00a0 Average grain yield by planting date for selected cultivars at the Northeast\n                                 Rice Research and Extension Center, Harrisburg, 2022-2023.\n\n\u00a0\nHerbicide Plant-Back Restrictions\nJarrod Hardke and Bob Scott\nAs we gear up for a hopefully nearing planting window, some fields have been sprayed\n                              with burndown applications somewhat recently. \u00a0A few notable plant-back intervals\n                              to rice for our burndown herbicides are included in Table 1.\u00a0 For additional information see MP519 Row Crop Plant-Back Intervals for Common Herbicides.\nOne herbicide not listed here, but that has been mentioned repeatedly at winter meetings,\n                                 is Dual (s-metolachlor) \u2013 if it was applied in the fall it is not safe to plant rice\n                                 on that field this spring.\nTable 1.\u00a0 Notable burn-down herbicides with plant-back intervals to rice.\n2,4-D\n21 days\nDicamba1\n22 days\nElevore\n14 days\nGoal\n10 months\nLeadoff\n10 months\nMetribuzin\n12 months\nPython\n6 months\nReviton\n120 days\nSelect Max\n30 days\nValor / Afforia\n30 days\nZidua SC (3.25 oz)\n12 months\n1 Plant-back days are rate dependent, days presented are for lowest labeled rate.\nAlways read and follow label directions.\n\u00a0\nThoughts on Prospective Plantings Report\nJarrod Hardke\nIn late November and early December, we seemed destined for a slight decline in Arkansas\n                              to around 1.3 million acres.\u00a0 Since then, prices of competing crops rapidly declined\n                              and changed the game.\u00a0 Since January it has looked as though we would plant similar\n                              acres or more compared to last year\u2019s 1.4+ million acres.\u00a0 So, the total acreage (Table 2) number puts us right in that neighborhood.\u00a0 From a national standpoint, some are\n                              slightly increasing while others and slightly decreasing resulting in not much change.\nMore on Arkansas though:\u00a0 long-grain acres are showing a dramatic increase (Table 3) while medium-grain acres are showing a dramatic decrease (Table 4).\u00a0 It was thought long-grain could go higher but seed shortages seem to be holding\n                              it back.\u00a0 Medium-grain, however, may still be projected a little high in this estimate\n                              but with the long-grain seed shortage some are looking to medium-grain seed as a way\n                              to get more rice acres in.\nOverall, at this point in time, the acreage projection is right in the wheelhouse\n                              for Arkansas though a little higher number toward 1.5 million total acres was where\n                              I was leaning.\u00a0 Spring weather will tell the story on what actually gets planted of\n                              course.\nTable 2.

Scott\n\u201cThe moon is bright and you\u2019re alright down here.\u201d\n\nClimbing the Harvest Ladder\nCrops are disappearing fast in certain areas while others are just really starting\n                              to pick up steam this week.\u00a0 Harvest progress should easily top 20% in Monday\u2019s upcoming\n                              report.\u00a0 Given the outlook for the next week, it will be amazing how much gets out\n                              of the field as grain moistures are beginning to fall rapidly on the heels of the\n                              cooler, dry air we enjoyed for much of this week.\u00a0 Now we\u2019ll get more sun and heat\n                              to cook out the rest.\nThe longer outlook in the 8-14 day range calls for more average temperatures and the\n                              potential for some rainfall.\u00a0 As dry as some of this rice is already starting to get\n                              in places that could spell bad news for quality.\nInterestingly so far, milling yields have continued to be underwhelming.\u00a0 At this\n                              early stage, I still don\u2019t have an answer for that.\u00a0 As far as an idea, the couple\n                              periods of milder temperatures with overcast conditions that occurred over the past\n                              month may have prevented grains from finishing up as firmly and strongly as we would\n                              normally expect.\u00a0 We\u2019ll study on this topic more as we get deeper into harvest \u2013 with\n                              low stink bug numbers and limited periods of high nighttime temperature concern we\n                              would expect better milling yields.\nOn the positive side \u2013 early yields continue to be strong around the state.\u00a0 There\n                              are always hiccup fields, but the vast majority of yield reports are very positive.\nLet us know if we can help.\nFig. 1.\u00a0 NOAA 7-day precipitation forecast.\n\nFig. 2.\u00a0 2012-2024 Arkansas rice harvest progress by week (USDA-NASS).\n\nUSA Rice Leadership

estimate of converting rice kernel counts to harvest loss.\u00a0\n                              There\u2019s a process for arriving at an accurate average number though.\nThe most accurate way to do the count is to count a 10 ft2 area across the entire header width.\u00a0 For a 30 ft header, that\u2019s an area 30 ft wide\n                              x 4 inches.\u00a0 Not a real feasible or convenient count to make.\nInstead, it may be much more straightforward to take a few simple counts from respective\n                              areas behind the machine.\nFor a 30-ft header, think of it as having three 10-ft sections.\u00a0 Take a single square\n                              foot count in the center of each of these 10-ft sections.\u00a0 Add the three counts and\n                              divide them by three to give you an average per square foot.\nRemember to count any kernels already on the ground in an unharvested area to deduct\n                              from your count that has already shattered on the ground.\nTable 2.\u00a0 Converting rice field loss counts into bushels per acre.\n25\n1.3\n50\n2.5\n75\n3.7\n100\n5.1\n125\n6.4\n250\n12.8\n\u00a0\nHerbicide-Resistant Weed Samples\nJason Norsworthy & Bob Scott\nAs harvest gets in full swing, now is often a good time to collect samples from possible\n                              herbicide-resistant weed populations.\u00a0 The primary weeds to be evaluated are barnyardgrass,\n                              Pennsylvania smartweed, weedy rice, and white-margined flatsedge.\nBarnyardgrass samples will be screened against Roundup, Command, Facet, Newpath, Regiment,\n                              Ricestar, and Propanil.\nSmartweed samples will be screened against Gambit and Regiment.\nWeedy rice samples will be screened against Newpath, Provisia, and Rogue.\nTo submit samples:\nCollect 40-50 seedheads from a field.\nPlace seedheads in a paper bag.\nIf submitting multiple samples, keep in separate, labeled bags.\nAllow seedheads to dry for ~7 days.\nDo not use plastic bags or sealed bags as seeds can rot.\nComplete a herbicide resistance screening form for each sample (obtain at county Extension\n                                    office).\nSubmit samples and forms to county Extension office.\nSamples must be received by Nov. 15 \u2013 anything after that date will not be screened.\u00a0\n                                 Results are typically ready in early March.\n\u00a0\nRice Market Update\nScott Stiles\nRice Market Update\nScott Stiles\nMonday\u2019s Crop Progress report from NASS included harvest estimates as of August 18th.\u00a0 Harvest of the 2024 crop continues to advance faster than last year as well as\n                              the 5-year average.\u00a0 Tropical activity in the U.S. Gulf has been surprisingly low-key\n                              this year considering earlier forecasts.\u00a0 Currently there are no organized systems\n                              in the Atlantic.\nTable 3.\u00a0 Rice Harvest - Selected States (%

futures shot 25 cents higher Monday and has since then settled into\n                              a range between $14.80 and $15. When reviewing the rally that occurred from July 19th to August 1st, trading this week has retraced 50% to 62% of that price move.\u00a0 For the time being,\n                              $14.80 is initial support.\nFig. 3.\u00a0 CME November 2024 Rough Rice Futures.\n\nThursday\u2019s Export Sales report didn\u2019t provide much fuel as long-grain business was quiet last week.\u00a0 There\n                              were two rough rice sales of 5,000 tons each reported to Guatemala and Honduras. \u00a0Thus\n                              far, rough rice sales are off to a very strong start in 24/25 with just over 331,000\n                              tons sold compared to 142,893 a year ago.\nThere was one rough rice shipment last week of 25,092 tons to Mexico.\u00a0 Regarding rail\n                              shipping to Mexico, effective from August 21 to September 20, BNSF Railway (BNSF)\n                              will not issue any permits for grain shuttle trains destined to Mexico. \u00a0Service to\n                              Mexico by other railroads (i.e., Union Pacific Railroad or CPKC) is expected to continue\n                              during the Aug. 21 to Sept. 20 timeframe.\nMilled rice sales last week were limited with Haiti, Iraq and Saudi Arabia all absent.\u00a0\n                              A total of 1,924 tons were sold to four (4) markets, most of which was to Mexico.\n                              \u00a0Milled rice sales are 39% behind last year with 132,258 tons sold compared with 216,779\n                              a year ago.\nOptimism from early yield reports and the open stretch of weather for harvest will\n                              be a fundamental headwind for the rice market.\u00a0 However, the cash basis for rice has\n                              remained steady this month.\u00a0 As of Friday, spot delivery bids at mills were hovering\n                              around $6.50/bu for August to October delivery.\nAs the Mississippi River continues to slide lower, the basis for corn and soybeans\n                              has turned weaker this month.\u00a0 At some locations along the Mississippi River, the\n                              corn basis has weakened about 30 cents this month and soybeans 43 cents.\u00a0 Current\n                              forecasts have the Mississippi River at Memphis dropping to its \u201clow threshold\u201d of\n                              -5 feet by September 6th.\u00a0 The weather outlook has Midsouth harvest advancing well into next week without\n                              interruption. \u00a0Barge freight rates are increasing.\u00a0 And, if the Mississippi River\n                              continues to head lower, expect additional weakness in corn and soybean basis over\n                              the upcoming month.\nFuel Market:\nThe chart below provides a look at nearby diesel futures over the past year.\u00a0 This\n                              week\u2019s trading has been in the $2.23 to $2.33 range.\u00a0 The $2.23 trade is the lowest\n                              point diesel has traded since late May 2023. \u00a0The energy markets tend to be volatile\n                              and can turn sharply higher on unforeseen geopolitical events.\u00a0 Plus, with harvest\n                              ramping up in the U.S. there will be increased demand for diesel over the next few\n                              months.\nFig. 4.\u00a0 Diesel nearby futures.\n\n\u00a0\nDD50 Rice Management Program is Live\nThe

      "Connor N. Sible and Fred E. Below Crop Physiology Laboratory Department of Crop Sciences University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 2 2023 Biological Testing for Soybean Production Report We examined different biological products, application methods, and agronomic management systems with the goal of showing which products have the greatest chance of success. Research Approach Six different biological products were tested in two different management systems (standard or progressive) with two genetically diverse soybean varieties (GH3762E3 and AG38XF1). This approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation of product performance and can help to decide if, how, and where to use a specific biological product. How Biological Products were Evaluated From our previous experience evaluating biological products, we know that a given product may enhance early season growth and the potential yield, but often not the final yield when other in-season factors like nutrient deficiency or leaf disease are present. Thus, biological products were evaluated in both \u2018standard\u2019 and \u2018progressive\u2019 management systems (Table 1) Table 1. Agronomic management systems used in the evaluation of biological products for soybean at Champaign, IL in 2023. Management System Preplant Fertility1 Foliar Protection Standard None None Progressive 17.5 lbs N/acre 20 lbs S/acre Fungicide and Insecticide at R3 1Preplant fertility supplied as ammonium sulfate (21-0-0-24S) broadcast with a Gandy drop spreader. The \u2018standard\u2019 system for soybean includes no upfront fertility with no subsequent in-season management, while the \u2018progressive\u2019 system has at-planting fertility of nitrogen and sulfur along with a fungicide and insecticide application at R3 for foliar protection (Table 1). Pre-plant fertility was provided as ammonium sulfate (21-0-0-24S) and foliar protection (fungicide with insecticide) as Miravis Top (13.7 oz per acre; Syngenta) with Endigo (4 oz per acre; Syngenta). All plots were seeded to achieve a final plant population of 140,000 plants per acre. Trial Design We also know that non-uniformity within fields causes field spatial variability that can mask the yield response to both agronomic management and to the biological product application. Thus, a pair-wise field design was used where every treated plot had an adjacent untreated control, and this allows for an unbiased comparison of biological products and their efficacy under different levels of agronomic management (Figure 1). Experimental plots were arranged in a split-split block design where the main plot was the biological product, the sub-plot was variety, and the sub-sub-plot was the management system. All treatments were replicated six times. Using this design, eight different biological products were evaluated (Table 2). Figure 1. Pair-wise design used to evaluate biological products under different levels of agronomic management and with two different hybrids. Each biological product was evaluated in a similar approach, with twelve main plots randomized across six replications.

Foliar applications were applied with Petrichor surfactant at 4 oz per acre for the BioPath and Super Nitro treatments while Li700 was supplied at 2.4 oz per acre for the Sanovita applications. All foliar applications were blended with water for total application volume of 15 gallons per acre. Trial Implementation Replicated blocks of the experimental plots were planted at Champaign, IL (40\u00b03'35\"N, 88\u00b014'13\"W) on 19 April using a precision plot planter (SeedPro 360, ALMACO). Preplant soil test levels are shown in Table 3. Plots were 36 feet in length and four rows in width, with rows 1 and 4 serving as border and rows 2 and 3 harvested for yield. For weed control, a pre-plant application of Boundary (34 oz per acre; Syngenta) was made on 17 April. In-season weed control in was applied 18 May as FirstRate (0.5 oz per acre; Corteva) and FlexstarGT (3.5 pt per acre; Syngenta) and on 7 June as Zidua (3.25 oz per acre; BASF), Liberty (36 oz per acre; BASF), FusiladeDX (8 oz per acre; Syngenta), and RoundUp Powermax 3 (30 oz per acre; Bayer Crop Science).

Presented values are the average of the six replications. Biological Product Applications The unique pairwise design allows for unbiased comparisons among biological products that are applied as a seed treatment, in-furrow, or foliar spray. Seed treatments were treated 19 April and in-furrow applications were mixed within an hour of application on date of planting. Early vegetative growth stage (V4) foliar applications were supplied on 3 June. The reproductive foliar (R1) applications of individual biologicals were supplied on 30 June and the R3 applications along with the foliar protection of the progressive management plots were applied on 30 July. Application Methods Seed treatments were blended with water for a total application of 6 oz per cwt using a Hege11 seed treater (Wintersteiger). Both in-furrow biological entries were blended with water for a total application volume of 12 gallons per acre and supplied using a planter-attached liquid application system (SureFire Ag Systems). Foliar applications were balanced with water for a total application volume of 15 gallons per acre and supplied using a pressurized CO2 backpack sprayer. Growing conditions The growing season started dry with below-average precipitation for April, resulting in well aerated soils and early planting for the county (Table 4). The months of May, June, and July all ended with below-normal precipitation (3.1, 1.9, and 1.5 inches below average, respectively), resulting in a moderate drought during the vegetative and early reproductive growth stages. However, the month of August received adequate rainfall during seed fill, resulting in extended plant health and a final trial average yield of 86 bushels per acre. 4 Table 4.

Data obtained from the Illinois State Water Survey. Data Collection, Analysis, and Interpretation At maturity, plots were harvested with a two-row plot combine and grain yield is reported as bushels per acre at 13% moisture (Tables 5 and 6). The experimental design was a split-split plot arrangement in six randomized complete blocks. Statistical analysis was performed using a linear mixed model approach with PROC MIXED in SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and means between treatments were separated using Fisher\u2019s protected LSD test at the 0.10 level of significance. Paired T-tests were conducted to evaluate an individual product\u2019s yield response to the respective untreated controls. Soybean Response to Management was limited in 2023 The response to agronomic management was minimal, with only a 0.6 bushel per acre response when averaged across the two varieties (Table 5). Multiple university studies and farmer testimonials highlight the value of early planted soybean (three to four weeks ahead of normal) to improve field average yields when compared to previous years and later plantings. In 2023, only 15% of Illinois soybean acres had been planted by 23 April (USDA-NASS), placing this study among early planted acres. As a result, the trial average yield of 86 bushels per acre was well above regional yield averages reported in previous years. In a dry year with little sulfate leaching and limited disease pressure, along with improved yield potential due to early planting, there was less need for management to maximize grain yields in 2023. Response to Biologicals was Variety and Management Dependent Yield responses to biologicals varied with both positive and negative responses observed between the treated plots and their respective paired controls. The GH3762E3 variety resulted in a positive yield response in seven of the twelve comparisons while the AG38XF1 only responded positively to applications in three of the twelve comparisons (Table 6). Two of the positive responses for AG38XF1 variety were with the in-furrow application of BioPath or the seed treatment application of PhosN to the standard management system, resulting in a 3.2 or 2.0 bushel response, respectively. Each of these products were placed in the root zone and contain Bacillus spp. bacteria that enhance soil nutrient availability, in particular phosphorus, which can be a limiting nutrient for high-yielding soybean during grain fill. The PhosN seed treatment also significantly improved the yield of the GH3762E3 variety under standard management by 5 bushels, providing a consistent response across varieties for low-input systems. Conversely, these applications resulted in negative responses for both varieties under progressive management where supplied nitrogen and sulfur fertility may have stimulated native microbial release of soil phosphorus, negating the effect of the biologicals. Foliar supplied biologicals were most responsive when applied to the GH3762E3 variety with progressive management, where the Super Nitro, BioPath, and Herbagreen products numerically improved yields by 3.2, 3.7, and 3.0 bushels, respectively. These applications were less responsive with the standard management for this variety with responses of 0.7, -1.0, or 2.3 bushels, respectively, and induced negative responses when supplied to the AG38XF1 variety in five of the six comparisons. Conclusions This study shows that early planted soybean can result in a high yield potential, and with an extended growing season the response to additional management factors of fertility, foliar protection, or biologicals was limited. The findings here highlight the impact that variety and management system can have on soybean response to other agronomic inputs like biologicals, and that the addition of a given product type and/or application method must take into consideration other agronomic practices being utilized on the farm. 5 Table 5.

      "Regional Review: Ground zero for GM wheat \nKANSAS CITY, MISSOURI, US \u2014 A new wheat variety, resistant to drought, is set to play a vital role in smoothing out South American production in the face of increasing weather uncertainty. HB4 wheat, developed by the Argentine company Bioceres, using a gene derived from sunflowers, is being taken up by growers in Argentina and Brazil.\nSouth America\u2019s major grain and oilseeds producers, Brazil and Argentina are, behind the United States, the second and third largest growers of biotech crop varieties in the world.\u00a0\n\u201cWith more than 26 million hectares planted with genetically engineered soybean, corn and cotton crops, Argentina has the third largest area of GE crops under cultivation in the world,\u201d the attach\u00e9 said in an annual report on the sector published in December 2023. \u201cThe commercial adoption of GE crops began in 1996 with the introduction of herbicide-tolerant soybeans and has seen unprecedented growth in area planted since.\n\u201cCurrently, 100% of soybeans, 99% of corn, and 100% of cotton planted in Argentina is genetically engineered. While in the past Argentina has primarily been a producer of GE crops destined for feed and fiber, it is now the first major wheat exporter to commercialize GE wheat for food use.\u201d\u00a0\nThe wheat involved is the drought-resistant HB4 variety developed by Bioceres.\u00a0\n\u201cThe approval in Argentina raised concerns among several farmer organizations and exporters, as they understand this approval might put Argentine wheat exports at risk in other markets,\u201d the attach\u00e9 said. \u201cTo address these concerns, government of Argentina created an audit commission within the National Seed Institute (INASE).\u201d\u00a0\nThe Argentine authorities took the view that \u201cthe biosafety approval granted to flour derived from HB4 wheat met the regulatory requirement for major market approval and granted full approval for HB4 seed commercialization in May 2022.\u201d\u00a0\nIn an emailed response to questions from World Grain, Martin Mariani, manager of global seed and trait at Bioceres, said, \u201cWe\u2019re expecting $15 million to $20 million in incremental EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) over the next years as reported when HB4 wheat received approval for cultivation in Brazil (March 2023).\n\u201cIn terms of HB4 wheat being planted in Argentina and Brazil, it\u2019s important to note that we don\u2019t see HB4 as a replacement per se for traditional wheat \u2014 more like an insurance policy, because it can stabilize production in traditional wheat production regions that are experiencing longer and more regular incidents of drought, like the Central and Southern productive regions of the Argentine Pampas (which contribute more than 95% of wheat production in Argentina) and the southern states of Brazil (90% of Brazil\u2019s productive wheat area), both of which have recently suffered some of their worst, most prolonged droughts in decades.\u201d\nHe said it\u2019s also being planted in newer wheat production areas like Brazil\u2019s Cerrado region, \u201cwhere we are working with Embrapa (Brazil\u2019s Agricultural Research Corporation) to develop subtropical HB4 wheat varieties.\u201d\n\u201cIn Argentina in the 2022-23 season, more than 55,000 hectares of HB4 wheat were planted out of a total of 5.9 million hectares,\u201d Mariani said. \u201cOverall, from 2019 up to today, over 100,000 hectares of HB4 wheat were planted in Argentina. We also have collaborations with other seed companies that are developing HB4 varieties in Argentina.\u201d\u00a0\nHB4 wheat is the only available drought-tolerant wheat technology available today, he said.\u00a0\n\u201cIt enables crops to maintain photosynthesis and generate antioxidants and Osmo protectants in conditions of water stress, and therefore offers more predictable yields under adverse conditions,\u201d Mariani said. \u201cIt can therefore play a key role in the adaptation of farming systems to more extreme climates.\u201d\nHB4 wheat increases yields by an average of 20% in water-limited conditions, a key adaptation that favors double-cropping systems, where water management is increasingly critical, he said.\u00a0\n\u201cImportantly, from the grower perspective, the technology doesn\u2019t cause any drag yield when there is no drought and is tolerant to glufosinate herbicide,\u201d Mariani said.\n\u201cHB4 also has shown environmental benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder no-till practices, HB4 soy-wheat rotations result in an estimated 1,650 kg of carbon fixed into the soil per hectare per year, compared to positive emissions from conventional soy monoculture.\n\u201cOn average, three hectares under this system will remove the annual emissions of one car. Also, its ability to grow better with less water could help reduce land use and farmland expansion, limiting deforestation and negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services like water filtration.\u201d\nHB4 wheat is approved for food and feed in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Nigeria, South Africa, Colombia, Thailand and Chile, as well as Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina, which also have approved HB4 wheat for cultivation, Mariani noted.\u00a0\n\u201cHB4 wheat dossiers are under evaluation in Bolivia, Uruguay and the Philippines,\u201d he said.\nBrazil embraces GM crops\nIn a report from Brazil, also published in December, the attach\u00e9 there said Brazil is the second-largest producer of biotech crops in the world, putting the area planted with GE traits for 2022-23 at 68 million hectares.\u00a0\n\u201cAdoption rates for soybeans and cotton reached 99% and for corn, 95%,\u201d they said. \u201cContinued use of biotechnology seeds has been a major contributor to yield growth in Brazil since its adoption.\u201d\nThey explained that the National Technical Commission (CTNBio), which is responsible for assessing new technologies in Brazil, had approved the new variety of wheat on Nov. 11, 2021.\u00a0\n\u201cBrazil approved the import of this product in the form of flour, but it was not approved to be imported as unmilled grain or as seeds for cultivation,\u201d meaning that \u201cas the situation currently stands, the GE wheat is planted and milled in Argentina, and the wheat flour is imported into Brazil.\u201d\nIn early March 2023, Brazil approved the planting and sale of HB4, when Abitrigo (the Brazilian Wheat Industry Association) published an official statement on the case noting that it was in favor of innovative developments that would \u201cbring benefits to the health and food security of Brazilians.\u201d\u00a0\nAbitrigo stressed that there had not been \u201cconsiderable demonstrations by Brazilian consumers\u201d following the approval of imports of flour made from HB4 wheat, the attach\u00e9 said.\u00a0\n\u201cThe final statement was that approval of the planning, import and commercialization of transgenic wheat (HB4) in the Brazilian national territory by CTNBio reassures the different players in the market and that the final word will be with consumers,\u201d the attach\u00e9 said.\n\u201cConsumers in Brazil are logical and rational, tied to price, especially due to budget constraints from Brazilian households,\u201d the attach\u00e9 said. \u201cBrazil has been importing the flour with GE wheat for human consumption since November 2021, but now Brazilian farmers will be able to plant the GE wheat seed in their country.\u201d\u00a0\nBrazil became the second nation, after Argentina, to approve a variety for this purpose.\n\u201cFor human consumption only, food from HB4 wheat has already been approved for import either in the form of wheat flour or as finished products such as baked goods in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, South Africa, Colombia, Nigeria and the United States. Those countries are not authorized to plant genetically engineered wheat. Historically, Brazil has always depended on imports to be able to supply the domestic market with wheat. For this reason, national producers see in the release of HB4 an opportunity to increase Brazilian production.\u00a0\n\u201cThe drought tolerance is crucial for planting in regions with excessive drought, which is the case in central-western Brazil.\u201d\u00a0\nAccording to the attach\u00e9 there, Argentina has 73 biotech crop events approved for production and commercialization, including 20 soybean events, 40 maize events, seven cotton events, two alfalfa events, one safflower event, two potato events, and one wheat event. They put the 2022-23 total area planted with biotech varieties at 24.5 million hectares.\nPublic attitudes\nThe attach\u00e9 said that \u201conly small non-governmental organizations or civil society groups fight against transgenic products.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHowever, GE crops (regardless of the intended use or trait) are associated with plant protection products popularly considered harmful to the environment and health,\u201d they said. \u201cFor years, there has been growing activism against the use of glyphosate,\u201d which meant that \u201cin 2021, the announcement of the HB4 drought-tolerant wheat approval that is also tolerant to glufosinate-ammonium sparked controversy among consumers.\u201d\nThe attach\u00e9 in Brazil quoted CTNBio data from Oct. 3, 2022, before the approval of HB4 wheat, showing that there are 105 GE events approved for commercial cultivation in Brazil, of which 55 events are for corn, 23 for cotton, 18 for soybeans, six for sugar cane, two for eucalyptus, and one for a virus-resistant variety (of) dry edible bean.\n\u201cPublic perception regarding GE plants in the country varies by audience,\u201d they said. \u201cBrazilian farmers\u2019 and ranchers\u2019 acceptance of these techniques is very well established.\u201d \u00a0\nAs far as the new wheat is concerned, they report that in May 2022, the Brazilian Association of Biscuits, Pasta, and Industrialized Breads and Cakes published the results of a December 2021 research conducted to analyze acceptance (or not) to this new variety of wheat amongst consumers.\nRelated Articles\nRegional Review: CIS countries' grain exports soaring\nRegional Review: The devil is in the details\nRegional review North America: Grain-rich continent\nRegional Review: Grains and oilseeds powerhouse\nU.K. research set to test GM wheat for higher yields \nCurrent Issues & Directories\nPopular Articles\nFocus on Ukraine\nADM cancels conference call with analysts\nAgribusiness challenges drag down Bunge earnings\nADM deploys Ag Logistics Platform\n",

No other input can radically change the yield potential to the extent that variety selection can. This decision can be daunting, but through the LSU AgCenter, producers do have information at their disposal to improve this decision-making process.\r\n\nFortunately, growers in Louisiana have two types of multi-environment data to use when selecting varieties. The official variety trials (OVT) are small-plot trials where varieties are evaluated. For the 2023 OVT, 71 varieties were entered by nine seed companies and one university soybean breeding program. The varieties consisted of several different herbicide technologies, and the maturity groups range from 3.7 to 5.8. The trial was replicated at seven research stations across the state in different soil types, including fine sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay and clay.\r\n\nIn addition to the OVT, the LSU AgCenter collaborates with soybean producers to evaluate soybean varieties directly on farms. For these core-block demonstration plots, LSU AgCenter parish agents cooperate with producers to plant, maintain and harvest strip trials submitted by seed companies and university soybean breeding programs. These demonstrations provide valuable yield data from local growing conditions and agronomic practices. The core block program is designed to evaluate a select number of soybean varieties in large plots located across the state. In some cases, observations from these large plots can result in identification of varieties that are resistant to a number of soilborne maladies. Seven seed companies submitted varieties for the 2023 core-block demonstrations. Thirty demonstrations were planted across 14 parishes. The demonstrations were divided by maturity group (MG). A demonstration consisted of varieties with a MG of 4.0 to 4.4; 4.5 to 4.9; or 5.2 to 5.6. The numbers of varieties submitted for each MG were five (MG 4.0 to 4.4), 12 (MG 4.5 to 4.9) and eight (MG 5.2 to 5.6).\r\n\nThe OVT and the core-block demonstrations allow producers to select from the large number of varieties in the OVT and from varieties tested in environments similar to their farms. We would advise growers to make all variety decisions based on multiyear and multi-environment data and to identify stable varieties that perform well over a range of environments.\r\n\nFor best use of this guide, we recommend evaluating variety yield results based on performance and stability. Performance refers to identifying the varieties that are high yielding in environments that best represent your local farm. Stability refers to the performance of a variety across multiple environments. It is important for growers to consider both factors when making variety decisions.\r\n\nOther Varietal Characteristics \n\nVariety yield potential is an important trait in selecting a variety, but other varietal characteristics should also be considered. How these criteria rank in importance to the grower may vary from one grower to the next and may vary from one field to the next. Several of these criteria for variety selection are discussed below.\r\n\nHerbicide Tolerance and Weed Management Programs\nSix different herbicide tolerances are available in soybean in 2024. They are Roundup Ready, Enlist, Liberty Link, STS/BOLT, Xtend and XtendFlex. Roundup Ready is tolerant to glyphosate; Enlist is tolerant to glyphosate, glufosinate, and 2,4-D choline; Liberty Link is tolerant to glufosinate; STS/BOLT is tolerant to glyphosate and higher rates of Classic and other ALS-herbicides; Xtend is tolerant to glyphosate and dicamba, and XtendFlex is tolerant to glyphosate, glufosinate, and dicamba. If multiple herbicide technologies are utilized by a producer, they should be careful in their planning because there is no cross tolerance among the varieties. For example, dicamba should only be applied to Xtend and XtendFlex varieties, and 2,4-D choline should only be applied to Enlist varieties. Regardless of the herbicide-tolerant technology utilized, application of a residual herbicide prior to soybean emergence followed by a post-emergence application of a residual herbicide that is tank-mixed with a nonselective herbicide is the best strategy to manage herbicide-resistant weeds. For Enlist, Xtend, and XtendFlex varieties, the company websites should be consulted prior to mixing herbicides to ensure whether the desired herbicide combination is legal. All applications that contain Engenia, Tavium, or XtendiMax in Xtend or XtendFlex soybean require a volatility reduction agent. Also, when tank-mixing another pesticide with Engenia, Tavium, or XtendiMax, a drift retardant agent may be required. Consult the company\u2019s websites for legal requirements. Applications of Enlist One or Enlist Duo require specific spray nozzles; therefore, check the company website to ensure spray nozzles are legal.  Research has shown that maintaining soybean weed-free for the first five weeks after emergence can maximize yield and the best program to accomplish this is use of residual herbicides preemergence and postemergence.\r\n\nDisease Resistance\nSoybean varieties differ in susceptibility to diseases and nematodes. Aerial blight is an important foliar disease south of Alexandria and is becoming more of an issue in northern parishes. Cercospora leaf blight is a major disease throughout the state. Frogeye leaf spot has been less of an issue in recent years because of resistant varieties but can be found annually. These, and other foliar diseases, may cause significant yield losses and harvest delays. Soil-borne diseases may also be a problem in any given year. Sudden death syndrome (SDS) has been confirmed in Louisiana, but it is not widespread and is rarely seen. A soil-borne disease with similar foliar symptoms as SDS known as taproot decline has recently been confirmed by pathologists and is likely the most prevalent issue in the state. Phytophthora root rot is an isolated issue and is more prevalent in clay or poorly drained soils. Root-knot nematode is prevalent in sandy soils and is an annual problem in certain areas. When these and other diseases occur in official variety trials, ratings are conducted to identify potential sources of resistance, making variety selection the most economical way for producers to manage diseases. Specialized variety trials may be conducted in certain areas to target specific diseases, such as the taproot decline variety screening at Macon Ridge Research Station.\r\n\nInsects\nSoybeans are damaged by a diverse insect pest complex of stink bugs, threecornered alfalfa hoppers, beetles, several Lepidopteran defoliators (soybean loopers, velvetbean caterpillars, green cloverworms) and pod feeders (corn earworms) from plant emergence until harvest. Soybeans can compensate for considerable insect injury; however, high pest populations can cause severe yield reductions or total crop loss. To reduce yield loss, fields should be scouted weekly using a shake sheet or a sweep net, and proper insecticide materials should be applied when action thresholds have been met. Soybean varieties can differ in their ability to tolerate various insect pests, and those varieties that are less tolerant should be scouted more often.\r\n\nScouting fields is especially important for locating the most damaging soybean pest in Louisiana, the redbanded stink bug. This pest feeds only on legumes; thus, earlier maturing varieties have the most potential for redbanded stink bug damage. In general, MG IV soybeans will have more damage than MG V at pod initiation, as seed set begins earlier and lasts longer. This results in longer exposure to stink bugs over time, resulting in greater opportunities for stink bug injury. Planting soybean as early as possible can mitigate late-season-damage. As early-planted soybean plants mature and begin to be harvested, the later planted soybean plants act as a sponge and absorb all the surrounding stink bugs searching for a new host. As a rule, scouting for redbanded stink bugs should begin at R2 and occur every five days, if possible. Failure to detect early populations can result in missed opportunities for control. As a reminder, the action threshold for the redbanded stink bug is 16 insects (nymphs and adults) per 100 sweeps.\r\n\nFor several years, we have screened high-yielding, commercially available soybean varieties for susceptibility to stink bugs to provide agents, consultants, and growers information on what to expect from stink bug pressure. No varieties are currently available that provide immunity from stink bugs. Many commercial varieties, however, provide excellent yields under varied growing conditions that are highly susceptible to stink bugs.\r\n\nSalt-Chloride Tolerance\nSoybeans under continuous irrigation may be subjected to high levels of salts or chlorides from well or surface water. Observations from several years at the Macon Ridge Research Station near Winnsboro have made it possible to pinpoint varieties that have resistance or sensitivity to the problem. The problem shows up as leaf scorching and usually occurs shortly after irrigation water is applied. When choosing varieties to be utilized in irrigated systems, excluders (those varieties that can tolerate high chloride levels) should be chosen. However, yield potential of both excluders and includers (those varieties that cannot tolerate high chloride levels) will be reduced in soils with high chloride levels.\r\n\nMaturity\r\n\nThere is a certain amount of overlap in maturity between groups within the state. Environmental conditions, especially drought and pest pressure, can cause variation in maturity. Most varieties within a group mature in the following range when planted at recommended times:\r\n\nWhere large acreages are involved, varieties of differing maturity should be selected to stagger the harvest and avoid losses from shattering and poor quality.\r\n\nLower Pod Height\r\n\nPod height is especially important in rough, poorly drained soils and new ground. It is important for all varieties to set pods a reasonable distance above the soil surface to aid in harvestability.\r\n\nPoor Drainage\r\n\nMany soybeans in Louisiana are planted on heavy clay soils with poor internal drainage. Research has determined that certain varieties are superior to others under these conditions. Consult results from the St. Joseph Sharkey clay test to select varieties for tolerance to poor drainage. Planting on raised beds is desirable where drainage is less than optimal.\r\n\nLodging Resistance\r\n\nSoybean varieties are more likely to lodge if a population of more than six plants per foot of row is present and if grown on a highly fertile soil. Tall varieties tend to lodge more severely than short ones. When lodging occurs, seed quality and yield are affected. A lodged field is more susceptible to disease and reduces harvest efficiency.\r\n\nPlant Height\r\n\nPlant height varies according to growing conditions, planting date, soil type and variety. If canopy closure has been a problem, a taller variety should be selected or a closer row spacing should be adopted. On highly fertile soil, too much growth is sometimes a problem, and a shorter variety is the better choice.\r\n\nSeed Quality\r\n\nPoor seed quality is more often found in early maturing varieties. Poor quality is especially true for indeterminate varieties that do not mature uniformly. However, in wet harvest seasons when temperatures and humidity remain high, seed quality issues can often be observed for most varieties. Poor seed quality occurs when fields are not harvested when ready or under heavy disease pressure. When poor conditions occur between physiological maturity (maximum dry matter accumulation) and harvest, chances increase for a decline in seed quality.\r\n\nCultural Practices\r\n\nLime and Molybdenum\r\n\nAvailability of most plant nutrients is typically greatest in soils with a pH of 5.8 to 7.0. When the soil pH drops below 5.2 on sandy loam and silt loam soils, and below 5.0 on clay soils, manganese toxicity may occur. When the soil pH drops below 5.0, aluminum toxicity may also occur. Soil testing should be conducted on a regular basis, and agricultural lime should be used to correct low pH soils to proper levels.\r\n\nIn extreme cases, manganese toxicity is expressed as a stunted plant with crinkled leaves. In milder cases, manganese toxicity may result in reduced yields even when visible symptoms are not present. Aluminum toxicity typically affects the roots, resulting in short, thick roots, a condition known as club root. Manganese and aluminum toxicities can be controlled by keeping the soil pH above the critical levels.\r\n\nMolybdenum is a critical component of the nitrogenase complex that fixes atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form for the soybean plant. Molybdenum is a nutrient needed by soybeans in small quantities. Although our soils typically have enough molybdenum for optimal growth, molybdenum is less available to plants as the soil becomes more acidic. At soil pH below 6.2, molybdenum should be applied as seed treatment at planting. However, if a commercial inoculum is needed and is applied as a seed treatment, molybdenum should not be applied as a seed treatment. The molybdenum salt will reduce the viability of the inoculum and will result in poor nodulation.\r\n\nNitrogen\r\n\nSoybeans need large quantities of nitrogen. Soybeans remove about 4 pounds of nitrogen in each harvested bushel. Fortunately, soybeans are legumes and can obtain most of their nitrogen from the atmosphere. They accomplish this with the aid of the bacterium Rhizobium japonicum. These bacteria use soybean roots as a livable environment and form nodules on soybean roots that capture nitrogen from the atmosphere and fix it into a usable form. Seed should be inoculated with Rhizobium japonicum bacteria in soils with no recent history of soybeans or when conditions have reduced bacteria survival.\r\n\nPhosphorus\r\n\nPhosphorous is critical in the early stages of soybean growth. It stimulates root growth, is essential in the storage and transfer of energy throughout the plant and is an important component of several biochemicals that control plant growth and development. Phosphorus is concentrated in the seed and strongly affects seed formation. Soybeans remove about 0.8 of a pound of phosphate (P2O5) per bushel in the harvested portion of the crop.\r\n\nPhosphorus deficiencies are not easily observed. Usually no striking visual symptoms indicate phosphorus deficiency in soybeans. The most common characteristics of phosphorus-deficient soybean plants are stunted growth and reduced yields.\r\n\nPhosphorus fertilization rates should be based on soil test results. Soil pH affects the availability of phosphorus, which is most available to soybeans when the soil pH is between 6.0 and 7.0.\r\n\nPotassium\r\n\nPotassium is essential in the growth and development of soybeans and is indirectly related to many plant cell functions. Some 60 enzymes require the presence of potassium, and plants with adequate amounts of potassium are better able to resist diseases than potassium-deficient plants. About four times as much potash (K2O) is required by soybeans as phosphate, (P2O5) and about twice as much potash (K2O) is removed in the seed as phosphate (P2O5). Soybeans remove about 1.4 pounds of potash (K2O) per bushel in the harvested portion of the plant.\r\n\nPotassium deficiency symptoms are easy to diagnose when they are severe enough to be seen visually and will usually occur on the lower leaves during pod fill as margins (edges) of the leaves appear necrotic (dead and brown). Severe potassium deficiencies can greatly reduce yields. Potassium fertilizer rates should be based on soil test results.\r\n\nEarly Planting\r\n\nSoybeans should not be planted until soil temperature reaches 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Because emergence may also be affected by cool soil temperatures after planting, early planting decisions should also consider the forecast up to seven days after planting. Adequate soil temperatures are often observed in April but can vary by location and year. Maturity Group IV and indeterminate Group V varieties perform best in April plantings. Research in north Louisiana has shown instances of high yields for Group IV and V planted in mid-to-late March. In these cases, daily average soil temperatures were generally at or above 60 degrees Fahrenheit at planting. A few (especially determinate types) may be sensitive to planting before early May. Narrow row spacing may be beneficial when planting early because of the potential of reduced plant height. Always use a base fungicide seed treatment when planting early and conditions are less than favorable.\r\n\nLate Planting\r\n\nWhen planting is delayed until June 15 or later, the amount of vegetative growth that the plant produces becomes more critical. It is important to choose varieties that grow rapidly in a short time. When blooming starts, most vegetative growth ceases in determinate varieties. When planting late, seeding rates should be increased to compensate for reduced vegetative growth.\r\n\nSeeding Rate\r\n\nPlant populations that are too dense reduce yields, encourage diseases and lodging, and increase seed cost. When calibrating planters, use seed-per-foot as your guide rather than pounds of seed per acre. In the following table, the estimated pounds per acre should be used only to calculate how much seed to buy. Because of varietal difference in seed size, as well as seasonal variation within lots of the same variety, planting rates can be misleading if expressed in pounds per acre. The rates outlined on page 5 of this publication are recommended.\nPlanting Dates\r\n\nBecause weather conditions are different from year to year, seeding dates can be affected by environmental conditions. Early or late planting can cause a reduction in plant height in many varieties. Generally, late plantings have less chance of success unless irrigation is available or optimal weather and timely rains occur throughout the growing season. A general rule is that half a bushel per day is lost for every day that planting is delayed past the first week of June.\r\n\nOptimal seeding dates for each maturity group planted in Louisiana are:\r\n\nRow Spacing\nVarieties respond differently to row spacing. An important consideration is that the canopy closes as quickly as possible to avoid late-season weed problems and to maximize the amount of light captured. Research has shown that narrow row spacing (30 inches or fewer) may outyield wide row spacing in some environments.\n\nDepth of Seeding\n\nPlant only deep enough to get the seed in moist soil. On sandy or silt loam soils, plant 1 inch deep if moisture is available. On clay soils, plant 1 to 2 inches deep, depending on moisture conditions. Rolling the soil, especially clays, after planting will help obtain a standby conserving moisture.\r\n\nThank you!\nHave a question or comment about the information on this page?\n\r\n            Innovate .

Its density, combined with its high protein content and gluten strength, make durum the wheat of choice for producing premium pasta and couscous products. Pasta made from durum is firm with consistent cooking quality. Du-rum kernels are amber colored and larger than those of other wheat classes. Also unique to durum is its yellow endosperm, which gives pasta its golden hue and the best color for couscous.\nWhen durum is milled, the endosperm is ground into a granular product called semolina. A mixture of water and semolina forms a stiff dough. Pasta dough is then forced through dies, or metal discs with holes, to create hundreds of different shapes.\nDurum production is geographically concentrated to the Northern Plains because it demands a special agronomic environment. In most years, the states of North Dakota and Montana produce 90 percent of the U.S. durum crop.\nTable of Contents AVERAGE SHARE OF U.S. DURUM EXPORTS BY PORT (2020-2023) LAKES 45% GULF 49% PNW 6% Montana North Dakota 3 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Overview The 2024 Northern Durum production was 23% higher than last year at 71 million bushels (1.9 MMT). Planted area was 35% higher than last year and average yields reached record levels in North Dakota, but were reduced in Montana due to hot, dry conditions Field conditions were mostly good at planting time with decent moisture. Cool weather at the beginning of the growing season promoted plant growth and yield potential. The latter part of the growing season produced hotter, drier conditions which stressed the crop in western areas. Disease pressure was minimal to non-existent in the major production areas. Harvest was done under mostly dry conditions with few quality issues. Spotty rains in parts of the region did cause some color loss. Growing season weather differed by region, causing greater than typical variance in yields and some crop quality parameters. This year\u2019s crop GRADES a No. 1 Hard Amber Durum with 38% of the crop making that top grade. This crop shows a bit wider grade distribution due to some samples with lower test weight or higher damage. Vitreous kernel content at 83% is higher than last year and the same as the five-year average. Average test weight in this year\u2019s crop trended slightly lower at 60.8 lbs./bu. (79.2 kg/hl). While nearly two-thirds of the crop has test weight of 60 lbs./bu. or higher, there is a larger percent of the crop with some lower test weights due to late season heat and drought stress. Damage, at 0.6% is slightly higher than 2023, but lower than the five-year average. Average moisture of the crop is 12.2%, higher than last year and average due to wetter growing and harvest conditions in some areas of the production region.\nPROTEIN in this year\u2019s crop is notably higher at a 14.3% average, with exceptionally high protein in Montana, where growing conditions were more stressful to the crop. There is still quite a bit of variabil-ity in the protein, with larger percentages of this year\u2019s crop in both the very high and very low ranges. The majority of the crop has protein that is 13.0% or higher. THOUSAND KERNEL WEIGHTS are lower this year at 35.5 grams, versus 40.9 in 2023. Smaller kernels are the result of hot, dry growing conditions in western areas. Falling number values are very sound in this year\u2019s crop with an average 463 seconds. DON levels are once again generally low at <0.5 ppm for a crop average, but a small portion of samples did show above average levels, primarily in the lower production eastern areas. MILLING for the 2024 survey samples was performed on a Quadromat Junior mill, similar to the last five years, and is not indicative of commercial milling performance. Semolina extraction is significantly higher at 60.7%, nearly 5% above the average. Semolina color values are similar to last year and the five-year average with the b-value at 30.0. Ash is higher than last year at 0.68% and speck counts are lower. Protein in the flour average 12.3%, similar to last year. Protein loss in the milling process was slightly higher at 2%, likely due to more of the protein being stored in the bran and some areas of small, thin kernels.\nDOUGH STRENGTH parameters indicated strength very similar to last year and what is typical of an average durum crop. Dry spaghetti evaluations reveal a crop with slightly lower color scores, low-er cooked weight, but improved cooked firmness.\nThe 2024 crop has many positive attributes including high protein, a high grade profile, low damage, sound kernels, high vitreous kernel content, and a crop with good pasta quality performance. As is normal for most crop years, buyers should be aware of variance in all quality parameters, especially grades, test weight and protein, and adjust contract specifications as needed. The performance of the crop is typical of an average Northern Durum crop and should meet buyers\u2019 specifications. 2024 Production Data 2024 2023 2019-23 AVERAGE MILLION BUSHELS Montana 19.8 20.9 19.6 North Dakota 51.5 32.0 28.8 U.S. Total 80.1 59.3 56.1 MILLION METRIC TON Montana 0.54 0.57 0.53 North Dakota 1.40 0.85 0.78 U.S. Total 2.18 1.61 1.53 Source: USDA 2024 Small Grains Summary 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report 4 Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Seasonal Conditions - 2024 0 20 40 60 80 100 Planted 24 5 Yr Avg Planted 23 ND PLANTING PROGRESS Apr 21 Apr 28 May 5 May 12 May 19 June 2 Percent May 26 0 20 40 60 80 100 Harvest 24 5 Yr Avg Harvest 23 ND HARVEST PROGRESS Aug 25 Sept 1 Sept 8 Sept 15 Sept 23 Percent Sept 29 approximate share of regional production A 5% Montana North Dakota B 23% A 42% B 11% C 6% D 13% PLANTING of the Northern Durum crop started well ahead of average due to milder weather and limited snowfall over the winter. While some drier conditions persisted in early spring, mois-ture conditions at planting were much improved from previous years and some spring rain helped improved soil moisture conditions. There were very few planting delays and the majority of the crop was planted by early June. The crop EMERGED under mostly favorable conditions. Early development benefited from pre-cipitation and cooler temperatures and strong yield potential was predicted. As the growing season progressed, precipitation became more limited. Conditions became drier, and combined with hot temperatures, the crop was stressed in portions of western North Dakota and Montana. These condi-tions adversely affected yield potential. Production areas further east saw more adequate moisture which helped maintain overall good yield potential. Disease pressure was low. HARVEST began in early August, ahead of average. Conditions were mostly dry, with minimal delays. There were spotty areas of rainfall at harvest, which did cause some quality impacts, but overall harvest progress was fairly smooth. North Dakota saw good yields, while Montana had lower yields due to hotter, drier growing conditions. Harvest progress was slightly ahead of average and mostly finished by the end of September.\nPRODUCTION of this year\u2019s crop is estimat-ed at 80 million bushels, an increase of over 35% from the previous year due to a sizeable increase in planted acreage and higher yields in eastern production regions.\n5 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Wheat Characteristics WHEAT GRADES as defined by the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) of the USDA Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), reflect the general quality and condition of a representative sample. U.S. grades are based on test weight and include limits on damaged kernels, for-eign material, shrunken and broken kernels, and wheat of contrasting classes. Each determination is made on the basis of the grain when free from dockage and shrunken and broken kernels.\nSUBCLASS is as separate marketing factor based on the number of kernels that are dark, hard and vitreous. For durum wheat, the subclasses are: \u2022 Hard Amber Durum (HAD) \u2013 at least 75 percent or more hard, vitreous kernels; \u2022 Amber Durum (AD) \u2013 between 60 and 74 percent hard, vitreous kernels; \u2022 Durum (D) \u2013 less than 60 percent hard, vitreous kernels.\nU.S. sample grade is wheat that: a. Does not meet the requirements for U.S. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5; or b. Has a musty, sour or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or c. Is heating or of distinctly low quality.\n1. Includes damaged kernels (total), foreign material and shrunk-en and broken kernels.\n2. Unclassed wheat of any grade may contain not more than 10.0 percent of wheat of other classes.\n3. Includes contrasting classes.\n4.

Millers can control spec count by selecting durum that is free of disease and foreign material, thoroughly clean-ing the durum, properly tempering and conditioning the wheat before milling, and by using purifiers to remove small bran particles from the semolina.\nPROTEIN CONTENT in semolina has a high correlation with gluten content and, in turn, mechanical strength and cooking quality. Wet gluten is a quan-titative measure of the gluten forming proteins in semolina that are primarily responsible for its mechanical strength and pasta quality.\n2024 Semolina quality data GLUTOPEAK STATE AND CROP REPORTING AREA SEMOLINA EXTRACTION % ASH % SPECKS NO/10 SQ IN % PROTEIN (14% MOISTURE) % WET GLUTEN % GLUTEN INDEX % PEAK TIME SEC MAX TORQUE BE MONTANA Area A 60.9 0.72 20 13.2 35.0 97 207 48 Area B 55.9 0.72 17 14.1 36.1 84 120 55 State Avg. 2024 56.8 0.72 18 14.0 35.9 86 136 54 State Avg. 2023 50.1 0.67 24 12.9 34.1 88 174 41 NORTH DAKOTA Area A 62.4 0.65 27 11.6 30.2 89 164 43 Area B 63.6 0.72 30 11.2 29.9 90 158 42 Area C 62.3 0.70 35 11.0 27.7 96 141 39 Area D 60.2 0.65 25 12.4 31.3 89 180 44 State Avg. 2024 62.2 0.66 28 11.7 30.1 90 164 43 State Avg. 2023 53.4 0.61 28 12.1 30.7 93 183 41 REGION AVERAGE Avg. 2024 60.7 0.68 25 12.3 31.7 89 156 46 Avg. 2023 52.0 0.63 27 12.4 32.1 91 179 41 Five-Year Avg 55.3 0.63 27 12.6 33.8 77 175 41 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report 10 Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report DRY PASTA PROCESSORS want a finished product that is visually appealing, elastic and strong enough to resist breakage during cutting, packaging, handling and shipping, able to withstand the rigors of cooking, and satisfying to the consumer palate.\nYellow color in semolina and pasta is a traditional, rather than functional, mark of quality. In the early days of the pasta industry, before sophisticated testing evolved, consumers assumed that a yellow pasta was made from durum wheat, which is known to make pasta with superior cooking quality compared to that made from other hard wheats.\nMost consumers prefer pasta that is \u201cal dente,\u201d meaning it has some firmness to the bite. Good quality pasta that is cooked according to package directions should not be sticky or mushy when eaten.\n2024 Semolina & Spaghetti data STATE AND CROP REPORTING AREA SEMOLINA COLOR L (BLACK-WHITE) SEMOLINA COLOR A (GREEN-RED) SEMOLINA COLOR B (BLUE-YELLOW) SPAGHETTI COLOR L (BLACK-WHITE) SPAGHETTI COLOR A (GREEN-RED) SPAGHETTI COLOR B (BLUE-YELLOW) SPAGHETTI COOKED WEIGHT G SPAGHETTI COOKING LOSS % SPAGHETTI COOKED FIRMNESS G CM MONTANA Area A 80.5 -2.7 30.8 50.5 3.7 24.1 30.5 7.1 7.2 Area B 80.8 -2.8 30.3 51.2 3.6 23.4 29.8 6.7 7.6 State Avg. 2024 80.8 -2.8 30.4 51.1 3.6 23.5 29.9 6.8 7.5 State Avg. 2023 83.3 -2.5 30.6 52.9 2.9 25.8 31.8 7.3 4.1 NORTH DAKOTA Area A 81.4 -3.2 30.5 52.3 2.9 24.1 30.2 7.5 6.4 Area B 80.8 -3.1 29.1 52.0 2.8 23.4 30.9 8.2 6.0 Area C 81.2 -3.1 27.4 52.8 2.9 23.1 31.0 6.6 6.0 Area D 81.5 -3.2 29.4 51.9 3.3 24.2 28.8 6.4 6.6 State Avg. 2024 81.3 -3.2 29.9 52.2 3.0 23.9 30.1 7.3 6.3 State Avg. 2023 83.4 -2.6 29.7 53.7 2.9 25.3 31.6 7.4 3.8 REGION AVERAGE Avg. 2024 81.1 -3.1 30.0 51.9 3.1 23.8 30.1 7.2 6.7 Avg. 2023 83.4 -2.5 30.1 53.3 2.9 25.5 31.6 7.3 3.9 Five-Year Avg 83.3 -2.4 30.2 53.3 3.1 25.4 31.4 7.3 4.1 Montana North Dakota 2024 Average cooked firmness by Area A 7.2 (G CM) B 7.6 A 6.4 B 6.0 C 60 D 6.6 11 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report Montana North Dakota U.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report * Semolina color performed on CIE color scale.

North Dakota Grain Inspection service, Devils Lake, ND, provided grades for composite wheat samples representing each crop reporting area.\nVITREOUS KERNELS \u2022 Approximate percentage of kernels having vitreous endosperm, based on weights.\nDOCKAGE \u2022 Official USDA procedure. All matter other than wheat which can be removed readily from a test portion of the original sample by use of an approved device (Carter Dockage Tester). TEST WEIGHT \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists Mothod 55-10.01 approved April 1961, revised October 1999. Measured as pounds per bushel (lb/bu), kilograms per hectoliter (kg/hl) = (lbs/bu X 1.292) + 0.630. Approved Methods of the ANALYSIS \u2022 Half of the total wheat samples col-lected were analyzed for grad and other physical kernel characteristics. The data obtained from the analyses was used to generate frequency distributions as a percentage of the harvested crop. Distribution results may differ from the data presented in the various tables, because the latter are derived from production adjusted averages, rather than simple averages. All samples received in the laboratory were sub-sampled to obtain one composite sample for each of the four areas in North Dakota and one composite each of two areas for Montana. These were analyzed for grade and physical characteristics as well as milling performance and spaghetti processing qualities. Again, all state and regional averages have been adjusted to reflect production as opposed to simple averaging.\nAmerican Association of Cereal Chemists, Cereal Laboratory Methods (10th edition), St. Paul, MN (2000) THOUSAND KERNEL WEIGHT \u2022 Based on 10 gram sample of cleaned wheat (free of foreign material and broken kernels) counted by electronic seed counter.\nKERNEL SIZE DISTRIBUTION \u2022 Determinations made according to the procedure described in Cereal Science Today 5:(3), 71 (1960). Kernels re-maining over a Tyler No. 7 (2.92 mm opening) are classified as \u201clarge;\u201d kernels passing through the top sieve but remaining on a Tyler No. 9 (2.24 mm opening) are classified as \u201cmedium\u201d size kernels. Kernels passing through the second sieve are classed as \u201csmall.\u201d Size is reported as percentage of large, medium, and small kernels.\nPROTEIN \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC) Method: 46-30.01 (Combustion Method), expressed on dry basis and 12 percent moisture basis.\nASH \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists Method 08-01.01, approved April 1961, revised Octo-ber 1999; expressed on a 14 percent moisture basis.\nU.S. Durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Montana North Dakota 15 2024 REGIONAL QUALITY Report DON \u2022 Analysis was done on ground wheat using a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector as described in J. Assoc. Official Anal. Chem 79,472 (1996) FALLING NUMBER \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists Method 56-81.03, approved November 1972, revised September 1999; unites of seconds (14 percent moisture basis).\nMICRO SEDIMENTATION \u2022 Determined as de-scribed by Dick, J.W. and Quick, J.S. Cereal Chem. 60(4):315-318. 1983. WET GLUTEN \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists Method 38-12.01, approved October 1999; expressed on a 14 percent moisture basis determined with the glutomatic instrument.\nGLUTEN INDEX \u2022 American Association of Cereal Chemists Method 38-12-02, approved October 1999; determined with the glutomatic instrument as an indication of gluten strength.\nSemolina EXTRACTION \u2022 Durum tempered to 15.5% moisture and milled on a Brabender Quadrumat Jr mill configured to mill semolina. ASH \u2022 AACC Method 08-01.01, approved April 1961, revised October 1999; expressed on a 14 percent moisture basis.\nPROTEIN \u2022 AACC Method 46-30.01 (combustion method), approved September 1995, revised October 1999, N x 5.7, expressed on a 14 percent moisture basis.\nSPECKS \u2022 The number of specks in semolina was determined on a flat surface under a constant light source, and counting the visible specks (brown and black particles) in three different one-inch square areas. The average of the three readings was converted to the number of specks per 10 square inches.\nGLUTOPEAK \u2022 Glutopeak is a shear-based device that measures the aggregation behavior of gluten. Flour and solvent are mixed at a constant speed with a rotating paddle, resulting in the separation of gluten and aggregation. The gluten aggregate mass exerts a resistance force on the paddle, and creates a torque curve. The curve records the complexity of aggregation and gluten breakdown, measured as Peak Maximum Time (PMT, in seconds), and the Maximum Torque (MT, in Brabender equiva-lents (BE)).\nNDSU laboratory procedure: The semolina sample (8.5 g, 14% mb) was placed in 9.5 g solution of 0.5mol L-1 CaCI2. e temperature at 350C. The mixing paddle was set to rotate at 2,750 rpm and the test was run for 5 min at 35C.\nSpaghetti PROCESSING \u2022 Pasta was made using the laboratory procedure described by Walsh, Ebeling, and Dick, Cereal Sci. Today: 16(11) 385, 1971. A 1-Kg semolina was mixed with the appropriate amount of water that gave a dough consistency of 32 percent total water absorption. The other processing conditions used were: Water temperature, 40 C, extruder shaft speed, 25 rpm and vacuum, 18 in. HG; the dough was pressed through an 84-strand teflon-coated spaghetti die with 0.157 cm openings. The extruded spaghetti samples were dried at high temperature for 12 hrs, using maximum temperature and relative humidity of 73 C and 83 percent, respectively.\nCOLOR \u2022 Color scores were determined by light reflectance (AACC Method 14-22.01, 1983), using a Minolta Color Difference Meter (Model CR 410, Minolta Camera Co., Japan). The scores were generated according to the new color map designed by Debbouz (Pasta J. vol 6, No 6, 1994). A spaghetti sample with a score of 8.0 or higher is considered to have good color.\nCOOKED WEIGHT \u2022 10 g of dry spaghetti were palced in 300 ml boiling distilled water and cooked for 12 min. The cooked and drained spaghetti sample was weighed and the results were reported in grams.\nCOOKING LOSS \u2022 AACC Method 66-50.01. Solids lost to the cooking water. After drying the residue was weighed and reported as percentage of the original dry sample.\nFIRMNESS \u2022 AACC Method 66-50.01 with a Plexiglass tooth attached to a Texture Analyzer (Model TA-XT2, Texture Technology Corp., Scarsdale, New York).\n2024 U.S. durum Wheat Regional Quality Report Funding & Support Provided by: U.S. Wheat Associates North Dakota Wheat Commission Montana Wheat and Barley Committees North Dakota State University Plant Sciences Department"

      "5550 Skylane Blvd. Suite A Santa Rosa, CA 95403-1072 | (707) 576-2220 | https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/northcoast New Regulations for Vineyards to Protect Water Quality Information about the Draft Vineyard Order The North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Water Board) is developing new rules that address the impact vineyards may have on water quality. These rules, called the Draft Vineyard Order, were released for public comment in June 2023. Below are some frequently asked questions about the Draft Vineyard Order: What is the Regional Water Board? The Regional Water Board is part of the California Environmental Protection Agency and protects the quality of our region\u2019s waters (rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, groundwater, and the ocean) for present and future generations. We work with communities and organizations around the region to protect the right to clean water for all needs \u2013 such as drinking, bathing, boating, swimming, farming, manufacturing, and environmental uses. We take enforcement actions against those who violate federal and state environmental regulations. We restore and protect watersheds, rivers and streams that are essential to California fisheries, recreation, wildlife preservation, and the economy. The Regional Water Board covers the coastal region of California from the Oregon border to Marin County. For more information on the Regional Water Board, please visit https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/northcoast/. Why are vineyards being regulated? There are around 65,000 acres of vineyards in the North Coast Region. Over 95% of North Coast vineyards are located within the Navarro River and Russian River watersheds which provide important fish habitat and are impacted by excess sediment and high temperature. During storms, bare soil in vineyards can erode and contribute excess sediment to local rivers, which harms fish. In the absence of on-farm practices, pesticides and fertilizer applied on vineyards can also end up in local waterways and groundwater. The Draft Vineyard Order requires farmers to address stormwater runoff from their vineyards to control sediment and pollutants that can reach streams. The Draft Vineyard Order also includes statewide rules that protect drinking water through domestic well testing and fertilizer management. How would vineyard operators comply with the Order? North Coast Water Quality Control Board Information about the Draft Vineyard Order 2 In response to the new rules, vineyard operators may have to change some farming practices, prevent and minimize sediment discharges from their vineyard, or do water quality testing. The five main elements required of a vineyard operator in the Vineyard Order are: Vineyard operators would enroll in the Order and identify conditions in their vineyards. Under the Order, operators would be required to establish or maintain practices during the winter to prevent erosion in the vineyard and on agricultural roads, repair erosion when it occurs, and maintain existing vegetation around creeks. In some cases, vegetated buffers between creeks and the vineyard would need to be established. Operators would confirm that practices are protecting water quality through farm plans or water quality monitoring. If the practices are not effective, operators would be required to improve their farming practices to prevent pollutants from reaching streams. Operators would be allowed to form coalitions to assist in monitoring and reporting requirements in the Order. These coalitions would assist operators in enrolling, fee collection, and reporting to the Regional Water Board. Operators not in a coalition would be responsible for completing all monitoring and reporting requirements individually. How would water quality be monitored under these new regulations? Operators would be required to measure sediment in stormwater runoff from on-farm drainage pipes and man-made drainage structures. The Vineyard Order also requires that drinking water wells on vineyards be sampled for nitrates, which can leach to groundwater from fertilizer. Operators would be required to notify any drinking water well users if a well is unsafe for drinking due to nitrates. Groups of operators may form a coalition for regional water quality monitoring. Groundwater would be monitored on a regional basis by coalitions who work with Regional Water Board staff to identify monitoring wells that represent the agricultural area. Operators not in a coalition would monitor the groundwater using wells on-farm. Creeks in the watersheds would be monitored in a similar fashion, with coalitions measuring streambed conditions to identify if practices implemented in vineyards are improving fish habitat. Operators not in a coalition would measure their sediment discharge directly from their properties. What information would be reported to the Regional Water Board? Enroll Implement or Maintain On-Farm Practices Monitor Water Quality Report Results Adapt On-Farm Practices North Coast Water Quality Control Board Information about the Draft Vineyard Order 3 Operators would report on-farm practices, fertilizer application, and results of water quality monitoring to the Regional Board. Coalitions may summarize and report this information on behalf of their enrolled members. This information would be used by the Regional Board to confirm whether operators are complying with the Order. Would vineyards certified through sustainability programs be required to enroll? In the North Coast Region, there is widespread enrollment in voluntary sustainability programs such as Fish Friendly Farming, California Certified Sustainable (CCSW), LODI RULES, and Sustainability in Practice (SIP) in which vineyard operators implement on-farm practices to prevent or control erosion. These vineyards would be required to enroll in the Vineyard Order but may use existing certification in a voluntary program for some areas of sediment and erosion control compliance. What would this program cost vineyard operators? The State Water Resources Control Board sets fees for water quality regulations for agriculture. The State fees in 2024 were $1.42 per acre of vineyard for operators who participate in a coalition and $17.73-$35.45 for operators not in a coalition. In addition to State fees, there would be costs associated with maintaining and implementing on-farm practices, conducting water quality monitoring, and developing technical material. Staff estimated the cost for water quality monitoring and reporting to be between $5 to $6 per acre for operators participating in a coalition. When would these rules go into effect? The Regional Water Board plans to consider these regulations for adoption in late 2024. This means that these regulations could go into effect as early as spring 2025. The Draft Vineyard Order proposes a deadline for vineyard operators to enroll by July 2026.

      "Napa Green\u2019s Roundup ban underscores controversy behind Sonoma County\u2019s \u2018certified sustainable\u2019 vineyards\n95% of Sonoma County\u2019s vineyards are certified-sustainable. Here\u2019s why that\u2019s controversial.\nWhen Napa Green announced it would require its members to phase out the herbicide Roundup by 2026, some wondered if the move signaled broader wine industry change.\nThe announcement came last November from the Napa-based nonprofit, which provides sustainable winegrowing certification to vineyards in Napa Valley.\nIn California\u2019s wine industry, Napa Green\u2019s move to phase out Roundup (and glufosinate ammonium by 2028) was seen as a breakthrough.\nWhile the California Certified Organic Farmers, Regenerative Organic Alliance and Demeter Biodynamic all prohibit Roundup across many areas of agriculture, Napa Green is the first sustainability certification designed specifically for U.S. vineyards to regulate the herbicide.\nIn Sonoma County and elsewhere in the state, most winegrowers adhere to the sustainability standards set by the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance, which awards \u201ccertified sustainable\u201d status to those who qualify.\nWhile the alliance limits the use of materials the California Department of Pesticide Regulation and/or U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have deemed \u201crestricted,\u201d they do not limit glyphosate use.\nThat\u2019s made some question the organization\u2019s definition of \u201ccertified sustainable.\u201d\n\u201cThere are no federal regulations for the term \u2018sustainable,\u2019 explained Nellie Praetzel, director of biodiversity at Enterprise Vineyards in Sonoma. \u201cThe Sonoma County Winegrowers boast that 99% of Sonoma County vineyards are certified sustainable, but most are still spraying glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium. I think that\u2019s very misleading to consumers.\u201d\nWhat is Roundup?\nDeveloped for commercial use by Monsanto in the 1970s, glyphosate is a synthetic herbicide and the key ingredient in the weedkiller Roundup.\nToday, it\u2019s the most widely used herbicide in the U.S. and around the world, embraced by the agriculture industry as an effective, low-cost solution to weed control.\nIn recent years, Roundup and glyphosate have come under increased scrutiny about their effects on the environment and human health, including its potential link to non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\nIn the U.S. wine industry, many growers have used synthetic herbicides like Roundup to control weeds in the vineyard, which can compromise vine growth and grape yields by competing for nutrients, water and sunlight.\n\u201cRoundup is theoretically a great product because it\u2019s systemic, so it kills everything it touches and destroys the roots so the weeds don\u2019t come back,\u201d said Jim Pratt, who manages about 350 acres of vineyards in Sonoma County through his company, Cornerstone Vineyards. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t have a problem with Roundup, but the public really turned against it as a possible carcinogen. So we stopped using it a few years ago.\u201d\nIn 2015, the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer cited \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that glyphosate is \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans.\u201d\nDespite the fierce, ongoing debate among scientists, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European Commission maintain glyphosate and Roundup are safe to use. So does Monsanto.\nThat\u2019s persuaded the alliance and other organizations to continue to allow the use of Roundup.\n\u201cU. S. and international agencies continue to find that glyphosate is safe for use,\u201d said Allison Jordan, executive director of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance. \u201cWe rely on these and other experts to provide guidance based on the best available science.\u201d\nOn home turf\nAccording to the California Department of Pesticide Regulation, Sonoma County applied 56,847 pounds of glyphosate in 2022 overall, with 40,691 pounds used exclusively in the region\u2019s 60,000 acres of wine grape vineyards.\nThat\u2019s 47% less than 2014, when 77,754 pounds of glyphosate were applied to wine grapes in Sonoma County.\n\u201cSince the Sonoma County Winegrowers began our pursuit to become the most sustainable winegrowing region in the world, more than 35,000 vineyard acres in Sonoma County were glyphosate-free by 2021,\u201d said Karissa Kruse, president of the Sonoma County Winegrowers. \u201cWe see any additional resources and efforts to support growers \u2014 such as Napa Green\u2019s newly announced commitment \u2014 as a positive step.\u201d\nIn Napa County\u2019s 43,000 vineyard acres, 22,561 pounds of glyphosate were applied in 2022. With Napa Green\u2019s phase out of Roundup, at least 7,000 additional vineyard acres are anticipated to be glyphosate-free by 2026.\nHerbicide alternatives\nWhile both Sonoma and Napa counties have seen a decline in glyphosate use over the past decade, Napa Green reports a rise in alternative herbicides like Lifeline, which also have potential risks.\n\u201cSometimes, a winery will switch to a different herbicide just so they can say they don\u2019t use Roundup,\u201d said Praetzel, the biodiversity director at Enterprise Vineyards. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t tell you is that they\u2019ve switched to another pesticide like glufosinate, which is toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates.\u201d\nEnterprise Vineyards\u2019 owner Phil Coturri, a longtime vintner and pioneer of organic farming in California, said \u201cglyphosate and Roundup are easy targets because they\u2019re in the news all the time.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long a list of other things farmers can use that are just as toxic and deadly,\u201d he said.\nCoturri, who farms about 700 certified-organic vineyard acres in Sonoma and Napa counties, does not support the sustainability certification offered by the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like that they allow Roundup and other steroid inhibitors, and I\u2019ve figured out how to farm without them,\u201d said Cotturi. \u201cI refuse to support that certification. It has to start somewhere, and I think Napa Green is very brave for banning glyphosate.\u201d\nCoturri, who founded Enterprise Vineyards in 1979, said he\u2019s known about organics since \u201cbefore it was a buzzword.\u201d\n\u201cThere were a few times early in my career that I sprayed Roundup until it dawned on me that everything I was spraying was being washed into the San Francisco Bay watershed,\u201d said Coturri. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized my actions could affect millions of people.\u201d\nCoturri acknowledged organic farming is more expensive than traditional farming, but he\u2019s hopeful industrial technology will help farmers find new ways to be more cost-efficient. In the meantime, he\u2019s willing to help others move in the right direction.\n\u201cLet\u2019s share our knowledge, let\u2019s work for the common good, and let\u2019s set an example for the rest of the farming community,\u201d said Coturri. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to convince everyone. But through example you convert more people than you think.\nSam Coturri, Phil\u2019s son and winemaker at Winery Sixteen 600 in Sonoma, admits Roundup is one of his favorite topics to discuss.\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking to customers or wine professionals, Roundup is a touchstone to bring people into the conversation about the importance of organic farming,\u201d said Sam. \u201cIt\u2019s important to talk about the difference it makes in the quality of life for vineyard workers and ultimately the finished wine.\u201d\nAt the end of the day, Sam Coturri said it\u2019s consumers who will drive demand for organic, sustainably farmed wines.\n\u201cConsumers are looking for products that are farmed responsibly,\u201d said Sam. \u201cThe only way to get into their minds and pocketbooks is by showing them the word \u2018sustainable\u2019 isn\u2019t just a word \u2014 there are real actions behind it.\u201d\nYou can reach Staff Writer Sarah Doyle at 707-521-5478 or sarah.doyle@pressdemocrat.com.
