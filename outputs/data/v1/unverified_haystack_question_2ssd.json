But which tech behemoth is better positioned for future growth?\nAmazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) are two of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands and Wall Street\u2019s most coveted stocks, and the long-term trajectory of each blue-chip stock is still decidedly up. Plus, it\u2019s estimated that roughly 40% of all web traffic is hosted by those two companies combined. But which looks like the better buy today, AMZN stock or GOOG stock?\nBoth stocks were beaten down by the growth stock sell-off of 2022. GOOG has suffered less damage from all the selling, down 6% since the start of 2022 vs. AMZN\u2019s 13% loss. Going back a bit further, to just after the March 2020 Covid crash, the performance of both stocks has been far more palatable, with GOOG up 126% in since March 13, 2020, vs. a 63% gain for AMZN. Over the last five years, GOOG is up 156% vs. an 83% gain in AMZN.\nThose are strong returns for GOOG, especially when compared to the 64% return in the S&P 500 in the last five years. Amazon though? Not so much. Now the question is: Can AMZN and GOOG repeat or beat that performance over the next five years?\n[text_ad]\nIt would be foolish to doubt either company at this point. That said, no stock continues to grow at a breakneck pace forever. Just ask anyone who bought General Electric (GE) 10 or 15 years ago, when it ranked among the 10 largest companies in the world by market cap. So chances are, one or both of these blue-chip tech stocks will start to slow in the years ahead.\nGiven that backdrop, I thought it might be a fun exercise to examine which tech giant stock is better positioned for future growth.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at AMZN stock and GOOG stock, broken into a few key numbers:\nTrailing P/Es: AMZN 76, GOOG 26\nForward P/Es: AMZN 42, GOOG 20\nEstimated 2023 revenue growth: AMZN 11%, GOOG 8.2%\nEstimated 2023 EPS growth: AMZN 1,089%, GOOG 51.4%\nCash per share: AMZN $6.21, GOOG $9.58\nInstitutional ownership: AMZN 61%, GOOG 62%\nThat comparison tells us that AMZN is still the more overvalued stock. However, until recently it had been the faster-growing company on both the top and bottom lines; and it had been since 2016. That was also the year Amazon first turned consistently profitable.\nThat said, Google has way more cash than Amazon - nearly double in terms of total cash, with roughly a fifth as much debt. Considering that Amazon brings in nearly twice as much revenue as Google annually (though that gap is closing), that means that Amazon has been way more willing to spend its cash on things that will grow the company - the Amazon Prime Video streaming service that is rivaling Netflix these days; a new foray into live sports with NFL broadcasts; the Amazon Echo, Amazon Web Services, etc. Google looks more like a cash hoarder. The result is that Amazon stock has grown much faster than GOOG stock in the last decade, though that has certainly changed in the last two years.\nThe guess here is that Google will start loosening its purse strings in the coming years, devoting it to new, exciting products like the long-anticipated and recently released Google Pixel Watch intended to rival the Apple Watch, a new Pixel smartphone, or perhaps Google will join Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Disney in the big-money streaming video wars (YouTube did make a splash buying the NFL broadcast rights). Regardless of what it comes up with, bet on Google spending more of its $120 billion cash stockpile soon. If it does, that could capture investors\u2019 attention the way Amazon did up until the last few years.\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with either of these growth stocks. If you bought both of them five, 10 or even 15 years ago, you\u2019ve made a LOT of money. But AMZN has been the better performer, at least up until recently. I think that might change in the years to come. Between its cash stockpile, untapped potential revenue streams, and cheaper valuation, I like GOOG stock to outperform AMZN in the next five years. In fact, that shift already seems to be taking place, as the last few years have shown. It could be the start of a longer-term role reversal between two of the biggest, baddest tech stocks on the block.\nFurthermore, after such extreme selling last year, both these stocks are still trading below their 2021 levels despite a furious run-up to start this year. You could buy both (or either, although I prefer GOOG); either way, an investment in GOOG stock will likely turn out quite well five years from now.\nFor a list of the stocks that actually have momentum after a tough earnings season, consider taking a trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Trader.

    "Document": "Facebook (FB) Market Cap (2014-2024) History\nThis report examines the historical market capitalization of FACEBOOK INC. The analysis covers the period between 2014 and 2024. We have incorporated essential data alongside visual charts depicting quarterly and annual market capitalization figures.\nThe report is organized into three main sections, outlined below for convenient navigation.\nWhile market capitalization significantly differs from a company's book value, this metric holds significant importance. Despite being a theoretical value, market cap helps gauge investor willingness to invest in shares. It reflects investors' confidence in both present and future actions of the organization.\n 1 Chart: FACEBOOK INC Market Capitalization\nTo begin, let's explore a chart displaying the historical market capitalization values of FB. The chart encompasses 30 quarters, spanning from Q1-2015 to Q2-2022.\nPlease Note: The chart below, created using quarterly values, provides a more smoothed-out representation compared to a daily chart.\nTo construct the above graph, we computed the market capitalization using the following formula:\nMarket capitalization for a quarter is determined by multiplying the number of outstanding shares, as reported during the quarter or the preceding quarter (or as disclosed in filings), by the share price on the closing day of the corresponding period. This calculation gives you a snapshot of the company's total market value for that specific timeframe.\nConcerning outstanding shares, we utilized the diluted shares metric. This choice is motivated by the fact that diluted shares encompass not only common shares, but also various convertible instruments (such as bonds, preferred stocks, employee options, etc.) that could potentially be converted into shares in the future. The value for diluted shares can be found in an organization's quarterly and annual filings.\n 2 FB Yearly Market Capitalization\nIn this segment, you'll find a chart depicting the historical market capitalization values of FB plotted by year. The diagram below encompasses 9 years, ranging from 2014 to 2022.\nPlease note that companies usually disclose the weighted average number of diluted shares for each quarter and year. In this section, we've used the weighted number of shares reported in their annual filings (10-K). To calculate market capitalization, we've taken the straightforward approach of multiplying the number of shares by the closing share price for the relevant period.\nDisplayed below is a table presenting annual market capitalization data for FACEBOOK INC. Each row corresponds to a year, with the second column showing the market capitalization value and the third column indicating whether the value has increased or decreased compared to the previous year.\nMarket Capitalization Increase for FB over 9 Years:\nThe market capitalization of FACEBOOK INC has increased by $250.117 Billion (54.615 %) between 2014 and 2024.\nHere are the steps and formula we used to calculate the figure presented above:\nThe formula for calculating the increase/decrease in market capitalization is:\nChange Percentage = [(M2 - M1) / M2] X 100%\nWhere,\nM1 - Market Cap of FB in 2014 = $207.845 Billion\nM2 - Market Cap of FB in 2024 = $457.962 Billion\nSubstituting the values in the formula gives:\nChange in market capitalization of FACEBOOK INC as a percentage =\n(457.962 - 207.845) / 457.962 X 100% = 54.615 %Please Note: A positive sign before the result indicates an increase, and a negative sign indicates a decrease.Insight: Many individuals are keen to understand the growth of share prices (and returns) over the past several years. They believe that analyzing past growth can offer insights into future expected growth. While share price growth is valuable, market cap growth provides additional perspective. This is because market cap growth not only tracks share growth but also reflects the financial health of a company based on the number of issued shares.What Was the Peak Annual Market Capitalization for FACEBOOK INC?FACEBOOK INC achieved its highest market capitalization of $961.625 Billion during 2021.Insight: The market capitalization of a healthy company typically grows over time. Therefore, it's not uncommon for the highest cap value over a 10-year period to occur in recent quarters. However, if you find that the peak value was reached several years ago, it's worth investigating the reasons before making investment decisions.  3 FACEBOOK INC Quarterly Market CapitalizationIn the previous section, you explored a quarterly market cap chart for FACEBOOK INC.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.68%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through August 5, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.68%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through August 5, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024.

    "Summarized_Document": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

This At-a-Glance document is based on the association\u2019s 2024 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update: A Report of US and Global Data From the AHA, which is compiled annually by the AHA, the National Institutes of Health, and other collaborators. The years of data cited were the most recent available for each topic at the time the Update was written. American Heart Association Research \u2022 The AHA uses donations to fund research projects. Research applications are carefully weighed and selected by teams of scientists and healthcare professionals who volunteer for the association. \u2022 Ten investigators received Nobel Prizes for research wholly or partially supported by the AHA. \u2022 The AHA is the largest non-profit, non-governmental funder of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular research in the United States. \u2022 The AHA has funded more than $5 billion in research since 1949. Heart Disease, Stroke, and other Cardiovascular Diseases \u2022 Cardiovascular disease (CVD), listed as the underlying cause of death, accounted for 931,578 deaths in the United States in 2021. \u2022 Heart disease and stroke claimed more lives in 2021 in the United States than all forms of cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined. \u2022 Between 2017 and 2020, 127.9 million US adults (48.6%) had some form of CVD. Between 2019 and 2020, direct and indirect costs of total CVD were $422.3 billion ($254.3 billion in direct costs and $168.0 billion in lost productivity/mortality). \u2022 In 2017 to 2020 in the United States, 59.0% of non-Hispanic Black females and 58.9% of non-Hispanic Black males had some form of CVD.

Sudden Cardiac Arrest \u2022 In 2021, underlying cause sudden cardiac arrest mortality in the United States was 20,114. \u2022 According to 2022 US data, the majority of adult Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrests (OHCA) occur at a home or residence (72.1%). Public settings (17.3%) and nursing homes (10.6%) were the second and third most common locations of adult OHCA. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States.

Bystander witnessed adult arrests had a 14.0% survival to hospital discharge and 9-1-1 responder witnessed arrests had a 17.0% survival to hospital discharge. Heart Disease, Stroke and CVD Risk Factors The AHA gauges the cardiovascular health of the nation by tracking eight key health factors and behaviors that increase risks for heart disease and stroke. These are called \u201cLife\u2019s Essential 8\u201d and the AHA measures them to track progress toward improving cardiovascular health for all Americans. Life\u2019s Essential 8 are: not-smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, healthy body weight, sleep health, and control of cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Here are some key facts related to these factors: Smoking \u2022 Worldwide, tobacco contributed to an estimated 7.43 million deaths in 2021. \u2022 In the United States, smoking was the leading risk factor for years of life lost to premature mortality and the third leading risk factor for years of life lived with disability or injury in 2019. \u2022 A meta-analysis of 23 prospective and 17 case-control studies of cardiovascular risks associated with secondhand smoke exposure demonstrated 18%, 23%, 23%, and 29% increased risks for total mortality, total CVD, CHD, and stroke, respectively, in those exposed to secondhand smoke. \u2022 According to the 2020 Surgeon General\u2019s report on smoking cessation, >480 000 Americans die as a result of cigarette smoking and >41 000 die of secondhand smoke exposure each year, \u22481 in 5 deaths annually. \u2022 In 2022, 16.5% of US high school students and 4.5% of middle school students reported current tobacco product use. Additionally, 2.0% of US high school students and 1.0% of middle school students smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days. In the past 30 days, 14.1% of US high school students and 3.3% of middle school students used e-cigarettes. \u2022 In 2022, 11.5% of US adults reported cigarette use every day or some days (13.1% of males and 10.1% of females). Physical Inactivity \u2022 In 2020, the overall prevalence of meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans for aerobic activity was 24.2% in US adults. \u2022 Among US high school students in 2019, 44.1% were physically active for 60 minutes or more on at least 5 days of the week. Nutrition \u2022 Using the AHA\u2019s Life\u2019s Essential 8 scoring metric, diet was among the 4 metrics with the lowest scores; the range for diet across demographic groups was 23.8 to 47.7 out of 100. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States. Please refer to the complete Statistics Update for references and additional information for reported statistics. \u00a92024 American Heart Association, Inc. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use prohibited. \u2022 Among children 2 to 5 years of age, a mean diet score of 61.1 out of 100 was observed. The score for children 12 to 19 years of age was 28.5 out of 100. \u2022 Using 2019 data, an estimated 7.9 million deaths and 188 million disability-adjusted life years were attributable to dietary risks. The leading dietary risk factors were high sodium intake, low whole grain intake, and low legume intake. Overweight/Obesity \u2022 In the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity among adults from 2017 to 2020 was 41.8% in males and 41.8% in females. \u2022 The age-adjusted prevalence of severe obesity in adults in the United States in 2017 to 2020 was 6.6% in males and 11.7% in females. \u2022 Worldwide, high body mass index was attributed to 3.69 million deaths in 2021, a change of 46.7% compared with 2010. \u2022 According to the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study, age-standardized mortality rates attributable to high body mass index were lowest in high-income Asia Pacific and highest in southern sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, and Oceania. Cholesterol \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 86.4 million, or 34.7% of US adults had total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL or higher. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020 about 24.7 million, or 10.0% of US adults had total cholesterol of 240 mg/dL or higher. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 63.1 million, or 25.5% of US adults had high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (130 mg/dL or higher). \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 41.3 million, or 16.9% of US adults had low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL). \u2022 Globally in 2021 there were 3.72 million deaths attributable to high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a 19.8% change from 2010. Sleep \u2022 Analysis of 2020 data indicates that the proportion of US adults reporting insufficient sleep (<7 hours) was 32.8% (females, 32.2%; males, 33.4%). Prevalence of reporting insufficient sleep was lowest among older adults (>65 years of age) with 27.3% of females and 24.7% of males in this older group reporting <7 hours of sleep per night. \u2022 Based on 2020 data, 43.7% of US adults self-report they wake up feeling well rested on some days or never (46.9% of females; 40.4% of males). \u2022 Based on 2020 data, during the last 30 days, 24.3% of US adults responded that they had trouble falling or staying asleep on most or all days (27.8% female; 20.6% male). 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States.

Unauthorized use prohibited. Diabetes \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, an estimated 29.3 million (10.6%) US adults had diagnosed diabetes. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, an estimated 9.7 million (3.5%) US adults had undiagnosed diabetes. Additionally, 115.9 million (46.4%) US adults had prediabetes. \u2022 In 2021, 103,294 US deaths were attributed to diabetes. \u2022 In 2021, an estimated 1.70 million deaths were attributed to diabetes globally. This represents an age-standardized mortality rate of 19.93 per 100,000. High Blood Pressure (HBP) \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 122.4 million (46.7%) US adults had hypertension. \u2022 In 2021, there were 124,508 US deaths primarily attributable to HBP. \u2022 In 2021, the age-adjusted US death rate primarily attributable to HBP was 31.3 per 100,000.

    "Summarized_Document": "This document provides key statistics about heart disease, stroke, other cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and their risk factors, based on the 2024 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update by the American Heart Association (AHA). The AHA is the largest non-profit funder of cardiovascular research in the US, having funded over $5 billion in research since 1949. In 2021, CVD was the underlying cause of 931,578 deaths in the US, more than cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined. Between 2017 and 2020, 127.9 million US adults (48.6%) had some form of CVD. The direct and indirect costs of CVD in 2019-2020 were $422.3 billion. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was the leading cause of CVD deaths in 2021, accounting for 40.3% of CVD deaths. Stroke accounted for 17.5% of CVD deaths, with 162,890 deaths in 2021. Sudden cardiac arrest caused 20,114 deaths in 2021. The AHA tracks eight key health factors and behaviors, known as Life\u2019s Essential 8, to gauge cardiovascular health: not smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, healthy body weight, sleep health, and control of cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Smoking contributed to 7.43 million deaths worldwide in 2021. In the US, 16.5% of high school students and 4.5% of middle school students reported current tobacco use in 2022. Physical inactivity was prevalent, with only 24.2% of US adults meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines in 2020. Nutrition scores were low, with children aged 2-5 scoring 61.1 out of 100 and those aged 12-19 scoring 28.5 out of 100. Obesity affected 41.8% of US adults from 2017 to 2020. High cholesterol was prevalent, with 34.7% of US adults having total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL or higher. Insufficient sleep was reported by 32.8% of US adults in 2020. Diabetes affected 10.6% of US adults from 2017 to 2020, with 103,294 deaths attributed to diabetes in 2021. High blood pressure affected 46.7% of US adults from 2017 to 2020, with 124,508 deaths in 2021.

Cancellation rates fell to 46% in May and 35% in June as states lifted bans on elective procedures.\nThe data reflected hospitals\u2019 recovery trend. Operating room minutes jumped by 92% in May compared with April, although the metric remained 29% lower than in May 2019, according to the latest data from Kaufman Hall, covering more than 800 hospitals.\nMore recent data examined by Fitch Ratings showed hospital admissions and surgery volumes returned to 89% of pre-COVID levels in states that opened back up following the first wave, Kevin Holloran, a senior director, said in a July 16 call with investors.\n\u201cIt was far more rapid than we expected,\u201d Holloran said.\nA similar volume recovery in elective surgeries was seen in some ambulatory surgery centers, Bill Prentice, CEO of the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association (ASCA), said in an interview.\nSurgimate interpreted its data to mean that after restrictions were lifted following the first COVID-19 wave, surgeons\u2019 volumes were not affected by new state requirements for extensive cleaning regimes before and between procedures.\nBut new infection-control measures are still limiting volumes at some ASCs, Prentice said.\n\u201cThe difference is procedures are taking longer because of more screening, more intense infection control,\u201d Prentice said. Some facilities have extended operating hours and added days to try to compensate.\nThe Surgimate data includes surgeons from recently hard-hit states, albeit fewer than in other states.\nState bans start to mount again\nSome southern and western states affected by the latest spike in COVID-19 cases have sought to reimpose elective surgery restrictions.\nOn July 9, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott banned elective procedures in hospitals in all counties located within 11 designated \u201ctrauma service areas.\u201d Abbott ordered hospitals within those areas to postpone \u201call surgeries and procedures that are not medically necessary to diagnose or correct a serious medical condition of, or to preserve the life of, a patient who without timely performance of the surgery or procedure would be at risk for serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient\u2019s physician,\u201d according to a preceding order on which the new ban was based.\nOn July 10, the Mississippi Department of Health issued an order that certain nonurgent surgeries and procedures be postponed.\nOn July 13, the New Mexico Department of Health issued a public health order that reimposed an April 30 public health order prohibiting nonessential healthcare services, procedures and surgeries.\nIndustry experts see reason for concern\n\u201cLike Texas is starting to pull the throttle back on elective procedures, it feels to me like it is almost inevitable that the other states are going to have to do the same thing,\u201d Holloran said, referring to areas with a resurgence of COVID-19 cases.\nAny effect on surgery volumes in those states could start to appear within the next few weeks.\n\u201cWhile the last 60 days have delivered sound surgical care, it is hard to forecast the future,\u201d Brygel said.\u00a0\nAt this point, August scheduling looks similar to August 2019, Brygel said, even as the number of daily infections reported nationwide has doubled over the last 30 days. Daily new U.S. infections increased from 32,349 on June 22 to 69,641, o n July 24, according to one tracking site.\nThe new state restrictions don\u2019t apply to ASCs, according to Prentice. But those facilities have been affected by shortages and increasing costs of personal protective equipment.\nHolloran said if hospitals\u2019 volumes drop again this year, those organizations will need to look at further cuts to expenses, especially personnel and supply costs.\n\u201cIf the volume hits become more than temporary, which has been the view up until now, and they become more permanent, you\u2019ll see further revenue reductions, you\u2019ll see further expense reductions, and some of those may turn permanent, versus [employee] furlough,\u201d Holloran said.\nRich Daly\nwas a senior editor in HFMA\u2019s Washington, D.C., Office.\nRelated Tags\nAdvertisements\n\n\t\t\t\tHospital finances are on the upswing, but the toll of the Change Healthcare outage is yet to be seen\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tLeveraging the supply chain for cost reduction\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tHow healthcare finance organizations are working to become more resilient\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFTC takes legal action against pharmacy benefit managers, citing a distorted drug-pricing structure\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tReports on healthcare labor trends indicate an improved outlook for hospitals\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMedPAC starts to scrutinize the costs of outpatient coinsurance at critical access hospitals \u00a0\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSign up for The Buzz\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHealthcare finance content, event info and membership offers delivered to your inbox.

By July 20, scheduled surgeries for about 1,500 surgeons reached about the same number that were scheduled in January, before the pandemic, according to data provided to HFMA by surgical scheduling company Surgimate.\n\n\u201cWhile we often hear that patients may be skeptical, keep in mind that there was a tremendous April and May backlog to work through,\u201d Rebecca Brygel, CEO of Surgimate, a scheduling company for physician-owned practices, said in a written statement. \u201cEither way, a good portion of patients who require surgical intervention are able to receive the care they need in most areas.\u201d\n\nSurgery cancellation and rescheduling rates fell from 88% in April to pre-COVID-type rates of about 28% in late July. Cancellation rates fell to 46% in May and 35% in June as states lifted bans on elective procedures.\n\nThe data reflected hospitals\u2019 recovery trend. Operating room minutes jumped by 92% in May compared with April, although the metric remained 29% lower than in May 2019, according to the latest data from Kaufman Hall, covering more than 800 hospitals.\n\nMore recent data examined by Fitch Ratings showed hospital admissions and surgery volumes returned to 89% of pre-COVID levels in states that opened back up following the first wave, Kevin Holloran, a senior director, said in a July 16 call with investors. \u201cIt was far more rapid than we expected,\u201d Holloran said.\n\nA similar volume recovery in elective surgeries was seen in some ambulatory surgery centers, Bill Prentice, CEO of the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association (ASCA), said in an interview. Surgimate interpreted its data to mean that after restrictions were lifted following the first COVID-19 wave, surgeons\u2019 volumes were not affected by new state requirements for extensive cleaning regimes before and between procedures. But new infection-control measures are still limiting volumes at some ASCs, Prentice said.\n\n\u201cThe difference is procedures are taking longer because of more screening, more intense infection control,\u201d Prentice said. Some facilities have extended operating hours and added days to try to compensate. The Surgimate data includes surgeons from recently hard-hit states, albeit fewer than in other states.\n\nState bans start to mount again\n\nSome southern and western states affected by the latest spike in COVID-19 cases have sought to reimpose elective surgery restrictions. On July 9, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott banned elective procedures in hospitals in all counties located within 11 designated \u201ctrauma service areas.\u201d Abbott ordered hospitals within those areas to postpone \u201call surgeries and procedures that are not medically necessary to diagnose or correct a serious medical condition of, or to preserve the life of, a patient who without timely performance of the surgery or procedure would be at risk for serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient\u2019s physician,\u201d according to a preceding order on which the new ban was based.\n\nOn July 10, the Mississippi Department of Health issued an order that certain nonurgent surgeries and procedures be postponed. On July 13, the New Mexico Department of Health issued a public health order that reimposed an April 30 public health order prohibiting nonessential healthcare services, procedures and surgeries.\n\nIndustry experts see reason for concern\n\n\u201cLike Texas is starting to pull the throttle back on elective procedures, it feels to me like it is almost inevitable that the other states are going to have to do the same thing,\u201d Holloran said, referring to areas with a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. Any effect on surgery volumes in those states could start to appear within the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cWhile the last 60 days have delivered sound surgical care, it is hard to forecast the future,\u201d Brygel said. At this point, August scheduling looks similar to August 2019, Brygel said, even as the number of daily infections reported nationwide has doubled over the last 30 days. Daily new U.S. infections increased from 32,349 on June 22 to 69,641 on July 24, according to one tracking site.\n\nThe new state restrictions don\u2019t apply to ASCs, according to Prentice. But those facilities have been affected by shortages and increasing costs of personal protective equipment. Holloran said if hospitals\u2019 volumes drop again this year, those organizations will need to look at further cuts to expenses, especially personnel and supply costs. \u201cIf the volume hits become more than temporary, which has been the view up until now, and they become more permanent, you\u2019ll see further revenue reductions, you\u2019ll see further expense reductions, and some of those may turn permanent, versus [employee] furlough,\u201d Holloran said.",

There was a maximum 45.4% reduction in admissions in 2020, associated with a 27.7% reduction in hospital charges, with significant reductions in all examined diagnoses except for birth.\nMeaning\nIn this study, inpatient pediatric admissions in 2020 were reduced across a heterogeneous range of diagnoses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAbstract\nImportance\nIn early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear.\nObjective\nTo determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nNumber of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter.\nResults\nOf 5\u2009424\u2009688 inpatient encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2\u2009823\u2009748 [52.1%] boys; 3\u2009171\u2009224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213\u2009571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43\u2009550 [42\u2009110-43\u2009946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 [$5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$6\u2009324\u2009978\u2009456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020.\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States in January 2020.1 In response, the United States declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, expanded airport screenings, required quarantines for travelers, and undertook public information efforts.2,3 Case counts and fatalities increased slowly in January and February 2020 before achieving exponential growth in March 2020.4 Individual states began additional mitigation strategies in the spring, including stay-at-home orders, which took effect from early March through June 2020.5,6 These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality.6,7 Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for the use of face coverings on April 3, 2020, although enforcement varied by state.3,8 Although COVID-19 has resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations,1,9,10 early reports indicate that it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the United States11 and worldwide.12,13 A 2020 study from Brazil,14 in which regional differences contributed to peak bronchiolitis between February and August, showed a 78% to 85% reduction in hospitalization in infants younger than 1 year for acute bronchiolitis in 2020 compared with previous years.\nMany pediatric diagnoses warranting inpatient admission exhibit seasonal variation; prior work has characterized winter predominance in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 and Kawasaki syndrome18; autumn predominance in asthma16,19,20; and summer predominance in trauma.21 These fluctuations in disease pattern are likely influenced by population susceptibility and behavior as well as various environmental factors. However, to our knowledge, the seasonal patterns in other pediatric admissions remain unexplored. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database22 to determine the seasonal patterns of a variety of common pediatric admission diagnoses and compare data from the previous decade with 2020 admissions. Given the changes in population behavior in 2020,6,7 we hypothesized that pediatric admissions for a variety of diagnoses would be decreased in 2020 compared with prior years, except for admissions for birth.23,24\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 51 children\u2019s hospitals across the United States participating in PHIS, an online, quality-controlled, anonymized, administrative database maintained by the Children\u2019s Hospital Association.22,25 To ensure that changes in admission rates over time were reflective of changes in caseload, rather than expansion of the database by inclusion of new hospitals, the present study was limited to the 49 hospitals that have been providing data since 2010. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were no exclusion criteria. Patients were filtered according to their primary admission diagnoses based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 codes, depending on whether their admission was before or after October 1, 2015. Selected diagnoses were determined according to the percentage of total admissions in PHIS, disease pathophysiology, and seasonal distribution between 2010 and 2019. The full list of included ICD codes for each diagnosis group is included in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. This study was granted exemption by the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board; because the data were anonymous, informed consent could not be obtained. This manuscript follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies.26\nStatistical Analysis\nEncounter-level clinical and administrative data were extracted from PHIS (admission and discharge dates, age, sex, race, ethnicity, diagnostic codes, insurance status, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, complex chronic conditions,27 mechanical ventilation, abstracted charges, and cost). Admissions were described with summary statistics. Hospital charges were adjusted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index according to hospital zip code in PHIS.22 Charge-over-time analyses were adjusted for the quarterly gross domestic product, provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and expressed in quarter 1, 2010, dollars.28 Admission dates were grouped into month and year. Admission numbers were transformed into time series, databased on date of admission, and displayed graphically. Seasonality testing was performed with the Webel and Ollech method.29 Seasonal trends in admission rates between 2010 and 2019 were displayed with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. For visual comparison, the number of admissions in 2020 was displayed against the aforementioned models. For each diagnosis group, ensemble machine-learning forecasting models were created with autoregressive integrated moving average,30 neural network,31 and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms,32 each weighted on time-series cross-validation.33 Time-series data were arranged such that each model was trained on data from January 1, 2010, until June 30, 2019. Model forecasts were tested against actual admission numbers from July 1, 2019, until June 30, 2020. Model predictions were assessed with mean absolute percentage error,33 and the error rates for July 2019 to December 2019 were compared against those for January 2020 to June 2020. To quantify whether social distancing had a statistically significant association with pediatric admission rates, the actual admission rate in 2019 vs 2020 was compared against the ensemble algorithm\u2019s 95% CI.33 We conducted 2 exploratory analyses by repeating the aforementioned steps for patients with any diagnostic code for acute respiratory failure and for in-hospital mortality. All statistical analyses were performed with R Studio version 1.3.1073 and R versions 4.0.2 and 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing) with the following packages: Metrics, forecastHybrid, thief, forecast, cowplot, lubridate, forcats, stringr, dplyr, purrr, readr, tidyr, tibble, ggplot2, and tidyverse.34 An \u03b1 value of .05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance, and all tests were 2-tailed. The code used to create the manuscript is publicly available.35\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nThere were 49 hospitals with admission data in PHIS between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients beginning in 2010, of which 213\u2009571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. As shown in the Table, the cohort had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 5.1 (0.7-13.3) years and included 2\u2009823\u2009748 (52.1%) boys, 3\u2009171\u2009224 (58.5%) White individuals, 994\u2009915 (18.3%) Black individuals, and 1\u2009111\u2009025 (20.5%) Hispanic individuals. A total of 2\u2009977\u2009372 patients (54.9%) had government insurance, and 2\u2009481\u2009647 (45.7%) had a preexisting complex chronic condition. As shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement, the median (IQR) length of stay was 3 (2-5) days. A total of 186\u2009238 admissions (3.4%) had a length of stay of 30 days or more. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2% (5\u2009380\u2009125 encounters). There were 16 selected diagnoses, encompassing 1\u2009446\u2009376 encounters (26.7%). The number of encounters for each selected diagnosis is shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement; birth, bronchiolitis, and trauma were the most common diagnoses.\nTable. \nAbbreviations: CMS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; ECMO, extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; PHIS, Pediatric Health Information Systems.\nSeasonal Patterns in PHIS Admissions\nOverall admissions in PHIS between 2010 and 2019 are shown in Figure 1. There was an increase in the total number of admissions in winter months compared with summer months between 2010 and 2019. There were significantly fewer admissions in July vs January in 2010 to 2019 (median [IQR], 40\u2009726 [40\u2009063-41\u2009839] vs 47\u2009116 [45\u2009472-48\u2009298]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). As shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement, there was a significantly lower median (IQR) number of intensive care unit admissions and admissions requiring mechanical ventilation in July vs January 2010 to 2019 (7097 [6754-7483] vs 8002 [7222-8501]; P\u2009=\u2009.04 and 4140 [3962-4234] vs 4525 [4213-4776]; P\u2009=\u2009.02, respectively). There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23\u2009798 compared with a median (IQR) of 43\u2009550 (42\u2009110-43\u2009946) in April 2010 to 2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years, with 26\u2009089 in June 2020 compared with a median (IQR) of 40\u2009824 (40\u2009302-41\u2009583) in June 2010 to 2019.\nA, Number of monthly admissions in Pediatric Health Information Systems between January 2010 and June 2020, represented as a bar chart. B, Number of monthly admissions between January 2010 and June 2020 represented as a line chart. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nAdmissions by diagnoses are shown in Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. Several distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Because bronchiolitis coding changed in ICD-10 to include separate diagnostic codes for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, the seasonality of individual pathogens is shown in eFigure 4 in the Supplement for 2016 to 2019. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance, associated with the school-year calendar. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance, inversely associated with the school-year calendar in children aged 5 years and older, as shown in eFigure 5 in the Supplement. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. In the case of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, summer predominance was associated with admissions in children older than 1 year, as shown in eFigure 6 in the Supplement. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\nEach panel shows the number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (denoted in red). Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected. Changes in seasonal patterns identified with ensemble time-series forecasting models are shown in Figure 3 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement. Overall, models accurately predicted admission rates from July until December 2019 but not from January to June 2020 (mean absolute percentage error range, 3% to 21.2% vs 8.5% to 1111.7%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.06). A total of 70 of 72 monthly admission (97.2%) rates between July and December 2019 fell within the 95% CI of the models. The admission rates for atrial septal defect and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were below the 95% CI predicted by the models in August and December 2019, respectively. All other conditions remained within the model 95% CIs between July and December 2019. Admissions for birth remained within the model 95% CI between January and June 2020. Every other condition decreased below the model 95% CI between January and June 2020.\nEach panel shows the estimated number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020, according to ensemble forecasting models including autoregressive integrated moving average, neural network, and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms weighted on time-series cross-validation. All models were trained on data from January 2010 through June 2019, and the testing window for each model is shown. The blue line is the model estimate, and the dark and light blue shaded regions are the model 80% and 95% CIs, respectively. The red line is the actual number of admissions for each month. The vertical line represents January 2020. MAPE indicates mean absolute percentage error.\nHospital Charges\nOverall, 5\u2009377\u2009745 of 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters (99.1%) among 3\u2009356\u2009656 patients had hospital charge data available. The quarterly total hospital charges, adjusted for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index and quarterly gross domestic product, are shown in eFigure 8 in the Supplement. The per-admission charges with the same adjustments are shown in eFigure 9 in the Supplement. The total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6\u2009024\u2009735\u2009078 compared with a median (IQR) of $6\u2009229\u2009556\u2009859 ($5\u2009951\u2009083\u2009755-$6\u2009551\u2009134\u2009282) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 compared with a median (IQR) of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 ($5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$5\u2009991\u2009085\u2009056) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. However, the median (IQR) per-admission charge in 2020 was $24\u2009358 ($12\u2009631-$51\u2009740) compared with a median (IQR) of $20\u2009352 ($10\u2009781-$43\u2009604) in 2010 to 2019 (P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nExploratory Analyses\nDiagnoses including any cause of acute respiratory failure displayed significant winter predominance. In-hospital mortality did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation. Seasonal trends and machine-learning models for respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality are shown in eFigure 10 in the Supplement. There were annual increases in admissions for acute respiratory failure from 2010 through February 2020, with a decline in spring 2020. There were 3517 admissions for acute respiratory failure in December 2019 compared with 2143 admissions in December 2018, and 2894 in January 2020 compared with 2050 in January 2019. Acute respiratory failure decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in April 2020. There were no significant changes in admissions with in-hospital mortality between 2010 and 2019. Admissions with in-hospital mortality decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in March 2020.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to use a large database to model pediatric admission volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic for various diagnoses compared with prior years. Using this approach, we identified seasonal patterns in a diverse group of pediatric conditions. Before 2020, pediatric admissions overall displayed winter predominance, associated with an increase in infectious respiratory conditions, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Summer-predominant conditions included trauma and admissions for semielective surgical conditions (eg, atrial septal defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children aged >1 year). The present study is in agreement with several prior studies documenting seasonality in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 asthma,16,19,20 Kawasaki syndrome,18 and trauma.21 However, we additionally noted novel seasonality for diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health admissions and the absence of seasonality in admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta. The seasonality of diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with children aged 5 years or older and may be reflective of the efforts of the American Diabetes Association to incorporate school personnel in the diabetes medical management plans for these patients.36\nAlthough COVID-19 has resulted in few pediatric admissions and mortalities compared with those for adults,1,9,10 the present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 vs a median of 43\u2009550 in April 2010-2019). Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. There was a premature termination of winter-predominant conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia and a reduction in admissions for asthma in 2020 compared with previous years. In exploratory analyses, this was coupled with a decrease in all acute respiratory failure diagnoses. Given the infectious nature of these conditions and their spread by respiratory droplets,37,38,39 this may have been associated with the effects of social distancing and possibly was even fortunate, given evidence of a potentially severe respiratory virus season in 2019 to 2020, with the highest number of respiratory failure admissions recorded in the past decade. A recent Australian study corroborates our findings, with more than 95% reduction in respiratory syncytial virus and influenza detection in Western Australia through winter 2020.40 Taken together, these studies suggest that rates of infectious pediatric respiratory conditions are potentially modifiable by changes in human behavior. Similarly, pediatric trauma admissions are often sports related,41 and the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with decreased childhood physical activity; thus, reductions in trauma admissions were anticipated.42 However, reductions in mental health admissions are surprising, given limited literature suggesting that pandemic-related stressors may worsen mental health in both the general population and those with preexisting psychiatric conditions.43,44 This may represent an opportunity for changes in the delivery of mental health care.45\nThe present study cannot delineate which changes in admission rates represent decreases in incidence, hospital avoidance, or unmet care needs. One inpatient survey suggested that greater than one-third of parents delayed seeking medical care for their child because of fears surrounding COVID-19,46 and case series have reported delayed presentations leading to harm.47,48 Similarly, although admissions for repair of atrial septal defects or later-stage repairs of hypoplastic left heart syndrome may safely be deferred for a short period, it is unclear whether reductions in admission rates represent purely elective surgical delays or the possibility of decreased recognition of congenital heart disease because of decreased contact with health care; small case series of increases in sudden death in adults with congenital heart disease without contact with health care institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported.49 Taken together, these findings are worrisome, although not definitive, in that unmet health care needs may be accumulating in the pediatric population as a result of decreased health care interactions.\nReduced patient volumes during early 2020 have reportedly contributed to financial instability for many hospitals and health systems.50 The reduction in charges observed in the present study suggests a proportionate decline in operating income. Although children\u2019s hospitals generally maintain better operating margins compared with other nonprofit hospitals, the 45.4% reduction in inpatient admissions at children\u2019s hospitals observed during the first 6 months of 2020 and 27.7% reduction in charges observed in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years has an influence on financial security.50,51 Leaders of children\u2019s hospitals could face unique challenges in the coming months as patient volumes eventually recover and are potentially coupled with the destabilizing financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCharacterizing alterations in usual patient admission patterns aids in anticipating the potential ramifications of recent national policies and can also help in crafting responses in a variety of areas. The present study highlights the strengths of an ensemble machine-learning approach to model complex time-series data displaying a variety of seasonal relationships. As complexity in medical information has increased, there has been progressive interest in the application of machine learning to facilitate clinical decision-making. Such algorithms have been studied in a diverse array of applications, including sepsis prediction,52 COVID-19 prognosis,53 population health,54 and cyberbullying.55 In the present study, before the COVID-19 pandemic,6,7 ensemble time-series forecasting models accurately predicted 70 of 72 monthly pediatric admission rates (97.2%) between July 2019 and December 2019. Quantification of the seasonality of various admission types in pediatrics has applicability for hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator capacity planning as well as trainee education. According to the present study, pediatricians and trainees assigned to inpatient wards in the winter will experience higher-than-average case burden and gain greater experience in managing pneumonia and bronchiolitis, whereas those assigned to emergency departments in the summer will achieve greater experience in the management of pediatric trauma. Such knowledge can be harnessed in the development of training curricula that support experience across the spectrum of pediatric illness.\nLimitations\nThis study has important limitations. As with any retrospective database analysis, admission diagnoses are vulnerable to misclassification owing to coding error. Although including greater than 5\u2009000\u2009000 inpatient encounters, this study is limited to 49 hospitals that consistently provided data to PHIS between January 2010 and June 2020 and may not be representative of national pediatric admission trends. Because of data availability, data from some admissions from late June 2020 are not yet available. This may have resulted in undercounting of admissions from June. However, hospitalizations for birth did not decrease below the 95% CIs for the forecasting model. It is also possible that some hospitals have been delayed in reporting admissions to PHIS because of the pandemic, although this is not a known data quality issue. Owing to data availability, only admissions between January and June 2020 were analyzed regarding the effects of social distancing. Further study is warranted as additional data become available.\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. These trends were effectively modeled with ensemble time-series forecasting algorithms. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotes\neFigure 1.

    "Summarized_Document": "Trends in US Pediatric Hospital Admissions in 2020 Compared With the Decade Before the COVID-19 Pandemic\nJonathan H. Pelletier, Jaskaran Rakkar, Alicia K. Au, Dana Fuhrman, Robert S. B. Clark, Christopher M. Horvat\nUPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nAccepted for Publication: December 21, 2020. Published: February 12, 2021. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37227\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\n\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the US in January 2020. In response, the US declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, and implemented various social distancing measures. These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality. Although COVID-19 resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations, early reports indicate it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the US and worldwide.\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 49 children\u2019s hospitals across the US participating in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database. Patients were eligible if discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. Statistical analyses were performed using R Studio and R Project for Statistical Computing.\n\nResults\nThere were 5,424,688 encounters among 3,372,839 patients, of which 213,571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The cohort had a median age of 5.1 years and included 52.1% boys, 58.5% White individuals, 18.3% Black individuals, and 20.5% Hispanic individuals. A total of 54.9% had government insurance, and 45.7% had a preexisting complex chronic condition. The median length of stay was 3 days. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2%. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23,798 compared with a median of 43,550 in April 2010-2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years.\n\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nSeveral distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\n\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020. Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected.\n\nHospital Charges\nThe total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6,024,735,078 compared with a median of $6,229,556,859 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4,327,580,511 compared with a median of $5,983,142,102 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. The median per-admission charge in 2020 was $24,358 compared with a median of $20,352 in 2010 to 2019.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years. Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

There was a maximum 45.4% reduction in admissions in 2020, associated with a 27.7% reduction in hospital charges, with significant reductions in all examined diagnoses except for birth.\nMeaning\nIn this study, inpatient pediatric admissions in 2020 were reduced across a heterogeneous range of diagnoses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAbstract\nImportance\nIn early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear.\nObjective\nTo determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nNumber of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter.\nResults\nOf 5\u2009424\u2009688 inpatient encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2\u2009823\u2009748 [52.1%] boys; 3\u2009171\u2009224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213\u2009571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43\u2009550 [42\u2009110-43\u2009946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 [$5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$6\u2009324\u2009978\u2009456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020.\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States in January 2020.1 In response, the United States declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, expanded airport screenings, required quarantines for travelers, and undertook public information efforts.2,3 Case counts and fatalities increased slowly in January and February 2020 before achieving exponential growth in March 2020.4 Individual states began additional mitigation strategies in the spring, including stay-at-home orders, which took effect from early March through June 2020.5,6 These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality.6,7 Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for the use of face coverings on April 3, 2020, although enforcement varied by state.3,8 Although COVID-19 has resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations,1,9,10 early reports indicate that it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the United States11 and worldwide.12,13 A 2020 study from Brazil,14 in which regional differences contributed to peak bronchiolitis between February and August, showed a 78% to 85% reduction in hospitalization in infants younger than 1 year for acute bronchiolitis in 2020 compared with previous years.\nMany pediatric diagnoses warranting inpatient admission exhibit seasonal variation; prior work has characterized winter predominance in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 and Kawasaki syndrome18; autumn predominance in asthma16,19,20; and summer predominance in trauma.21 These fluctuations in disease pattern are likely influenced by population susceptibility and behavior as well as various environmental factors. However, to our knowledge, the seasonal patterns in other pediatric admissions remain unexplored. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database22 to determine the seasonal patterns of a variety of common pediatric admission diagnoses and compare data from the previous decade with 2020 admissions. Given the changes in population behavior in 2020,6,7 we hypothesized that pediatric admissions for a variety of diagnoses would be decreased in 2020 compared with prior years, except for admissions for birth.23,24\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 51 children\u2019s hospitals across the United States participating in PHIS, an online, quality-controlled, anonymized, administrative database maintained by the Children\u2019s Hospital Association.22,25 To ensure that changes in admission rates over time were reflective of changes in caseload, rather than expansion of the database by inclusion of new hospitals, the present study was limited to the 49 hospitals that have been providing data since 2010. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were no exclusion criteria. Patients were filtered according to their primary admission diagnoses based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 codes, depending on whether their admission was before or after October 1, 2015. Selected diagnoses were determined according to the percentage of total admissions in PHIS, disease pathophysiology, and seasonal distribution between 2010 and 2019. The full list of included ICD codes for each diagnosis group is included in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. This study was granted exemption by the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board; because the data were anonymous, informed consent could not be obtained. This manuscript follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies.26\nStatistical Analysis\nEncounter-level clinical and administrative data were extracted from PHIS (admission and discharge dates, age, sex, race, ethnicity, diagnostic codes, insurance status, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, complex chronic conditions,27 mechanical ventilation, abstracted charges, and cost). Admissions were described with summary statistics. Hospital charges were adjusted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index according to hospital zip code in PHIS.22 Charge-over-time analyses were adjusted for the quarterly gross domestic product, provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and expressed in quarter 1, 2010, dollars.28 Admission dates were grouped into month and year. Admission numbers were transformed into time series, databased on date of admission, and displayed graphically. Seasonality testing was performed with the Webel and Ollech method.29 Seasonal trends in admission rates between 2010 and 2019 were displayed with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. For visual comparison, the number of admissions in 2020 was displayed against the aforementioned models. For each diagnosis group, ensemble machine-learning forecasting models were created with autoregressive integrated moving average,30 neural network,31 and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms,32 each weighted on time-series cross-validation.33 Time-series data were arranged such that each model was trained on data from January 1, 2010, until June 30, 2019. Model forecasts were tested against actual admission numbers from July 1, 2019, until June 30, 2020. Model predictions were assessed with mean absolute percentage error,33 and the error rates for July 2019 to December 2019 were compared against those for January 2020 to June 2020. To quantify whether social distancing had a statistically significant association with pediatric admission rates, the actual admission rate in 2019 vs 2020 was compared against the ensemble algorithm\u2019s 95% CI.33 We conducted 2 exploratory analyses by repeating the aforementioned steps for patients with any diagnostic code for acute respiratory failure and for in-hospital mortality. All statistical analyses were performed with R Studio version 1.3.1073 and R versions 4.0.2 and 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing) with the following packages: Metrics, forecastHybrid, thief, forecast, cowplot, lubridate, forcats, stringr, dplyr, purrr, readr, tidyr, tibble, ggplot2, and tidyverse.34 An \u03b1 value of .05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance, and all tests were 2-tailed. The code used to create the manuscript is publicly available.35\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nThere were 49 hospitals with admission data in PHIS between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients beginning in 2010, of which 213\u2009571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. As shown in the Table, the cohort had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 5.1 (0.7-13.3) years and included 2\u2009823\u2009748 (52.1%) boys, 3\u2009171\u2009224 (58.5%) White individuals, 994\u2009915 (18.3%) Black individuals, and 1\u2009111\u2009025 (20.5%) Hispanic individuals. A total of 2\u2009977\u2009372 patients (54.9%) had government insurance, and 2\u2009481\u2009647 (45.7%) had a preexisting complex chronic condition. As shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement, the median (IQR) length of stay was 3 (2-5) days. A total of 186\u2009238 admissions (3.4%) had a length of stay of 30 days or more. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2% (5\u2009380\u2009125 encounters). There were 16 selected diagnoses, encompassing 1\u2009446\u2009376 encounters (26.7%). The number of encounters for each selected diagnosis is shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement; birth, bronchiolitis, and trauma were the most common diagnoses.\nTable. \nAbbreviations: CMS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; ECMO, extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; PHIS, Pediatric Health Information Systems.\nSeasonal Patterns in PHIS Admissions\nOverall admissions in PHIS between 2010 and 2019 are shown in Figure 1. There was an increase in the total number of admissions in winter months compared with summer months between 2010 and 2019. There were significantly fewer admissions in July vs January in 2010 to 2019 (median [IQR], 40\u2009726 [40\u2009063-41\u2009839] vs 47\u2009116 [45\u2009472-48\u2009298]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). As shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement, there was a significantly lower median (IQR) number of intensive care unit admissions and admissions requiring mechanical ventilation in July vs January 2010 to 2019 (7097 [6754-7483] vs 8002 [7222-8501]; P\u2009=\u2009.04 and 4140 [3962-4234] vs 4525 [4213-4776]; P\u2009=\u2009.02, respectively). There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23\u2009798 compared with a median (IQR) of 43\u2009550 (42\u2009110-43\u2009946) in April 2010 to 2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years, with 26\u2009089 in June 2020 compared with a median (IQR) of 40\u2009824 (40\u2009302-41\u2009583) in June 2010 to 2019.\nA, Number of monthly admissions in Pediatric Health Information Systems between January 2010 and June 2020, represented as a bar chart. B, Number of monthly admissions between January 2010 and June 2020 represented as a line chart. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nAdmissions by diagnoses are shown in Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. Several distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Because bronchiolitis coding changed in ICD-10 to include separate diagnostic codes for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, the seasonality of individual pathogens is shown in eFigure 4 in the Supplement for 2016 to 2019. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance, associated with the school-year calendar. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance, inversely associated with the school-year calendar in children aged 5 years and older, as shown in eFigure 5 in the Supplement. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. In the case of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, summer predominance was associated with admissions in children older than 1 year, as shown in eFigure 6 in the Supplement. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\nEach panel shows the number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (denoted in red). Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected. Changes in seasonal patterns identified with ensemble time-series forecasting models are shown in Figure 3 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement. Overall, models accurately predicted admission rates from July until December 2019 but not from January to June 2020 (mean absolute percentage error range, 3% to 21.2% vs 8.5% to 1111.7%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.06). A total of 70 of 72 monthly admission (97.2%) rates between July and December 2019 fell within the 95% CI of the models. The admission rates for atrial septal defect and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were below the 95% CI predicted by the models in August and December 2019, respectively. All other conditions remained within the model 95% CIs between July and December 2019. Admissions for birth remained within the model 95% CI between January and June 2020. Every other condition decreased below the model 95% CI between January and June 2020.\nEach panel shows the estimated number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020, according to ensemble forecasting models including autoregressive integrated moving average, neural network, and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms weighted on time-series cross-validation. All models were trained on data from January 2010 through June 2019, and the testing window for each model is shown. The blue line is the model estimate, and the dark and light blue shaded regions are the model 80% and 95% CIs, respectively. The red line is the actual number of admissions for each month. The vertical line represents January 2020. MAPE indicates mean absolute percentage error.\nHospital Charges\nOverall, 5\u2009377\u2009745 of 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters (99.1%) among 3\u2009356\u2009656 patients had hospital charge data available. The quarterly total hospital charges, adjusted for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index and quarterly gross domestic product, are shown in eFigure 8 in the Supplement. The per-admission charges with the same adjustments are shown in eFigure 9 in the Supplement. The total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6\u2009024\u2009735\u2009078 compared with a median (IQR) of $6\u2009229\u2009556\u2009859 ($5\u2009951\u2009083\u2009755-$6\u2009551\u2009134\u2009282) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 compared with a median (IQR) of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 ($5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$5\u2009991\u2009085\u2009056) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. However, the median (IQR) per-admission charge in 2020 was $24\u2009358 ($12\u2009631-$51\u2009740) compared with a median (IQR) of $20\u2009352 ($10\u2009781-$43\u2009604) in 2010 to 2019 (P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nExploratory Analyses\nDiagnoses including any cause of acute respiratory failure displayed significant winter predominance. In-hospital mortality did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation. Seasonal trends and machine-learning models for respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality are shown in eFigure 10 in the Supplement. There were annual increases in admissions for acute respiratory failure from 2010 through February 2020, with a decline in spring 2020. There were 3517 admissions for acute respiratory failure in December 2019 compared with 2143 admissions in December 2018, and 2894 in January 2020 compared with 2050 in January 2019. Acute respiratory failure decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in April 2020. There were no significant changes in admissions with in-hospital mortality between 2010 and 2019. Admissions with in-hospital mortality decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in March 2020.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to use a large database to model pediatric admission volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic for various diagnoses compared with prior years. Using this approach, we identified seasonal patterns in a diverse group of pediatric conditions. Before 2020, pediatric admissions overall displayed winter predominance, associated with an increase in infectious respiratory conditions, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Summer-predominant conditions included trauma and admissions for semielective surgical conditions (eg, atrial septal defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children aged >1 year). The present study is in agreement with several prior studies documenting seasonality in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 asthma,16,19,20 Kawasaki syndrome,18 and trauma.21 However, we additionally noted novel seasonality for diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health admissions and the absence of seasonality in admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta. The seasonality of diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with children aged 5 years or older and may be reflective of the efforts of the American Diabetes Association to incorporate school personnel in the diabetes medical management plans for these patients.36\nAlthough COVID-19 has resulted in few pediatric admissions and mortalities compared with those for adults,1,9,10 the present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 vs a median of 43\u2009550 in April 2010-2019). Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. There was a premature termination of winter-predominant conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia and a reduction in admissions for asthma in 2020 compared with previous years. In exploratory analyses, this was coupled with a decrease in all acute respiratory failure diagnoses. Given the infectious nature of these conditions and their spread by respiratory droplets,37,38,39 this may have been associated with the effects of social distancing and possibly was even fortunate, given evidence of a potentially severe respiratory virus season in 2019 to 2020, with the highest number of respiratory failure admissions recorded in the past decade. A recent Australian study corroborates our findings, with more than 95% reduction in respiratory syncytial virus and influenza detection in Western Australia through winter 2020.40 Taken together, these studies suggest that rates of infectious pediatric respiratory conditions are potentially modifiable by changes in human behavior. Similarly, pediatric trauma admissions are often sports related,41 and the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with decreased childhood physical activity; thus, reductions in trauma admissions were anticipated.42 However, reductions in mental health admissions are surprising, given limited literature suggesting that pandemic-related stressors may worsen mental health in both the general population and those with preexisting psychiatric conditions.43,44 This may represent an opportunity for changes in the delivery of mental health care.45\nThe present study cannot delineate which changes in admission rates represent decreases in incidence, hospital avoidance, or unmet care needs. One inpatient survey suggested that greater than one-third of parents delayed seeking medical care for their child because of fears surrounding COVID-19,46 and case series have reported delayed presentations leading to harm.47,48 Similarly, although admissions for repair of atrial septal defects or later-stage repairs of hypoplastic left heart syndrome may safely be deferred for a short period, it is unclear whether reductions in admission rates represent purely elective surgical delays or the possibility of decreased recognition of congenital heart disease because of decreased contact with health care; small case series of increases in sudden death in adults with congenital heart disease without contact with health care institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported.49 Taken together, these findings are worrisome, although not definitive, in that unmet health care needs may be accumulating in the pediatric population as a result of decreased health care interactions.\nReduced patient volumes during early 2020 have reportedly contributed to financial instability for many hospitals and health systems.50 The reduction in charges observed in the present study suggests a proportionate decline in operating income. Although children\u2019s hospitals generally maintain better operating margins compared with other nonprofit hospitals, the 45.4% reduction in inpatient admissions at children\u2019s hospitals observed during the first 6 months of 2020 and 27.7% reduction in charges observed in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years has an influence on financial security.50,51 Leaders of children\u2019s hospitals could face unique challenges in the coming months as patient volumes eventually recover and are potentially coupled with the destabilizing financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCharacterizing alterations in usual patient admission patterns aids in anticipating the potential ramifications of recent national policies and can also help in crafting responses in a variety of areas. The present study highlights the strengths of an ensemble machine-learning approach to model complex time-series data displaying a variety of seasonal relationships. As complexity in medical information has increased, there has been progressive interest in the application of machine learning to facilitate clinical decision-making. Such algorithms have been studied in a diverse array of applications, including sepsis prediction,52 COVID-19 prognosis,53 population health,54 and cyberbullying.55 In the present study, before the COVID-19 pandemic,6,7 ensemble time-series forecasting models accurately predicted 70 of 72 monthly pediatric admission rates (97.2%) between July 2019 and December 2019. Quantification of the seasonality of various admission types in pediatrics has applicability for hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator capacity planning as well as trainee education. According to the present study, pediatricians and trainees assigned to inpatient wards in the winter will experience higher-than-average case burden and gain greater experience in managing pneumonia and bronchiolitis, whereas those assigned to emergency departments in the summer will achieve greater experience in the management of pediatric trauma. Such knowledge can be harnessed in the development of training curricula that support experience across the spectrum of pediatric illness.\nLimitations\nThis study has important limitations. As with any retrospective database analysis, admission diagnoses are vulnerable to misclassification owing to coding error. Although including greater than 5\u2009000\u2009000 inpatient encounters, this study is limited to 49 hospitals that consistently provided data to PHIS between January 2010 and June 2020 and may not be representative of national pediatric admission trends. Because of data availability, data from some admissions from late June 2020 are not yet available. This may have resulted in undercounting of admissions from June. However, hospitalizations for birth did not decrease below the 95% CIs for the forecasting model. It is also possible that some hospitals have been delayed in reporting admissions to PHIS because of the pandemic, although this is not a known data quality issue. Owing to data availability, only admissions between January and June 2020 were analyzed regarding the effects of social distancing. Further study is warranted as additional data become available.\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. These trends were effectively modeled with ensemble time-series forecasting algorithms. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotes\neFigure 1.

Au, Dana Fuhrman, Robert S. B. Clark, Christopher M. Horvat\nUPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nAccepted for Publication: December 21, 2020. Published: February 12, 2021. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37227\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\n\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the US in January 2020. In response, the US declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, and implemented various social distancing measures. These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality. Although COVID-19 resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations, early reports indicate it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the US and worldwide.\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 49 children\u2019s hospitals across the US participating in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database. Patients were eligible if discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. Statistical analyses were performed using R Studio and R Project for Statistical Computing.\n\nResults\nThere were 5,424,688 encounters among 3,372,839 patients, of which 213,571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The cohort had a median age of 5.1 years and included 52.1% boys, 58.5% White individuals, 18.3% Black individuals, and 20.5% Hispanic individuals. A total of 54.9% had government insurance, and 45.7% had a preexisting complex chronic condition. The median length of stay was 3 days. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2%. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23,798 compared with a median of 43,550 in April 2010-2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years.\n\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nSeveral distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\n\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020. Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected.\n\nHospital Charges\nThe total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6,024,735,078 compared with a median of $6,229,556,859 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4,327,580,511 compared with a median of $5,983,142,102 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. The median per-admission charge in 2020 was $24,358 compared with a median of $20,352 in 2010 to 2019.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years. Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

We sought to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes.\nMethods:\nWe used data from the General Internal Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) study, a retrospective cohort study, of all patients admitted to a general internal medicine service at 7 Toronto hospitals between 2010 and 2015. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Most Responsible Diagnosis code was used to identify the 10 most frequent reasons for admission in patients with diabetes. Cost of hospital admission was estimated using the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight. Comparisons were made between patients with or without diabetes using the Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free confidence intervals (CIs) for median cost.\nResults:\nAmong the 150 499 hospital admissions in our study, 41 934 (27.8%) involved patients with diabetes. Compared with patients without diabetes, hospital admissions because of soft tissue and bone infections were most frequent (2.5% v. 1.9%; prevalence ratio [PR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37) and costly (Can$8794 v. Can$5845; cost ratio [CR] 1.50, 95% CI 1.37\u20131.65) among patients with diabetes. This was followed by urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22; CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19; CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25) and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20; CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34).\nInterpretation:\nSoft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders are associated with a greater frequency and cost of hospital admissions in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing hospital admissions secondary to these disorders may be beneficial in patients with diabetes.\n\nDiabetes inflicts a heavy burden on health care systems globally.1 In Canada and the United States, nearly 1 in 10 people are diagnosed with diabetes,2,3 and this figure has been projected to increase to 1 in 5 people by 2050.4 In 2008, diabetes cost Canada $2.18 billion in the form of hospital admissions, physician care and medications. 5 By 2022, new cases of diabetes have been estimated to cost an additional $15.36 billion.6 In the US, one-quarter of all health care expenditures in 2017 were incurred by people with diabetes.3\nAcute inpatient hospital admissions are the primary driver of health care costs related to diabetes in Canada and the US. In many jurisdictions, including Ontario, more than 50% of attributable costs in incident diabetes are ascribed to acute inpatient hospital admissions.3,7 Research has shown diabetes to portend a higher likelihood of heart failure,8 stroke9 and renal failure.10 However, there is a paucity of data describing the specific medical conditions that drive the increased frequency and cost of hospital admission among people with diabetes. Such population-level data could specifically guide public policy in strengthening support for greater outpatient services among people with diabetes.\nThe objectives of this study were to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes.\nMethods\nStudy design and setting\nThis is a retrospective cohort study using data collected by the General Internal Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) study. A full description of the design and methods of the study has been presented previously.11 The GEMINI study involves 7 large hospital sites affiliated with the University of Toronto: St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Credit Valley Hospital and Mississauga Hospital. The latter 2 hospitals are large community teaching hospitals serving the neighbouring city of Mississauga. The remaining GEMINI hospitals are academic health centres in Toronto (Appendix 1, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1). All GEMINI hospitals are publicly funded, independently operated and provide tertiary or quaternary care.\nStudy population\nWe included all patients admitted to or discharged from the general internal medicine service at each hospital between Apr. 1, 2010, and Mar. 31, 2015. This included patients who required an intensive care unit (ICU) admission at any point during their hospital admission and those who were transferred to surgical services (e.g., for an amputation). There were no exclusion criteria.\nGeneral internal medicine admissions accounted for a substantial proportion of hospital admissions, including 39% of all emergency admissions.11 The most responsible care providers on the general internal medicine wards were predominantly internists. A separate inpatient cardiology ward was ubiquitous among all hospitals, but access to respirology, nephrology, hematology, gastroenterology, oncology and stroke wards varied. There were no separate endocrinology inpatient wards at any centres.\nData sources and collection\nWe collected patient-level characteristics for each admission, including demographic characteristics, diagnoses, interventions and discharge destination as reported by participating hospitals to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database (DAD). Each individual-level record included age, sex, place of residence at time of admission and discharge, most responsible discharge diagnosis, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, laboratory and radiology test results, blood transfusions, medications and intensive care unit admissions (Appendix 2, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1). Unique identifiers were used to link all data, and analyses on a subset of data showed 98%\u2013100% accuracy compared with chart review.12 Patients with diabetes were identified using CIHI Diagnosis Code (Group 10, Field 02) which conveys International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes as recorded in hospital administrative databases.\nFor each admission, we identified the primary discharge diagnosis using ICD-10 codes. Diseases were then classified into clinically relevant categories using Clinical Classifications Software, which organizes individual diagnoses into 285 mutually exclusive categories.11\nTo estimate the cost of each hospital admission comparably across sites and years, we used the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight (RIW) for each admission13 and multiplied this by the annual cost per weighted case for acute inpatient cases that was reported for each hospital using the Ontario Cost Distribution Methodology.14 The RIW is determined by CIHI using information collected in the DAD, which captures administrative, clinical and demographic information on hospital discharges from all acute inpatient separations (i.e., transfer, death, discharge or the patient leaving against advice) in Canada, with the exception of Quebec. Based on individual factors affecting medical complexity, including most responsible discharge diagnosis, age and comorbidities, every inpatient case is assigned an RIW by CIHI. This approach allows for the estimation of a nationally comparable cost for each hospital stay, including costs related to administration, staff, supplies, technology and equipment, but does not include fee-for-service physician billing costs.15 Data from CIHI have been validated previously16,17 and have reliably formed the basis for a substantial body of clinical and health services research.18,19\nAll costs were reported in Canadian dollars.\nStatistical analysis\nThe study population was described using means and standard deviations (SDs) or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), as appropriate for continuous or interval variables, and frequencies for categorical variables. We compared patients with or without diabetes using a Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free confidence intervals (CIs) for median cost.20 For the top 10 most frequent reasons for admission among patients with diabetes, we compared frequency and cost of admission using prevalence ratios (PRs) and cost ratios (CRs). We computed PRs and CRs as the ratio of frequency or cost in patients with diabetes to the frequency or cost in patients without diabetes.21 Given large sample sizes, we determined differences to be meaningful if they were both statistically significant (p < 0.05) and relative differences were greater than 10%.\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses using only the first hospital admission for all included patients and stratifying results by sex. We accounted for inflation by standardizing fiscal year cost of hospital stay to April 2015 using Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health guidance and used the general consumer price index as a deflator.22 All analyses were conducted using R statistical software, version 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\nEthics approval\nResearch ethics board approval was obtained from all participating hospitals (Clinical Trials Ontario Study ID 1394). An exception from informed consent was obtained because this was a large retrospective study with minimal risk of re-identification for any individual patient.\nResults\nThere were 150 499 admissions to general internal medicine wards across all hospital sites during the study period (Table 1). There were 97 316 unique patients. Overall, 41 934 (27.8%) of all hospital admissions occurred in patients with diabetes, and most hospital admissions (94.1%) were among patients with type 2 diabetes. Among all patients admitted to hospital, the median age was 73 years, 50.2% were female and the median number of comorbidities, including diabetes, was 6.\nTable 1:\nCharacteristics of study participants, stratified by diabetes status\nNote: IQR = interquartile range, SD = standard deviation.\nFrequency of admissions\nThe most frequent reasons for admission to general internal medicine (Table 2, Table 3) among patients with diabetes were heart failure (7.7%), urinary tract infection (5.1%), stroke (4.8%), pneumonia (4.6%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4.4%), delirium (3.2%), acute renal failure (2.9%), sepsis (2.8%), soft tissue and bone infections (2.5%) and electrolyte disorders (2.4%). Based on the Clinical Classifications Software group of electrolyte disorders, the most common were hyponatremia (57.2%), dehydration (14.1%), hypernatremia (10.2%), hyperkalemia (6.0%) and hypokalemia (4.0%).\nTable 2:\nPrevalence and cost of admission for most common reasons for hospital admissions, stratified by diabetes status\nNote: COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nTable 3:\nMost common reasons for hospital admission, stratified by increase in prevalence and cost of hospital admission\nNote: COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nThe PRs for these conditions (Figure 1, Table 3) showed that acute renal failure (PR 2.02, 95% CI 1.87\u20132.17), heart failure (PR 1.88, 95% CI 1.80\u20131.96), soft tissue and bone infections (PR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37), sepsis (PR 1.22, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.31), urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22), delirium (PR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.23), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19) and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20) were the more common reasons for hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with those without.\nPrevalence ratios with error bars of most responsible reasons for diagnosis.

The proportional difference in cost of admission for heart failure, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were statistically significant but were not greater than our threshold of 10%.\nCost ratios with error bars of most responsible reasons for diagnosis. Note: CI = confidence interval, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CR = cost ratio.\nStratifying by sex did not significantly change our results, with the exception of acute renal failure (CR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.26 in females; not statistically significant in males), urinary tract infection (CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.28 in females; not statistically significant in males) and sepsis (CR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15\u20131.35 in males; not statistically significant in females) (Appendix 3).\nSensitivity analyses\nSensitivity analyses that used only the first hospital admission for each patient (n = 96 073) did not significantly change our results. Adjustment for age is included in the CIHI RIW methodology used for cost estimation, and adjustment for inflation did not significantly change our results14 (Appendices 4 and 5, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1).\nInterpretation\nIn our study of patients admitted to the general internal medicine services at 7 Toronto hospitals, nearly one-third had diabetes. Soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders were more frequent and costly among patients with diabetes than among patients without. In addition, hospital admissions for acute renal failure, heart failure, sepsis and delirium occurred at a greater frequency in the diabetes population, but not at an increased cost.\nDiabetes is a highly prevalent and potential driver of illness among patients admitted to hospital. A recent study found hypertension to be the most common comorbid condition among patients admitted to hospital with diabetes as the primary reason for admission.23 However, as we have shown, diabetes itself is rarely a reason for admission; rather, its associated morbidities frequently lead to hospital admissions owing to complications including soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders. This study provides essential information for clinicians and policy makers to understand the broader impact of diabetes on hospital admissions.\nOur findings on stroke add to existing knowledge: patients with diabetes have about twice the risk of stroke as those without diabetes.24 Rates of stroke have fallen substantially over the last few decades in response to the growing evidence in support of cardioprotective therapies and their adoption in clinical practice.25 Yet, based on our evidence, admissions for stroke remain more common in patients with diabetes.\nCompared with stroke prevention, the prevention of soft tissue and bone infections has received less attention in the research literature, potentially at the expense of increased morbidity and mortality.26 In Canada and the US, decades of improvements in rates of nontraumatic lower-extremity amputations in patients with diabetes have recently reversed, especially among younger adults.27\u201329 A 2017 international meta-analysis comparing the prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers across 33 countries has found Canada (14.8%) to have the second highest rate, after Belgium (16.6%).30 Foot care is one of the most neglected components of standard diabetes care practices, with only 51% of Canadian patients with diabetes having their feet checked as recommended.31 With the exception of recent coverage in Ontario, offloading devices are not currently covered for Canadians with diabetes who have foot ulcers.32 In addition, the prevalence of diabetes is higher in lower-income households,33 providing real-life context to the 57% of Canadians with diabetes who cannot afford their necessary medications, devices and supplies.34\nTo curb such trends in soft tissue and bone infections, proven preventive measures, including regular foot examination, debridement, mechanical offloading devices and chiropody, must not only be available, but also easily accessible for patients with diabetes who often lack economic or social capital. As part of increasing efforts to integrate information technology into medicine,35 the use of telemedicine36 and social media37 in diabetes foot care may help fill in gaps in accessibility and knowledge dissemination. Given the projected increase in the burden of diabetic foot ulcers, including frequent and costly admissions to hospital as shown in our study, increased primary care efforts and public funding should be directed specifically toward proven preventive strategies and modernized approaches.38\nMost of the diabetes-related conditions identified in our study were vascular in nature, except for urinary tract infections, delirium and electrolyte disorders. The increased burden of hospital admission secondary to urinary tract infections in patients with diabetes is consistent with existing knowledge. 39 Diabetes is associated with a higher risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, urinary tract infections and severe complications. Whether patients with diabetes should be treated if they have asymptomatic bacteriuria is unknown and may be an important focus of future research. In addition, ongoing review of the safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, which are gaining prominence in diabetes care, is needed to understand its impact on urinary tract infections among patients with diabetes.40\nAlthough delirium may be caused by any of the identified comorbid conditions, there is limited literature on how diabetes itself can predispose an individual to delirium. Diabetes has been associated with both Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia,41 yet studies on its association with delirium have yielded mixed results and have been conducted primarily in an intensive care setting.42 One plausible hypothesis is that the generation of microvascular malformations in the central nervous system from persistent metabolic derangements leads to endothelial damage and deregulated angiogenesis.43 Given that the prevalence of delirium among our patients with diabetes was 15% greater than among those without, further studies are warranted to understand the mechanism behind this increased prevalence.\nElectrolyte disorders were one of the most frequent and costly reasons for admission in patients with diabetes, yet preventive strategies are lacking. The multifactorial nature of its pathophysiology in diabetes, likely including poor nutrition, impaired gastrointestinal absorption, acid\u2013base abnormalities and pharmacological agents, makes electrolyte abnormalities a challenging condition to prevent.44 Further studies that aim to elucidate the individual pathophysiologic mechanisms of electrolyte disorders in patients with diabetes will be necessary to develop outpatient strategies for monitoring and prevention.\nFinally, heart failure was the most common reason for hospital admission among patients with diabetes, a relation that has been well established.45 New treatment options for this particular demographic have been emerging. For instance, a meta-analysis evaluating cardiovascular outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors found that these medications have shown promising effects of reducing hospital admissions secondary to heart failure by about 30%, regardless of presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heart failure at baseline.46\nLimitations\nThere are several limitations to our study. Our patients with diabetes were restricted to those who were admitted to a general internal medicine service for some portion of their hospital admission and did not include patients admitted to surgical, psychiatric or subspecialty medical services. Thus, the frequency of admissions secondary to diabetes-related complications or severe complications may be underestimated. However, more than one-third of emergency department admissions are to a general internal medicine service; therefore, our data capture the largest group of patients requiring hospital admission and represent a crucial health services group on which to focus.11\nOur cost estimates did not take physician billing and outpatient expenses into account; therefore, the costs of admission may have been underestimated, which may have affected the CR methods we adopted. Using the RIW, we were able to estimate the cost of hospital admission, but not out-of-pocket costs such as mechanical offloading devices. However, RIW has been used previously in similar studies7,47 and provides a reasonable and comparable estimation of the direct health care costs attributable to diabetes.\nThere remains a residual risk of clustering at the hospital, physician and admission levels. We conducted sensitivity analyses using only the first hospital admission, and the results were robust. Our patient population came from only 2 cities in Canada. However, our inclusion of the 5 largest hospitals in Toronto and the only 2 hospitals in Mississauga, Canada\u2019s first and ninth most populous municipalities respectively, adds to the generalizability of our findings. Lastly, the number of comorbid conditions in the comparison of patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes was not adjusted.\nConclusion\nA substantial portion of acute hospital admissions are associated with diabetes. Our study characterizes the frequency and costs associated with acute inpatient hospital admissions to a general internal medicine service from various diabetes-related conditions. Based on our findings, a preventive strategy focused on reducing hospital admissions secondary to soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders in patients with diabetes may be beneficial in this high-risk group.\nSupplementary Material\nFootnotes\nCompeting interests: Amol Verma and Fahad Razak report that they are part-time employees of Health Quality Ontario.

This was followed by urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22; CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19; CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25), and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20; CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34). Interpretation: Soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke, and electrolyte disorders are associated with greater frequency and cost of hospital admissions in patients with diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing these admissions may be beneficial. Diabetes is a significant burden on healthcare systems globally, with nearly 1 in 10 people diagnosed in Canada and the US. Acute inpatient hospital admissions are the primary driver of diabetes-related healthcare costs. This study provides population-level data to guide public policy in strengthening outpatient services for people with diabetes. Methods: The GEMINI study involved 7 large hospital sites in Toronto. Data included patient characteristics, diagnoses, interventions, and discharge destinations. Costs were estimated using CIHI RIW and the Ontario Cost Distribution Methodology. Statistical analysis used Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free CIs for median cost. Results: Among 150,499 admissions, 41,934 (27.8%) were in patients with diabetes. The most frequent reasons for admission were heart failure (7.7%), urinary tract infection (5.1%), stroke (4.8%), pneumonia (4.6%), COPD (4.4%), delirium (3.2%), acute renal failure (2.9%), sepsis (2.8%), soft tissue and bone infections (2.5%), and electrolyte disorders (2.4%). The median costs of admission for these conditions ranged from $4422 to $12,916. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusion: A substantial portion of acute hospital admissions are associated with diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing admissions for soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke, and electrolyte disorders may benefit this high-risk group.",

We sought to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes.\nMethods:\nWe used data from the General Internal Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) study, a retrospective cohort study, of all patients admitted to a general internal medicine service at 7 Toronto hospitals between 2010 and 2015. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Most Responsible Diagnosis code was used to identify the 10 most frequent reasons for admission in patients with diabetes. Cost of hospital admission was estimated using the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight. Comparisons were made between patients with or without diabetes using the Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free confidence intervals (CIs) for median cost.\nResults:\nAmong the 150 499 hospital admissions in our study, 41 934 (27.8%) involved patients with diabetes. Compared with patients without diabetes, hospital admissions because of soft tissue and bone infections were most frequent (2.5% v. 1.9%; prevalence ratio [PR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37) and costly (Can$8794 v. Can$5845; cost ratio [CR] 1.50, 95% CI 1.37\u20131.65) among patients with diabetes. This was followed by urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22; CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19; CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25) and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20; CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34).\nInterpretation:\nSoft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders are associated with a greater frequency and cost of hospital admissions in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing hospital admissions secondary to these disorders may be beneficial in patients with diabetes.\n\nDiabetes inflicts a heavy burden on health care systems globally.1 In Canada and the United States, nearly 1 in 10 people are diagnosed with diabetes,2,3 and this figure has been projected to increase to 1 in 5 people by 2050.4 In 2008, diabetes cost Canada $2.18 billion in the form of hospital admissions, physician care and medications. 5 By 2022, new cases of diabetes have been estimated to cost an additional $15.36 billion.6 In the US, one-quarter of all health care expenditures in 2017 were incurred by people with diabetes.3\nAcute inpatient hospital admissions are the primary driver of health care costs related to diabetes in Canada and the US. In many jurisdictions, including Ontario, more than 50% of attributable costs in incident diabetes are ascribed to acute inpatient hospital admissions.3,7 Research has shown diabetes to portend a higher likelihood of heart failure,8 stroke9 and renal failure.10 However, there is a paucity of data describing the specific medical conditions that drive the increased frequency and cost of hospital admission among people with diabetes. Such population-level data could specifically guide public policy in strengthening support for greater outpatient services among people with diabetes.\nThe objectives of this study were to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes.\nMethods\nStudy design and setting\nThis is a retrospective cohort study using data collected by the General Internal Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) study. A full description of the design and methods of the study has been presented previously.11 The GEMINI study involves 7 large hospital sites affiliated with the University of Toronto: St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Credit Valley Hospital and Mississauga Hospital. The latter 2 hospitals are large community teaching hospitals serving the neighbouring city of Mississauga. The remaining GEMINI hospitals are academic health centres in Toronto (Appendix 1, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1). All GEMINI hospitals are publicly funded, independently operated and provide tertiary or quaternary care.\nStudy population\nWe included all patients admitted to or discharged from the general internal medicine service at each hospital between Apr. 1, 2010, and Mar. 31, 2015. This included patients who required an intensive care unit (ICU) admission at any point during their hospital admission and those who were transferred to surgical services (e.g., for an amputation). There were no exclusion criteria.\nGeneral internal medicine admissions accounted for a substantial proportion of hospital admissions, including 39% of all emergency admissions.11 The most responsible care providers on the general internal medicine wards were predominantly internists. A separate inpatient cardiology ward was ubiquitous among all hospitals, but access to respirology, nephrology, hematology, gastroenterology, oncology and stroke wards varied. There were no separate endocrinology inpatient wards at any centres.\nData sources and collection\nWe collected patient-level characteristics for each admission, including demographic characteristics, diagnoses, interventions and discharge destination as reported by participating hospitals to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database (DAD). Each individual-level record included age, sex, place of residence at time of admission and discharge, most responsible discharge diagnosis, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, laboratory and radiology test results, blood transfusions, medications and intensive care unit admissions (Appendix 2, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1). Unique identifiers were used to link all data, and analyses on a subset of data showed 98%\u2013100% accuracy compared with chart review.12 Patients with diabetes were identified using CIHI Diagnosis Code (Group 10, Field 02) which conveys International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes as recorded in hospital administrative databases.\nFor each admission, we identified the primary discharge diagnosis using ICD-10 codes. Diseases were then classified into clinically relevant categories using Clinical Classifications Software, which organizes individual diagnoses into 285 mutually exclusive categories.11\nTo estimate the cost of each hospital admission comparably across sites and years, we used the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight (RIW) for each admission13 and multiplied this by the annual cost per weighted case for acute inpatient cases that was reported for each hospital using the Ontario Cost Distribution Methodology.14 The RIW is determined by CIHI using information collected in the DAD, which captures administrative, clinical and demographic information on hospital discharges from all acute inpatient separations (i.e., transfer, death, discharge or the patient leaving against advice) in Canada, with the exception of Quebec. Based on individual factors affecting medical complexity, including most responsible discharge diagnosis, age and comorbidities, every inpatient case is assigned an RIW by CIHI. This approach allows for the estimation of a nationally comparable cost for each hospital stay, including costs related to administration, staff, supplies, technology and equipment, but does not include fee-for-service physician billing costs.15 Data from CIHI have been validated previously16,17 and have reliably formed the basis for a substantial body of clinical and health services research.18,19\nAll costs were reported in Canadian dollars.\nStatistical analysis\nThe study population was described using means and standard deviations (SDs) or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), as appropriate for continuous or interval variables, and frequencies for categorical variables. We compared patients with or without diabetes using a Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free confidence intervals (CIs) for median cost.20 For the top 10 most frequent reasons for admission among patients with diabetes, we compared frequency and cost of admission using prevalence ratios (PRs) and cost ratios (CRs). We computed PRs and CRs as the ratio of frequency or cost in patients with diabetes to the frequency or cost in patients without diabetes.21 Given large sample sizes, we determined differences to be meaningful if they were both statistically significant (p < 0.05) and relative differences were greater than 10%.\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses using only the first hospital admission for all included patients and stratifying results by sex. We accounted for inflation by standardizing fiscal year cost of hospital stay to April 2015 using Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health guidance and used the general consumer price index as a deflator.22 All analyses were conducted using R statistical software, version 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\nEthics approval\nResearch ethics board approval was obtained from all participating hospitals (Clinical Trials Ontario Study ID 1394). An exception from informed consent was obtained because this was a large retrospective study with minimal risk of re-identification for any individual patient.\nResults\nThere were 150 499 admissions to general internal medicine wards across all hospital sites during the study period (Table 1). There were 97 316 unique patients. Overall, 41 934 (27.8%) of all hospital admissions occurred in patients with diabetes, and most hospital admissions (94.1%) were among patients with type 2 diabetes. Among all patients admitted to hospital, the median age was 73 years, 50.2% were female and the median number of comorbidities, including diabetes, was 6.\nTable 1:\nCharacteristics of study participants, stratified by diabetes status\nNote: IQR = interquartile range, SD = standard deviation.\nFrequency of admissions\nThe most frequent reasons for admission to general internal medicine (Table 2, Table 3) among patients with diabetes were heart failure (7.7%), urinary tract infection (5.1%), stroke (4.8%), pneumonia (4.6%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4.4%), delirium (3.2%), acute renal failure (2.9%), sepsis (2.8%), soft tissue and bone infections (2.5%) and electrolyte disorders (2.4%). Based on the Clinical Classifications Software group of electrolyte disorders, the most common were hyponatremia (57.2%), dehydration (14.1%), hypernatremia (10.2%), hyperkalemia (6.0%) and hypokalemia (4.0%).\nTable 2:\nPrevalence and cost of admission for most common reasons for hospital admissions, stratified by diabetes status\nNote: COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nTable 3:\nMost common reasons for hospital admission, stratified by increase in prevalence and cost of hospital admission\nNote: COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nThe PRs for these conditions (Figure 1, Table 3) showed that acute renal failure (PR 2.02, 95% CI 1.87\u20132.17), heart failure (PR 1.88, 95% CI 1.80\u20131.96), soft tissue and bone infections (PR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37), sepsis (PR 1.22, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.31), urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22), delirium (PR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.23), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19) and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20) were the more common reasons for hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with those without.\nPrevalence ratios with error bars of most responsible reasons for diagnosis. Note: CI = confidence interval, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, PR = prevalence ratio.\nStratifying by sex did not significantly change our results, with the exception of electrolyte disorders (PR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09\u20131.38 in males but not statistically significant in females) and pneumonia (PR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82\u20130.94 in males; PR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86\u20131.00 in females) (Appendix 3, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1).\nCost of admissions\nThe median costs of admission (Table 2) for each of the most common reasons for admission among patients with diabetes were $12 916 for delirium, $10 722 for sepsis, $8794 for soft tissue and bone infections, $8270 for stroke, $6821 for heart failure, $6301 for acute renal failure, $6278 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, $6183 for pneumonia, $5442 for urinary tract infection and $4422 for electrolyte disorders.\nThe CRs for these conditions (Figure 2, Table 3) showed that admission for soft tissue and bone infections (CR 1.50, 95% CI 1.37\u20131.65), urinary tract infection (CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), electrolyte disorders (CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34) and stroke (CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25) were more costly among patients with diabetes compared with those without. The proportional difference in cost of admission for heart failure, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were statistically significant but were not greater than our threshold of 10%.\nCost ratios with error bars of most responsible reasons for diagnosis. Note: CI = confidence interval, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CR = cost ratio.\nStratifying by sex did not significantly change our results, with the exception of acute renal failure (CR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.26 in females; not statistically significant in males), urinary tract infection (CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.28 in females; not statistically significant in males) and sepsis (CR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15\u20131.35 in males; not statistically significant in females) (Appendix 3).\nSensitivity analyses\nSensitivity analyses that used only the first hospital admission for each patient (n = 96 073) did not significantly change our results. Adjustment for age is included in the CIHI RIW methodology used for cost estimation, and adjustment for inflation did not significantly change our results14 (Appendices 4 and 5, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1).\nInterpretation\nIn our study of patients admitted to the general internal medicine services at 7 Toronto hospitals, nearly one-third had diabetes. Soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders were more frequent and costly among patients with diabetes than among patients without. In addition, hospital admissions for acute renal failure, heart failure, sepsis and delirium occurred at a greater frequency in the diabetes population, but not at an increased cost.\nDiabetes is a highly prevalent and potential driver of illness among patients admitted to hospital. A recent study found hypertension to be the most common comorbid condition among patients admitted to hospital with diabetes as the primary reason for admission.23 However, as we have shown, diabetes itself is rarely a reason for admission; rather, its associated morbidities frequently lead to hospital admissions owing to complications including soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders. This study provides essential information for clinicians and policy makers to understand the broader impact of diabetes on hospital admissions.\nOur findings on stroke add to existing knowledge: patients with diabetes have about twice the risk of stroke as those without diabetes.24 Rates of stroke have fallen substantially over the last few decades in response to the growing evidence in support of cardioprotective therapies and their adoption in clinical practice.25 Yet, based on our evidence, admissions for stroke remain more common in patients with diabetes.\nCompared with stroke prevention, the prevention of soft tissue and bone infections has received less attention in the research literature, potentially at the expense of increased morbidity and mortality.26 In Canada and the US, decades of improvements in rates of nontraumatic lower-extremity amputations in patients with diabetes have recently reversed, especially among younger adults.27\u201329 A 2017 international meta-analysis comparing the prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers across 33 countries has found Canada (14.8%) to have the second highest rate, after Belgium (16.6%).30 Foot care is one of the most neglected components of standard diabetes care practices, with only 51% of Canadian patients with diabetes having their feet checked as recommended.31 With the exception of recent coverage in Ontario, offloading devices are not currently covered for Canadians with diabetes who have foot ulcers.32 In addition, the prevalence of diabetes is higher in lower-income households,33 providing real-life context to the 57% of Canadians with diabetes who cannot afford their necessary medications, devices and supplies.34\nTo curb such trends in soft tissue and bone infections, proven preventive measures, including regular foot examination, debridement, mechanical offloading devices and chiropody, must not only be available, but also easily accessible for patients with diabetes who often lack economic or social capital. As part of increasing efforts to integrate information technology into medicine,35 the use of telemedicine36 and social media37 in diabetes foot care may help fill in gaps in accessibility and knowledge dissemination. Given the projected increase in the burden of diabetic foot ulcers, including frequent and costly admissions to hospital as shown in our study, increased primary care efforts and public funding should be directed specifically toward proven preventive strategies and modernized approaches.38\nMost of the diabetes-related conditions identified in our study were vascular in nature, except for urinary tract infections, delirium and electrolyte disorders. The increased burden of hospital admission secondary to urinary tract infections in patients with diabetes is consistent with existing knowledge. 39 Diabetes is associated with a higher risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, urinary tract infections and severe complications. Whether patients with diabetes should be treated if they have asymptomatic bacteriuria is unknown and may be an important focus of future research. In addition, ongoing review of the safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, which are gaining prominence in diabetes care, is needed to understand its impact on urinary tract infections among patients with diabetes.40\nAlthough delirium may be caused by any of the identified comorbid conditions, there is limited literature on how diabetes itself can predispose an individual to delirium. Diabetes has been associated with both Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia,41 yet studies on its association with delirium have yielded mixed results and have been conducted primarily in an intensive care setting.42 One plausible hypothesis is that the generation of microvascular malformations in the central nervous system from persistent metabolic derangements leads to endothelial damage and deregulated angiogenesis.43 Given that the prevalence of delirium among our patients with diabetes was 15% greater than among those without, further studies are warranted to understand the mechanism behind this increased prevalence.\nElectrolyte disorders were one of the most frequent and costly reasons for admission in patients with diabetes, yet preventive strategies are lacking. The multifactorial nature of its pathophysiology in diabetes, likely including poor nutrition, impaired gastrointestinal absorption, acid\u2013base abnormalities and pharmacological agents, makes electrolyte abnormalities a challenging condition to prevent.44 Further studies that aim to elucidate the individual pathophysiologic mechanisms of electrolyte disorders in patients with diabetes will be necessary to develop outpatient strategies for monitoring and prevention.\nFinally, heart failure was the most common reason for hospital admission among patients with diabetes, a relation that has been well established.45 New treatment options for this particular demographic have been emerging. For instance, a meta-analysis evaluating cardiovascular outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors found that these medications have shown promising effects of reducing hospital admissions secondary to heart failure by about 30%, regardless of presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heart failure at baseline.46\nLimitations\nThere are several limitations to our study. Our patients with diabetes were restricted to those who were admitted to a general internal medicine service for some portion of their hospital admission and did not include patients admitted to surgical, psychiatric or subspecialty medical services. Thus, the frequency of admissions secondary to diabetes-related complications or severe complications may be underestimated. However, more than one-third of emergency department admissions are to a general internal medicine service; therefore, our data capture the largest group of patients requiring hospital admission and represent a crucial health services group on which to focus.11\nOur cost estimates did not take physician billing and outpatient expenses into account; therefore, the costs of admission may have been underestimated, which may have affected the CR methods we adopted. Using the RIW, we were able to estimate the cost of hospital admission, but not out-of-pocket costs such as mechanical offloading devices. However, RIW has been used previously in similar studies7,47 and provides a reasonable and comparable estimation of the direct health care costs attributable to diabetes.\nThere remains a residual risk of clustering at the hospital, physician and admission levels. We conducted sensitivity analyses using only the first hospital admission, and the results were robust. Our patient population came from only 2 cities in Canada. However, our inclusion of the 5 largest hospitals in Toronto and the only 2 hospitals in Mississauga, Canada\u2019s first and ninth most populous municipalities respectively, adds to the generalizability of our findings. Lastly, the number of comorbid conditions in the comparison of patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes was not adjusted.\nConclusion\nA substantial portion of acute hospital admissions are associated with diabetes. Our study characterizes the frequency and costs associated with acute inpatient hospital admissions to a general internal medicine service from various diabetes-related conditions. Based on our findings, a preventive strategy focused on reducing hospital admissions secondary to soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders in patients with diabetes may be beneficial in this high-risk group.\nSupplementary Material\nFootnotes\nCompeting interests: Amol Verma and Fahad Razak report that they are part-time employees of Health Quality Ontario.

    "Summarized_Document": "Background: Acute inpatient hospital admissions account for over half of all healthcare costs related to diabetes. This study aimed to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. Methods: Data from the GEMINI study, involving 7 Toronto hospitals between 2010 and 2015, was used. The CIHI Most Responsible Diagnosis code identified the 10 most frequent reasons for admission in patients with diabetes. Cost was estimated using the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight. Results: Out of 150,499 hospital admissions, 41,934 (27.8%) involved patients with diabetes. Soft tissue and bone infections were the most frequent (2.5% vs. 1.9%; PR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37) and costly (Can$8794 vs. Can$5845; CR 1.50, 95% CI 1.37\u20131.65) among patients with diabetes. This was followed by urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22; CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19; CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25), and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20; CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34). Interpretation: Soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke, and electrolyte disorders are associated with greater frequency and cost of hospital admissions in patients with diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing these admissions may be beneficial. Diabetes is a significant burden on healthcare systems globally, with nearly 1 in 10 people diagnosed in Canada and the US. Acute inpatient hospital admissions are the primary driver of diabetes-related healthcare costs. This study provides population-level data to guide public policy in strengthening outpatient services for people with diabetes. Methods: The GEMINI study involved 7 large hospital sites in Toronto. Data included patient characteristics, diagnoses, interventions, and discharge destinations. Costs were estimated using CIHI RIW and the Ontario Cost Distribution Methodology. Statistical analysis used Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free CIs for median cost. Results: Among 150,499 admissions, 41,934 (27.8%) were in patients with diabetes. The most frequent reasons for admission were heart failure (7.7%), urinary tract infection (5.1%), stroke (4.8%), pneumonia (4.6%), COPD (4.4%), delirium (3.2%), acute renal failure (2.9%), sepsis (2.8%), soft tissue and bone infections (2.5%), and electrolyte disorders (2.4%). The median costs of admission for these conditions ranged from $4422 to $12,916. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusion: A substantial portion of acute hospital admissions are associated with diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing admissions for soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke, and electrolyte disorders may benefit this high-risk group.",

We sought to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes.\nMethods:\nWe used data from the General Internal Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) study, a retrospective cohort study, of all patients admitted to a general internal medicine service at 7 Toronto hospitals between 2010 and 2015. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Most Responsible Diagnosis code was used to identify the 10 most frequent reasons for admission in patients with diabetes. Cost of hospital admission was estimated using the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight. Comparisons were made between patients with or without diabetes using the Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free confidence intervals (CIs) for median cost.\nResults:\nAmong the 150 499 hospital admissions in our study, 41 934 (27.8%) involved patients with diabetes. Compared with patients without diabetes, hospital admissions because of soft tissue and bone infections were most frequent (2.5% v. 1.9%; prevalence ratio [PR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37) and costly (Can$8794 v. Can$5845; cost ratio [CR] 1.50, 95% CI 1.37\u20131.65) among patients with diabetes. This was followed by urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22; CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19; CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25) and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20; CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34).\nInterpretation:\nSoft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders are associated with a greater frequency and cost of hospital admissions in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing hospital admissions secondary to these disorders may be beneficial in patients with diabetes.\n\nDiabetes inflicts a heavy burden on health care systems globally.1 In Canada and the United States, nearly 1 in 10 people are diagnosed with diabetes,2,3 and this figure has been projected to increase to 1 in 5 people by 2050.4 In 2008, diabetes cost Canada $2.18 billion in the form of hospital admissions, physician care and medications. 5 By 2022, new cases of diabetes have been estimated to cost an additional $15.36 billion.6 In the US, one-quarter of all health care expenditures in 2017 were incurred by people with diabetes.3\nAcute inpatient hospital admissions are the primary driver of health care costs related to diabetes in Canada and the US. In many jurisdictions, including Ontario, more than 50% of attributable costs in incident diabetes are ascribed to acute inpatient hospital admissions.3,7 Research has shown diabetes to portend a higher likelihood of heart failure,8 stroke9 and renal failure.10 However, there is a paucity of data describing the specific medical conditions that drive the increased frequency and cost of hospital admission among people with diabetes. Such population-level data could specifically guide public policy in strengthening support for greater outpatient services among people with diabetes.\nThe objectives of this study were to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes.\nMethods\nStudy design and setting\nThis is a retrospective cohort study using data collected by the General Internal Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) study. A full description of the design and methods of the study has been presented previously.11 The GEMINI study involves 7 large hospital sites affiliated with the University of Toronto: St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Credit Valley Hospital and Mississauga Hospital. The latter 2 hospitals are large community teaching hospitals serving the neighbouring city of Mississauga. The remaining GEMINI hospitals are academic health centres in Toronto (Appendix 1, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1). All GEMINI hospitals are publicly funded, independently operated and provide tertiary or quaternary care.\nStudy population\nWe included all patients admitted to or discharged from the general internal medicine service at each hospital between Apr. 1, 2010, and Mar. 31, 2015. This included patients who required an intensive care unit (ICU) admission at any point during their hospital admission and those who were transferred to surgical services (e.g., for an amputation). There were no exclusion criteria.\nGeneral internal medicine admissions accounted for a substantial proportion of hospital admissions, including 39% of all emergency admissions.11 The most responsible care providers on the general internal medicine wards were predominantly internists. A separate inpatient cardiology ward was ubiquitous among all hospitals, but access to respirology, nephrology, hematology, gastroenterology, oncology and stroke wards varied. There were no separate endocrinology inpatient wards at any centres.\nData sources and collection\nWe collected patient-level characteristics for each admission, including demographic characteristics, diagnoses, interventions and discharge destination as reported by participating hospitals to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database (DAD). Each individual-level record included age, sex, place of residence at time of admission and discharge, most responsible discharge diagnosis, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, laboratory and radiology test results, blood transfusions, medications and intensive care unit admissions (Appendix 2, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1). Unique identifiers were used to link all data, and analyses on a subset of data showed 98%\u2013100% accuracy compared with chart review.12 Patients with diabetes were identified using CIHI Diagnosis Code (Group 10, Field 02) which conveys International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes as recorded in hospital administrative databases.\nFor each admission, we identified the primary discharge diagnosis using ICD-10 codes. Diseases were then classified into clinically relevant categories using Clinical Classifications Software, which organizes individual diagnoses into 285 mutually exclusive categories.11\nTo estimate the cost of each hospital admission comparably across sites and years, we used the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight (RIW) for each admission13 and multiplied this by the annual cost per weighted case for acute inpatient cases that was reported for each hospital using the Ontario Cost Distribution Methodology.14 The RIW is determined by CIHI using information collected in the DAD, which captures administrative, clinical and demographic information on hospital discharges from all acute inpatient separations (i.e., transfer, death, discharge or the patient leaving against advice) in Canada, with the exception of Quebec. Based on individual factors affecting medical complexity, including most responsible discharge diagnosis, age and comorbidities, every inpatient case is assigned an RIW by CIHI. This approach allows for the estimation of a nationally comparable cost for each hospital stay, including costs related to administration, staff, supplies, technology and equipment, but does not include fee-for-service physician billing costs.15 Data from CIHI have been validated previously16,17 and have reliably formed the basis for a substantial body of clinical and health services research.18,19\nAll costs were reported in Canadian dollars.\nStatistical analysis\nThe study population was described using means and standard deviations (SDs) or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), as appropriate for continuous or interval variables, and frequencies for categorical variables. We compared patients with or without diabetes using a Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free confidence intervals (CIs) for median cost.20 For the top 10 most frequent reasons for admission among patients with diabetes, we compared frequency and cost of admission using prevalence ratios (PRs) and cost ratios (CRs). We computed PRs and CRs as the ratio of frequency or cost in patients with diabetes to the frequency or cost in patients without diabetes.21 Given large sample sizes, we determined differences to be meaningful if they were both statistically significant (p < 0.05) and relative differences were greater than 10%.\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses using only the first hospital admission for all included patients and stratifying results by sex. We accounted for inflation by standardizing fiscal year cost of hospital stay to April 2015 using Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health guidance and used the general consumer price index as a deflator.22 All analyses were conducted using R statistical software, version 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\nEthics approval\nResearch ethics board approval was obtained from all participating hospitals (Clinical Trials Ontario Study ID 1394). An exception from informed consent was obtained because this was a large retrospective study with minimal risk of re-identification for any individual patient.\nResults\nThere were 150 499 admissions to general internal medicine wards across all hospital sites during the study period (Table 1). There were 97 316 unique patients. Overall, 41 934 (27.8%) of all hospital admissions occurred in patients with diabetes, and most hospital admissions (94.1%) were among patients with type 2 diabetes. Among all patients admitted to hospital, the median age was 73 years, 50.2% were female and the median number of comorbidities, including diabetes, was 6.\nTable 1:\nCharacteristics of study participants, stratified by diabetes status\nNote: IQR = interquartile range, SD = standard deviation.\nFrequency of admissions\nThe most frequent reasons for admission to general internal medicine (Table 2, Table 3) among patients with diabetes were heart failure (7.7%), urinary tract infection (5.1%), stroke (4.8%), pneumonia (4.6%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4.4%), delirium (3.2%), acute renal failure (2.9%), sepsis (2.8%), soft tissue and bone infections (2.5%) and electrolyte disorders (2.4%). Based on the Clinical Classifications Software group of electrolyte disorders, the most common were hyponatremia (57.2%), dehydration (14.1%), hypernatremia (10.2%), hyperkalemia (6.0%) and hypokalemia (4.0%).\nTable 2:\nPrevalence and cost of admission for most common reasons for hospital admissions, stratified by diabetes status\nNote: COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nTable 3:\nMost common reasons for hospital admission, stratified by increase in prevalence and cost of hospital admission\nNote: COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nThe PRs for these conditions (Figure 1, Table 3) showed that acute renal failure (PR 2.02, 95% CI 1.87\u20132.17), heart failure (PR 1.88, 95% CI 1.80\u20131.96), soft tissue and bone infections (PR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37), sepsis (PR 1.22, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.31), urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22), delirium (PR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.23), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19) and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20) were the more common reasons for hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared with those without.\nPrevalence ratios with error bars of most responsible reasons for diagnosis. Note: CI = confidence interval, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, PR = prevalence ratio.\nStratifying by sex did not significantly change our results, with the exception of electrolyte disorders (PR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09\u20131.38 in males but not statistically significant in females) and pneumonia (PR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82\u20130.94 in males; PR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86\u20131.00 in females) (Appendix 3, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1).\nCost of admissions\nThe median costs of admission (Table 2) for each of the most common reasons for admission among patients with diabetes were $12 916 for delirium, $10 722 for sepsis, $8794 for soft tissue and bone infections, $8270 for stroke, $6821 for heart failure, $6301 for acute renal failure, $6278 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, $6183 for pneumonia, $5442 for urinary tract infection and $4422 for electrolyte disorders.\nThe CRs for these conditions (Figure 2, Table 3) showed that admission for soft tissue and bone infections (CR 1.50, 95% CI 1.37\u20131.65), urinary tract infection (CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), electrolyte disorders (CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34) and stroke (CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25) were more costly among patients with diabetes compared with those without. The proportional difference in cost of admission for heart failure, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were statistically significant but were not greater than our threshold of 10%.\nCost ratios with error bars of most responsible reasons for diagnosis. Note: CI = confidence interval, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CR = cost ratio.\nStratifying by sex did not significantly change our results, with the exception of acute renal failure (CR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.26 in females; not statistically significant in males), urinary tract infection (CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.28 in females; not statistically significant in males) and sepsis (CR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15\u20131.35 in males; not statistically significant in females) (Appendix 3).\nSensitivity analyses\nSensitivity analyses that used only the first hospital admission for each patient (n = 96 073) did not significantly change our results. Adjustment for age is included in the CIHI RIW methodology used for cost estimation, and adjustment for inflation did not significantly change our results14 (Appendices 4 and 5, available at www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/2/E406/suppl/DC1).\nInterpretation\nIn our study of patients admitted to the general internal medicine services at 7 Toronto hospitals, nearly one-third had diabetes. Soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders were more frequent and costly among patients with diabetes than among patients without. In addition, hospital admissions for acute renal failure, heart failure, sepsis and delirium occurred at a greater frequency in the diabetes population, but not at an increased cost.\nDiabetes is a highly prevalent and potential driver of illness among patients admitted to hospital. A recent study found hypertension to be the most common comorbid condition among patients admitted to hospital with diabetes as the primary reason for admission.23 However, as we have shown, diabetes itself is rarely a reason for admission; rather, its associated morbidities frequently lead to hospital admissions owing to complications including soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders. This study provides essential information for clinicians and policy makers to understand the broader impact of diabetes on hospital admissions.\nOur findings on stroke add to existing knowledge: patients with diabetes have about twice the risk of stroke as those without diabetes.24 Rates of stroke have fallen substantially over the last few decades in response to the growing evidence in support of cardioprotective therapies and their adoption in clinical practice.25 Yet, based on our evidence, admissions for stroke remain more common in patients with diabetes.\nCompared with stroke prevention, the prevention of soft tissue and bone infections has received less attention in the research literature, potentially at the expense of increased morbidity and mortality.26 In Canada and the US, decades of improvements in rates of nontraumatic lower-extremity amputations in patients with diabetes have recently reversed, especially among younger adults.27\u201329 A 2017 international meta-analysis comparing the prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers across 33 countries has found Canada (14.8%) to have the second highest rate, after Belgium (16.6%).30 Foot care is one of the most neglected components of standard diabetes care practices, with only 51% of Canadian patients with diabetes having their feet checked as recommended.31 With the exception of recent coverage in Ontario, offloading devices are not currently covered for Canadians with diabetes who have foot ulcers.32 In addition, the prevalence of diabetes is higher in lower-income households,33 providing real-life context to the 57% of Canadians with diabetes who cannot afford their necessary medications, devices and supplies.34\nTo curb such trends in soft tissue and bone infections, proven preventive measures, including regular foot examination, debridement, mechanical offloading devices and chiropody, must not only be available, but also easily accessible for patients with diabetes who often lack economic or social capital. As part of increasing efforts to integrate information technology into medicine,35 the use of telemedicine36 and social media37 in diabetes foot care may help fill in gaps in accessibility and knowledge dissemination. Given the projected increase in the burden of diabetic foot ulcers, including frequent and costly admissions to hospital as shown in our study, increased primary care efforts and public funding should be directed specifically toward proven preventive strategies and modernized approaches.38\nMost of the diabetes-related conditions identified in our study were vascular in nature, except for urinary tract infections, delirium and electrolyte disorders. The increased burden of hospital admission secondary to urinary tract infections in patients with diabetes is consistent with existing knowledge. 39 Diabetes is associated with a higher risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, urinary tract infections and severe complications. Whether patients with diabetes should be treated if they have asymptomatic bacteriuria is unknown and may be an important focus of future research. In addition, ongoing review of the safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, which are gaining prominence in diabetes care, is needed to understand its impact on urinary tract infections among patients with diabetes.40\nAlthough delirium may be caused by any of the identified comorbid conditions, there is limited literature on how diabetes itself can predispose an individual to delirium. Diabetes has been associated with both Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia,41 yet studies on its association with delirium have yielded mixed results and have been conducted primarily in an intensive care setting.42 One plausible hypothesis is that the generation of microvascular malformations in the central nervous system from persistent metabolic derangements leads to endothelial damage and deregulated angiogenesis.43 Given that the prevalence of delirium among our patients with diabetes was 15% greater than among those without, further studies are warranted to understand the mechanism behind this increased prevalence.\nElectrolyte disorders were one of the most frequent and costly reasons for admission in patients with diabetes, yet preventive strategies are lacking. The multifactorial nature of its pathophysiology in diabetes, likely including poor nutrition, impaired gastrointestinal absorption, acid\u2013base abnormalities and pharmacological agents, makes electrolyte abnormalities a challenging condition to prevent.44 Further studies that aim to elucidate the individual pathophysiologic mechanisms of electrolyte disorders in patients with diabetes will be necessary to develop outpatient strategies for monitoring and prevention.\nFinally, heart failure was the most common reason for hospital admission among patients with diabetes, a relation that has been well established.45 New treatment options for this particular demographic have been emerging. For instance, a meta-analysis evaluating cardiovascular outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors found that these medications have shown promising effects of reducing hospital admissions secondary to heart failure by about 30%, regardless of presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heart failure at baseline.46\nLimitations\nThere are several limitations to our study. Our patients with diabetes were restricted to those who were admitted to a general internal medicine service for some portion of their hospital admission and did not include patients admitted to surgical, psychiatric or subspecialty medical services. Thus, the frequency of admissions secondary to diabetes-related complications or severe complications may be underestimated. However, more than one-third of emergency department admissions are to a general internal medicine service; therefore, our data capture the largest group of patients requiring hospital admission and represent a crucial health services group on which to focus.11\nOur cost estimates did not take physician billing and outpatient expenses into account; therefore, the costs of admission may have been underestimated, which may have affected the CR methods we adopted. Using the RIW, we were able to estimate the cost of hospital admission, but not out-of-pocket costs such as mechanical offloading devices. However, RIW has been used previously in similar studies7,47 and provides a reasonable and comparable estimation of the direct health care costs attributable to diabetes.\nThere remains a residual risk of clustering at the hospital, physician and admission levels. We conducted sensitivity analyses using only the first hospital admission, and the results were robust. Our patient population came from only 2 cities in Canada. However, our inclusion of the 5 largest hospitals in Toronto and the only 2 hospitals in Mississauga, Canada\u2019s first and ninth most populous municipalities respectively, adds to the generalizability of our findings. Lastly, the number of comorbid conditions in the comparison of patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes was not adjusted.\nConclusion\nA substantial portion of acute hospital admissions are associated with diabetes. Our study characterizes the frequency and costs associated with acute inpatient hospital admissions to a general internal medicine service from various diabetes-related conditions. Based on our findings, a preventive strategy focused on reducing hospital admissions secondary to soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke and electrolyte disorders in patients with diabetes may be beneficial in this high-risk group.\nSupplementary Material\nFootnotes\nCompeting interests: Amol Verma and Fahad Razak report that they are part-time employees of Health Quality Ontario.

    "Summarized_Document": "Background: Acute inpatient hospital admissions account for over half of all healthcare costs related to diabetes. This study aimed to identify the most common and costly conditions leading to hospital admission among patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. Methods: Data from the GEMINI study, involving 7 Toronto hospitals between 2010 and 2015, was used. The CIHI Most Responsible Diagnosis code identified the 10 most frequent reasons for admission in patients with diabetes. Cost was estimated using the CIHI Resource Intensity Weight. Results: Out of 150,499 hospital admissions, 41,934 (27.8%) involved patients with diabetes. Soft tissue and bone infections were the most frequent (2.5% vs. 1.9%; PR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.37) and costly (Can$8794 vs. Can$5845; CR 1.50, 95% CI 1.37\u20131.65) among patients with diabetes. This was followed by urinary tract infections (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.22; CR 1.23, 95% CI 1.17\u20131.29), stroke (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.19; CR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.25), and electrolyte disorders (PR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.20; CR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.34). Interpretation: Soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke, and electrolyte disorders are associated with greater frequency and cost of hospital admissions in patients with diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing these admissions may be beneficial. Diabetes is a significant burden on healthcare systems globally, with nearly 1 in 10 people diagnosed in Canada and the US. Acute inpatient hospital admissions are the primary driver of diabetes-related healthcare costs. This study provides population-level data to guide public policy in strengthening outpatient services for people with diabetes. Methods: The GEMINI study involved 7 large hospital sites in Toronto. Data included patient characteristics, diagnoses, interventions, and discharge destinations. Costs were estimated using CIHI RIW and the Ontario Cost Distribution Methodology. Statistical analysis used Pearson \u03c72 test for frequency and distribution-free CIs for median cost. Results: Among 150,499 admissions, 41,934 (27.8%) were in patients with diabetes. The most frequent reasons for admission were heart failure (7.7%), urinary tract infection (5.1%), stroke (4.8%), pneumonia (4.6%), COPD (4.4%), delirium (3.2%), acute renal failure (2.9%), sepsis (2.8%), soft tissue and bone infections (2.5%), and electrolyte disorders (2.4%). The median costs of admission for these conditions ranged from $4422 to $12,916. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Conclusion: A substantial portion of acute hospital admissions are associated with diabetes. Preventive strategies focused on reducing admissions for soft tissue and bone infections, urinary tract infections, stroke, and electrolyte disorders may benefit this high-risk group.",

The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.\n1Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.\n\"Our first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations on both the top and bottom line, tracking the trajectory we outlined for this year and setting up a return to growth in the second quarter,\" said Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation. \"Our topline performance improved for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in our digital business led by strength in our same-day fulfillment services. Consumers continue to respond to the newness and value that we offer across our shopping experience, and we're pleased with early results from the relaunch of Target Circle. Looking ahead, our team will deliver for our guests through lower prices, a seasonally relevant assortment, ease and convenience, as we keep investing in our strategy and efficiency initiatives to get back to growth and deliver on our longer-term financial goals.\"\nGuidance\nFor the second quarter, the Company expects a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.95 to $2.35.\nFor the full year, the Company continues to expect a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60.\nOperating Results\nComparable sales declined 3.7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a comparable store sales decline of 4.8 percent partially offset by a comparable digital sales increase of 1.4 percent. Total revenue of $24.5 billion was 3.1 percent lower than last year, reflecting a total sales decline of 3.2 percent and a 3.9 percent increase in other revenue. First quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was 2.4 percent lower than last year, driven by lower sales volume.\nFirst\u00a0quarter operating income margin rate was 5.3 percent in 2024, compared with 5.2 percent in 2023. First quarter gross margin rate was 27.7 percent, compared with 26.3 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of merchandising activities, including cost improvements that more than offset higher promotional markdown rates, combined with favorable category mix and lower book to physical inventory adjustments as compared to the prior year.\u00a0 First quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.1 percent in 2024, compared with 19.8 percent in 2023, reflecting the combined impact of lower sales and higher costs, including continued investments in pay and benefits and marketing, partially offset by disciplined cost management.\nInterest Expense and Taxes\nThe Company's first quarter 2024 net interest expense was $106 million, compared with $147 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in interest income reflecting higher cash balances year-over-year.\nFirst\u00a0quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.7 percent, compared with the prior year rate of 21.1 percent, reflecting lower discrete benefits as compared to the prior year.\nCapital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital\nThe Company paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, compared with $497 million last year, reflecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.\nThe Company did not repurchase any stock in the first quarter.\u00a0 As of the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by Target's Board of Directors in August 2021.\nFor the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2024, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.4 percent, compared with 11.4 percent for the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2023. The increase in ROIC reflects higher operating income, partially offset by higher average invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information about the Company's ROIC calculation.\nWebcast Details\nTarget will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call at 7:00 a.m. CT today. Investors and the media are invited to listen to the meeting at Corporate.Target.com/Investors (click on \"Q1 2024 Target Corporation Earnings Conference Call\" under \"Events & Presentations\").

The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.\n1Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.\n\"Our first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations on both the top and bottom line, tracking the trajectory we outlined for this year and setting up a return to growth in the second quarter,\" said Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation. \"Our topline performance improved for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in our digital business led by strength in our same-day fulfillment services. Consumers continue to respond to the newness and value that we offer across our shopping experience, and we're pleased with early results from the relaunch of Target Circle. Looking ahead, our team will deliver for our guests through lower prices, a seasonally relevant assortment, ease and convenience, as we keep investing in our strategy and efficiency initiatives to get back to growth and deliver on our longer-term financial goals.\"\nGuidance\nFor the second quarter, the Company expects a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.95 to $2.35.\nFor the full year, the Company continues to expect a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60.\nOperating Results\nComparable sales declined 3.7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a comparable store sales decline of 4.8 percent partially offset by a comparable digital sales increase of 1.4 percent. Total revenue of $24.5 billion was 3.1 percent lower than last year, reflecting a total sales decline of 3.2 percent and a 3.9 percent increase in other revenue. First quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was 2.4 percent lower than last year, driven by lower sales volume.\nFirst\u00a0quarter operating income margin rate was 5.3 percent in 2024, compared with 5.2 percent in 2023. First quarter gross margin rate was 27.7 percent, compared with 26.3 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of merchandising activities, including cost improvements that more than offset higher promotional markdown rates, combined with favorable category mix and lower book to physical inventory adjustments as compared to the prior year.\u00a0 First quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.1 percent in 2024, compared with 19.8 percent in 2023, reflecting the combined impact of lower sales and higher costs, including continued investments in pay and benefits and marketing, partially offset by disciplined cost management.\nInterest Expense and Taxes\nThe Company's first quarter 2024 net interest expense was $106 million, compared with $147 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in interest income reflecting higher cash balances year-over-year.\nFirst\u00a0quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.7 percent, compared with the prior year rate of 21.1 percent, reflecting lower discrete benefits as compared to the prior year.\nCapital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital\nThe Company paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, compared with $497 million last year, reflecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.\nThe Company did not repurchase any stock in the first quarter.\u00a0 As of the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by Target's Board of Directors in August 2021.\nFor the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2024, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.4 percent, compared with 11.4 percent for the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2023. The increase in ROIC reflects higher operating income, partially offset by higher average invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information about the Company's ROIC calculation.\nWebcast Details\nTarget will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call at 7:00 a.m. CT today.

The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.\n1Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.\n\"Our first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations on both the top and bottom line, tracking the trajectory we outlined for this year and setting up a return to growth in the second quarter,\" said Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation. \"Our topline performance improved for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in our digital business led by strength in our same-day fulfillment services. Consumers continue to respond to the newness and value that we offer across our shopping experience, and we're pleased with early results from the relaunch of Target Circle. Looking ahead, our team will deliver for our guests through lower prices, a seasonally relevant assortment, ease and convenience, as we keep investing in our strategy and efficiency initiatives to get back to growth and deliver on our longer-term financial goals.\"\nGuidance\nFor the second quarter, the Company expects a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.95 to $2.35.\nFor the full year, the Company continues to expect a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60.\nOperating Results\nComparable sales declined 3.7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a comparable store sales decline of 4.8 percent partially offset by a comparable digital sales increase of 1.4 percent. Total revenue of $24.5 billion was 3.1 percent lower than last year, reflecting a total sales decline of 3.2 percent and a 3.9 percent increase in other revenue. First quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was 2.4 percent lower than last year, driven by lower sales volume.\nFirst\u00a0quarter operating income margin rate was 5.3 percent in 2024, compared with 5.2 percent in 2023. First quarter gross margin rate was 27.7 percent, compared with 26.3 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of merchandising activities, including cost improvements that more than offset higher promotional markdown rates, combined with favorable category mix and lower book to physical inventory adjustments as compared to the prior year.\u00a0 First quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.1 percent in 2024, compared with 19.8 percent in 2023, reflecting the combined impact of lower sales and higher costs, including continued investments in pay and benefits and marketing, partially offset by disciplined cost management.\nInterest Expense and Taxes\nThe Company's first quarter 2024 net interest expense was $106 million, compared with $147 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in interest income reflecting higher cash balances year-over-year.\nFirst\u00a0quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.7 percent, compared with the prior year rate of 21.1 percent, reflecting lower discrete benefits as compared to the prior year.\nCapital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital\nThe Company paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, compared with $497 million last year, reflecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.\nThe Company did not repurchase any stock in the first quarter.\u00a0 As of the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by Target's Board of Directors in August 2021.\nFor the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2024, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.4 percent, compared with 11.4 percent for the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2023. The increase in ROIC reflects higher operating income, partially offset by higher average invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information about the Company's ROIC calculation.\nWebcast Details\nTarget will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call at 7:00 a.m. CT today. Investors and the media are invited to listen to the meeting at Corporate.Target.com/Investors (click on \"Q1 2024 Target Corporation Earnings Conference Call\" under \"Events & Presentations\").

At the same time, not enough stock causes slow order fulfillment, the potential for missed sales, and lost revenue.\nReorder point (ROP) is a supply chain management technique that businesses can use to guide this delicate balancing act to improve inventory operations, avoid stockouts, and maintain ideal inventory levels.\nWhat is the reorder point?\nThe reorder point is the minimum number of units a company needs to have in stock to fill sales orders or meet production targets. Once inventory dips below the calculated reorder point, replenishment is triggered through a new purchase order.\nRegularly calculating reorder points removes the mystery from inventory cost control and helps your business maintain optimal service levels.\nWhy should your business know your reorder points?\nReorder points help to ensure products and cash flow in the right direction, at the right time. With accurate reorder points for all of your product SKUs, you can meet customer demand in a timely fashion to improve cash flow and avoid the bloated costs of overstock.\nPrimary business benefits of using reorder points include the following:\nCost control\nInventory\u00a0carrying costs\u00a0typically account for 15-30% of total inventory costs. This affects the profit margin on goods sold. By using the most optimal reorder levels, businesses can keep storage and warehousing costs low to protect profits. \nOptimal inventory levels\nBy reordering a predetermined amount of replenishment inventory according to demand forecasts, you can avoid sunk costs from inventory shrinkage and obsolescence.\nSupply chain optimization\n The reorder point calculation takes into account delivery lead time from suppliers. By keeping track of average delivery lead time, you can identify your most reliable and least reliable suppliers and make more informed\u00a0procurement decisions.\nImproved forecasting\nTo accurately calculate reorder points, you\u2019ll need to have strong records on sales volume and trends over a certain time period. As you build this body of data, you can improve forecasting to better meet customer demand.\nNow, let\u2019s see how to find the reorder point.\nHow does the reorder point formula work?\nThe reorder point formula takes into account three factors: average daily sales or usage, average delivery lead time, and safety stock.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nFirst, let\u2019s define all of the components that make up this equation.\nComponents of the reorder equation\nAverage daily sales or usage\n Average daily sales is the average number of units sold or used per day over a defined time period. Three months or 90 days is a good starting increment to use. A retailer would measure the average number of units sold, while a manufacturer would calculate the average number of components used per day. \nLet\u2019s say you sold 40 units of an item in March, 60 in April, and 46 in May.\nOver those three months (or 92 days) that averages out to 1.5 units sold on average per day.\nAverage delivery lead time\n Average delivery lead time is the average amount of time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the time the order was placed. Average delivery lead time changes with fluctuations in seasonal demand, the quantity ordered, and distance from the up-chain supplier. For a reasonable measure, take an average of the past three months of POs for the SKU item you want to set a reorder point for. If your sales cycle is longer or shorter, adjust accordingly. \nSafety stock\nSafety stock\u00a0is the amount of inventory a business holds to mitigate the risk of shortages or stockouts. The safety stock calculation is the difference between the maximum daily sales/usage and lead time, and the average daily usage and lead time. \n(Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time)\n Let\u2019s say a manufacturer used 10 units of a component on their busiest day of production. The longest time it would take the supplier to deliver this component is 15 days. And let\u2019s assume that the average daily use is 1.5 units, and the average lead time is 12 days. \n(10 x 15) \u2013 (1.5 x 12)\n150 \u2013 18 = 132\u00a0\nThe manufacturer should hold 132 safety stock units to avoid bottlenecks in production.\nThe reorder point formula in action\nNow we\u2019ve got all reorder point sub-metrics ready. Let\u2019s continue with the manufacturer example and calculate the reorder point.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nAverage daily usage = 1.5 units\nAverage lead team = 12 days\nSafety stock = 132 units\n(1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150\nTherefore, the manufacturer should reorder this component when stock falls to 150 units. By doing so, the company can prevent stockouts and avoid dipping into safety stock while they wait for new stock to arrive.\nHow to start using the reorder point formula in your business\nIf you have at least one procurement cycle and one sales cycle worth of data, you can start using the reorder point formula to improve your inventory operations.\nBusinesses with a limited number of products can start with excel spreadsheets and format cells to turn red when inventory levels reach the reorder point.\nFor growing\u00a0retailers,\u00a0manufacturers, or\u00a0wholesalers, working with dozens or hundreds of spreadsheets can be time-consuming and error-prone. If your business falls into this category, consider the benefits of\u00a0inventory management software.\n A modern inventory management system can bring greater efficiency to inventory processes through automation and digital tools. For example, real-time inventory tracking allows staff to see what\u2019s in stock, what\u2019s on order, and where each item is located. Software tools can also collect and present data on purchase orders, sales fulfillment, and demand forecasting on a single user dashboard. \n With this information readily available, inventory managers can avoid wasting time manually searching through spreadsheets and crunching numbers. Some inventory management tools also enable businesses to generate customized reports on inventory stock by item, vendor, delivery date, assembly, and more. Rich inventory insights like these empower businesses to fine-tune their reorder points and overall inventory management processes. \nFinal thoughts\nKeep in mind, reorder points are not static. Sales volumes fluctuate, and supply delivery times vary. Demand for certain product lines may grow or fall.\nTo maintain an accurate reorder point, check the underlying metrics \u2014 average daily sales/usage and average lead time \u2014 at least once per quarter. If you have a high season and low season, or seasonal bad weather that slows down deliveries, factor this in.\nAn effective reorder point ensures that your business keeps flowing\u2014 it helps you fulfill orders quickly, protects your margins, and keeps customers happy.\nRecommended for you\nMidsize business\nWhat is the safety stock formula?

Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time).For example, if a manufacturer uses 1.5 units daily on average, with an average lead time of 12 days and a safety stock of 132 units, the reorder point would be (1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150 units. This means the manufacturer should reorder when stock falls to 150 units to avoid stockouts.Businesses can start using the reorder point formula with at least one procurement and sales cycle worth of data. Small businesses might use spreadsheets, while larger operations may benefit from inventory management software for greater efficiency and accuracy. These tools can automate processes, provide real-time tracking, and generate detailed reports to fine-tune inventory management.Reorder points should be reviewed at least quarterly to account for fluctuations in sales volumes and delivery times.

At the same time, not enough stock causes slow order fulfillment, the potential for missed sales, and lost revenue.\nReorder point (ROP) is a supply chain management technique that businesses can use to guide this delicate balancing act to improve inventory operations, avoid stockouts, and maintain ideal inventory levels.\nWhat is the reorder point?\nThe reorder point is the minimum number of units a company needs to have in stock to fill sales orders or meet production targets. Once inventory dips below the calculated reorder point, replenishment is triggered through a new purchase order.\nRegularly calculating reorder points removes the mystery from inventory cost control and helps your business maintain optimal service levels.\nWhy should your business know your reorder points?\nReorder points help to ensure products and cash flow in the right direction, at the right time. With accurate reorder points for all of your product SKUs, you can meet customer demand in a timely fashion to improve cash flow and avoid the bloated costs of overstock.\nPrimary business benefits of using reorder points include the following:\nCost control\nInventory\u00a0carrying costs\u00a0typically account for 15-30% of total inventory costs. This affects the profit margin on goods sold. By using the most optimal reorder levels, businesses can keep storage and warehousing costs low to protect profits. \nOptimal inventory levels\nBy reordering a predetermined amount of replenishment inventory according to demand forecasts, you can avoid sunk costs from inventory shrinkage and obsolescence.\nSupply chain optimization\n The reorder point calculation takes into account delivery lead time from suppliers. By keeping track of average delivery lead time, you can identify your most reliable and least reliable suppliers and make more informed\u00a0procurement decisions.\nImproved forecasting\nTo accurately calculate reorder points, you\u2019ll need to have strong records on sales volume and trends over a certain time period. As you build this body of data, you can improve forecasting to better meet customer demand.\nNow, let\u2019s see how to find the reorder point.\nHow does the reorder point formula work?\nThe reorder point formula takes into account three factors: average daily sales or usage, average delivery lead time, and safety stock.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nFirst, let\u2019s define all of the components that make up this equation.\nComponents of the reorder equation\nAverage daily sales or usage\n Average daily sales is the average number of units sold or used per day over a defined time period. Three months or 90 days is a good starting increment to use. A retailer would measure the average number of units sold, while a manufacturer would calculate the average number of components used per day. \nLet\u2019s say you sold 40 units of an item in March, 60 in April, and 46 in May.\nOver those three months (or 92 days) that averages out to 1.5 units sold on average per day.\nAverage delivery lead time\n Average delivery lead time is the average amount of time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the time the order was placed. Average delivery lead time changes with fluctuations in seasonal demand, the quantity ordered, and distance from the up-chain supplier. For a reasonable measure, take an average of the past three months of POs for the SKU item you want to set a reorder point for. If your sales cycle is longer or shorter, adjust accordingly. \nSafety stock\nSafety stock\u00a0is the amount of inventory a business holds to mitigate the risk of shortages or stockouts. The safety stock calculation is the difference between the maximum daily sales/usage and lead time, and the average daily usage and lead time. \n(Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time)\n Let\u2019s say a manufacturer used 10 units of a component on their busiest day of production. The longest time it would take the supplier to deliver this component is 15 days. And let\u2019s assume that the average daily use is 1.5 units, and the average lead time is 12 days. \n(10 x 15) \u2013 (1.5 x 12)\n150 \u2013 18 = 132\u00a0\nThe manufacturer should hold 132 safety stock units to avoid bottlenecks in production.\nThe reorder point formula in action\nNow we\u2019ve got all reorder point sub-metrics ready. Let\u2019s continue with the manufacturer example and calculate the reorder point.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nAverage daily usage = 1.5 units\nAverage lead team = 12 days\nSafety stock = 132 units\n(1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150\nTherefore, the manufacturer should reorder this component when stock falls to 150 units. By doing so, the company can prevent stockouts and avoid dipping into safety stock while they wait for new stock to arrive.\nHow to start using the reorder point formula in your business\nIf you have at least one procurement cycle and one sales cycle worth of data, you can start using the reorder point formula to improve your inventory operations.\nBusinesses with a limited number of products can start with excel spreadsheets and format cells to turn red when inventory levels reach the reorder point.\nFor growing\u00a0retailers,\u00a0manufacturers, or\u00a0wholesalers, working with dozens or hundreds of spreadsheets can be time-consuming and error-prone. If your business falls into this category, consider the benefits of\u00a0inventory management software.\n A modern inventory management system can bring greater efficiency to inventory processes through automation and digital tools. For example, real-time inventory tracking allows staff to see what\u2019s in stock, what\u2019s on order, and where each item is located. Software tools can also collect and present data on purchase orders, sales fulfillment, and demand forecasting on a single user dashboard. \n With this information readily available, inventory managers can avoid wasting time manually searching through spreadsheets and crunching numbers. Some inventory management tools also enable businesses to generate customized reports on inventory stock by item, vendor, delivery date, assembly, and more. Rich inventory insights like these empower businesses to fine-tune their reorder points and overall inventory management processes. \nFinal thoughts\nKeep in mind, reorder points are not static. Sales volumes fluctuate, and supply delivery times vary. Demand for certain product lines may grow or fall.\nTo maintain an accurate reorder point, check the underlying metrics \u2014 average daily sales/usage and average lead time \u2014 at least once per quarter. If you have a high season and low season, or seasonal bad weather that slows down deliveries, factor this in.\nAn effective reorder point ensures that your business keeps flowing\u2014 it helps you fulfill orders quickly, protects your margins, and keeps customers happy.\nRecommended for you\nMidsize business\nWhat is the safety stock formula?

Calculating reorder points helps maintain optimal service levels and improve cash flow.The reorder point formula is: Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock. Components of the formula include:- Average daily sales or usage: The average number of units sold or used per day over a defined period, typically three months.- Average delivery lead time: The average time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the order date, which can vary with seasonal demand and other factors.- Safety stock: Extra inventory held to mitigate the risk of shortages, calculated as (Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time).For example, if a manufacturer uses 1.5 units daily on average, with an average lead time of 12 days and a safety stock of 132 units, the reorder point would be (1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150 units. This means the manufacturer should reorder when stock falls to 150 units to avoid stockouts.Businesses can start using the reorder point formula with at least one procurement and sales cycle worth of data. Small businesses might use spreadsheets, while larger operations may benefit from inventory management software for greater efficiency and accuracy. These tools can automate processes, provide real-time tracking, and generate detailed reports to fine-tune inventory management.Reorder points should be reviewed at least quarterly to account for fluctuations in sales volumes and delivery times.

Authored by USApple Vice President of Insights and Analytics, Chris Gerlach, the report takes an in-depth look at the trends and forces \u2013 from political headwinds to weather events \u2013 that shape the U.S. apple industry.\n*The Outlook Report is based on recently released United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates. After the presentation of those numbers, USApple members met in-person to discuss current growing conditions to formulate a more up-to-date production estimate. The final USApple 2024/25 crop year forecast is an adjustment of the USDA numbers based on those conversations.\nU.S. Production\nAccording to USApple\u2019s analysis, total U.S. apple production for the 2024/25 crop year (CY) will be 259,517,252 bushels. This represents a 10.1% decrease compared to last year\u2019s final production figure.\n\u201cGrowers from across the U.S. are reporting the crop quality is excellent,\u201d said Gerlach.\nThese figures are more comprehensive than USDA data, which only look at the top seven apple-producing states. USApple analyzes the production from states outside of the top seven and adds that back into USDA\u2019s figure. It also incorporates feedback from growers based on what they\u2019re seeing in the field every day.\n\u201cDespite various challenges, the resilience and dedication of our growers have led to another promising year for apple production,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cThe data we\u2019ve gathered not only highlights the strength of our industry, but also underscores the importance of innovation and adaptability in ensuring a bountiful harvest.\u201d\nVarietal Mix\nAt the varietal level, Gala is expected to retain the top spot with more than 48 million bushels produced, accounting for around 17% of the U.S. apple market. After Gala, rounding out the top five are Red Delicious (12.3%), Granny Smith (10%), Honeycrisp (9.8%) and Fuji (9.4%).\nIn general, the varieties on the rise include Honeycrisp, Pink Lady/Cripps Pink and Cosmic Crisp\u00ae. Fuji, Rome and \u201cother\u201d varieties have remained relatively consistent compared to 2019/20 production volumes. Varieties on the decline include Gala and Red Delicious.\n\u201cWe still see strong Honeycrisp production, but it\u2019s tempered this year,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cWith volumes aligning more closely with Gala and Red Delicious, we may see production levels stabilize rather than increase dramatically in the future.\u201d\nTrade\nAccording to USDA trade data, fresh apple exports totaled 46.4 million bushels in the 2023/24 CY (July to June). This is around 14 million bushels higher than 2022/23 export levels \u2013 an astonishing 44% year-over-year increase.\nDuring the same period, fresh apple imports dropped by around one million bushels, a 15% decline.

    "Summarized_Document": "Chicago (August 16, 2024)\u2014 After record-breaking production last year, apple growers expect another high-performing year, according to a new report released by the U.S. Apple Association (USApple) at the organization\u2019s 129th annual Outlook Conference in Chicago. USApple\u2019s Industry Outlook 2024 provides the most up-to-date data and analysis on U.S. and global apple production, utilization, and trade. Authored by USApple Vice President of Insights and Analytics, Chris Gerlach, the report takes an in-depth look at the trends and forces \u2013 from political headwinds to weather events \u2013 that shape the U.S. apple industry. The Outlook Report is based on recently released United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates. After the presentation of those numbers, USApple members met in-person to discuss current growing conditions to formulate a more up-to-date production estimate. The final USApple 2024/25 crop year forecast is an adjustment of the USDA numbers based on those conversations. According to USApple\u2019s analysis, total U.S. apple production for the 2024/25 crop year (CY) will be 259,517,252 bushels. This represents a 10.1% decrease compared to last year\u2019s final production figure. \u201cGrowers from across the U.S. are reporting the crop quality is excellent,\u201d said Gerlach. These figures are more comprehensive than USDA data, which only look at the top seven apple-producing states. USApple analyzes the production from states outside of the top seven and adds that back into USDA\u2019s figure. It also incorporates feedback from growers based on what they\u2019re seeing in the field every day. \u201cDespite various challenges, the resilience and dedication of our growers have led to another promising year for apple production,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cThe data we\u2019ve gathered not only highlights the strength of our industry, but also underscores the importance of innovation and adaptability in ensuring a bountiful harvest.\u201d At the varietal level, Gala is expected to retain the top spot with more than 48 million bushels produced, accounting for around 17% of the U.S. apple market. After Gala, rounding out the top five are Red Delicious (12.3%), Granny Smith (10%), Honeycrisp (9.8%) and Fuji (9.4%). In general, the varieties on the rise include Honeycrisp, Pink Lady/Cripps Pink and Cosmic Crisp\u00ae. Fuji, Rome and \u201cother\u201d varieties have remained relatively consistent compared to 2019/20 production volumes. Varieties on the decline include Gala and Red Delicious. \u201cWe still see strong Honeycrisp production, but it\u2019s tempered this year,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cWith volumes aligning more closely with Gala and Red Delicious, we may see production levels stabilize rather than increase dramatically in the future.\u201d According to USDA trade data, fresh apple exports totaled 46.4 million bushels in the 2023/24 CY (July to June). This is around 14 million bushels higher than 2022/23 export levels \u2013 an astonishing 44% year-over-year increase. During the same period, fresh apple imports dropped by around one million bushels, a 15% decline. The joint effects of increasing exports and decreasing imports caused the already net positive fresh apple trade balance to grow to more than 42 million bushels. The surge in fresh apple exports is largely attributed to the abundant domestic supply, competitive pricing abroad, and favorable positive trade policies. \u201cThanks to the removal of previously imposed tariffs on our apples, exports to India are up nearly 4,000% year over year. We are optimistic that this critical market will continue to grow in volume and value,\u201d said Gerlach. According to United Nations (UN) data, worldwide apple production surpassed 5 billion bushels for the first time in 2022 (the latest available datapoint).

    "Document": "2024 Manufacturing Outlook for Sourcing & Supply Chain Resiliency\nKey Takeaways:\nThe Full Article:\nResilience remains a top priority for manufacturers, who continue to increase their operational visibility and transparency and become more agile to proactively address potential supply chain disruptions. To remain competitive in 2024, digital transformation solutions enabling organizations to achieve supply chain resiliency, profitability, and sustainability goals are crucial.\nAccording to KPMG, \u201csmart\u201d supply chain management and sourcing initiatives will make waves powered by advanced technologies such as automation, data analytics, digital twins, and more.\nThis article explores six main priorities that manufacturers are navigating to stay ahead of the competition in 2024:\n1. Increase Supply Chain Speed and Performance with Digitalization\nDigital transformation (DX) can significantly benefit manufacturing sourcing and procurement teams. A growing body of work shows that successful DX initiatives require effective planning and a detailed implementation plan that addresses new technology, employee training, and operational guidelines (workflows) to drive value.\nA 10-year Deloitte study of publicly traded companies worldwide finds that DX tied to an effective strategy and a comprehensive deployment and onboarding process can yield a market capitalization increase of up to 5%. By contrast, DX programs executed without the same level of rigor can cause value erosion.\nHere are two areas of strategic sourcing to consider enhancing:\nI) Streamline Supplier Communications and Revisit Strategic Sourcing Operations\nManufacturers and suppliers want to streamline their sourcing and procurement processes in the current business landscape. A survey conducted by IndustryWeek in collaboration with aPriori found that 70% of respondents want to accelerate the quoting process, and 79% prefer a 24-hour to two-week completion window.\nDigital tools like aPriori provide a centralized solution for real-time supplier collaboration and information exchange. These automated platforms eliminate the need for traditional request for quotation (RFQ) processes that are time-consuming and prone to delays.\nInstead, today\u2019s digital technologies deliver \u201cZero RFQ\u201d or automated procurement capabilities that enable manufacturing companies to:\nII) Accelerate the Product Design and Production Process\nDigital automation-driven solutions help innovators bring together teams spread across different departments. These teams can combine their efforts on a single solution covering design, manufacturing, and sourcing operations.\nWith access to real-time data and visibility into the design and production process, sourcing professionals can get involved early in product development. This helps them identify potential component shortages and recommend design alternatives and changes to an existing bill of materials (BOM). This way, manufacturing companies can avoid supply chain risks and mitigate any negative impacts that may emerge.\naPriori\u2019s real-time co-working application, aP Workspace, expedites task management and provides data audibility for decision-making. Users can access links to the application from their product lifecycle management (PLM) systems to gain actionable insights. These capabilities allow teams to collaborate seamlessly and communicate effectively, achieving their profitability and sustainability goals without reinventing existing business processes.\n2. Build a Solid Foundation for Artificial Intelligence\nManufacturers continue to make digital investments to automate processes, manage data, strengthen internal resources, and facilitate cross-functional collaboration. The result is faster and more informed business decisions for forward-thinking manufacturers.\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most alluring digital tools. S&P\u2019s 2024 Supply Chain Outlook states, \u201cWhile AI cannot prevent supply chain disruptions, if deployed in the correct manner, it could provide predictive probabilities of future disruptions.\u201d\nAI cannot work in a vacuum: It needs robust, accurate data to analyze and address specific manufacturing challenges. But as the MIT Sloan Management Review points out, \u201cManufacturing data is often localized or specific to a particular industry domain or a company\u2019s operations. As a result, there isn\u2019t a lot of relevant data available for building reliable AI models.\u201d\nAdditionally, product design, sourcing, and manufacturing data often reside in individual departments (either in systems that are not integrated or personalized spreadsheets filled with supplier information that is not easily accessible).\nCentralizing and providing access to data across the product development life cycle is central to making data-driven insights (with or without AI). Adding weight, carbon emissions, and other information to a PLM system \u2013 which already stores a bill of materials (BOM) \u2013 makes it easier for product development and sourcing teams to make decisions confidently and anticipate potential issues throughout the development process.\nManufacturers can also use automated analysis solutions like aPriori\u2019s aP Generate, which integrates with the PLM to centralize critical manufacturing information. aP Generate links to aP Design and aP Workspace in the PLM, enabling users to take further steps or ask questions for up-to-date decision-making.\nSome manufacturers are already gaining end-to-end insights using digital twins to connect product design, manufacturing processes, and individual factory capabilities. This data-driven insight is powerful on its own. And it can serve as part of a digital platform that AI can use to make additional analysis quickly.\nPrioritizing data quality is key to unlocking the full potential of AI in the manufacturing industry. With data-driven insights, manufacturers can evaluate alternatives, improve scenario planning operations, transform business models, and enhance supply chain resiliency.\n3. De-Risk Supply Chains and Evaluate Reshoring\nMaintaining a diverse supplier base and reducing overreliance on specific supplier locations mitigates risks associated with geopolitical issues, natural disasters, and other unprecedented events like the 2020 pandemic. Diversified supply chains improve resilience and ensure business continuity in today\u2019s dynamic global environment.\nOne tool that can help manufacturers with this is aPriori\u2019s Regional Data Libraries (RDLs). These digital libraries provide real-world and timely variable material and supplier production costs across 87 global regions. By utilizing this feature, innovators can assess manufacturing alternatives effectively, consider the impact of region-specific tariffs, and avoid an overreliance on specific regions with potential risks. This often leads to significant cost savings and reduced lead times.\nManufacturers can also consider the benefits of reshoring specific manufacturing operations. This can lead to a reduction in shipping costs and taking advantage of valuable tax credits. For instance, automotive manufacturers can use reshoring to redirect the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain to the U.S. This helps eliminate their dependency on semiconductors produced in China and capitalize on a $7,500 tax credit.\nIn its annual Reshoring Index report, the global consulting firm Kearney provides further insight into U.S. reshoring initiatives. Its findings include:\nRead our insights on why reshoring U.S. manufacturing could be right for you.\n4. Offset Labor Shortages via Automation\nAccording to Deloitte\u2019s 2024 Manufacturing Industry Outlook survey, nearly 80% of respondents consider labor market shortages a critical threat. To address this challenge, approximately 50% of manufacturing executives equip their production workforce with advanced digital technologies and flexible schedules. This approach aims to:\nLeading innovators like Woodward leverage aPriori\u2019s automation, simulation capabilities, and actionable insights to counteract the shortage of skilled workers. By employing aPriori, the company can achieve more with fewer resources, such as:\n5. Capitalize on Economic Tailwinds to Accelerate U.S. Manufacturing Growth\nProduct innovators can take advantage of positive economic factors supporting business growth in the upcoming year. These economic trends include:\nI) Federal Investments in Manufacturing Innovation\nThe Biden administration has introduced new measures to strengthen North America\u2019s supply chains and reduce costs. One of the measures implemented is the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act, which aims to reduce America\u2019s reliance on foreign-produced chips.\nThis federal initiative includes $231 billion to build semiconductor factories in the U.S. The program also includes a 25% tax credit for capital investments in semiconductor production to spur innovation and manufacturing in this area.\nAlongside the U.S. CHIPS initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) aims to propel clean energy and sustainable manufacturing domestically. The IRA provides more than $1.7 billion in funding and additional tax credits to incentivize manufacturers. This initiative primarily targets consumers, empowering them to purchase green products like EVs.\nCompanies across multiple industries can take advantage of the incentives offered by federal programs. For instance, the building and construction industry can capitalize on these incentives by developing energy-efficient buildings with sustainable insulation, lighting, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Similarly, federal investments to advance the clean energy sector range from EV production in the automotive industry to zero-emissions battery materials.\n6. Use the Green Supply Chain as a Competitive Advantage\nProduct manufacturers increasingly recognize the growing demand from customers and stakeholders for sustainable, green innovations. Manufacturers can achieve a net-zero future by selecting the appropriate raw materials and production processes to decarbonize their product portfolios.\nAcross the globe, several regulations have been implemented to increase sustainable manufacturing and sourcing operations. These measures include:\nThe financial impact of sustainability requires manufacturers to assign a cost to carbon as they design new products and initiate value engineering on older products. Internal Carbon Pricing (ICP) is an approach that manufacturers and other organizations use internally to assign a cost for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted. This enables manufacturing and sourcing teams to understand the cost of carbon and to compare it to traditional manufacturing costs (e.g., material, labor, and manufacturing overhead costs).\nWith an \u201capples-to-apples\u201d comparison, sourcing teams can easily evaluate carbon and other manufacturing costs. Then, they can select the suppliers that will enable them to reach their key performance indicators for cost, CO2e, and other goals.\nGain the Ability to Navigate Global Supply Chain Uncertainty\nThe ongoing process of digital transformation shapes the 2024 manufacturing outlook. This encompasses trends like Generative AI, automation, and digital twin technologies for supply chain resiliency. Advanced digital solutions like aPriori provide real-time advantages, from accelerating product design to counteracting critical labor market shortages.\nIn addition to investing in digital technologies, economic tailwinds, fueled by initiatives like the CHIPS Act, provide sustainable growth opportunities and promote reshoring.\nAt its core, this post highlights the various obstacles, opportunities, and trends that manufacturing companies can expect to face in the upcoming year.\nGet the State of Procurement Report\nSubscribe to the aPriori Blog!\nListen to Our Most Popular Manufacturing Podcasts of 2023\n13 Must-Read Manufacturing Sourcing & Procurement Posts of 2023\nRead Our 7 Best Product Sustainability and Innovation Posts of 2023\nWhat Is Design to Cost?

As we look forward to fiscal 2025, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth, EPS growth and free cash flow productivity \u2013 each in-line with our long-term growth algorithm. We remain committed to our integrated strategy \u2013 a focused product portfolio of daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority (of product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and consumer and customer value), productivity, constructive disruption and an agile and accountable organization \u2013 all aimed at delivering sustainable, balanced growth and value creation.\"\nFiscal Year ($ billions, except EPS)\nGAAP\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP*\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$84.0\n$82.0\n+2%\n\u00a0\nOrganic Sales\nn/a\nn/a\n+4%\nDiluted EPS\n$6.02\n$5.90\n+2%\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n$6.59\n$5.90\n+12%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFourth Quarter ($ billions, except EPS)\nGAAP\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP*\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$20.5\n$20.6\n\u2014%\n\u00a0\nOrganic Sales\nn/a\nn/a\n+2%\nDiluted EPS\n$1.27\n$1.37\n(7)%\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n$1.40\n$1.37\n+2%\n* Please refer to Exhibit 1 - Non-GAAP Measures for the definition and reconciliation of these measures to the related GAAP measures.\nFiscal Year 2024 Results\nThe Company reported fiscal year 2024 net sales of $84.0 billion, an increase of two percent versus the prior year. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased four percent. Higher pricing contributed four points of growth to organic sales. Shipment volumes and mix were unchanged versus the prior year.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $6.02, an increase of two percent versus prior year as the increase in net sales was partially offset by a non-cash charge to impair the carrying value of the Gillette trade name intangible asset and higher non-core restructuring charges. Core net earnings per share increased by 12% to $6.59. Currency-neutral core EPS increased 16% versus the prior year EPS.\nThe Company generated operating cash flow of $19.8 billion and net earnings of $15.0 billion for the fiscal year. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 105%, which is calculated as operating cash flow less capital spending and certain other items, as a percentage of net earnings excluding the Gillette impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria.\nThe Company returned over $14 billion of value to shareholders in fiscal 2024 via $9.3 billion in dividend payments and $5 billion of share repurchases. With the dividend increase in April 2024, this marks the 68th consecutive year that P&G has increased its dividend and the 134th consecutive year that P&G has paid a dividend since its incorporation in 1890.\nApril-June Quarter Results\nThe Company reported fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter net sales of $20.5 billion, unchanged versus the prior year. A one percent increase in all-in volume and one percent increase due to higher pricing were offset by two percentage points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased two percent. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased two percent. Mix had a neutral impact on sales growth for the quarter.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS increased six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nOperating cash flow was $5.8 billion and net earnings were $3.1 billion, with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 148%.\nApril-June Quarter Business Discussion\nApril - June 2024\nVolume\nForeign\nExchange\nPrice\nMix\nOther (2)\nNet Sales\nOrganic\nVolume\nOrganic\nSales\nNet Sales Drivers (1)\nBeauty\n(1)%\n(3)%\n3%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n(1)%\n1%\n3%\nGrooming\n2%\n(7)%\n5%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n2%\n7%\nHealth Care\n2%\n(1)%\n2%\n1%\n(1)%\n3%\n1%\n4%\nFabric & Home Care\n2%\n(1)%\n(1)%\n1%\n(1)%\n\u2014%\n3%\n2%\nBaby, Feminine & Family Care\n(1)%\n(2)%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n(3)%\n(1)%\n(1)%\nTotal P&G\n1%\n(2)%\n1%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n2%\n2%\n(1) \u00a0Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.\n(2) \u00a0Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.\nBeauty segment organic sales increased three percent versus year ago. Skin and Personal Care organic sales were unchanged as growth from increased pricing was offset by lower sales of the super-premium SK-II brand and in Greater China. Hair Care organic sales increased high single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix due to growth of premium products.\nGrooming segment organic sales increased seven percent versus year ago driven by increased pricing primarily in Latin America and volume growth from innovation.\nHealth Care segment organic sales increased four percent versus year ago. Oral Care organic sales increased high single digits due to premium product mix and volume growth in North America and Europe. Personal Health Care organic sales were unchanged as growth due to pricing and volume increases were offset by unfavorable mix due to lower incidence of cough and cold.\nFabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased two percent versus year ago. Fabric Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth driven by North America and Europe was offset by lower pricing due to increased promotional spending. Home Care organic sales increased high single digits due to volume growth from innovation and favorable product mix.\nBaby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales declined one percent versus year ago. Baby Care organic sales decreased mid-single digits due to volume declines from share losses, partially offset by premium product mix. Feminine Care organic sales increased low single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix. Family Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth was offset by unfavorable product mix.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27 for the quarter, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased by two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS were up six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nReported gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points versus year ago. Core gross margin for the quarter increased 140 basis points versus year ago, 180 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 210 basis points of productivity savings, 100 basis points of lower commodity costs and 40 basis points of pricing benefit. These were partially offset by 130 basis points of unfavorable product mix and 40 basis points of product/package reinvestments and other impacts.\nReported selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 260 basis points versus the prior year. Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 240 basis points versus year ago and 240 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 300 basis points of marketing reinvestments and 30 basis points of wage inflation and overhead investments, partially offset by 40 basis points of productivity savings and 50 basis points of net sales growth leverage and other impacts.\nReported operating margin for the quarter decreased 140 basis points due primarily to higher restructuring charges. Excluding 40 basis points of non-core restructuring charges, core operating margin for the quarter decreased 100 basis points versus the prior year, 60 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. Core operating margin included gross productivity savings of 250 basis points.\nLimited Market Portfolio Restructuring\nIn December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company said that it expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to 1.5 billion after tax, including foreign currency translation losses to be recognized upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has substantially liquidated its operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, and recorded a non-cash charge of $216 million after tax for accumulated currency translation losses. On July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 million for accumulated currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\nIntangible Asset Impairment\nIn the October-December 2023 quarter of the fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge, on intangible assets acquired as part of the Company\u2019s acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nThe impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value.\nFiscal Year 2025 Guidance\nP&G expects fiscal year 2025 all-in sales growth in the range of two to four percent versus the prior year. Foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately one percentage point to all-in sales growth. The Company expects organic sales growth in the range of three to five percent.\nP&G expects fiscal 2025 diluted net earnings per share growth in the range of 10% to 12% versus fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS of $6.02. P&G expects its fiscal 2025 core net earnings per share growth in the range of five to seven percent versus fiscal 2024 core EPS of $6.59. This outlook equates to a range of $6.91 to $7.05 per share, with a mid-point estimate of $6.98, or an increase of 6%.\nThe Company said its outlook estimates a net headwind of around $500 million after-tax from unfavorable commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. The net headwind equates to a $0.20 per share for fiscal 2025, or a three percentage drag on core EPS growth.\nIn addition, the prior fiscal year included benefits from minor brand divestitures and tax impacts that are unlikely to repeat to the same extent in the new fiscal year. Combined, these are an additional $0.10 to $0.12 headwind to core EPS.\nThe Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures without unreasonable efforts given the unpredictability of the timing and amounts of discrete items, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or impairments, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nP&G said it expects a core effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% in fiscal 2025.\nCapital spending is estimated to be in the range of four to five percent of fiscal 2025 net sales.\nP&G said it expects adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% and expects to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 to $7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures because the Company cannot predict the timing and amounts of discrete items such as acquisition and divestitures, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nThe Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:\nIncremental restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges.\nIntangible asset impairment: In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($1.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying value of the Gillette intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nWe do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.\nOrganic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nCore EPS and Currency-neutral EPS: Core net earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as useful supplemental measures of Company performance over time.\nCore gross margin and Currency-neutral Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's Core gross margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nCore selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as a percentage of sales and Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales: Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's Core selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provides a supplemental perspective to the Company's operating efficiency over time.\nCore operating margin and Currency-neutral Core operating margin: Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's Core operating margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nAdjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.\nAdjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G\u2019s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nTHE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nAmounts in millions except per share amounts\nAs Reported\n(GAAP)\n\u00a0\nIncremental\nRestructuring\n\u00a0\nIntangible\nImpairment\n\u00a0\nCore\n(Non-GAAP)\n\u00a0\nAs Reported\n(GAAP) (1)\nCost of products sold\n$\n10,348\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n(45\n)\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,303\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,613\n\u00a0\nGross profit\n\u00a0\n10,183\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n10,229\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n9,940\n\u00a0\nGross margin\n\u00a0\n49.6\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n49.8\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n48.4\n%\nCurrency impact to Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n50.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n\u00a0\n6,299\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(28\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n6,271\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5,778\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n30.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(0.2\n)%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n28.1\n%\nCurrency impact to Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperating income\n\u00a0\n3,884\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n73\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,958\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4,162\n\u00a0\nOperating margin\n\u00a0\n18.9\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.3\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n20.3\n%\nCurrency impact to Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOther non-operating income, net\n\u00a0\n98\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n248\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n346\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n195\n\u00a0\nIncome taxes\n\u00a0\n726\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(6\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n720\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n841\n\u00a0\nNet earnings attributable to P&G\n\u00a0\n3,137\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n327\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,464\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,384\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted net earnings per common share (2)\n$\n1.27\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n0.13\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.40\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.37\n\u00a0\nCurrency impact to Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n0.05\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n1.45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n\u00a0\n2,472.2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2,477.5\n\u00a0\nCommon shares outstanding -

    "Summarized_Document": "Procter & Gamble (P&G) reported its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results, highlighting strong performance despite economic and geopolitical challenges. For fiscal year 2024, net sales increased by 2% to $84.0 billion, and organic sales grew by 4%. Diluted EPS rose by 2% to $6.02, while core EPS increased by 12% to $6.59. The company generated $19.8 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $14 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, net sales remained flat at $20.5 billion, with organic sales up by 2%. Diluted EPS for the quarter decreased by 7% to $1.27, while core EPS increased by 2% to $1.40. P&G's fiscal year 2025 guidance anticipates 2-4% all-in sales growth and 3-5% organic sales growth. The company expects diluted EPS growth of 10-12% and core EPS growth of 5-7%. P&G also plans to pay around $10 billion in dividends and repurchase $6-7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025. The company faced challenges such as higher restructuring charges and an impairment charge on the Gillette intangible asset. Despite these, P&G remains committed to its integrated strategy focused on product superiority, productivity, and constructive disruption.",

As we look forward to fiscal 2025, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth, EPS growth and free cash flow productivity \u2013 each in-line with our long-term growth algorithm. We remain committed to our integrated strategy \u2013 a focused product portfolio of daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority (of product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and consumer and customer value), productivity, constructive disruption and an agile and accountable organization \u2013 all aimed at delivering sustainable, balanced growth and value creation.\"\nFiscal Year ($ billions, except EPS)\nGAAP\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP*\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$84.0\n$82.0\n+2%\n\u00a0\nOrganic Sales\nn/a\nn/a\n+4%\nDiluted EPS\n$6.02\n$5.90\n+2%\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n$6.59\n$5.90\n+12%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFourth Quarter ($ billions, except EPS)\nGAAP\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP*\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$20.5\n$20.6\n\u2014%\n\u00a0\nOrganic Sales\nn/a\nn/a\n+2%\nDiluted EPS\n$1.27\n$1.37\n(7)%\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n$1.40\n$1.37\n+2%\n* Please refer to Exhibit 1 - Non-GAAP Measures for the definition and reconciliation of these measures to the related GAAP measures.\nFiscal Year 2024 Results\nThe Company reported fiscal year 2024 net sales of $84.0 billion, an increase of two percent versus the prior year. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased four percent. Higher pricing contributed four points of growth to organic sales. Shipment volumes and mix were unchanged versus the prior year.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $6.02, an increase of two percent versus prior year as the increase in net sales was partially offset by a non-cash charge to impair the carrying value of the Gillette trade name intangible asset and higher non-core restructuring charges. Core net earnings per share increased by 12% to $6.59. Currency-neutral core EPS increased 16% versus the prior year EPS.\nThe Company generated operating cash flow of $19.8 billion and net earnings of $15.0 billion for the fiscal year. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 105%, which is calculated as operating cash flow less capital spending and certain other items, as a percentage of net earnings excluding the Gillette impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria.\nThe Company returned over $14 billion of value to shareholders in fiscal 2024 via $9.3 billion in dividend payments and $5 billion of share repurchases. With the dividend increase in April 2024, this marks the 68th consecutive year that P&G has increased its dividend and the 134th consecutive year that P&G has paid a dividend since its incorporation in 1890.\nApril-June Quarter Results\nThe Company reported fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter net sales of $20.5 billion, unchanged versus the prior year. A one percent increase in all-in volume and one percent increase due to higher pricing were offset by two percentage points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased two percent. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased two percent. Mix had a neutral impact on sales growth for the quarter.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS increased six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nOperating cash flow was $5.8 billion and net earnings were $3.1 billion, with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 148%.\nApril-June Quarter Business Discussion\nApril - June 2024\nVolume\nForeign\nExchange\nPrice\nMix\nOther (2)\nNet Sales\nOrganic\nVolume\nOrganic\nSales\nNet Sales Drivers (1)\nBeauty\n(1)%\n(3)%\n3%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n(1)%\n1%\n3%\nGrooming\n2%\n(7)%\n5%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n2%\n7%\nHealth Care\n2%\n(1)%\n2%\n1%\n(1)%\n3%\n1%\n4%\nFabric & Home Care\n2%\n(1)%\n(1)%\n1%\n(1)%\n\u2014%\n3%\n2%\nBaby, Feminine & Family Care\n(1)%\n(2)%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n(3)%\n(1)%\n(1)%\nTotal P&G\n1%\n(2)%\n1%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n2%\n2%\n(1) \u00a0Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.\n(2) \u00a0Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.\nBeauty segment organic sales increased three percent versus year ago. Skin and Personal Care organic sales were unchanged as growth from increased pricing was offset by lower sales of the super-premium SK-II brand and in Greater China. Hair Care organic sales increased high single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix due to growth of premium products.\nGrooming segment organic sales increased seven percent versus year ago driven by increased pricing primarily in Latin America and volume growth from innovation.\nHealth Care segment organic sales increased four percent versus year ago. Oral Care organic sales increased high single digits due to premium product mix and volume growth in North America and Europe. Personal Health Care organic sales were unchanged as growth due to pricing and volume increases were offset by unfavorable mix due to lower incidence of cough and cold.\nFabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased two percent versus year ago. Fabric Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth driven by North America and Europe was offset by lower pricing due to increased promotional spending. Home Care organic sales increased high single digits due to volume growth from innovation and favorable product mix.\nBaby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales declined one percent versus year ago. Baby Care organic sales decreased mid-single digits due to volume declines from share losses, partially offset by premium product mix. Feminine Care organic sales increased low single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix. Family Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth was offset by unfavorable product mix.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27 for the quarter, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased by two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS were up six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nReported gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points versus year ago. Core gross margin for the quarter increased 140 basis points versus year ago, 180 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 210 basis points of productivity savings, 100 basis points of lower commodity costs and 40 basis points of pricing benefit. These were partially offset by 130 basis points of unfavorable product mix and 40 basis points of product/package reinvestments and other impacts.\nReported selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 260 basis points versus the prior year. Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 240 basis points versus year ago and 240 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 300 basis points of marketing reinvestments and 30 basis points of wage inflation and overhead investments, partially offset by 40 basis points of productivity savings and 50 basis points of net sales growth leverage and other impacts.\nReported operating margin for the quarter decreased 140 basis points due primarily to higher restructuring charges. Excluding 40 basis points of non-core restructuring charges, core operating margin for the quarter decreased 100 basis points versus the prior year, 60 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. Core operating margin included gross productivity savings of 250 basis points.\nLimited Market Portfolio Restructuring\nIn December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company said that it expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to 1.5 billion after tax, including foreign currency translation losses to be recognized upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has substantially liquidated its operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, and recorded a non-cash charge of $216 million after tax for accumulated currency translation losses. On July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 million for accumulated currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\nIntangible Asset Impairment\nIn the October-December 2023 quarter of the fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge, on intangible assets acquired as part of the Company\u2019s acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nThe impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value.\nFiscal Year 2025 Guidance\nP&G expects fiscal year 2025 all-in sales growth in the range of two to four percent versus the prior year. Foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately one percentage point to all-in sales growth. The Company expects organic sales growth in the range of three to five percent.\nP&G expects fiscal 2025 diluted net earnings per share growth in the range of 10% to 12% versus fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS of $6.02. P&G expects its fiscal 2025 core net earnings per share growth in the range of five to seven percent versus fiscal 2024 core EPS of $6.59. This outlook equates to a range of $6.91 to $7.05 per share, with a mid-point estimate of $6.98, or an increase of 6%.\nThe Company said its outlook estimates a net headwind of around $500 million after-tax from unfavorable commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. The net headwind equates to a $0.20 per share for fiscal 2025, or a three percentage drag on core EPS growth.\nIn addition, the prior fiscal year included benefits from minor brand divestitures and tax impacts that are unlikely to repeat to the same extent in the new fiscal year. Combined, these are an additional $0.10 to $0.12 headwind to core EPS.\nThe Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures without unreasonable efforts given the unpredictability of the timing and amounts of discrete items, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or impairments, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nP&G said it expects a core effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% in fiscal 2025.\nCapital spending is estimated to be in the range of four to five percent of fiscal 2025 net sales.\nP&G said it expects adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% and expects to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 to $7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures because the Company cannot predict the timing and amounts of discrete items such as acquisition and divestitures, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nThe Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:\nIncremental restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges.\nIntangible asset impairment: In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($1.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying value of the Gillette intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nWe do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.\nOrganic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nCore EPS and Currency-neutral EPS: Core net earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as useful supplemental measures of Company performance over time.\nCore gross margin and Currency-neutral Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's Core gross margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nCore selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as a percentage of sales and Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales: Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's Core selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provides a supplemental perspective to the Company's operating efficiency over time.\nCore operating margin and Currency-neutral Core operating margin: Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's Core operating margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nAdjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.\nAdjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G\u2019s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nTHE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nAmounts in millions except per share amounts\nAs Reported\n(GAAP)\n\u00a0\nIncremental\nRestructuring\n\u00a0\nIntangible\nImpairment\n\u00a0\nCore\n(Non-GAAP)\n\u00a0\nAs Reported\n(GAAP) (1)\nCost of products sold\n$\n10,348\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n(45\n)\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,303\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,613\n\u00a0\nGross profit\n\u00a0\n10,183\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n10,229\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n9,940\n\u00a0\nGross margin\n\u00a0\n49.6\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n49.8\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n48.4\n%\nCurrency impact to Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n50.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n\u00a0\n6,299\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(28\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n6,271\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5,778\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n30.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(0.2\n)%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n28.1\n%\nCurrency impact to Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperating income\n\u00a0\n3,884\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n73\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,958\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4,162\n\u00a0\nOperating margin\n\u00a0\n18.9\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.3\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n20.3\n%\nCurrency impact to Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOther non-operating income, net\n\u00a0\n98\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n248\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n346\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n195\n\u00a0\nIncome taxes\n\u00a0\n726\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(6\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n720\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n841\n\u00a0\nNet earnings attributable to P&G\n\u00a0\n3,137\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n327\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,464\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,384\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted net earnings per common share (2)\n$\n1.27\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n0.13\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.40\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.37\n\u00a0\nCurrency impact to Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n0.05\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n1.45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n\u00a0\n2,472.2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2,477.5\n\u00a0\nCommon shares outstanding -

    "Summarized_Document": "Procter & Gamble (P&G) reported its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results, highlighting strong performance despite economic and geopolitical challenges. For fiscal year 2024, net sales increased by 2% to $84.0 billion, and organic sales grew by 4%. Diluted EPS rose by 2% to $6.02, while core EPS increased by 12% to $6.59. The company generated $19.8 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $14 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, net sales remained flat at $20.5 billion, with organic sales up by 2%. Diluted EPS for the quarter decreased by 7% to $1.27, while core EPS increased by 2% to $1.40. P&G's fiscal year 2025 guidance anticipates 2-4% all-in sales growth and 3-5% organic sales growth. The company expects diluted EPS growth of 10-12% and core EPS growth of 5-7%. P&G also plans to pay around $10 billion in dividends and repurchase $6-7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025. The company faced challenges such as higher restructuring charges and an impairment charge on the Gillette intangible asset. Despite these, P&G remains committed to its integrated strategy focused on product superiority, productivity, and constructive disruption.",

As we look forward to fiscal 2025, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth, EPS growth and free cash flow productivity \u2013 each in-line with our long-term growth algorithm. We remain committed to our integrated strategy \u2013 a focused product portfolio of daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority (of product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and consumer and customer value), productivity, constructive disruption and an agile and accountable organization \u2013 all aimed at delivering sustainable, balanced growth and value creation.\"\nFiscal Year ($ billions, except EPS)\nGAAP\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP*\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$84.0\n$82.0\n+2%\n\u00a0\nOrganic Sales\nn/a\nn/a\n+4%\nDiluted EPS\n$6.02\n$5.90\n+2%\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n$6.59\n$5.90\n+12%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFourth Quarter ($ billions, except EPS)\nGAAP\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP*\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$20.5\n$20.6\n\u2014%\n\u00a0\nOrganic Sales\nn/a\nn/a\n+2%\nDiluted EPS\n$1.27\n$1.37\n(7)%\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n$1.40\n$1.37\n+2%\n* Please refer to Exhibit 1 - Non-GAAP Measures for the definition and reconciliation of these measures to the related GAAP measures.\nFiscal Year 2024 Results\nThe Company reported fiscal year 2024 net sales of $84.0 billion, an increase of two percent versus the prior year. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased four percent. Higher pricing contributed four points of growth to organic sales. Shipment volumes and mix were unchanged versus the prior year.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $6.02, an increase of two percent versus prior year as the increase in net sales was partially offset by a non-cash charge to impair the carrying value of the Gillette trade name intangible asset and higher non-core restructuring charges. Core net earnings per share increased by 12% to $6.59. Currency-neutral core EPS increased 16% versus the prior year EPS.\nThe Company generated operating cash flow of $19.8 billion and net earnings of $15.0 billion for the fiscal year. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 105%, which is calculated as operating cash flow less capital spending and certain other items, as a percentage of net earnings excluding the Gillette impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria.\nThe Company returned over $14 billion of value to shareholders in fiscal 2024 via $9.3 billion in dividend payments and $5 billion of share repurchases. With the dividend increase in April 2024, this marks the 68th consecutive year that P&G has increased its dividend and the 134th consecutive year that P&G has paid a dividend since its incorporation in 1890.\nApril-June Quarter Results\nThe Company reported fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter net sales of $20.5 billion, unchanged versus the prior year. A one percent increase in all-in volume and one percent increase due to higher pricing were offset by two percentage points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased two percent. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased two percent. Mix had a neutral impact on sales growth for the quarter.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS increased six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nOperating cash flow was $5.8 billion and net earnings were $3.1 billion, with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 148%.\nApril-June Quarter Business Discussion\nApril - June 2024\nVolume\nForeign\nExchange\nPrice\nMix\nOther (2)\nNet Sales\nOrganic\nVolume\nOrganic\nSales\nNet Sales Drivers (1)\nBeauty\n(1)%\n(3)%\n3%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n(1)%\n1%\n3%\nGrooming\n2%\n(7)%\n5%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n2%\n7%\nHealth Care\n2%\n(1)%\n2%\n1%\n(1)%\n3%\n1%\n4%\nFabric & Home Care\n2%\n(1)%\n(1)%\n1%\n(1)%\n\u2014%\n3%\n2%\nBaby, Feminine & Family Care\n(1)%\n(2)%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n(3)%\n(1)%\n(1)%\nTotal P&G\n1%\n(2)%\n1%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n\u2014%\n2%\n2%\n(1) \u00a0Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.\n(2) \u00a0Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.\nBeauty segment organic sales increased three percent versus year ago. Skin and Personal Care organic sales were unchanged as growth from increased pricing was offset by lower sales of the super-premium SK-II brand and in Greater China. Hair Care organic sales increased high single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix due to growth of premium products.\nGrooming segment organic sales increased seven percent versus year ago driven by increased pricing primarily in Latin America and volume growth from innovation.\nHealth Care segment organic sales increased four percent versus year ago. Oral Care organic sales increased high single digits due to premium product mix and volume growth in North America and Europe. Personal Health Care organic sales were unchanged as growth due to pricing and volume increases were offset by unfavorable mix due to lower incidence of cough and cold.\nFabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased two percent versus year ago. Fabric Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth driven by North America and Europe was offset by lower pricing due to increased promotional spending. Home Care organic sales increased high single digits due to volume growth from innovation and favorable product mix.\nBaby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales declined one percent versus year ago. Baby Care organic sales decreased mid-single digits due to volume declines from share losses, partially offset by premium product mix. Feminine Care organic sales increased low single digits driven by increased pricing and favorable product mix. Family Care organic sales were unchanged as volume growth was offset by unfavorable product mix.\nDiluted net earnings per share were $1.27 for the quarter, a decrease of seven percent versus the prior year driven primarily by higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Core net earnings per share increased by two percent to $1.40. Currency-neutral core EPS were up six percent versus the prior year EPS.\nReported gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points versus year ago. Core gross margin for the quarter increased 140 basis points versus year ago, 180 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 210 basis points of productivity savings, 100 basis points of lower commodity costs and 40 basis points of pricing benefit. These were partially offset by 130 basis points of unfavorable product mix and 40 basis points of product/package reinvestments and other impacts.\nReported selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 260 basis points versus the prior year. Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales increased 240 basis points versus year ago and 240 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 300 basis points of marketing reinvestments and 30 basis points of wage inflation and overhead investments, partially offset by 40 basis points of productivity savings and 50 basis points of net sales growth leverage and other impacts.\nReported operating margin for the quarter decreased 140 basis points due primarily to higher restructuring charges. Excluding 40 basis points of non-core restructuring charges, core operating margin for the quarter decreased 100 basis points versus the prior year, 60 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. Core operating margin included gross productivity savings of 250 basis points.\nLimited Market Portfolio Restructuring\nIn December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company said that it expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to 1.5 billion after tax, including foreign currency translation losses to be recognized upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has substantially liquidated its operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, and recorded a non-cash charge of $216 million after tax for accumulated currency translation losses. On July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 million for accumulated currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\nIntangible Asset Impairment\nIn the October-December 2023 quarter of the fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge, on intangible assets acquired as part of the Company\u2019s acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nThe impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value.\nFiscal Year 2025 Guidance\nP&G expects fiscal year 2025 all-in sales growth in the range of two to four percent versus the prior year. Foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately one percentage point to all-in sales growth. The Company expects organic sales growth in the range of three to five percent.\nP&G expects fiscal 2025 diluted net earnings per share growth in the range of 10% to 12% versus fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS of $6.02. P&G expects its fiscal 2025 core net earnings per share growth in the range of five to seven percent versus fiscal 2024 core EPS of $6.59. This outlook equates to a range of $6.91 to $7.05 per share, with a mid-point estimate of $6.98, or an increase of 6%.\nThe Company said its outlook estimates a net headwind of around $500 million after-tax from unfavorable commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. The net headwind equates to a $0.20 per share for fiscal 2025, or a three percentage drag on core EPS growth.\nIn addition, the prior fiscal year included benefits from minor brand divestitures and tax impacts that are unlikely to repeat to the same extent in the new fiscal year. Combined, these are an additional $0.10 to $0.12 headwind to core EPS.\nThe Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures without unreasonable efforts given the unpredictability of the timing and amounts of discrete items, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or impairments, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nP&G said it expects a core effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% in fiscal 2025.\nCapital spending is estimated to be in the range of four to five percent of fiscal 2025 net sales.\nP&G said it expects adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% and expects to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 to $7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures because the Company cannot predict the timing and amounts of discrete items such as acquisition and divestitures, which could significantly impact GAAP results.\nThe Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:\nIncremental restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges.\nIntangible asset impairment: In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($1.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying value of the Gillette intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company.\nWe do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.\nOrganic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nCore EPS and Currency-neutral EPS: Core net earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as useful supplemental measures of Company performance over time.\nCore gross margin and Currency-neutral Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's Core gross margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nCore selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as a percentage of sales and Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales: Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core SG&A expense as a percentage of sales is a measure of the Company's Core selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provides a supplemental perspective to the Company's operating efficiency over time.\nCore operating margin and Currency-neutral Core operating margin: Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Currency-neutral Core operating margin is a measure of the Company's Core operating margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a supplemental perspective to the Company\u2019s operating efficiency over time.\nAdjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.\nAdjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G\u2019s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.\nTHE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024\n\u00a0\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nAmounts in millions except per share amounts\nAs Reported\n(GAAP)\n\u00a0\nIncremental\nRestructuring\n\u00a0\nIntangible\nImpairment\n\u00a0\nCore\n(Non-GAAP)\n\u00a0\nAs Reported\n(GAAP) (1)\nCost of products sold\n$\n10,348\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n(45\n)\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,303\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n10,613\n\u00a0\nGross profit\n\u00a0\n10,183\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n10,229\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n9,940\n\u00a0\nGross margin\n\u00a0\n49.6\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n49.8\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n48.4\n%\nCurrency impact to Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core gross margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n50.2\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n\u00a0\n6,299\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(28\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n6,271\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5,778\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n30.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(0.2\n)%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n28.1\n%\nCurrency impact to Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core selling, general and administrative expense as a % of net sales\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n30.5\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperating income\n\u00a0\n3,884\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n73\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,958\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4,162\n\u00a0\nOperating margin\n\u00a0\n18.9\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.3\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n20.3\n%\nCurrency impact to Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.4\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core operating margin\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n19.7\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOther non-operating income, net\n\u00a0\n98\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n248\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n346\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n195\n\u00a0\nIncome taxes\n\u00a0\n726\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(6\n)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n720\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n841\n\u00a0\nNet earnings attributable to P&G\n\u00a0\n3,137\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n327\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,464\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3,384\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCore EPS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted net earnings per common share (2)\n$\n1.27\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n0.13\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.40\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n1.37\n\u00a0\nCurrency impact to Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n0.05\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurrency-neutral Core EPS\n\u00a0\n$\n1.45\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n\u00a0\n2,472.2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2,477.5\n\u00a0\nCommon shares outstanding -

    "Summarized_Document": "Procter & Gamble (P&G) reported its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results, highlighting strong performance despite economic and geopolitical challenges. For fiscal year 2024, net sales increased by 2% to $84.0 billion, and organic sales grew by 4%. Diluted EPS rose by 2% to $6.02, while core EPS increased by 12% to $6.59. The company generated $19.8 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $14 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, net sales remained flat at $20.5 billion, with organic sales up by 2%. Diluted EPS for the quarter decreased by 7% to $1.27, while core EPS increased by 2% to $1.40. P&G's fiscal year 2025 guidance anticipates 2-4% all-in sales growth and 3-5% organic sales growth. The company expects diluted EPS growth of 10-12% and core EPS growth of 5-7%. P&G also plans to pay around $10 billion in dividends and repurchase $6-7 billion of common shares in fiscal 2025. The company faced challenges such as higher restructuring charges and an impairment charge on the Gillette intangible asset. Despite these, P&G remains committed to its integrated strategy focused on product superiority, productivity, and constructive disruption.",

    "Document": "\nMarch Weather in Paris France\n\n\nDaily high temperatures increase by 7\u00c2\u00b0F, from 49\u00c2\u00b0F to 56\u00c2\u00b0F, rarely falling below 40\u00c2\u00b0F or exceeding 67\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nDaily low temperatures increase by 4\u00c2\u00b0F, from 37\u00c2\u00b0F to 41\u00c2\u00b0F, rarely falling below 28\u00c2\u00b0F or exceeding 49\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nFor reference, on August 3, the hottest day of the year, temperatures in Paris typically range from 59\u00c2\u00b0F to 78\u00c2\u00b0F, while on February 8, the coldest day of the year, they range from 35\u00c2\u00b0F to 45\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nAverage High and Low Temperature in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below shows you a compact characterization of the hourly average temperatures for the quarter of the year centered on March. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day. \n\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in March in Paris\n\n\nEastgate, Washington, United States (4,999 miles away) is the far-away foreign place with temperatures most similar to Paris (view comparison). \n\n\nCompare Paris to another city: \n\n\n\nClouds \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe month of March in Paris experiences gradually decreasing cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy decreasing from 62% to 56%. \n\n\nThe clearest day of the month is March 31, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 44% of the time. \n\n\nFor reference, on December 29, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 74%, while on July 21, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 62%. \n\n\nCloud Cover Categories in March in Paris\n\n\n\nPrecipitation \n\n \n\n\n\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Paris, the chance of a wet day over the course of March is increasing, starting the month at 20% and ending it at 26%. \n\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 30% on May 22, and its lowest chance is 20% on March 2. \n\n\nProbability of Precipitation in March in Paris\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day. \n\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during March in Paris is essentially constant, remaining about 1.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.6 inches or falling below 0.2 inches. \n\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.2 inches on March 3. \n\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSun \n\n \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of March in Paris, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 36 seconds, and weekly increase of 25 minutes, 13 seconds. \n\n\nThe shortest day of the month is March 1, with 11 hours, 3 minutes of daylight and the longest day is March 31, with 12 hours, 51 minutes of daylight. \n\n\nHours of Daylight and Twilight in March in Paris\n\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Paris is 7:31 AM on March 1 and the earliest sunrise is 1 hour, 0 minutes earlier at 6:31 AM on March 30. \n\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:34 PM on March 1 and the latest sunset is 1 hour, 46 minutes later at 8:20 PM on March 31. \n\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) ends at 3:00 AM on March 31, 2024, shifting sunrise and sunset to be an hour earlier. \n\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:46 AM and sets 16 hours, 11 minutes later, at 9:57 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:41 AM and sets 8 hours, 15 minutes later, at 4:56 PM. \n\n\nSunrise & Sunset with Twilight and Daylight Saving Time in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation. \n\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in March in Paris\n\n\n\nMoon \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for March 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon. \n\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in March in Paris\n\n\n\nHumidity \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night. \n\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining around 0% throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on July 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time. \n\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in March in Paris\n\n\n\nWind \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages. \n\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.7 miles per hour throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on January 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on August 7, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour. \n\n\nAverage Wind Speed in March in Paris\n\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Paris throughout March is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 33% on March 12. \n\n\nWind Direction in March in Paris\n\n\n\nGrowing Season \n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (\u2265 32\u00c2\u00b0F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere). \n\n\nThe growing season in Paris typically lasts for 8.0 months (243 days), from around March 21 to around November 19, rarely starting before February 16 or after April 19, and rarely ending before October 23 or after December 20. \n\n\nDuring March in Paris, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 64% over the course of the month. \n\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Paris\n\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50\u00c2\u00b0F and a cap of 86\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Paris are gradually increasing during March, increasing by 50\u00c2\u00b0F, from 21\u00c2\u00b0F to 71\u00c2\u00b0F, over the course of the month. \n\n\nGrowing Degree Days in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSolar Energy \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation. \n\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Paris is increasing during March, rising by 1.4 kWh, from 2.6 kWh to 4.0 kWh, over the course of the month. \n\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in March in Paris\n\n\n\nTopography \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Paris are 48.853 deg latitude, 2.349 deg longitude, and 138 ft elevation. \n\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Paris contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 233 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 159 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (633 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (883 feet). \n\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Paris is covered by artificial surfaces (97%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (91%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and trees (23%). \n\n\n\nData Sources \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Paris, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. \n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Paris. \n\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Paris according to the International Standard Atmosphere  , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis   between the two locations. \n\n\nThe estimated value at Paris is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Paris and a given station. \n\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are: \n\n\nV\u00c3\u00a9lizy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Villacoublay Air Base (LFPV, 23%, 9 mi, southwest, 446 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis Orly Airport (LFPO, 34%, 9 mi, south, 151 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0093Le Bourget Airport (LFPB, 35%, 9 mi, northeast, 79 ft elevation change)\n\n\nPontoise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Cormeilles Aerodrom (LFPT, 9%, 22 mi, northwest, 187 ft elevation change)\n\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Paris and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data. \n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition  , by Jean Meeus. \n\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis  . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid. \n\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database  , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \n\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)  , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database  . \n\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com  . \n\n\nMaps are \u00a9 OpenStreetMap   contributors. \n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose.

The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day. \n\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in March in Paris\n\n\nEastgate, Washington, United States (4,999 miles away) is the far-away foreign place with temperatures most similar to Paris (view comparison). \n\n\nCompare Paris to another city: \n\n\n\nClouds \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe month of March in Paris experiences gradually decreasing cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy decreasing from 62% to 56%. \n\n\nThe clearest day of the month is March 31, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 44% of the time. \n\n\nFor reference, on December 29, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 74%, while on July 21, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 62%. \n\n\nCloud Cover Categories in March in Paris\n\n\n\nPrecipitation \n\n \n\n\n\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Paris, the chance of a wet day over the course of March is increasing, starting the month at 20% and ending it at 26%. \n\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 30% on May 22, and its lowest chance is 20% on March 2. \n\n\nProbability of Precipitation in March in Paris\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day. \n\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during March in Paris is essentially constant, remaining about 1.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.6 inches or falling below 0.2 inches. \n\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.2 inches on March 3. \n\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSun \n\n \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of March in Paris, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 36 seconds, and weekly increase of 25 minutes, 13 seconds. \n\n\nThe shortest day of the month is March 1, with 11 hours, 3 minutes of daylight and the longest day is March 31, with 12 hours, 51 minutes of daylight. \n\n\nHours of Daylight and Twilight in March in Paris\n\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Paris is 7:31 AM on March 1 and the earliest sunrise is 1 hour, 0 minutes earlier at 6:31 AM on March 30. \n\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:34 PM on March 1 and the latest sunset is 1 hour, 46 minutes later at 8:20 PM on March 31. \n\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) ends at 3:00 AM on March 31, 2024, shifting sunrise and sunset to be an hour earlier. \n\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:46 AM and sets 16 hours, 11 minutes later, at 9:57 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:41 AM and sets 8 hours, 15 minutes later, at 4:56 PM. \n\n\nSunrise & Sunset with Twilight and Daylight Saving Time in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation. \n\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in March in Paris\n\n\n\nMoon \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for March 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon. \n\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in March in Paris\n\n\n\nHumidity \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night. \n\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining around 0% throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on July 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time. \n\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in March in Paris\n\n\n\nWind \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages. \n\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.7 miles per hour throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on January 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on August 7, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour. \n\n\nAverage Wind Speed in March in Paris\n\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Paris throughout March is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 33% on March 12. \n\n\nWind Direction in March in Paris\n\n\n\nGrowing Season \n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (\u2265 32\u00c2\u00b0F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere). \n\n\nThe growing season in Paris typically lasts for 8.0 months (243 days), from around March 21 to around November 19, rarely starting before February 16 or after April 19, and rarely ending before October 23 or after December 20. \n\n\nDuring March in Paris, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 64% over the course of the month. \n\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Paris\n\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50\u00c2\u00b0F and a cap of 86\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Paris are gradually increasing during March, increasing by 50\u00c2\u00b0F, from 21\u00c2\u00b0F to 71\u00c2\u00b0F, over the course of the month. \n\n\nGrowing Degree Days in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSolar Energy \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation. \n\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Paris is increasing during March, rising by 1.4 kWh, from 2.6 kWh to 4.0 kWh, over the course of the month. \n\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in March in Paris\n\n\n\nTopography \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Paris are 48.853 deg latitude, 2.349 deg longitude, and 138 ft elevation. \n\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Paris contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 233 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 159 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (633 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (883 feet). \n\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Paris is covered by artificial surfaces (97%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (91%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and trees (23%). \n\n\n\nData Sources \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Paris, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. \n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Paris. \n\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Paris according to the International Standard Atmosphere  , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis   between the two locations. \n\n\nThe estimated value at Paris is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Paris and a given station. \n\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are: \n\n\nV\u00c3\u00a9lizy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Villacoublay Air Base (LFPV, 23%, 9 mi, southwest, 446 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis Orly Airport (LFPO, 34%, 9 mi, south, 151 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0093Le Bourget Airport (LFPB, 35%, 9 mi, northeast, 79 ft elevation change)\n\n\nPontoise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Cormeilles Aerodrom (LFPT, 9%, 22 mi, northwest, 187 ft elevation change)\n\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Paris and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data. \n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition  , by Jean Meeus. \n\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis  . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid. \n\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database  , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \n\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)  , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database  . \n\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com  . \n\n\nMaps are \u00a9 OpenStreetMap   contributors. \n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose.

The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day. \n\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in March in Paris\n\n\nEastgate, Washington, United States (4,999 miles away) is the far-away foreign place with temperatures most similar to Paris (view comparison). \n\n\nCompare Paris to another city: \n\n\n\nClouds \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe month of March in Paris experiences gradually decreasing cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy decreasing from 62% to 56%. \n\n\nThe clearest day of the month is March 31, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 44% of the time. \n\n\nFor reference, on December 29, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 74%, while on July 21, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 62%. \n\n\nCloud Cover Categories in March in Paris\n\n\n\nPrecipitation \n\n \n\n\n\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Paris, the chance of a wet day over the course of March is increasing, starting the month at 20% and ending it at 26%. \n\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 30% on May 22, and its lowest chance is 20% on March 2. \n\n\nProbability of Precipitation in March in Paris\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day. \n\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during March in Paris is essentially constant, remaining about 1.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.6 inches or falling below 0.2 inches. \n\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 1.2 inches on March 3. \n\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSun \n\n \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of March in Paris, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 36 seconds, and weekly increase of 25 minutes, 13 seconds. \n\n\nThe shortest day of the month is March 1, with 11 hours, 3 minutes of daylight and the longest day is March 31, with 12 hours, 51 minutes of daylight. \n\n\nHours of Daylight and Twilight in March in Paris\n\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Paris is 7:31 AM on March 1 and the earliest sunrise is 1 hour, 0 minutes earlier at 6:31 AM on March 30. \n\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:34 PM on March 1 and the latest sunset is 1 hour, 46 minutes later at 8:20 PM on March 31. \n\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) ends at 3:00 AM on March 31, 2024, shifting sunrise and sunset to be an hour earlier. \n\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:46 AM and sets 16 hours, 11 minutes later, at 9:57 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:41 AM and sets 8 hours, 15 minutes later, at 4:56 PM. \n\n\nSunrise & Sunset with Twilight and Daylight Saving Time in March in Paris\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation. \n\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in March in Paris\n\n\n\nMoon \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for March 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon. \n\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in March in Paris\n\n\n\nHumidity \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night. \n\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining around 0% throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on July 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 4% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time. \n\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in March in Paris\n\n\n\nWind \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages. \n\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Paris is essentially constant during March, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.7 miles per hour throughout. \n\n\nFor reference, on January 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on August 7, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour. \n\n\nAverage Wind Speed in March in Paris\n\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Paris throughout March is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 33% on March 12. \n\n\nWind Direction in March in Paris\n\n\n\nGrowing Season \n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (\u2265 32\u00c2\u00b0F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere). \n\n\nThe growing season in Paris typically lasts for 8.0 months (243 days), from around March 21 to around November 19, rarely starting before February 16 or after April 19, and rarely ending before October 23 or after December 20. \n\n\nDuring March in Paris, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 64% over the course of the month. \n\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Paris\n\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50\u00c2\u00b0F and a cap of 86\u00c2\u00b0F. \n\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Paris are gradually increasing during March, increasing by 50\u00c2\u00b0F, from 21\u00c2\u00b0F to 71\u00c2\u00b0F, over the course of the month. \n\n\nGrowing Degree Days in March in Paris\n\n\n\nSolar Energy \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation. \n\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Paris is increasing during March, rising by 1.4 kWh, from 2.6 kWh to 4.0 kWh, over the course of the month. \n\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in March in Paris\n\n\n\nTopography \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Paris are 48.853 deg latitude, 2.349 deg longitude, and 138 ft elevation. \n\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Paris contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 233 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 159 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (633 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (883 feet). \n\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Paris is covered by artificial surfaces (97%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (91%), and within 50 miles by cropland (58%) and trees (23%). \n\n\n\nData Sources \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Paris, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016. \n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Paris. \n\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Paris according to the International Standard Atmosphere  , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis   between the two locations. \n\n\nThe estimated value at Paris is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Paris and a given station. \n\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are: \n\n\nV\u00c3\u00a9lizy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Villacoublay Air Base (LFPV, 23%, 9 mi, southwest, 446 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis Orly Airport (LFPO, 34%, 9 mi, south, 151 ft elevation change)\n\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0093Le Bourget Airport (LFPB, 35%, 9 mi, northeast, 79 ft elevation change)\n\n\nPontoise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Cormeilles Aerodrom (LFPT, 9%, 22 mi, northwest, 187 ft elevation change)\n\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Paris and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data. \n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition  , by Jean Meeus. \n\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis  . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid. \n\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database  , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \n\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)  , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database  . \n\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com  . \n\n\nMaps are \u00a9 OpenStreetMap   contributors. \n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose.

While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands. \n\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader. \n\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page. \n\n\nLanguage\n\n\u00a9 Cedar Lake Ventures, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're permitted to use this graph as long as you provide prominent attribution with a link back close to the use of the graph.

And it's picked up the pace in recent years.\nIn the last 80 years, sea level rise has risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that total in the last 30 years, said Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's best estimates, that pace is expected to speed up\u2014dramatically.\nIt took about 80 years for the first foot. The second one will only take 30 years. The next, 20 years. And Florida could see the next foot in merely a decade after that.\n\"Sea level rise is beginning to speed up a bit,\" McNoldy said. \"If you draw a straight line it starts to not look so straight in recent decades.\"\nThat's according to NOAA's \"intermediate-high\" projection of sea level rise. The agency created a range of predictions\u2014low, intermediate-low, intermediate, intermediate-high and high\u2014to estimate what sea level rise could look like in places like Florida.\nSo far, scientists have found that we're trending toward the high end of those predictions.\n\"Presently, sea level is tracking in the intermediate-high to high, the two fastest,\" said Randall Parkinson, a coastal geologist with Florida International University. \"The other three scenarios, you might not even think about because we're already rising faster than that.\"\nThose are the same predictions used by South Florida governments when deciding how high to build new developments. But after a new bill signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis this year, local governments hoping for state money for sea rise projects have to only consider the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios, a downgrade from previous legislation that asked them to consider intermediate-low and intermediate-high scenarios.\nWhat goes into a sea rise projection?\nTwo feet of sea rise by 2060, compared to present-day levels, would be a shock to the system for Miami, where the average elevation is three feet. That's why local governments\u2014and the state\u2014are spending billions to keep streets dry.\nHowever, pinning down exactly how much sea rise South Florida could experience is a tough task.\nResearchers know the two main factors in sea level rise are the temperature of the ocean and how much the ice sheets melt. As burned fossil fuels trap more heat in the atmosphere, that heat is largely being absorbed by the ocean. Hotter water physically takes up more space than cold water, so a hotter ocean means higher sea levels. A hotter atmosphere also means gigantic ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting, pouring tremendous amounts of now-liquid water into the sea.\nThose two issues make up the lion's share of impact to rising sea levels, but South Florida also has its own unique challenges that add to rising water levels.\nThere's the fact that some parts of the land are actually sinking, a process known as subsidence. However, it's not very much\u2014the depth of two credit cards stacked on top of each other over half a decade in one spot in Miami Beach.\n\"It does add to an already dire situation, but it isn't a driving force,\" Parkinson said.\nThe one big unknown in South Florida's future of sea level rise is likely the water rushing offshore. The Gulf Stream, a massive current that moves hot water from the tropics to the frigid depths of the Arctic, has a little offshoot that runs between Florida's east coast and the Bahamas.\nThe Florida Current, as it's known, has an impact on Miami's water levels. When the current is stronger, water levels are generally a bit lower in Miami. And when it's weaker, they have been shown to rise.\nA new paper from Lisa Beal, professor of ocean sciences at UM's Rosenstiel School, and Chris Piecuch, a physical oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, found for the first time that this current may be slowing down.\n\"We found that there is a weakening. It's small,\" she said.\nThe article, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in September, suggested that the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% in the last 40 years, although it did not directly link that change to global warming.\nBeal said the findings were significant for Florida.\n\"We shouldn't get carried away that weakening of the Gulf Stream is going to double sea level rise in Miami. It isn't,\" she said. However, \"when you're so low-lying like South Florida, you'd kind of want to know because it means you reach thresholds of flooding much more quickly.\"\nBut perhaps the biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise boils down to one thing: exactly how much more pollution the world will continue to spew into the atmosphere. The lower-end predictions account for a world in which governments stop burning fossil fuels quickly, and the higher-end predictions are based on a situation where we burn even more than we are now.\n\"One of the great unknowns is, the world needs to be attempting to slow down the release of greenhouse gases,\" McNoldy said.\n\nJournal information:\nGeophysical Research Letters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  2024 Miami Herald.

    "Summarized_Document": "Sea levels are rising faster in South Florida, impacting roads and homes. Over the past 80 years, sea levels have risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that rise occurring in the last 30 years, according to Brian McNoldy from the University of Miami. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts this pace will accelerate, with the next foot of rise expected in just 30 years, then 20 years, and possibly a decade after that. Currently, sea levels are tracking towards NOAA's intermediate-high to high projections, the fastest scenarios. Local governments in South Florida use these projections to plan new developments, although recent legislation now requires them to consider only the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios for state-funded projects. The main factors driving sea level rise are ocean temperature and ice sheet melt. As fossil fuels trap more heat, the ocean absorbs it, causing water to expand and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt, adding more water to the sea. South Florida also faces land subsidence, though it's minimal. The Florida Current, part of the Gulf Stream, affects Miami's water levels; a weaker current can lead to higher sea levels. A study by Lisa Beal and Chris Piecuch found the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% over the last 40 years. The biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise is the amount of pollution the world will continue to emit. Lower-end predictions assume a rapid reduction in fossil fuel use, while higher-end predictions assume continued or increased emissions.",

Notes UK overview March overall was unsettled, wet and dull. The month began colder than normal across the UK, with temperatures across the UK cooler than average and southern areas recording notably low daily minimum temperatures (for instance, Benson in Oxfordshire recorded -4.6\u00b0C on the 3rd). Snow fell on the 2nd across parts of south west England, causing some travel disruption. However, the cool weather was replaced with milder weather for much of the rest of the month, with temperatures widely into the mid to high teens at times (for instance, a maximum of 18.8\u00b0C was recorded at Charlwood, Surrey on the 20th). Temperatures dipped again towards the end of the month, and on the 27th/28th, some areas around Plymouth and Dartmoor experienced snowy conditions overnight. Overall the weather was unsettled, with a succession of frontal systems bringing rain and wind. By mid-month, several counties including London and Kent had already provisionally experienced their whole-month average rainfall, and continued to be soaked throughout the rest of the month. The month ended on an unsettled note, with widespread showers and strong winds across the UK. Overall, the provisional mean temperature for the UK was 6.7\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above average. Southern England was much milder than areas further north, with a provisional mean temperature of 8.2\u00b0C (anomaly of 1.4\u00b0C) for southern England and 5.0\u00b0C (anomaly of 0.6\u00b0C) for Scotland. England provisionally recorded the seventh-warmest March on record in a series from 1884. The UK overall recorded provisionally 127% of the long term average rainfall for March, with much of this concentrated in the south. England and Wales both recorded more than 150% of their long term average monthly rainfall, while Scotland recorded just 90% of the average March rainfall. County Down in Northern Ireland provisionally experienced its third wettest March on record (145.9mm) in a series from 1836. As well as wet, the month was also dull, with the UK provisionally recording just 95.2 hours of sunshine (87% of the long term average). Reference climatology used for calculating anomalies is the period 1991-2020 unless otherwise stated. Weather impacts \u2022 Snow across Ireland, southwest Midlands and the Bristol area caused traffic disruption and road closures \u2022 Persistent rain across the country throughout the month, particularly in southern England, caused groundwater and surface water flooding March started with heavy snow across southern and western parts of Northern Ireland, with the Enniskillen area reporting numerous traffic incidents and several fallen trees as a result of the snow. Parts of the Peak District and south Pennines also experienced snow, with several roads reported closed for a period. Further south, a heavy hail storm in Sussex on the 1st may have contributed to a major road traffic collision on the M23. Further snow on the 2nd hit the south-western Midlands and Bristol area, with reports of several snow-related traffic incidents and the use of snow ploughs to clear a section of the M4. The rest of the month saw unsettled weather with regular bouts of rain. Ongoing groundwater flooding in Suffolk that began in February continued well into March, bringing significant traffic disruption. However, there was otherwise relatively little in the way of impactful rain up until the final week of the month. The last week of March brought rain, snow, and strong winds. Heavy rain in Cornwall on the 25th/26th as a result of a stalling weather front led to flooding; the Cornwall Fire and Rescue service reported rescuing six people from flooding incidents on the roads which included rescues from flooded cars. On the 27th, the rain turned to snow across southwest England, leading to travel disruption including reports of abandoned vehicles around Dartmoor and further road disruption in mid-Wales as the area of precipitation moved north. Strong winds and locally intense rainfall on the 28th affected southern areas of Wales and England, resulting in several incidents of surface water flooding that led to the closure of several roads in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire to allow the floodwater to drain. The month closed with scattered heavy showers on the 29th, before the weather settled a little over the Easter weekend. Monthly extremes The table below lists UK monthly weather extremes recorded at individual weather stations during March 2024 from data available on 02/04/2024.

Weather diary \u2022 Low pressure dominating, wet and windy The weather pattern for March was characterized by a series of Atlantic low pressure systems crossing the country through the month with just a brief settled spell during the 2nd week and the occasional transient ridge of high pressure. Wet and windy was the order of the day on the 1st with a deep low crossing central England, producing significant rainfall across all regions, and some very strong winds for the south coast, gusts to 80mph being reported in places. Low pressure continued to dominate through to the 6th. By the 7th, high pressure had become established over Scandinavia and the UK fell under the influence of a continental easterly until the 11th. The consequence of that was northern parts of England and all of Scotland remained mostly dry but cold, and any weather systems were pushed south, bringing more wind and rain to southern and southwestern counties. However, by the 13th, the high pressure had all but vanished, allowing a mobile westerly airstream to resume over the UK with the latest system bringing heavy and persistent rain particularly to Northern Ireland, north Wales and northwest England. Parts of Snowdonia saw nearly 100mm of rain over a 24 hour period. From the 13th to the 25th, the UK was hit by a series of depressions, with their attendant fronts bringing more wind and rain across all regions. After the 20th, the trajectory of the lows changed to approach the UK from a more southerly direction. The resulting southwesterly winds finally brought some milder conditions, with maximum temperatures widely into the mid-teens Celsius, slightly higher over southern England. After the 25th and to the end of the month, a north-south split was evident with Scotland subject to a cold and showery northeasterly airstream, with the rest of the UK milder but very wet at times. Notes The Met Office National Meteorological Library and Archive holds a near-continuous record of monthly weather reports from 1884, and this report forms a continuation of that series. The purpose of each report is to provide an overview of the weather conditions across the UK for that month. The emphasis is mainly based on observations from the surface network of weather stations. Climate series based on from data from these stations are used to provide long term context. This summary was produced on 03/04/2024 14:28. The statistics are a provisional assessment of the observational data available at the time of production. Ongoing data receipt and quality assurance processes may result in subsequent updates to the statistics presented. If you have any questions or feedback about this product, spot any data errors or omissions, or wish to obtain further data, please contact the Met Office. For historical monthly weather reports please visit the Library and Archive. o The land-surface observations presented in this report are from the Met Office official weather station network which includes both automatic weather stations and manual climate stations operated by volunteer observers. Rainfall data are from the official registered rain-gauge network which includes rain-gauges operated by a number of key partners including the Environment Agency, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and Northern Ireland Water. o The observations are carefully managed such that they conform to current best-practice observational standards as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The observations also pass through a range of quality assurance procedures at the Met Office before application for climate monitoring. o Daily and monthly maps, monthly statistics and monthly time-series are primarily based on the HadUK-Grid dataset of 1km resolution UK gridded climate data (Hollis et al, 2019). Monthly statistics from the monthly Central England temperature series 1659 (Manley, 1974) and England and Wales precipitation series from 1766 (Wigley et al, 1984) provide long term context. o The monthly lightning activity map is based on data from the Met Office ATDnet (Arrival Time Difference Network) system. This is an automatic lightning location network comprising around ten lightning outstation sensors located across Europe. o The monthly maps of mean sea level pressure and 250hPa wind speed and direction are based on the ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al, 2019). ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics.

Notes UK overview March overall was unsettled, wet and dull. The month began colder than normal across the UK, with temperatures across the UK cooler than average and southern areas recording notably low daily minimum temperatures (for instance, Benson in Oxfordshire recorded -4.6\u00b0C on the 3rd). Snow fell on the 2nd across parts of south west England, causing some travel disruption. However, the cool weather was replaced with milder weather for much of the rest of the month, with temperatures widely into the mid to high teens at times (for instance, a maximum of 18.8\u00b0C was recorded at Charlwood, Surrey on the 20th). Temperatures dipped again towards the end of the month, and on the 27th/28th, some areas around Plymouth and Dartmoor experienced snowy conditions overnight. Overall the weather was unsettled, with a succession of frontal systems bringing rain and wind. By mid-month, several counties including London and Kent had already provisionally experienced their whole-month average rainfall, and continued to be soaked throughout the rest of the month. The month ended on an unsettled note, with widespread showers and strong winds across the UK. Overall, the provisional mean temperature for the UK was 6.7\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above average. Southern England was much milder than areas further north, with a provisional mean temperature of 8.2\u00b0C (anomaly of 1.4\u00b0C) for southern England and 5.0\u00b0C (anomaly of 0.6\u00b0C) for Scotland. England provisionally recorded the seventh-warmest March on record in a series from 1884. The UK overall recorded provisionally 127% of the long term average rainfall for March, with much of this concentrated in the south. England and Wales both recorded more than 150% of their long term average monthly rainfall, while Scotland recorded just 90% of the average March rainfall. County Down in Northern Ireland provisionally experienced its third wettest March on record (145.9mm) in a series from 1836. As well as wet, the month was also dull, with the UK provisionally recording just 95.2 hours of sunshine (87% of the long term average). Reference climatology used for calculating anomalies is the period 1991-2020 unless otherwise stated. Weather impacts \u2022 Snow across Ireland, southwest Midlands and the Bristol area caused traffic disruption and road closures \u2022 Persistent rain across the country throughout the month, particularly in southern England, caused groundwater and surface water flooding March started with heavy snow across southern and western parts of Northern Ireland, with the Enniskillen area reporting numerous traffic incidents and several fallen trees as a result of the snow. Parts of the Peak District and south Pennines also experienced snow, with several roads reported closed for a period. Further south, a heavy hail storm in Sussex on the 1st may have contributed to a major road traffic collision on the M23. Further snow on the 2nd hit the south-western Midlands and Bristol area, with reports of several snow-related traffic incidents and the use of snow ploughs to clear a section of the M4. The rest of the month saw unsettled weather with regular bouts of rain. Ongoing groundwater flooding in Suffolk that began in February continued well into March, bringing significant traffic disruption. However, there was otherwise relatively little in the way of impactful rain up until the final week of the month. The last week of March brought rain, snow, and strong winds. Heavy rain in Cornwall on the 25th/26th as a result of a stalling weather front led to flooding; the Cornwall Fire and Rescue service reported rescuing six people from flooding incidents on the roads which included rescues from flooded cars. On the 27th, the rain turned to snow across southwest England, leading to travel disruption including reports of abandoned vehicles around Dartmoor and further road disruption in mid-Wales as the area of precipitation moved north. Strong winds and locally intense rainfall on the 28th affected southern areas of Wales and England, resulting in several incidents of surface water flooding that led to the closure of several roads in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire to allow the floodwater to drain. The month closed with scattered heavy showers on the 29th, before the weather settled a little over the Easter weekend.

Weather diary \u2022 Low pressure dominating, wet and windy The weather pattern for March was characterized by a series of Atlantic low pressure systems crossing the country through the month with just a brief settled spell during the 2nd week and the occasional transient ridge of high pressure. Wet and windy was the order of the day on the 1st with a deep low crossing central England, producing significant rainfall across all regions, and some very strong winds for the south coast, gusts to 80mph being reported in places. Low pressure continued to dominate through to the 6th. By the 7th, high pressure had become established over Scandinavia and the UK fell under the influence of a continental easterly until the 11th. The consequence of that was northern parts of England and all of Scotland remained mostly dry but cold, and any weather systems were pushed south, bringing more wind and rain to southern and southwestern counties. However, by the 13th, the high pressure had all but vanished, allowing a mobile westerly airstream to resume over the UK with the latest system bringing heavy and persistent rain particularly to Northern Ireland, north Wales and northwest England. Parts of Snowdonia saw nearly 100mm of rain over a 24 hour period. From the 13th to the 25th, the UK was hit by a series of depressions, with their attendant fronts bringing more wind and rain across all regions. After the 20th, the trajectory of the lows changed to approach the UK from a more southerly direction. The resulting southwesterly winds finally brought some milder conditions, with maximum temperatures widely into the mid-teens Celsius, slightly higher over southern England. After the 25th and to the end of the month, a north-south split was evident with Scotland subject to a cold and showery northeasterly airstream, with the rest of the UK milder but very wet at times. Notes The Met Office National Meteorological Library and Archive holds a near-continuous record of monthly weather reports from 1884, and this report forms a continuation of that series. The purpose of each report is to provide an overview of the weather conditions across the UK for that month. The emphasis is mainly based on observations from the surface network of weather stations. Climate series based on from data from these stations are used to provide long term context. This summary was produced on 03/04/2024 14:28. The statistics are a provisional assessment of the observational data available at the time of production. Ongoing data receipt and quality assurance processes may result in subsequent updates to the statistics presented. If you have any questions or feedback about this product, spot any data errors or omissions, or wish to obtain further data, please contact the Met Office. For historical monthly weather reports please visit the Library and Archive. o The land-surface observations presented in this report are from the Met Office official weather station network which includes both automatic weather stations and manual climate stations operated by volunteer observers. Rainfall data are from the official registered rain-gauge network which includes rain-gauges operated by a number of key partners including the Environment Agency, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and Northern Ireland Water. o The observations are carefully managed such that they conform to current best-practice observational standards as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The observations also pass through a range of quality assurance procedures at the Met Office before application for climate monitoring. o Daily and monthly maps, monthly statistics and monthly time-series are primarily based on the HadUK-Grid dataset of 1km resolution UK gridded climate data (Hollis et al, 2019). Monthly statistics from the monthly Central England temperature series 1659 (Manley, 1974) and England and Wales precipitation series from 1766 (Wigley et al, 1984) provide long term context. o The monthly lightning activity map is based on data from the Met Office ATDnet (Arrival Time Difference Network) system. This is an automatic lightning location network comprising around ten lightning outstation sensors located across Europe. o The monthly maps of mean sea level pressure and 250hPa wind speed and direction are based on the ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al, 2019). ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics.

Notes UK overview March overall was unsettled, wet and dull. The month began colder than normal across the UK, with temperatures across the UK cooler than average and southern areas recording notably low daily minimum temperatures (for instance, Benson in Oxfordshire recorded -4.6\u00b0C on the 3rd). Snow fell on the 2nd across parts of south west England, causing some travel disruption. However, the cool weather was replaced with milder weather for much of the rest of the month, with temperatures widely into the mid to high teens at times (for instance, a maximum of 18.8\u00b0C was recorded at Charlwood, Surrey on the 20th). Temperatures dipped again towards the end of the month, and on the 27th/28th, some areas around Plymouth and Dartmoor experienced snowy conditions overnight. Overall the weather was unsettled, with a succession of frontal systems bringing rain and wind. By mid-month, several counties including London and Kent had already provisionally experienced their whole-month average rainfall, and continued to be soaked throughout the rest of the month. The month ended on an unsettled note, with widespread showers and strong winds across the UK. Overall, the provisional mean temperature for the UK was 6.7\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above average. Southern England was much milder than areas further north, with a provisional mean temperature of 8.2\u00b0C (anomaly of 1.4\u00b0C) for southern England and 5.0\u00b0C (anomaly of 0.6\u00b0C) for Scotland. England provisionally recorded the seventh-warmest March on record in a series from 1884. The UK overall recorded provisionally 127% of the long term average rainfall for March, with much of this concentrated in the south. England and Wales both recorded more than 150% of their long term average monthly rainfall, while Scotland recorded just 90% of the average March rainfall. County Down in Northern Ireland provisionally experienced its third wettest March on record (145.9mm) in a series from 1836. As well as wet, the month was also dull, with the UK provisionally recording just 95.2 hours of sunshine (87% of the long term average). Reference climatology used for calculating anomalies is the period 1991-2020 unless otherwise stated. Weather impacts \u2022 Snow across Ireland, southwest Midlands and the Bristol area caused traffic disruption and road closures \u2022 Persistent rain across the country throughout the month, particularly in southern England, caused groundwater and surface water flooding March started with heavy snow across southern and western parts of Northern Ireland, with the Enniskillen area reporting numerous traffic incidents and several fallen trees as a result of the snow. Parts of the Peak District and south Pennines also experienced snow, with several roads reported closed for a period. Further south, a heavy hail storm in Sussex on the 1st may have contributed to a major road traffic collision on the M23. Further snow on the 2nd hit the south-western Midlands and Bristol area, with reports of several snow-related traffic incidents and the use of snow ploughs to clear a section of the M4. The rest of the month saw unsettled weather with regular bouts of rain. Ongoing groundwater flooding in Suffolk that began in February continued well into March, bringing significant traffic disruption. However, there was otherwise relatively little in the way of impactful rain up until the final week of the month. The last week of March brought rain, snow, and strong winds. Heavy rain in Cornwall on the 25th/26th as a result of a stalling weather front led to flooding; the Cornwall Fire and Rescue service reported rescuing six people from flooding incidents on the roads which included rescues from flooded cars. On the 27th, the rain turned to snow across southwest England, leading to travel disruption including reports of abandoned vehicles around Dartmoor and further road disruption in mid-Wales as the area of precipitation moved north. Strong winds and locally intense rainfall on the 28th affected southern areas of Wales and England, resulting in several incidents of surface water flooding that led to the closure of several roads in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire to allow the floodwater to drain. The month closed with scattered heavy showers on the 29th, before the weather settled a little over the Easter weekend.

Weather diary \u2022 Low pressure dominating, wet and windy The weather pattern for March was characterized by a series of Atlantic low pressure systems crossing the country through the month with just a brief settled spell during the 2nd week and the occasional transient ridge of high pressure. Wet and windy was the order of the day on the 1st with a deep low crossing central England, producing significant rainfall across all regions, and some very strong winds for the south coast, gusts to 80mph being reported in places. Low pressure continued to dominate through to the 6th. By the 7th, high pressure had become established over Scandinavia and the UK fell under the influence of a continental easterly until the 11th. The consequence of that was northern parts of England and all of Scotland remained mostly dry but cold, and any weather systems were pushed south, bringing more wind and rain to southern and southwestern counties. However, by the 13th, the high pressure had all but vanished, allowing a mobile westerly airstream to resume over the UK with the latest system bringing heavy and persistent rain particularly to Northern Ireland, north Wales and northwest England. Parts of Snowdonia saw nearly 100mm of rain over a 24 hour period. From the 13th to the 25th, the UK was hit by a series of depressions, with their attendant fronts bringing more wind and rain across all regions. After the 20th, the trajectory of the lows changed to approach the UK from a more southerly direction. The resulting southwesterly winds finally brought some milder conditions, with maximum temperatures widely into the mid-teens Celsius, slightly higher over southern England. After the 25th and to the end of the month, a north-south split was evident with Scotland subject to a cold and showery northeasterly airstream, with the rest of the UK milder but very wet at times. Notes The Met Office National Meteorological Library and Archive holds a near-continuous record of monthly weather reports from 1884, and this report forms a continuation of that series. The purpose of each report is to provide an overview of the weather conditions across the UK for that month. The emphasis is mainly based on observations from the surface network of weather stations. Climate series based on from data from these stations are used to provide long term context. This summary was produced on 03/04/2024 14:28. The statistics are a provisional assessment of the observational data available at the time of production. Ongoing data receipt and quality assurance processes may result in subsequent updates to the statistics presented. If you have any questions or feedback about this product, spot any data errors or omissions, or wish to obtain further data, please contact the Met Office. For historical monthly weather reports please visit the Library and Archive. o The land-surface observations presented in this report are from the Met Office official weather station network which includes both automatic weather stations and manual climate stations operated by volunteer observers. Rainfall data are from the official registered rain-gauge network which includes rain-gauges operated by a number of key partners including the Environment Agency, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and Northern Ireland Water. o The observations are carefully managed such that they conform to current best-practice observational standards as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The observations also pass through a range of quality assurance procedures at the Met Office before application for climate monitoring. o Daily and monthly maps, monthly statistics and monthly time-series are primarily based on the HadUK-Grid dataset of 1km resolution UK gridded climate data (Hollis et al, 2019). Monthly statistics from the monthly Central England temperature series 1659 (Manley, 1974) and England and Wales precipitation series from 1766 (Wigley et al, 1984) provide long term context. o The monthly lightning activity map is based on data from the Met Office ATDnet (Arrival Time Difference Network) system. This is an automatic lightning location network comprising around ten lightning outstation sensors located across Europe. o The monthly maps of mean sea level pressure and 250hPa wind speed and direction are based on the ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al, 2019). ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics.

    "Summarized_Document": "March 2024 Monthly Weather Report\n\nUK Overview\nMarch was unsettled, wet, and dull. The month began colder than normal, with notable low temperatures in southern areas (e.g., -4.6\u00b0C in Benson, Oxfordshire on the 3rd). Snow fell on the 2nd in southwest England, causing travel disruptions. Milder weather followed, with temperatures reaching up to 18.8\u00b0C in Charlwood, Surrey on the 20th. The month ended with unsettled weather, including rain and wind. The provisional mean temperature for the UK was 6.7\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above average. Southern England was milder with a mean temperature of 8.2\u00b0C, while Scotland had 5.0\u00b0C. The UK recorded 127% of the long-term average rainfall for March, with England and Wales exceeding 150% of their averages. County Down in Northern Ireland had its third wettest March on record with 145.9mm of rain. The UK recorded just 95.2 hours of sunshine, 87% of the long-term average.\n\nWeather Impacts\nSnow in Ireland, southwest Midlands, and Bristol caused traffic disruptions. Persistent rain, especially in southern England, led to groundwater and surface water flooding. Heavy snow on the 1st and 2nd caused traffic incidents and road closures. The rest of the month saw regular rain, with significant flooding in Cornwall on the 25th/26th. The month ended with heavy showers and some settled weather over Easter.\n\nMonthly Extremes\n- Highest Maximum: 18.8\u00b0C on 20th at Charlwood, Surrey\n- Lowest Maximum: 1.2\u00b0C on 2nd at Pennerley, Shropshire\n- Highest Minimum: 11.6\u00b0C on 14th at Prestatyn, Clwyd\n- Lowest Minimum: -6.9\u00b0C on 26th at Altnaharra No 2, Sutherland\n- Most Rainfall: 94.4mm on 13th at Capel Curig No 3, Gwynedd\n- Most Sunshine: 11.5 hours on 30th at Kirkwall, Orkney and 31st at Bewcastle, Cumbria\n- Highest Gust: 70Kt (81mph) on 1st and 28th at Wight: Needles Old Battery, Isle of Wight\n- Greatest Snow Depth: 12cm on 1st at Lough Navar Forest, Fermanagh\n\nMonthly Climate Statistics\n- Mean Maximum Temperature: UK 10.0\u00b0C, England 11.1\u00b0C, Wales 10.0\u00b0C, Scotland 8.1\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 9.7\u00b0C\n- Mean Minimum Temperature: UK 3.5\u00b0C, England 4.4\u00b0C, Wales 4.0\u00b0C, Scotland 1.9\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 3.5\u00b0C\n- Mean Temperature: UK 6.7\u00b0C, England 7.8\u00b0C, Wales 7.0\u00b0C, Scotland 5.0\u00b0C, Northern Ireland 6.6\u00b0C\n- Rainfall: UK 107.8mm (127% of average), England 94.3mm (162%), Wales 158.2mm (153%), Scotland 112.7mm (90%), Northern Ireland 129.2mm (149%)\n- Sunshine: UK 95.2 hours (87% of average), England 93.4 hours (80%), Wales 86.8 hours (79%), Scotland 101.4 hours (104%), Northern Ireland 88.9 hours (88%)\n- Windspeed: UK 9.9 knots, England 8.9 knots, Wales 10.7 knots, Scotland 11.4 knots, Northern Ireland 9.9 knots\n\nMonthly Time-Series\n- Mean Temperature: 6.7\u00b0C (2024), 6.0\u00b0C (2015-2024), 5.7\u00b0C (1991-2020), 4.7\u00b0C (1961-1990)\n- Rainfall: 107.8mm (2024), 96.5mm (2015-2024), 85.1mm (1991-2020), 91.0mm (1961-1990)\n- Sunshine: 95.2 hours (2024), 113.6 hours (2015-2024), 109.2 hours (1991-2020), 100.0 hours (1961-1990)\n\nWeather Diary\nMarch was dominated by Atlantic low-pressure systems, with brief settled spells.

    "Document": "Brazil \u2013 Extreme Rainfall Days in Metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo Have Risen Four-Fold\nStudy by researchers at Brazil\u2019s National Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN) reveals that etreme rainfall days in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo have risen four-fold in seven decades. The research also shows a rise in the number of consecutive dry days, suggesting that extreme rainfall events are concentrated in shorter, more widely spaced periods.\nExtreme rainfall has become increasingly common in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The capital of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest city in the southern hemisphere. The metropolitan area suffered from flooding due to heavy rain in February. Early in the month, no less than 114 millimeters (mm) fell in a single 24-hour period. This was the second highest 24-hour amount for the month since 1943, according to Brazil\u2019s National Meteorological Institute (INMET).\nAccording to a study by researchers at the Natural Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN), an agency of the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC), both the total rainfall and the frequency of extreme rainfall events in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo have increased significantly in the last seven decades.\nWhile there were practically no days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) in the 1950s, such days have occurred between twice and five times per year in the last ten years in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo, according to the authors.\nThe study was supported by S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation \u2013 FAPESP under the aegis of its Research Program on Global Climate Change (RPGCC). The findings are reported in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.\nResearchers affiliated with INMET, the National Space Research Institute (INPE) and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG-USP) also took part in the study.\n\u201cIntense rainstorms lasting a few hours with huge amounts of water, as much as 80 mm or 100 mm, are no longer sporadic events. They\u2019re happening more and more frequently,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Antonio Marengo, a senior researcher at CEMADEN and principal investigator for the study, told.\nThe researchers analyzed data collected by INMET\u2019s weather stations at IAG-USP and Santana Lookout in the northern part of the city. The analysis showed an increase in the number of days with heavy rain and in the frequency of rainfall extremes, especially during the rainy season (spring-summer).\nThe dry season used to occur between April and September in most of the state but has lasted until October in recent decades. The number of consecutive days without any rain at all has also gradually increased, suggesting that heavy rainfall events are concentrated in fewer days, interrupted by longer periods of hot dry weather.\nWith fewer cold nights and more hot days, convective rainfall is more likely to occur, increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall, the authors note.\nIn convective rainfall, the ground heats up, boosting evaporation and causing warm moist air to rise (convection). As the air ascends, it cools and forms convective clouds, which precipitate upon reaching saturation.\n\u201cWe observed a long-term trend in this kind of weather event, with very strong signs that climate change is in progress,\u201d Marengo said.\nRecords from the IAG-USP and Santana Lookout weather stations showed a four-fold increase in the number of days with rainfall exceeding 100 mm between 2000 and 2018 compared with those from the 1940s or 1960s.\nRecords from IAG-USP also showed an increase in total rainfall, in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, and in the frequency of consecutive dry days in the period 1931-2017.\n\u201cThis suggests that the increase in total rainfall in S\u00e3o Paulo in recent decades was due to an increase in \u2018heavy\u2019 precipitation, concentrated in fewer days and with longer dry spells in between,\u201d Marengo said.\nCauses\nAccording to the researchers, the changing rainfall regime in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo may be due to natural climate variability but may also be related to global warming and growing urbanization that has occurred especially in the last 40 years, which has exacerbated the occurrence of urban heat islands.\nThe growth of urbanization has transformed the region\u2019s previously exposed soil and Atlantic Rainforest remnants into sealed concrete, cement and asphalt surfaces that absorb heat while retaining no moisture. The temperature rises during the day, and as the sun goes down, the accumulated heat rises into the atmosphere, the relative humidity falls, and water evaporates rapidly from the ground to form towering cumulonimbus clouds, Marengo explained.\nIn his view, heat islands and similar effects help explain the increase in extreme rainfall events that occurred in metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo between 1933 and 2010.\nIn the last 20 years, these changes in the rainfall regime, in conjunction with the high-risk construction of buildings on hillsides and riverbanks, have led to an increase in hydrometeorological hazards, triggering disasters such as flash floods, river flooding and landslides, the authors note.\n\u201cAn extreme rainfall event isn\u2019t itself a natural disaster. So-called natural disasters actually result from a combination of factors ranging from climate and weather to urban, economic and social phenomena. In other words, they\u2019re also anthropogenic disasters that result from human action, not just climate,\u201d Marengo said.\nMost Brazilian states suffer from flooding, but it is worst in S\u00e3o Paulo, which accounts for 33.36% of cases, followed by Santa Catarina (11.25%), Rio Grande do Sul (9.06%), Paran\u00e1 (8.33%), Rio de Janeiro (7.28%) and Minas Gerais (5.96%).\nSome 170 river floods and flash floods occurred in the period 2014-18. Flash floods produced the most deaths and serious injuries, followed by landslides and mudslides.\n\u201cThe Southeast and South regions of Brazil are the worst affected by hydrometeorological disasters because of their population density,\u201d Marengo said.\n\u201cLandslides, for example, only kill people because they\u2019re forced to live in high-risk areas where no one should build a home. The streets only fill up with water because the rivers have been channelized and buried, and the city\u2019s surfaces are sealed with asphalt and concrete.\u201d\nSource: Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo\nRelated\nBrazil\nIndonesia \u2013 at Least 3 Dead, 2 Missing After Floods and Landslides in 3 Provinces\nUSA \u2013  Neptune Flood Insurance Now Available in 42 States\n\nECMWF\nLatest Articles\nFollow Us\nCategories\nFlood News in Americas by Country\nEditor's Picks\nDepave \u2013 the Community-Based Approach to Storm Water Management\nUsing Drones for Flood Disaster Risk Reduction, Assessment and Recovery\nFlood Protection Options for Airports\nReport \u2013 Flood Losses in Europe to Increase Fivefold by 2050\nUN \u2013 1995 to 2015, Flood Disasters Affected 2.3 Billion and Killed 157,000\nDrowning World \u2013 Photographer Gideon Mendel\u2019s 8 Year Project\nFlood and High Water Marks\nG-Cans Project, Tokyo \u2013 Japan\u2019s $2.6 Billion Flood Tunnel\nCookies | Privacy |  Contacts\nNorth America\nSouth America\nEurope\nAsia\nAfrica\nOceania\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 FloodList \n",

During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4. Difference from average Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) for the state of Kansas during the February 12-26, 2024 period as compared to the long-term average. Source: Kansas Applied Remote Sensing (KARS), available at: https://greenreport-kars.ku.edu/.\u00a0 \n\nPossible consequences to the wheat crop\nThe effect of the high soil temperatures during February on the wheat crop will depend on several factors, particularly on temperatures during early March.\nWhere temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F and with little fluctuation during the recent period, such as in many areas throughout the southeast quarter of the state, the high temperatures should cause a gradual loss of cold hardiness. The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis.

    "Document": "Los Angeles Lakers 2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nWill LeBron and his son, Bronny, hoist the Larry O'Brien together?\nMassimo Marchiano\nWe've got the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25 to see how the game thinks the team will perform this year. Last year, the Lakers finished the season 47-35 and made the playoffs. However, they lost to the Denver Nuggets in the First Round in 5 games. Will they fare better this year? Let's find out.\nLos Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will go 48-34 in the regular season and make the playoffs. But before we show what happened in the postseason, let's see how they got there in the first place.\nOctober \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers' 2024-2025 season started on a rough note, with the team going 1-4 in October. The team performed well offensively, but the same couldn't be said about the defense. They managed to start the year 1-0 after beating Minnesota 111-103. But they instantly faced a fierce five-game losing streak that set them back.\nLeBron James and Anthony Davis led the team in minutes per game, points scored, and several other statistical categories. But as we can see, there'll need to be improvements from other players if they want to turn things around.\nNovember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe month of November was a bit better for the Lakers, but the team still struggled. As we mentioned, they suffered a loss to start the month, extending their losing streak to five. However, the Lakers went on to win seven of their next nine games to go 8-7. However, as soon as things were looking better, they lost four straight to end the month and end up being below .500 again.\nNothing was too different here than in October. While the team played well offensively, they allowed over 1,500 points (110 points per game) in a 14 game stretch. However, the season is still early and anything is possible.\nDecember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nBecause some games are still to be decided, a couple of games here do not reflect the actual 2024-2025 season. Instead of waiting for December to see the confirmed matchups, we just rocked with what NBA 2K25's MyNBA mode provided for us. The rest of the season does accurately reflect the real 2024-2024 schedule.\nAnyways, it was a better month for the Lakers who finally evened out their record. Additionally, the defense managed to buckle down and play better, though they still need to improve. However, thanks LeBron averaging over 27 points per game, the Lakers' offense is in good hands. We also got to see Bronny James play for the first time, though he only played for two minutes against the Kings near the end of the month.\nJanuary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers started off their New Year with a win to go above .500 for the first time this season. They went on to win two more games to extend their win streak to four games. Furthermore, this month saw the team win some important matchups, including a 1 point victory over the Celtics.\nIn fact, L.A. had three close games this month in which the winning team only won by 1 point. Another thing worth noting is the defensive improvement. This month they only allowed over 100 points in half of their matchups this month. It's not perfect, but the Lakers seemed to find a better rhythm in terms of defense.\nOverall, Davis and LeBron continue to be the superstars of this team. Fortunately, they've both been healthy and didn't get injured\u2026 yet.\nFebruary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers continued another win streak in the month of February, winning their first three games before losing to the Pacers. Overall, they went 16-11 in the first two months of the year as they continue to build their record. At this point into the season, it seems unlikely the Lakers will be able to catch up to the Mavericks, who are the #1 team in the league.\nThe Lakers still find themselves fighting for a playoff spot, but the slight improvements every month seem to help the team inch towards a postseason spot.\nA quick shoutout to Austin Reaves here, who put up 29 points in the team's 127-94 win over the Denver Nuggets. With Nikola Jokic missing the game due to injury the Lakers took advantage and got a little revenge on Denver.\nMarch \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nMarch started off ugly as the team suffered a 77-97 loss to the Clippers. However, they went on to win 12 games this month as they essentially clinched a playoff spot. They also faced a lot of adversity, as D'Angelo Russell missed time due to injury. Although not the star player of the team, it hurts to lose good depth guys.\nNevertheless, L.A. performed fine without him, as LeBron James continued to ball out. We also got to see Bronny play, but just barely. He made one basket and earned an assist in the team's 113-102 win over the Grizzlies. But the most important thing here for L.A. to do is win a few more games to reserve a playoff spot.\nApril \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nDespite an ugly three-game losing streak in the middle of the month, the Lakers did just enough to earn the fifth seed in the NBA Playoffs. They started the month with back-to-back wins, and ended the month with another two to edge out Sacramento for the 5 seed.\nLike last year, it wasn't the most prettiest season, but L.A. found a way to make the postseason and avoid the Play-In. However, they now host a San Antonio Spurs team which shocked the league this season. Can they defeat San Antonio, whose now led by second-year superstar Victor Wembanyama?\nNBA Playoffs First Round \u2013 vs. #4 San Antonio Spurs\nThe Lakers got off to a hot start in this series, but ultimately let the Spurs take a quick 2-1 lead in the series. However, LeBron buckled down, averaging a whopping 33 points per game to help the Lakers overcome the Spurs. However, there was one major problem the Lakers now had to deal with.\nAnthony Davis suffered an ankle injury which would cause him to miss at least the next round. Can the Lakers hold off the #1 Mavericks without him?\nNBA Playoffs QuarterFinals \u2013 vs. #1 Dallas Mavericks\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will lose to the Dallas Mavericks in the Quarterfinals of the NBA Playoffs. Due to Anthony Davis' injury, the team suffered a serious collapse, failing to score and rebound throughout the contest. LeBron also faltered, now averaging just 23 points per game in the series.\nAlthough they made it farther than they did last season, the Lakers were still hoping to reach the NBA Finals again. As long as LeBron is still playing at an All-Star level, the team can definitely make a big push this year. Unfortunately, NBA 2K25 doesn't think they'll go that far.\nOverall, that wraps up the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25. We hope you enjoyed reading. We also look forward to another exciting NBA Season, which begins in October.\nFor more gaming and NBA news, visit ClutchPoints.

They started the month with back-to-back wins, and ended the month with another two to edge out Sacramento for the 5 seed.\nLike last year, it wasn't the most prettiest season, but L.A. found a way to make the postseason and avoid the Play-In. However, they now host a San Antonio Spurs team which shocked the league this season. Can they defeat San Antonio, whose now led by second-year superstar Victor Wembanyama?\nNBA Playoffs First Round \u2013 vs. #4 San Antonio Spurs\nThe Lakers got off to a hot start in this series, but ultimately let the Spurs take a quick 2-1 lead in the series. However, LeBron buckled down, averaging a whopping 33 points per game to help the Lakers overcome the Spurs. However, there was one major problem the Lakers now had to deal with.\nAnthony Davis suffered an ankle injury which would cause him to miss at least the next round. Can the Lakers hold off the #1 Mavericks without him?\nNBA Playoffs QuarterFinals \u2013 vs. #1 Dallas Mavericks\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will lose to the Dallas Mavericks in the Quarterfinals of the NBA Playoffs. Due to Anthony Davis' injury, the team suffered a serious collapse, failing to score and rebound throughout the contest. LeBron also faltered, now averaging just 23 points per game in the series.\nAlthough they made it farther than they did last season, the Lakers were still hoping to reach the NBA Finals again. As long as LeBron is still playing at an All-Star level, the team can definitely make a big push this year. Unfortunately, NBA 2K25 doesn't think they'll go that far.\nOverall, that wraps up the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25. We hope you enjoyed reading. We also look forward to another exciting NBA Season, which begins in October.\nFor more gaming and NBA news, visit ClutchPoints.

I thought he did the best that he could.\u201d\nThe rest of the Blazers shot 10 of 32 (31.3%) from the field in the first half and 1 of 14 from three-point range while committing 10 turnovers.\nFor the game, the Blazers shot 39.8% from the field and 5 on 31 threes (16.1%). The Blazers committed 24 turnovers on the night.\nBillups briefly discussed how the Blazers started off playing clean basketball. They led 11-10 about four minutes into the game.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t last long,\u201d Billups said. \u201cIt happened pretty quick where we couldn\u2019t score. We couldn\u2019t get in the paint.

And everything just kind of went bad at the same time.\u201d\nAyton, who played just over five minutes in the second half, finished with 18 points and eight rebounds. Scoot Henderson led the Blazers with 20 points with six assists but also committed seven turnovers.\nDalano Banton, who set a career high with 31 points during Wednesday\u2019s loss at Atlanta, shot just 5 of 19 against the Heat for 12 points.\nThe Heat did whatever they wanted on offense, shooting 59.3% from the field and 21 of 39 on threes (53.8%).\nThe Heat had six players with double-digit scoring, four over 20. Thomas Bryant led the Heat with 26 points off the bench. Terry Rozier scored 22 with six assists.\nWHAT IT MEANS\nThe Blazers (19-55) lost their ninth consecutive game to match their longest losing streak of the season. The Heat (40-33) remained in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, slightly ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers (39-35).\nMONUMENTAL LOSS\nThe 60-point defeat is the third-worst in franchise history. Earlier this season, Portland lost 139-77 at Oklahoma City. That 62-point defeat ranks second all-time. The Blazers\u2019 worst loss in franchise history came Feb. 27, 1998, at Indiana by the score of 124-59 (65 points).\nMATISSE THYBULLE\nThe Blazers guard returned to action but didn\u2019t last long.

I thought he did the best that he could.\u201d\nThe rest of the Blazers shot 10 of 32 (31.3%) from the field in the first half and 1 of 14 from three-point range while committing 10 turnovers.\nFor the game, the Blazers shot 39.8% from the field and 5 on 31 threes (16.1%). The Blazers committed 24 turnovers on the night.\nBillups briefly discussed how the Blazers started off playing clean basketball. They led 11-10 about four minutes into the game.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t last long,\u201d Billups said. \u201cIt happened pretty quick where we couldn\u2019t score. We couldn\u2019t get in the paint. We try to make a point, always, of getting the ball to the paint. Collapsing defenses and then create the chase, is what I call it.\u201d\nInstead, Miami prevented the Blazers from accomplishing their goal.\n\u201cTheir defense, they got physical,\u201d Billups said. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t get to the paint. And we just kind of settled, settled, settled. We turned it over. And we had a lot of what I call \u2018shooting turnovers,\u2019 which are just horrible shots that might as well be a turnover. And everything just kind of went bad at the same time.\u201d\nAyton, who played just over five minutes in the second half, finished with 18 points and eight rebounds. Scoot Henderson led the Blazers with 20 points with six assists but also committed seven turnovers.\nDalano Banton, who set a career high with 31 points during Wednesday\u2019s loss at Atlanta, shot just 5 of 19 against the Heat for 12 points.\nThe Heat did whatever they wanted on offense, shooting 59.3% from the field and 21 of 39 on threes (53.8%).\nThe Heat had six players with double-digit scoring, four over 20. Thomas Bryant led the Heat with 26 points off the bench. Terry Rozier scored 22 with six assists.\nWHAT IT MEANS\nThe Blazers (19-55) lost their ninth consecutive game to match their longest losing streak of the season. The Heat (40-33) remained in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, slightly ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers (39-35).\nMONUMENTAL LOSS\nThe 60-point defeat is the third-worst in franchise history. Earlier this season, Portland lost 139-77 at Oklahoma City. That 62-point defeat ranks second all-time. The Blazers\u2019 worst loss in franchise history came Feb. 27, 1998, at Indiana by the score of 124-59 (65 points).\nMATISSE THYBULLE\nThe Blazers guard returned to action but didn\u2019t last long. Thybulle played seven minutes before leaving the game with a right ankle impingement. He had missed five games with an ankle injury leading up to Friday night.\nNEXT UP\nThe Blazers play at 4 p.m. Monday at the Orlando Magic.\nLatest Blazers news\n-- Aaron Fentress | afentress@Oregonian.com | @AaronJFentress (Twitter), @AaronJFentress (Instagram), @AaronFentress (Facebook)\nMORE BLAZERS COVERAGE\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

How much more did teams run? A lot. In 2022 there were 2,486 stolen bases in MLB, up slightly from 2,213 from 2021. Under the new rules in 2023 there were 3,503 stolen bases. So far in 2024 the league has swiped 3,268 bags. \nThe 2023 Cubs were in on that action, stealing 140 bags last season. That was good for eighth in the league. The 2024 Cubs are on a roughly similar trajectory with 131 stolen bases so far this season, good for seventh in the league. That\u2019s a respectable position relative to the rest of the league, but today I\u2019d like to make the case that the 2024 Cubs don\u2019t run nearly enough. The underlying numbers suggest they should be running more. A lot more.\nTo determine this I looked at some league-wide tendencies around stolen bases. I also looked at team success rates, some research on what an acceptable success rate should be and the Cubs individual player numbers.\nLet\u2019s start with team-level stolen base success rates and opportunities:\nTeams by Stolen Base Opportunities\nThe Cubs have had 1,911 stolen base chances according to Baseball Reference. They\u2019ve stolen 131 bases and been caught stealing 27 times, so they\u2019ve attempted a steal in 158 of those opportunities. Put in slightly different terms, they run 8.27 percent of the time that they have the chance to \u2014 which is good for eighth in baseball, right in line with their stolen base tally relative to the rest of the league.\nHowever, they\u2019ve been successful stealing bases 83 percent of the time, which puts them fifth in the majors in terms of stolen base success rate just a smidge behind the Brewers. You can see the above data sorted by success rate on attempts with two more decimal points pushed out, and resorted below:\nTeam stolen base success rate\nThat rate of 82.91 percent is good for keeping all of our blood pressure low by avoiding outs on the basepaths, but it is actually too high a threshold. Research from Tom Tango has indicated that the \u201cbreak-even\u201d point for attempting to steal a base is 75 percent:\nIn the soon-to-come Catcher Caught Stealing leaderboard on Savant, I am able to model each stolen base attempt to determine its expected caught stealing rate, based on where the runner is at the time the ball enters the catcher\u2019s glove. As we know, the breakeven point for a stolen base attempt is for the runner to be at least 75% successful. If the runner thinks they can be safe at least 75% of the time, they should go for it. That is of course a combination of reading the pitcher and beating the catcher.\nSimilarly, if a runner thinks they will be safe at most 60% of the time, they should never attempt to steal. In-between, and there\u2019s some other variables to consider.\nPut slightly differently, the Cubs are stealing a lot of bases relative to the rest of the league and their running rate is similar to their spot on the stolen base leaderboard relative to the rest of the league. However, they are probably leaving stolen bases (and the runners in scoring position that come with them) on the table. An 82.91 percent success rate is too cautious relative to the break-even point to attempt a steal.\nBut those are obviously not numbers that make sense at a team level. After all, the Cubs baseball team includes Pete Crow-Armstrong and his 99th percentile sprint speed, but it also includes Miguel Amaya and his 10th percentile sprint speed. Clearly, that 75 percent break even point has to be applied at a player level, not a team level. So I ran these same numbers for the Cubs players this season and you can see the results of that work below:\nCubs stolen base success rate 2024\nEleven Cubs have a stolen base success rate greater than 80 percent entering play on Friday. Furthermore, if you take a look at the individual results here, it is pretty clear that the Cubs stolen base success rate as a team was dragged down considerably by Christopher Morel\u2019s team-worst 58.33 percent success rate on the basepaths during his time with the Cubs. Pretty much every single member of the team who runs should run more with the possible exceptions of Seiya Suzuki (70 percent success rate) and Michael Busch (66.67 percent success rate).\nNow, some obvious small sample size caveats apply here. For example, Christian Bethancourt and his 55th percentile sprint speed should probably only be deployed selectively during the course of a season. He\u2019s got a 100 percent success rate in that same way Anthony Rizzo used to just gazelle his way to five to 10 stolen bases a season during his time with the Cubs (including a career-high 17 steals in 2015). Additionally, injury risk is real, and it could make sense that a guy like Nick Madrigal who\u2019s dealt with a number of hamstring injuries might need to cool it on the basepaths a bit, even though he\u2019s got a 100% success rate and the same sprint speed as Bethancourt.\nCaveats about guys who are clearly taking advantage of a particular battery or slowing down due to injury aside, the Cubs are leaving runs on the basepaths by having so many players who are well above the break-even point. While it\u2019s impossible to guess how many successful opportunities to move critical runs into scoring position or 90-feet from home have been left on the table by the Cubs in 2024, it seems pretty clear that there\u2019s room to run on the North Side of Chicago.\n\n\n    More From\n    \n        Bleed Cubbie Blue\n\n\n\n\n\n          Most Read\n        \n\n\nGambling Problem?

    "Summarized_Document": "One of the significant developments last season was the increase in stolen bases across MLB due to rule changes encouraging more running. In 2022, there were 2,486 stolen bases, up from 2,213 in 2021. In 2023, this number jumped to 3,503, and so far in 2024, the league has recorded 3,268 stolen bases. The 2023 Chicago Cubs stole 140 bases, ranking eighth in the league. In 2024, they have stolen 131 bases, ranking seventh. Despite this respectable position, the data suggests the Cubs should be running more. The Cubs have had 1,911 stolen base opportunities, attempting a steal in 158 of those chances (8.27%), ranking eighth in MLB. They have an 83% success rate, fifth in the majors, but this is too cautious compared to the 75% break-even point for attempting steals. At the player level, eleven Cubs have a success rate above 80%. Christopher Morel's 58.33% success rate has notably dragged down the team's overall rate. Players like Seiya Suzuki (70%) and Michael Busch (66.67%) might need to be more selective. Small sample sizes and injury risks, such as Nick Madrigal's hamstring issues, also play a role. Overall, the Cubs are likely leaving potential runs on the table by not attempting more steals, given their high success rates.",

    "Summarized_Document": "The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released new residential construction statistics for March 2024. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for building permits in March was 1,458,000, a 4.3% decrease from February's revised rate of 1,523,000 but a 1.5% increase from March 2023's rate of 1,437,000. Single-family authorizations were at 973,000, down 5.7% from February's revised figure of 1,032,000. Authorizations for buildings with five units or more were at 433,000.Privately-owned housing starts in March were at a SAAR of 1,321,000, a 14.7% decrease from February's revised estimate of 1,549,000 and a 4.3% decrease from March 2023's rate of 1,380,000. Single-family housing starts were at 1,022,000, down 12.4% from February's revised figure of 1,167,000. The rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 290,000.Housing completions in March were at a SAAR of 1,469,000, a 13.5% decrease from February's revised estimate of 1,698,000 and a 3.9% decrease from March 2023's rate of 1,528,000. Single-family housing completions were at 947,000, down 10.5% from February's revised rate of 1,058,000. The rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 502,000.The data also includes explanatory notes on the interpretation of changes in the statistics, highlighting that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics can be irregular and may require several months to establish an underlying trend. The statistics are based on a non-probability sample and are subject to nonsampling error. The total quantity response rate for these estimates is 75.9%.The next release is scheduled for May 16, 2024. Additional information on the survey methodology can be found on the Census Bureau's website.",

    "Summarized_Document": "The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released new residential construction statistics for March 2024. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for building permits in March was 1,458,000, a 4.3% decrease from February's revised rate of 1,523,000 but a 1.5% increase from March 2023's rate of 1,437,000. Single-family authorizations were at 973,000, down 5.7% from February's revised figure of 1,032,000. Authorizations for buildings with five units or more were at 433,000.Privately-owned housing starts in March were at a SAAR of 1,321,000, a 14.7% decrease from February's revised estimate of 1,549,000 and a 4.3% decrease from March 2023's rate of 1,380,000. Single-family housing starts were at 1,022,000, down 12.4% from February's revised figure of 1,167,000. The rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 290,000.Housing completions in March were at a SAAR of 1,469,000, a 13.5% decrease from February's revised estimate of 1,698,000 and a 3.9% decrease from March 2023's rate of 1,528,000. Single-family housing completions were at 947,000, down 10.5% from February's revised rate of 1,058,000. The rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 502,000.The data also includes explanatory notes on the interpretation of changes in the statistics, highlighting that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics can be irregular and may require several months to establish an underlying trend. The statistics are based on a non-probability sample and are subject to nonsampling error. The total quantity response rate for these estimates is 75.9%.The next release is scheduled for May 16, 2024. Additional information on the survey methodology can be found on the Census Bureau's website.",

    "Summarized_Document": "The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released new residential construction statistics for March 2024. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for building permits in March was 1,458,000, a 4.3% decrease from February's revised rate of 1,523,000 but a 1.5% increase from March 2023's rate of 1,437,000. Single-family authorizations were at 973,000, down 5.7% from February's revised figure of 1,032,000. Authorizations for buildings with five units or more were at 433,000.Privately-owned housing starts in March were at a SAAR of 1,321,000, a 14.7% decrease from February's revised estimate of 1,549,000 and a 4.3% decrease from March 2023's rate of 1,380,000. Single-family housing starts were at 1,022,000, down 12.4% from February's revised figure of 1,167,000. The rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 290,000.Housing completions in March were at a SAAR of 1,469,000, a 13.5% decrease from February's revised estimate of 1,698,000 and a 3.9% decrease from March 2023's rate of 1,528,000. Single-family housing completions were at 947,000, down 10.5% from February's revised rate of 1,058,000. The rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 502,000.The data also includes explanatory notes on the interpretation of changes in the statistics, highlighting that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics can be irregular and may require several months to establish an underlying trend. The statistics are based on a non-probability sample and are subject to nonsampling error. The total quantity response rate for these estimates is 75.9%.The next release is scheduled for May 16, 2024. Additional information on the survey methodology can be found on the Census Bureau's website.",

    "Query": "What was the average daily ridership on the New York City subway system in March 2024 compared to September 2024?",
    "Document_ID": "DOC_74",
    "Document": "Subway and bus ridership for 2023\n2023 ridership reflects continued growth\nIn 2023, subway ridership posted a 14% annual increase to 1.15 billion annual paid rides, hitting the billion-ride milestone six weeks earlier than in 2022.\nRidership patterns have shifted since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with discretionary travel becoming more popular than commutation travel. Increased telecommuting and more flexible work-from-home policies have made traditional five-day commuting less common. Commutation ridership is now highest on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Overall subway ridership is now at 68% of 2019 levels. At 77%, weekend recovery is higher than the weekday recovery of 66%. Paid ridership has also benefited from a slightly lower fare evasion rate in 2023, as the MTA continues to combat subway fare evasion.\nBus ridership experienced a modest annual increase of 0.3% to 426 million rides, 63% of the 2019 level. This was slower than the 11% growth observed in 2022. Significant factors contributing to slower growth include rising bus fare evasion and the introduction of a fare-free pilot program on five bus routes starting in September 2023.\nOverview of New York City\u2019s transit system\nWe operate the largest public transportation agency in North America and one of the largest in the world.\nThe subway has a daily ridership of approximately 3.6 million and buses have a daily ridership of 1.4 million, representing 68% and 63%, respectively, of pre-pandemic ridership levels.\nOur system includes:\nHow we calculate ridership\nSubways\nWe include:\nWe do not include:\nBuses\nWe include:\nWe do not include:\nAverage weekday, Saturday, and Sunday ridership includes every weekday, Saturday, and Sunday in the year, except major holidays and days when the subway system was closed or operated fare-free.\nAverage weekend ridership is the two-day sum of average Saturday plus average Sunday ridership.

Note that our table lists 424 stations. We combined ridership data for station complexes, where stations are connected by transfer passageways. (We can't accurately allocate ridership to each station in a complex.) For example, the 14 St\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u00a0station is combined with the 8 Av\u00a0\u200b\u00a0station.\nThe station names and lines stopping at each station reflect service at the end of 2023.\nIn our spreadsheet, stations are listed alphabetically by borough, and the rankings are by 2023 ridership. The \u201csystemwide adjustment\u201d accounts for miscellaneous ridership and other adjustments that are not allocated by station.\nIn our tables, stations that were temporarily closed (either fully or partially) are denoted with asterisks; go to the \u201cClosures\u201d tab for the closure dates. For these stations, zero ridership was included in the averages for any days when the station was closed, except for the days when the entire subway was closed or fare-free.\nSummary of bus ridership (New York City Transit)\nYear\nAverage weekday\nAverage Saturday\nAverage Sunday\nAverage weekend\nAnnual total\n2018\n1,811,605\n1,122,626\n868,057\n1,990,683\n569,361,220\n2019\n1,770,394\n1,108,809\n847,931\n1,956,740\n557,036,504\n2020\n980,374\n671,835\n532,002\n1,203,837\n316,768,454\n2021\n984,865\n646,302\n482,090\n1,128,392\n311,893,583\n2022\n1,094,415\n662,179\n523,178\n1,185,357\n343,092,963\n2023\n1,082,428\n670,755\n535,911\n1,206,666\n340,766,398\nSummary of bus ridership (MTA Bus Company)\nYear\nAverage weekday\nAverage Saturday\nAverage Sunday\nAverage weekend\nAnnual total\n2018\n392,617\n224,751\n170,892\n395,643\n121,448,276\n2019\n388,075\n228,364\n171,762\n400,126\n120,551,580\n2020\n207,042\n132,387\n99,713\n232,100\n65,655,990\n2021\n228,425\n142,112\n102,744\n244,856\n71,431,466\n2022\n268,124\n150,399\n113,157\n263,556\n82,609,386\n2023\n279,247\n159,451\n121,069\n280,520\n86,216,666\nTop 10 busiest bus routes by ridership in 2023\nRank\nRoute\nBorough\nRidership\n1\nM15 Local/SBS\nManhattan\n10,468,682\n2\nQ58\nQueens\n7,119,884\n3\nB6\nBrooklyn\n6,049,383\n4\nBx12 Local/SBS\nBronx\n5,900,063\n5\nB82 Local/SBS\nBrooklyn\n5,647,706\n6\nB46 Local/SBS\nBrooklyn\n5,547,520\n7\nB44 Local/SBS\nBrooklyn\n5,468,965\n8\nQ27\nQueens\n5,414,302\n9\nB41\nBrooklyn\n4,759,664\n10\nQ44\nQueens\n4,715,292\nAbout our bus data\nLocal routes begin with one or two letters corresponding to the major borough of operation (B = Brooklyn, Bx = Bronx, M = Manhattan, Q = Queens, S = Staten Island).

    "Summarized_Document": "Subway and bus ridership for 2023\n2023 ridership reflects continued growth\nIn 2023, subway ridership increased by 14% annually to 1.15 billion paid rides, reaching the billion-ride milestone six weeks earlier than in 2022. Ridership patterns have shifted since the COVID-19 pandemic, with discretionary travel becoming more popular than commutation travel. Increased telecommuting and flexible work-from-home policies have made traditional five-day commuting less common. Commutation ridership is now highest on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Overall subway ridership is now at 68% of 2019 levels, with weekend recovery at 77% and weekday recovery at 66%. Paid ridership has also benefited from a slightly lower fare evasion rate in 2023.\n\nBus ridership experienced a modest annual increase of 0.3% to 426 million rides, 63% of the 2019 level. This was slower than the 11% growth observed in 2022.

July 6, 1990\nWhen it comes to transportation in San Francisco, the cable cars and streetcars understandably get all the glory. But the bus has played an important role in San Francisco's history too. There's a folder in the photo archives devoted to San Francisco buses. The earliest one dates from 1918, showing the first gasoline bus introduced by The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. It crossed Golden Gate Park. There aren't any bus photos in the folder from the Twenties or Thirties, I had to get them from another source. But, every other decade was well represented.\u00a0\nThe photo from 1918 was used in an article that was published in 1962. Fifty years earlier, San Francisco launched as what Muni describes as \"the first major, publicly owned, land-based transit agency in the United States.\" On that day, an open end streetcar, which came to be known as \"Old Number One,\" slid smoothly and sleekly out of the barn and headed east down Geary Street at noon, on December 28.\"\u00a0\nMore For You\nRare unseen downtown San Francisco photos show city life in the 1930s and 1940s\nSave the Palace of Fine Arts?

Today, that same ride will cost adults $2.25. In 1912, San Francisco's mayor, \"Sunny Jim\" Rolph, placed the first nickel in Muni's first coin box. The Chronicle article at the time stated that the coin was one of the first 40 minted at the Old Mint at Fifth and Mission Streets.\u00a0\nMayor Rolph hoped the launching of the transit system would be without much fanfare. But, by the time the streetcar reached Market Street, just off Geary, it was met by a mob of about 50,000 people, almost causing a riot. Souvenir hunters placed coins on the tracks to flatten them. In the first 12 hours, fifteen thousand people jammed onto the 10 new streetcars, earning Muni a handsome $750.\u00a0\nThe video below shows what Market Street was like in 1912, just prior to the Muni's founding.\nBob Bragman is a producer for SFGATE.

DART faces uncertain future as North Texas cities try to cut funding\nCity officials say poor service and a lack of transparency underlie recent votes to cap funding to the agency. \nBy Amber GaudetTransportation and mobility reporter\nTransportation and mobility reporter\n6:00 AM on Aug 9, 2024 CDT\nDallas Area Rapid Transit, the region\u2019s largest mass transit agency ferrying nearly 50 million passengers last year, could lose $6 billion in funding during the next two decades if cities that pay the bulk of its budget get their wish.\nSix of DART\u2019s 13 member cities have passed resolutions since June in support of cutting sales tax contributions to the transit agency by a quarter. Another member city, Dallas, has discussed doing the same.\nSince DART was formed in 1983, participating cities have paid a penny sales tax \u2014 a 1% tax on every dollar spent \u2014 to DART. Sales tax revenue represents about 70% of the transit agency\u2019s overall budget. Other revenue sources include fares, federal funds, interest and debt issuances. Plano and Irving, two of DART\u2019s biggest sources of sales tax revenue, would each save about $30 million annually by cutting contributions by a quarter.\nDART leaders have said that would cripple the agency, leading to deep service cuts throughout the region. Member cities, however, say they\u2019ve waited years to get answers from DART about where their dollars are going \u2014 and are ready to take the fight over funding to the Texas Legislature to change the laws governing regional transit agencies.\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\nOr with: \nBy signing up you agree to our\u00a0Terms of Service\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy Policy\nDART\u2019s system services about 700 square miles in Dallas-Fort Worth, operating 692 buses and one of the longest light rail systems in the country. The urban rail and bus network is the primary source of transportation for thousands of area residents traversing the sprawling metroplex. The usefulness and scope of that system is now in question by cities looking to claw back millions of dollars in contributions, which have grown to $870 million a year.\nHow DART was formed and funded\nIn August 1983, voters in 14 cities in Dallas-Fort Worth cast ballots in favor of forming a regional transportation authority that collected a 1-cent sales tax from member cities. Seven suburban cities voted against the proposal.\nThat support led to the creation of DART. It was the second attempt to form a regional transit authority supported by a 1-cent sales tax.\nAs early as 1988, according to The Dallas Morning News archives, some local officials and residents were expressing doubts about the newly formed DART, complaining of poor system design, excessive costs and mismanaged funds.\nIt\u2019s long been common for transportation agencies to be the subject of poor public opinion, according to Michael Walk, a researcher at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute.\n\u201cThe norm for transit systems, particularly across the U.S., is to struggle with public perception, whether it\u2019s the riders themselves being maybe dissatisfied with the way the routes work or with safety or cleanliness of systems or nonriders seeing public transit as a less desirable service,\u201d Walk said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s an ongoing challenge to correct those perceptions or to mitigate the ramifications of them.\u201d\nThe state\u2019s Transportation Code gives transportation agency boards the authority to voluntarily ask the state comptroller to collect sales taxes at a lower rate than what the public authorized when DART was formed. If the DART Board of Directors does not do that on its own as member cities that have passed resolutions want, officials would be forced to ask the legislature to change the code to create another avenue to cut funding.\nAs cities demand answers, riders fear cuts\nWhen Dallas resident Alexander Dunn heard Plano passed a resolution in June to cut their contributions to DART, he started organizing. On a Saturday afternoon in late July, Dunn and about 50 other DART riders and advocates gathered in a small community room in downtown Dallas to discuss how to respond.\n\u201cPeople are really keyed into the fact that this is an existential fight for the future of DART,\u201d Dunn said.\nDunn\u2019s group, Dallas Area Transit Alliance, says riders will ultimately pay the price for funding reductions. Although he\u2019s a casual user of DART who owns a car, he knows many rely on the system as their sole source of transportation.\nAlthough exactly what cuts would happen would be determined if funding reductions were finalized, they could include less frequent buses, cuts to paratransit service for disabled riders, workforce reductions and deferred maintenance.\n\u201cMany options from my personal perspective exist including consolidation of bus routes, increased schedule intervals for buses, light rail and commuter rail, as well as the reduction up to removal of GoLink service,\u201d DART board member Randall Bryant said in a public statement. Bryant represents Dallas on the board.\nThe alliance launched an online petition objecting to the cuts that has collected more than 1,400 signatures as of Aug. 6.\n\u201cAll of the progress DART\u2019s been making over the past year, more than a year, with regards to security, cleanliness, maintenance, reliability, frequency \u2014 all of that would go away if DART loses a quarter of its sales tax revenue,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cAnd even beyond that, we now have to be starting to work from the bottom trying to get back to that [current service levels] before we can even think about improvements.\u201d\nOfficials say they empathize with riders and are advocating to make the system they rely on better.\n\u201cPlano is very pro-transit \u2014 I think that gets lost in some of the discussions and media surrounding the discussion,\u201d said Plano director of government relations Andrew Fortune. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion around, \u2018Oh, my goodness, this is going to harm riders or it\u2019s going to cut services\u2019 and that\u2019s really not the proposal.\u2019\u201d\nRowlett Mayor Blake Margolis said he understands riders\u2019 concerns and does not want to see service in his city reduced.\n\u201cWe support transit,\u201d Margolis said. \u201cWe want to see DART perform well, we want to see trains be clean and safe, and we want to see ridership go up. But we also know that just the way that the business is functioning today is not working in the best interest of DART member cities.\n\u201cAnd if we want to see this transit system grow regionally, then  something of some kind needs to change with this structure.\u201d\n\u2018Rendering the entire system useless\u2019\nLeaders at the mass transit agency say reduced contributions would mean significant cuts to the frequency and number of critical routes. Service frequency could be cut back from 15 minutes to as much as one hour on some routes, and paratransit services for disabled residents would also be cut back to federally mandated minimums, DART CEO Nadine Lee said.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re getting to those levels of service on your best lines, best corridors, you\u2019re really rendering the entire system useless,\u201d Lee said.\nThe agency would also have to halt or delay maintenance and modernization projects. Those include efforts to upgrade original rail signal systems, infrastructure and vehicles and to modernize passenger amenities and facilities.\n\u201cBoth the light rail fleet as well as the bus fleet is ending its useful life or reaching the end of its useful life,\u201d Lee said.\n\u201cWe know that we need to program a tremendous amount of money to modernize our system because it is aging and because it is becoming increasingly more expensive for us to maintain what we have because of the age of our assets. And so the spending that we\u2019re doing is prudent.\u201d\nThe agency hopes to expand services as the region contends with a growing population.\nGrowing contributions means more accountability\nSeveral member cities that have publicly supported capping DART contributions have said they do not want service cuts and the recent resolutions were an attempt to get answers from the agency. Top officials from three member cities said they have been asking DART for years to provide a detailed breakdown of what services the cities get for their dollars, along with local ridership numbers.\n\u201cWe continue to look at how much revenue is increasing year over year, and still can\u2019t get an accounting of what it costs to provide services in Plano, so that really became a driving aspect,\u201d Plano City Manager Mark Israelson said. \u201cI think Plano has been very patient in waiting for some of those answers over these years, and we\u2019re at that point of really wanting to know what that provides to our community.\u201d\nThe agency provided a cost allocation report by city in 2022, DART chief financial officer Jamie Adelman said.\n\u201cThere were three or four attempts that we made to try to allocate the cost by city in order to answer the question that we were hearing from the cities, and I will tell you that every time we turned something in to the cities for their review, they were not happy with it, [but] they were not clear about what they weren\u2019t happy with,\u201d DART CEO Lee said.\nFiguring out how to break down systemwide costs like light rail by city has remained a challenge, according to Lee.\nDART has commissioned a study examining the return on investment for each city by Ernst & Young, results of which are expected in September.\nAlso expected in the fall is the Transit 2.0 report, a study commissioned by the North Central Texas Council of Governments to examine regional transportation needs, including DART funding, through 2050. Lee and North Central Texas Council of Governments Regional Transportation Council director Michael Morris have separately urged cities to wait for the results of the studies before taking action.\n\u201cThe resolutions that the cities are taking are premature and the reason why they\u2019re premature is we\u2019ve already outlined the process to get their questions answered,\u201d Morris said.\nAmong other top issues for member cities is service. Officials from cities voting to cut funding have said they regularly hear complaints from residents about poor system design, crime and unclean buses and trains. Meanwhile, the dollar amount of tax contributions by member cities to DART has grown for the past 10 years and is expected to increase about 4.5% in fiscal year 2025.\n\u201cWhat would have the most impact positively toward their ridership is to enhance their basic services, making sure their trains and busses are clean, making sure that there\u2019s proper fare enforcement, making sure that people feel safe while riding public transportation, which has been a plague on the system and which my constituents tell me is the reason why they don\u2019t feel safe riding the train anymore,\u201d Rowlett\u2019s Margolis said. \u201cThis is about saying, \u2018Hey, wake up, let\u2019s refocus back on the important things that DART needs to focus on and get right.\u2019\u201d\nNot all member cities think DART is doing a bad job. Officials in Garland and Richardson have expressed support for DART in public meetings, though none have taken formal action in support of the agency.\nDART said they have tried to engage with city leaders about how to meet the needs of each community, but often haven\u2019t gotten clear answers on what those needs are. Some member cities haven\u2019t engaged at all, staff said during a committee meeting earlier this month, though the agency keeps trying.\nDART, cities face revenue pressures\nMember cities have pointed to low ridership as a reason to cut funds. DART says ridership has recovered about 83% since the COVID-19 pandemic, ahead of the national average, though they did not specify what metrics they use for the figure. Online ridership data shows fiscal year-to-date ridership through June 2024 is at 41.4 million compared to 52.8 million in June 2019, about 22% lower than during the pre-pandemic measure. DART\u2019s fiscal year runs October through September.\n\u201cWe spend ... this year the projections are $108 million \u2014 that\u2019s more money than we spend on anything,\u201d Irving Mayor and DART board member Rick Stopfer said. \u201cAnd what are our residents getting for it? Are they really getting the service that $100 million deserves?\u201d\nBoard member Patrick Kennedy, who represents Dallas, said cities should be looking to increase density around stations to encourage ridership.\n\u201cLike 80% of where ridership comes from is the built environment and land use patterns,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe should be going pedal to the metal for the next 10 years doing that rather than trying to take away revenue.\u201d\nLike other organizations, transit agencies have been subject to inflationary pressures that have squeezed finances, according to transportation researcher Walk.\n\u201cIn addition to just general inflation and labor costs increases, it\u2019s been a very big challenge to keep the workforce and to then have to pay them what they need in order to stay in a very difficult job,\u201d Walk said. \u201cJust like the rest of the industry, and every person is experiencing, whether it\u2019s parts or fuel, or supplies, professional services, everything has been going up recently, and so transit agencies feel those pressures, just like every other business and company.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not to say every transit agency is 100% efficient, Walk said. There are significant maintenance and operational costs to running a large transit system that might be difficult to communicate in a direct service-for-dollars way that cities desire. Those cost pressures can get in the way of investing in service upgrades like frequency increases.\nCity leaders from Rowlett, Plano and Irving have complained the DART system is a magnet for crime and the service is losing money because residents with other options are choosing not to ride DART.\nDART crime reports increased 18% for the second quarter of 2024 over the same time last year. DART says that is because of increased efforts to be proactive in addressing issues. The agency has added more than 100 armed security officers to address crime and partnered with Parkland Health for homeless and mental health outreach.\nMargolis has pointed to fare evasion as an area where DART could shore up funds. Fares generally make up a small percentage of overall revenue, and things like day passes and federally mandated discount fares for certain groups complicate the fare picture, Lee said.\nThe agency had 73 fare enforcement officers last year. Increasing enforcement through a wider deployment of officers would result in more costs than returns, according to Lee.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a perception that we\u2019re missing out on a significant amount of fares, and I don\u2019t think that that is accurate,\u201d Lee said.\nDART has said cutting funding would only introduce more issues into the system.\n\u201cThat means now you don\u2019t have money to do the repairs on a 40-year-old system that needs to be done to keep the system up to date, and you keep making the entire system worse and worse,\u201d DART spokesperson Jeamy Molina said in July.\nLooking to Austin for answers\nAny reduction to the 1-cent tax could potentially put DART in default with bondholders, staff told the board during a committee meeting earlier this month. About 25% of what DART spends every year is on debt service.\nMember cities say they are dealing with their own budget constraints. Dallas has discussed whether to divert DART funds to deal with its pension crisis, though only the DART board or the Texas Legislature can trigger changes to DART\u2019s funding structure. Officials have pointed to a 2019 state law that capped local government property tax increases at 3.5% without voter approval.\n\u201cWe had that implemented, and we had to adjust very quickly,\u201d Plano\u2019s Israelson said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an extended period to be able to do that. So we\u2019ve learned to live with revenue caps. We think DART can, too.\u201d\nIsraelson said the goal is to lower the city\u2019s sales tax contribution to .75 cents per dollar. A revenue cap could also have incremental growth baked in to account for inflation.\n\u201cRight now, we would challenge the discussion that if they are fully funded at the dollar amount that they have this year and going forward they have a revenue cap that has some sort of increment of growth in it, I would challenge the question, tell us how that\u2019s a service reduction versus the current service level,\u201d Israelson said.\nPlano and Irving send more than $100 million a year to DART. The $30 million or more that would be saved under their funding cut requests could provide relief to city budgets struggling to pay for other services.\nIsraelson said it would be up to Plano voters how those dollars are spent. In Irving, Stopfer said he would keep that money focused on getting residents where they need to go \u2014 though he isn\u2019t sure what that might look like. Bus stops, sidewalks and streets all need attention in Irving\u2019s DART service areas, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of dollars that need to be spent so that the individuals that are using these buses  are in a clean, safe, accessible environment,\u201d Stopfer said.\nWith the DART board not expected to offer a resolution to reduce funding, cities are weighing their options ahead of the next legislative session.\n\u201cIf we really want to deal with these issues, it\u2019s going to require legislation,\u201d Stopfer said.\nA proposal being considered by Plano officials would amend the Texas Transportation Code to restrict the issuance of future debt pledges to 3/4 a cent of tax revenue and \u201cimmediately\u201d institute a revenue cap equivalent to DART\u2019s sales tax projections for fiscal year 2024. An annual 2% growth index from sales tax revenue would be allowed for one-time expenditures, with any growth above 2% dedicated to paying off debt faster.\nThe proposal is a starting place for discussions and is the result of a consensus among member cities that passed resolutions supporting DART revenue caps, according to Plano\u2019s Fortune.\nMost of the items in Plano\u2019s proposal can be accomplished by the DART board without legislative action, which Plano officials still hope for, Fortune said. But if DART doesn\u2019t come to the table, officials will take the fight to Austin.\nPlano will likely finalize its legislative program in October.\nStopfer said he would like to see legislative action to allow cities to join DART for less than a full penny and to allow funds in excess of a capped amount to be returned to member cities.\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s got to be a certain amount of transparency on how the dollars are spent, [and] I think that there\u2019s got to be some correlation between ridership and dollars spent,\u201d Stopfer said. \u201cI think that if you\u2019re truly going to bring other people on board, in addition to lowering the percentage, you\u2019re going to have to change the makeup of the board because no one is going to come on a board that they can\u2019t have a voice on.\u201d\nBoard members are appointed based on a member city\u2019s population, giving Dallas eight representatives on the board. Other cities have at most two each.\nRowlett is also thinking about contingencies, according to Margolis, though he said it was too early to share specifics.\n\u201cConversations are happening more and more between a coalition of member cities \u2014 we\u2019re working on our next steps and formulating that and getting ready,\u201d Margolis said.\nDART is considering its own legislative priorities. The board recently postponed a vote to finalize a legislative agenda that included language opposing \u201clegislation that could detrimentally impact DART\u2019s mission, finances, governance or operations, including changes to DART\u2019s sales tax statute.\u201d\nThe board will revisit the issue in September.\nDART wants to keep talks about how to move transit forward local, Lee said, and continue discussions with member cities about how to meet the unique needs of each area through its area planning process.\n\u201cWe have had conversations with each individual city about their vision for the future,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to accomplish in the future, where they see development patterns happening, where they see their major travel corridors where we can add that travel capacity for them. How we incorporate transit as more of an essential piece of the fabric of their cities.\n\u201cThose are the conversations I want to be having instead of trying to fight something down in Austin.\u201d\nAmber is a staff writer for The Dallas Morning News.

    "Summarized_Document": "Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), the largest mass transit agency in North Texas, is facing potential funding cuts that could total $6 billion over the next two decades. Six of DART\u2019s 13 member cities have passed resolutions since June 2024 to reduce their sales tax contributions by a quarter, with Dallas also considering similar measures. This sales tax, a 1% levy on every dollar spent, constitutes about 70% of DART\u2019s budget. Plano and Irving, two major contributors, would each save about $30 million annually with the proposed cuts.DART, which services 700 square miles in the Dallas-Fort Worth area with 692 buses and one of the longest light rail systems in the country, argues that these cuts would severely impact service, including less frequent buses, reduced paratransit services, workforce reductions, and deferred maintenance. The agency's ridership has recovered to about 83% of pre-pandemic levels, with fiscal year-to-date ridership at 41.4 million through June 2024, compared to 52.8 million in June 2019.The funding cuts are driven by member cities' demands for greater transparency and accountability from DART. Cities like Plano and Irving have been asking for detailed breakdowns of services and local ridership numbers for years. DART has attempted to provide cost allocation reports, but cities have found them unsatisfactory. A study by Ernst & Young on the return on investment for each city is expected in September 2024, along with the Transit 2.0 report examining regional transportation needs through 2050.Riders and advocates, like the Dallas Area Transit Alliance, fear that funding reductions will lead to significant service cuts, affecting thousands who rely on DART as their primary mode of transportation. An online petition against the cuts has garnered over 1,400 signatures.City officials argue that the current system is inefficient and plagued by issues such as crime, poor design, and uncleanliness. They believe that reducing contributions will force DART to improve its services. However, DART officials warn that such cuts would only exacerbate existing problems, making it harder to maintain and modernize the aging system.The debate over DART\u2019s funding is expected to continue, with cities potentially taking their case to the Texas Legislature. Proposals include amending the Texas Transportation Code to cap future debt pledges and institute a revenue cap. DART, on the other hand, aims to keep discussions local and work with member cities to address their unique needs.In summary, the implementation of the new light rail line in Dallas in June 2024 has been overshadowed by the broader issue of funding cuts and their potential impact on public transportation usage. While the new line may have contributed to the 83% recovery in ridership, the looming financial challenges and service reductions pose significant risks to the future of DART and its ability to serve the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.",

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures.  Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here.

With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d1 in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014 communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities.\nHousing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%.2 1 DOE\u2019s working definition of disadvantaged is based on cumulative burden and includes data for 36 burden indicators collected at the census tract level. These burden indicators can be grouped across four categories: energy burden, environmental and climate hazards, fossil dependence, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. https://www.energy.gov/diversity/justice40-initiative 2 According to Elevate analysis of 2014 data from Cook County property assessor.\n3 According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/fmr98/sect8.html 4 https://resilient.chicago.gov/ Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]3), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety.\nWe selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1.\nCommunity Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago,4 the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs.\n3 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Table 1.

The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2.\nHigh-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3.\nA co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat Table 2.

The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history.8,9 Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan10 identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency.\nPaired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as 8 Cusick, Daniel. 2020. \u201cChicago Learned Climate Lessons from Its Deadly 1995 Heat Wave.\u201d Scientific American. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chicago-learned-climate-lessons-from-its-deadly-1995-heat-wave1/ 9 Thomas, Mike. 2015. \u201cChicago\u2019s Deadly 1995 Heat Wave: An Oral History.\u201d Chicago Magazine. https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/July-2015/1995-Chicago-heat-wave/ 10 City of Chicago. 2022a.

This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago.

CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool.11 These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago.\nIn addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study.\n11 https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/cambium.html How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types.

This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings.\nHomes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry 12 City of Chicago. 2022b. Chicago Recovery Plan. https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/chicago-recovery-plan/home.html construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction.\n\u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps.\n\u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid.\nAlong with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%. Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety. We selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1. Community Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago, the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs. Estimation of Energy Savings Potential From Retrofit Programs Using NREL\u2019s ResStock Analysis Tool Of the dozen or so retrofit packages explored by Elevate and NREL, we selected three candidate packages designed to be cost-effective, code compliant, and having a high potential to reduce energy consumption. The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2. High-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3. A co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat waves. The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history. Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency. Paired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as the same building without the heat pump upgrade. This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago. Advanced retrofit packages with heat pumps have the potential to reduce Chicago\u2019s CO2 emissions by 2.5 million metric tons per year\u2014the equivalent of 500,000 cars taken off the road! If these two top packages (Package 2 and 3) are deployed in all 323,000 Chicago buildings from the five selected housing types, there would be significant energy savings, bill savings, and CO2 savings, as shown in Table 4. CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool. These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago. In addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study. How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types. At the time of release of this case study, the City of Chicago is directly investing $46 million from the Chicago Recovery Plan into energy and equity projects. Approximately half of this amount is reserved for retrofits in single-family and multifamily buildings. This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings. Homes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction. \u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps. \u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid. Along with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

    "Document": "Watch CBS News\nGet Ready For Higher Electric Bills, Regulators Sign Off On FPL Rate Increases\n\nOctober 26, 2021 / 11:37 PM EDT\n          / CBS Miami\n        \nTALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami/NSF) - State utility regulators Tuesday approved a series of base-rate increases for Florida Power & Light that will result in higher monthly bills for customers in January.\nDespite opponents' arguments that residential and small business customers will end up subsidizing costs for some larger customers, the Public Service Commission unanimously supported a four-year rate settlement, which calls for a $692 million increase in base rates in January and another increase of $560 million in 2023. Additional increases are planned in 2024 and 2025 to pay for solar projects.\nCommission Chairman Gary Clark noted receiving more than 1,100 emails from consumers about the proposal and indicated he had concerns about ratepayers subsidizing FPL's solar expansion and a electric-vehicle charging station program. But, Clark said he understands the need for clean energy investments and pointed to other benefits of the settlement, such as predictability in rates.\n\"There are things within that predictability that I think give homeowners, give businesses some assurity going into the future, that they have a stable rate climate, they can do their budgeting accordingly,\" Clark said. \"I think that is a very positive, very positive thing.\"\nCommissioners also added a requirement for annual reports on the company's expansion of infrastructure for electric vehicles.\nFPL reached the rate settlement in August with the state Office of Public Counsel, which represents consumers; the Florida Retail Federation; the Florida Industrial Power Users Group; and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Three other parties later signed on.\nThe rate plan incorporates the merger of FPL and Northwest Florida's Gulf Power. That merger formally took effect Jan. 1, but it came with issues such as the utilities having widely different rates.\nIn a prepared statement, FPL President and CEO Eric Silagy said the deal benefits all customers by keeping \"bills low\" while \"accelerating investments in clean energy.\"\n\"Florida is a rapidly growing state on the front lines of climate change, and our customers deserve bold, decisive, long-term actions as we continue building a more resilient and sustainable energy future all of us can depend on, including future generations,\" Silagy said in the statement.\nFor customers outside of Northwest Florida who use 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month, bills are expected to go from the current $101.70 to $113.85 in January. Those bills would increase to $115.52 in 2023, $116.05 in 2024, and $117.02 in 2025. In addition to base rates, the totals include costs for such things as natural gas for power plants.\nThe plan uses what is described as a \"transition rider\" to take into account the substantially different rates that FPL and Gulf have charged. The result will leave Northwest Florida customers paying more than FPL customers in other areas.\nUnder the plan, Gulf residential customers who use 1,000 kilowatt hours a month will see their bills go from the current $129.24 to $137.49 in January. They then would see the bills decrease to $134.44 in 2023, $130.25 in 2024 and $126.47 in 2025.\nFPL filed a base-rate proposal in March and then negotiated the settlement, which trimmed the original proposal by about $428 million. The settlement, in part, reduced a targeted return on equity --- a closely watched measure of profitability --- from 11.5 percent to 10.6 percent.\n\"I believe that all of the parties are to be commended for the outstanding job that you did, negotiating on behalf of the folks that you represented,\" Clark said. \"It's pretty obvious some of you did a little better job than others.\"\nBut the settlement was opposed by Floridians Against Increased Rates, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising, which have members who are residential customers of FPL.\nThose groups argued, in part, that the plan will require residential and small business customers to subsidize the rates of large commercial and industrial customers.\n\"To put it succinctly, a settlement that includes so much wasteful spending to double down on fossil fuels, that transfers so much wealth from residential customers to commercial and industrial customers, and that literally leaves residential customers worse off than in FPL's original proposal, cannot be in the public interest,\" attorneys for the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising wrote in an Oct. 11 brief. \"This 'settlement' gives FPL everything they want --- and more.\"\nThe agreement addresses a series of solar-energy issues, which FPL said will support the development of 16 million solar panels at more than 50 sites across Florida. FPL has been operating under a base-rate settlement that took effect in January 2017 and will end in December.\n(\u00a92021 CBS Local Media. All rights reserved.

    "Document": "Watch CBS News\nGet Ready For Higher Electric Bills, Regulators Sign Off On FPL Rate Increases\n\nOctober 26, 2021 / 11:37 PM EDT\n          / CBS Miami\n        \nTALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami/NSF) - State utility regulators Tuesday approved a series of base-rate increases for Florida Power & Light that will result in higher monthly bills for customers in January.\nDespite opponents' arguments that residential and small business customers will end up subsidizing costs for some larger customers, the Public Service Commission unanimously supported a four-year rate settlement, which calls for a $692 million increase in base rates in January and another increase of $560 million in 2023. Additional increases are planned in 2024 and 2025 to pay for solar projects.\nCommission Chairman Gary Clark noted receiving more than 1,100 emails from consumers about the proposal and indicated he had concerns about ratepayers subsidizing FPL's solar expansion and a electric-vehicle charging station program. But, Clark said he understands the need for clean energy investments and pointed to other benefits of the settlement, such as predictability in rates.\n\"There are things within that predictability that I think give homeowners, give businesses some assurity going into the future, that they have a stable rate climate, they can do their budgeting accordingly,\" Clark said. \"I think that is a very positive, very positive thing.\"\nCommissioners also added a requirement for annual reports on the company's expansion of infrastructure for electric vehicles.\nFPL reached the rate settlement in August with the state Office of Public Counsel, which represents consumers; the Florida Retail Federation; the Florida Industrial Power Users Group; and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Three other parties later signed on.\nThe rate plan incorporates the merger of FPL and Northwest Florida's Gulf Power. That merger formally took effect Jan. 1, but it came with issues such as the utilities having widely different rates.\nIn a prepared statement, FPL President and CEO Eric Silagy said the deal benefits all customers by keeping \"bills low\" while \"accelerating investments in clean energy.\"\n\"Florida is a rapidly growing state on the front lines of climate change, and our customers deserve bold, decisive, long-term actions as we continue building a more resilient and sustainable energy future all of us can depend on, including future generations,\" Silagy said in the statement.\nFor customers outside of Northwest Florida who use 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month, bills are expected to go from the current $101.70 to $113.85 in January. Those bills would increase to $115.52 in 2023, $116.05 in 2024, and $117.02 in 2025. In addition to base rates, the totals include costs for such things as natural gas for power plants.\nThe plan uses what is described as a \"transition rider\" to take into account the substantially different rates that FPL and Gulf have charged. The result will leave Northwest Florida customers paying more than FPL customers in other areas.\nUnder the plan, Gulf residential customers who use 1,000 kilowatt hours a month will see their bills go from the current $129.24 to $137.49 in January. They then would see the bills decrease to $134.44 in 2023, $130.25 in 2024 and $126.47 in 2025.\nFPL filed a base-rate proposal in March and then negotiated the settlement, which trimmed the original proposal by about $428 million. The settlement, in part, reduced a targeted return on equity --- a closely watched measure of profitability --- from 11.5 percent to 10.6 percent.\n\"I believe that all of the parties are to be commended for the outstanding job that you did, negotiating on behalf of the folks that you represented,\" Clark said. \"It's pretty obvious some of you did a little better job than others.\"\nBut the settlement was opposed by Floridians Against Increased Rates, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising, which have members who are residential customers of FPL.\nThose groups argued, in part, that the plan will require residential and small business customers to subsidize the rates of large commercial and industrial customers.\n\"To put it succinctly, a settlement that includes so much wasteful spending to double down on fossil fuels, that transfers so much wealth from residential customers to commercial and industrial customers, and that literally leaves residential customers worse off than in FPL's original proposal, cannot be in the public interest,\" attorneys for the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising wrote in an Oct. 11 brief. \"This 'settlement' gives FPL everything they want --- and more.\"\nThe agreement addresses a series of solar-energy issues, which FPL said will support the development of 16 million solar panels at more than 50 sites across Florida. FPL has been operating under a base-rate settlement that took effect in January 2017 and will end in December.\n(\u00a92021 CBS Local Media. All rights reserved.

    "Document": "A road map for Europe\u2019s automotive industry\nIntroduction\nThe automotive industry is a jewel of the European economy. For decades, the industry has been an important contributor to Europe\u2019s economic growth, innovation, and prosperity, accounting for almost 7 percent of the region\u2019s GDP and being directly or indirectly responsible for employing almost 14 million people.1\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, European Commission, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d ACEA, September 1, 2022; 25 actions for a successful restart of the EU\u2019s automotive sector, CLEPA, May 2020. The industry also carries significant symbolic weight; taglines such as \u201cMade in Germany,\u201d \u201cItalian car design,\u201d \u201cEuro NCAP for Saver Cars,\u201d and \u201cBritish racing\u201d have come to stand for European innovation and craftsmanship.\nHowever, the status quo is being challenged and the industry faces massive ongoing transformations, such as the shift from internal combustion engines to electrified powertrains and a shift in focus from hardware to differentiation through software. This dynamic has allowed new entrants in Europe and abroad\u2014especially in China, the largest automotive market in the world2\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d China - Country Commercial Guide, International Trade Administration, updated April 7, 2023.\u2014to disrupt the market and win market share. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports for the first time, with exports of about 3.0 million vehicles, in contrast to Germany\u2019s 2.6 million.3\u201cWhat if Germany stopped making cars?,\u201d Economist, July 31, 2023. These transformative forces overlap with a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, including rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. All of these factors have greatly affected the European auto industry and make navigating the sector\u2019s transformation challenging. A prosperous future for the European automotive industry will therefore depend on how well and quickly it responds and how European stakeholders can shape the necessary conditions for future success. The need for action is urgent.\nTo that end, we have sketched a road map that covers seven areas. Executing on this plan will require action from a variety of industry stakeholders. Speedy action from automotive companies will be important, but the regional ecosystem, including the public sector and multiple adjacent sectors, will need to participate in shaping a level playing field and a fertile environment for the future of the European automotive industry.\nA multidecade success story\nThe European automotive industry has been an engine powering prosperity and growth, employment, and innovation and has contributed to Europe\u2019s image and perception on the global stage (Exhibit 1).\nAn economic powerhouse for the region, the automotive industry contributed about 10 percent of Europe\u2019s exports in 2022.425 actions for a successful restart, May 2020; \u201cEuropean Union exports by category,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023. The sector\u2019s more than 17,300 companies form a network of OEMs and suppliers of all tiers.5\u201cImpact of electromobility on the European automotive industry,\u201d HitHorizons, February 21, 2022. Significantly, the industry directly or indirectly employs more than 6 percent of the region\u2019s workforce,6\u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d September 1, 2022. creating positive spillover effects outside the sector.\nThe automotive industry has also been a nexus of innovation. Technical champions and small and medium-size businesses within the ecosystem have continuously innovated, especially in the areas of combustion engine powertrain, chassis, safety systems, and exterior and interior design. Indeed, about 30 percent of global automotive patents originated from European countries, the most of any region.7McKinsey analysis based on data about automotive industry global patents from IPlytics and Innography by Clarivate, accessed June 12, 2023. Significant investments into research and development have helped European automakers introduce new technologies that have contributed to major advances in sustainability and safety by improving fuel economies and reducing emissions, noise, and accidents.\nProgress and investment in the European auto industry over the past several decades have contributed to Europe\u2019s global image. German engineering is widely touted,8Dave Taylor, \u201cWho owns the idea of German engineering among German car brands?,\u201d Taylor Brand Group, April 8, 2013. and our research suggests many European automakers are considered front-runners in sustainability, with some of the most ambitious targets around electric vehicles (EVs), decarbonization, and safety.\nThanks in part to this work, the brand value of the ten largest European auto companies is conservatively estimated at a combined \u20ac200 billion; five of the ten most valuable car brands worldwide are European.9\u201cLargest automakers by market capitalization,\u201d CompaniesMarketcap.com, accessed August 15, 2023; brand value analysis based on 2023 data on European automotive companies from Brand Finance, accessed June 20, 2023; Alex Haigh, \u201c2022 Automotive industry trends: Doubling down on electric and connected cars,\u201d Brand Finance, February 22, 2022. The grand challenge now is to maintain and build on these assets in the face of profound and accelerating change.\nDisruption and transformation\nThe historic strengths and recently reported record margins of European OEMs may create a false sense of safety for the industry. Accelerated disruptions around electrification, software, and new competitive pressures loom.\nSubstantial market disruptions have been observed in other industries, with serious outcomes. For instance, European manufacturers lost more than 90 percent of their share of the smartphone market in just six years.10\u201cGlobal market share held by Nokia smartphones from 1st quarter 2007 to 2nd quarter 2013,\u201d Statista Research Department, July 25, 2013. McKinsey analysis shows that leading players in the film camera industry lost similar market share over nine years.\nMarket share data suggest that European OEMs\u2019 leadership position is being challenged as new entrants, especially from China, gain traction. Our analysis also suggests that European market conditions for local development and production are becoming less competitive. Analysis from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility shows that since 2019, European incumbents have lost six percentage points of market share in their home market and five percentage points in China. Meanwhile, Chinese OEMs are gaining ground in both China and Europe, reaching 45 percent market share in their home market in 2022 and octupling their market share in Europe between 2020 and 2022.11McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. This dynamic is even more apparent in battery electric vehicles (BEVs): new EV-focused entrants hold 51 percent of the global BEV market (Exhibit 2).12McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. Besides market share, European OEMs also face the challenge of running profitable BEV businesses.\nA more detailed look at different segments offers a more nuanced picture of the industry. In the premium segment\u2014home turf for many European OEMs\u2014European OEMs still hold 71 percent of global sales. But this segment is also becoming more challenging to hold: newcomers claimed 18 percent of the premium market in 2022.13McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023.\nThis shake-up stems from the fast pace of change in the industry. The transition from internal-combustion-engine (ICE) to zero-emissions vehicles is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80 percent per year since 2020. McKinsey analysis suggests that many global mobility markets will reach near-total EV penetration by the mid-2030s. In response, European OEMs have announced ambitious electrification plans to launch more than 150 EV models through 2030, according to McKinsey analysis.\nThe EV transition drives the industry\u2019s emphasis away from hardware toward software and digital. According to our analysis, EV consumers are more than twice as likely to switch brands for better in-vehicle technology, such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) features and connectivity services. Our research shows that successful automakers are developing cars defined by software, resulting in a tripling of software content per vehicle since 2015.\nWith electrified, software-defined cars becoming the norm, semiconductors and batteries are the new industry control points. In fact, more than a third of the value of a BEV is associated with the battery. Consequently, the European supplier landscape is changing rapidly, and new capabilities are needed in development and manufacturing.\nRecently, software development and hardware development are increasingly decoupling. We\u2019ve observed that European suppliers have become proficient at the interaction between software and hardware in the context of specific control units that oversee specific components of a car, such as the engine or transmission. Modern vehicles may have as many as 150 control units in a distributed software architecture. Hardware and software will increasingly decouple as software becomes more centralized into domains such as the powertrain and in-vehicle connectivity\u2014and, eventually, into computers that oversee zones of the vehicle rather than components.\nAs a result of this shift toward more centralized computing, portions of vehicles may become commoditized, and scale and incremental improvements may become the main drivers of competitiveness. As a result, several component markets increasingly resemble the smartphone industry, in which the core differentiator is software innovation\u2014in addition to economies of scale, industrial excellence, and quality in hardware. McKinsey analysis suggests that the number of build-to-print suppliers (which manufacture products and components to customers\u2019 detailed engineering instructions) in the automotive industry that provide components such as power electronics will increase. We\u2019ve found that about a third of OEMs\u2019 requests for quotes in some powertrain components and systems are already build-to-print requests.\nNew entrants are moving to supply the automotive market with critical future technologies such as batteries, semiconductors, and software. Traditional suppliers find themselves sandwiched between \u201chigh-tech commodity\u201d companies that provide semiconductors and batteries upstream and cost-pressured incumbent OEMs downstream. This dynamic threatens European supply chains. Consider that the current battery value chain is largely controlled by Chinese companies (Exhibit 3).\nTo counteract these developments and form a strong supply network like the one Europe created during the ICE era, major industry participants are announcing strategic partnerships to secure access to resources and manufacturing capacity, especially for batteries and semiconductors. For example, some incumbents plan to strengthen their control over critical portions of the value chain by partnering with mine operators or even acquiring stakes in mines.14\u201cFactbox: Automakers accelerate drive to secure battery raw materials,\u201d Reuters, April 3, 2023; Victoria Waldersee, \u201cVolkswagen to invest in mines in bid to become global battery supplier,\u201d Reuters, March 17, 2023. While these actions are steps in the right direction, the projected supply and capacity are not yet enough to meet the region\u2019s forecast demand by 2030. Accelerated efforts are necessary.\nMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\nIn a perfect storm for the European auto industry, the current macroeconomic climate is turbulent, with multiple ongoing crises. Compared with other regions, Europe is particularly exposed and affected, and the automotive sector is at a disadvantage compared with other important industries. These challenges fall into five major areas:\nEnergy and resources. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe have surged to twice the costs in the United States and triple costs in China.1McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cChina electricity prices,\u201d GlobalPetrolPrices.com, December 2022; \u201cMidwest Information Office: Average energy prices for the United States, regions, census divisions, and selected metropolitan areas,\u201d US Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed August 17, 2023; and \u201cElectricity price statistics,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. This creates challenges for the auto industry, in which a significant portion of production costs come from energy requirements.\nGeopolitical tensions. The European auto industry generates a significant\u2014and higher compared with other regions\u2014share of its revenues through exports,2McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cInternational trade in cars,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. which means current geopolitical pressures have an outsize impact on European automakers.\nSupply chain challenges. Compared with other industries, the auto industry relies more heavily on timely deliveries of parts and components from international markets. The European auto industry is therefore at considerable risk when finely tuned international supply chains are disrupted.\nInflation. Inflation has hit Europe much more severely than the United States or China, with labor costs for European automakers disproportionately affected compared with other industries.3\u201cConsumer prices up 4.9 percent from April 2022 to April 2023,\u201d\u00a0TED: The Economics Daily, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, May 15, 2023.\nProductivity crisis. Europe\u2019s productivity and economic growth lag behind those of its peers, particularly in areas such as software engineering in which the auto industry needs significant additional capacity.4\u201cUnited States full year GDP growth,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cPriority reforms key for sustaining growth and achieving China\u2019s long-term goals - World Bank report,\u201d World Bank, June 14, 2023.\nFinally, these transformative forces overlap with a European macroeconomic environment that has a particularly acute impact on the region\u2019s auto industry (see sidebar \u201cMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\u201d).\nRoad map for the European automotive industry\nThe European auto industry is in the midst of the greatest change in its history. In service of helping the industry remain globally competitive we outline a road map of seven pillars for stakeholders to act on (Exhibit 4). The time to act is now: according to our analysis, European automotive OEMs and suppliers earn about three times the revenue of their Chinese counterparts and five times the EBIT, which means the European industry can act from a position of strength.\nA rapid response from OEMs and suppliers in the European auto industry will be important. But other stakeholders\u2014including adjacent industries such as the energy, research, and public sectors\u2014would also need to act collaboratively to provide an environment that enables success for the European automotive industry (and mobility ecosystem) of the future. In short, the ecosystem approach that made Europe strong in the ICE era has to be translated to serve the era of software-defined, electrified cars.\nRevive strengths in customer understanding, product design, and brand\nThe European automotive industry will need to extend its legacy of cutting-edge product design and superior brand value and transfer it into the new context of software-defined electric vehicles.\nOf the 25 global brands with the highest brand value, all but three are European.15\u201cLuxury & premium 2023 ranking,\u201d Brandirectory, Brand Finance, accessed August 15, 2023. Our data show that brand remains among the top five purchase criteria for European, American, and Chinese auto consumers. However, in the age of electrification and software-defined cars, purchase criteria will change and brand rankings might get reshuffled.\nTo maintain superior brand value, European incumbent OEMs would need to analyze and understand customer needs and preferences to build desirable products. Traditional consumer segmentation would need to be adapted for the era of software-defined electric vehicles, with more-detailed consumer profiles and more-granular user profiles. Owning and analyzing consumer data will enable OEMs to offer tailored mobility solutions and seamlessly engage consumers across the life cycle. They can also build their product development organizations to reflect customer journeys and experiences, which would bring operational roles closer to the customer. As consumers\u2019 desires change and technology advances, OEMs would need to continuously update their software remotely to bring the most up-to-date functionality to customers and meet their needs.\nFocus relentlessly on cost and speed\nMcKinsey research from 2022 shows that the vehicle purchase price is the most important buying factor for consumers across markets.16Annual MCFM Consumer Survey 2022, McKinsey Center for Future Mobility, global n = 27,869, December 2022. Particularly in EVs, Chinese OEMs can turn their cost advantage into a competitive edge: our analysis shows that their costs are 20 to 30 percent lower than those of European OEMs.\nTo catch up, European OEMs could drive down costs strategically. According to our analysis, European OEMs could close up to 20 percentage points of the cost gap by adopting structural product design, vertically integrating battery production, scaling EV production, and improving productivity. For example, battery insourcing could decrease European OEMs\u2019 costs by three percentage points, and cost-efficient battery cell chemistry alternatives could save five to six percentage points for some vehicles and segments. As for the remaining 5 to 10 percentage-point cost gap, European OEMs could identify differentiating features that consumers would be willing to pay a premium for, such as brand differentiation; environmental, social, and governance (ESG) leadership; and superior safety performance.\nSpeed is another consideration. McKinsey analysis shows that European OEMs have a long development cycle compared with competitors from other regions, with concept-to-pilot phases lasting up to four years. By contrast, we\u2019ve found that the fastest automakers in China need only 21 months to move from concept to pilot, allowing them to respond to market trends much more quickly.\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not necessarily appropriate to make direct comparisons between the Chinese and European automotive sectors or development cycles. However, European OEMs should take on the challenge and redesign their own processes to accelerate innovation, development, and industrialization. For instance, the product design process could be accelerated through iterative styling methods. Subsequent product development could be optimized by decoupling hardware and software development and by applying agile principles to software development. Across all processes, co-locating cross-domain teams and setting up task forces for products that are behind schedule or components with supply bottlenecks can further accelerate development.\nExecute a winning strategy for the Chinese market\nOur research shows China will remain the biggest automotive market in the future, which means winning in China will be important for European OEMs and suppliers that want to play a globally relevant role.\nEuropean incumbents have lost five percentage points of market share in China since 2019, a substantial decrease. Meanwhile, our analysis shows that Chinese automakers are outpacing their competitors and have gained more than ten percentage points of market share in China, driven by their hold on more than 80 percent of the EV market.17McKinsey analysis based on global passenger-car sales data from IHS Markit, 2002\u201322, accessed May 20, 2023.\nHow have they done it? Chinese OEMs offer significantly lower price points, and their products are more appealing and tailored to Chinese consumers\u2019 needs and preferences. They also bring targeted innovations to market rapidly; our research shows that more than 70 percent of new vehicles unveiled at the Shanghai auto show in April 2023 came from Chinese OEMs.\nLike their OEM counterparts, European automotive suppliers have a hard time gaining traction with Chinese EV players, especially for EV powertrain components and systems. While Western suppliers have held more than half of China\u2019s ICE powertrain market, they hold less than 5 percent of the EV powertrain market.18McKinsey analysis based on IHS Markit Production Forecast, number of model launches by powertrain for Aion, BMW, BYD, Mercedes-Benz, NIO, Tesla, Volkswagen and Xpeng, data as of 2022, accessed June 10, 2023.\nEuropean OEMs and suppliers would need a fundamental strategic overhaul to regain competitiveness in China and meet the preferences of Chinese customers. This starts with developing products specifically tailored for the Chinese market. According to our research, the average customer in China is 34 years old, compared with 58 in Europe. These consumers have significantly different purchasing criteria. For instance, Chinese consumers place higher value on cutting-edge technology, connectivity, advanced driver assistance systems, and on-board multimedia screens than European and American consumers do. Chinese car buyers also favor simplified vehicle choices with preconfigured options.19Thomas Fang, Mingyu Guan, Bill Peng, and Tony Zhou, \u201cMcKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2023,\u201d July 14, 2023.\nTo implement a \u201clocal for local\u201d strategy\u2014in which R&D, production, and distribution are in close proximity to where products will be bought and used\u2014European players would need to adjust their operating models for the Chinese market. For example, OEMs could localize research and development capabilities and transfer decision rights to local management. Entering local partnerships across the portfolio and supply chain will also be essential to develop a strong foothold in China and to benefit from the know-how and reputations of local partners.\nCreate resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains\nTo reduce bottlenecks and dependencies, the industry will need resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains centered on batteries, semiconductors, and green materials. In 2021, the chip crisis led to a loss of ten million vehicles in global production,20\u201cS&P Global Mobility on short- & long-term impact from chip shortage,\u201d Auto Remarketing, July 14, 2023. highlighting a need to increase supply chain resilience.\nTo create resilient supply, localization is vital. We project that the European supply\u2013demand gap for batteries will reach almost 40 percent, or 500 gigawatt-hours (GWh), by 2030. To cover European battery demand locally, an additional 20 gigafactories, a \u20ac35 billion investment, would be needed.21McKinsey Battery Insights analysis assumes a 500-GWh supply\u2013demand gap and average capital expenditures of \u20ac70 million per gigawatt hour in Europe. This leads to a \u20ac35 million investment need, in addition to the already announced \u20ac70 million for planned and existing factories in Europe. The continent would also need 37 new semiconductor fabs to cover local demand, requiring a \u20ac190 billion investment.22Annual report 2020: The automotive industry in facts and figures, Verband der Automobilindustrie, 2020. As a first step, the European Chips Act will provide \u20ac43 billion in subsidies. Next steps could involve expanding the ecosystem along the value chain while safeguarding crucial supplies, with tactics such as increasing safety stock and implementing dual-sourcing strategies.\nAt least in the midterm, improving the circularity of supply chains will further decrease Europe\u2019s dependence on raw materials and components from other regions while increasing sustainability. It could also increase the share of local added value in critical EV components and create additional jobs and economic growth. Our analysis shows that reusing materials from scrapped batteries can also save up to 10 percent of costs and avoid 20 percent of the CO2 required in production. To implement a circular value chain, industry stakeholders would need to commit to the use of recycled content and material efficiency and establish reverse operations at end of life.\nEnd-to-end transparency on ESG criteria such as digital traceability is an important way to make critical supply chains more sustainable. As sustainability standards in key industries begin to develop\u2014consider the launch of the battery passport, which contains ESG data for batteries23\u201cAction partnerships: Battery passport,\u201d Global Battery Alliance, accessed August 15, 2023.\u2014the European auto industry should stay at the forefront of ESG performance to gain and maintain competitive advantage in the future.\nHyperscale competitive European battery and semiconductor players\nWe\u2019ve observed that European players are underrepresented in battery manufacturing and high-end compute and semiconductors that power artificial intelligence. According to our analysis, only one European manufacturer is among the top ten in terms of market capitalization for battery manufacturing, while in semiconductors, Europe needs to close the capability gap for the next wave of computing to deliver functionalities such as ADAS.\nA path to creating an ecosystem of technology champions consists of three elements. First, Europe should consider developing a pan-European regulatory rule book to scale high-growth firms, aligning tax standards, regulations, labor rules, and bureaucratic processes. Second, to stay at the forefront of technology, the region would need to build specialized knowledge and product innovation capabilities. Suppliers could tap into niche specialties, such as more-sustainable battery refining. Finally, the European industry would need a battery and semiconductor network, similar to the one that serves the aerospace industry. European incumbents could form strategic partnerships with emerging entrants and research institutions.\nDesign a way forward for ADAS with policy support\nAdvanced driver assistance systems features are increasingly important. They are becoming a key differentiator for vehicle buyers: According to our research, 51 percent of consumers worldwide would consider switching to some form of ADAS car in the future. Competitive pressures around ADAS are also intensifying. In 2022, Mercedes-Benz was the first automotive player to introduce and certify Level 3 autonomy, the threshold at which drivers can take their hands off the wheel.24Andrew J. Hawkins, \u201cMercedes-Benz is the first to bring Level 3 automated driving to the US,\u201d Verge, January 27, 2023. Other participants in the global industry are catching up using a variety of technology approaches.\nTo remain competitive, the European industry may need to form a cross-industry alliance. Players could collaborate in two main areas. The first area is where differentiation is negligible and where there are opportunities for savings. This would include standardizing sensor communication protocols, which would simplify the integration of new sensors. Standardizing middleware (which sits between front- and back-end technologies) and layers of the operating system are other approaches.\nThe second area of collaboration is where scale and large databases could enable a faster, more robust development process for efforts including the continuous updates of software layers in maps\u2014updates such as creating high-definition map- and location-based services. A shared pool of data could also be used for AI training and validation.\nThe right regulatory environment could be critical to enable this kind of cross-industry collaboration. Public-sector stakeholders could consider adapting existing guidelines to the context of autonomous driving. These updates could encourage collaborative precompetitive research and innovation that advance and accelerate technological progress and drive standardization.\nClose the software skill gap to win the automotive digital transition\nSoftware is essential to the future of the automotive industry. But according to our analysis, only 15 to 20 percent of current R&D workers at European incumbents have software skills, compared with almost 45 percent at new entrants.\nTo shrink the gap, industry stakeholders would need to find holistic solutions. For example, European incumbents could create shared\u2014or at least interoperable\u2014software platforms across OEMs in Europe (and possibly other regions where the industry has strong partnerships) to complement individual participants\u2019 capabilities and to avoid costly solo efforts.\nEarly hiring, reskilling, and foreign talent can also help close the gap. Players can intensify early hiring directly from universities and boost STEM and software talent education through partnerships with universities and schools. Our research shows that reskilling is already in progress: 37 percent of European suppliers have ongoing reskilling efforts, and another 41 percent have plans to implement them. To draw skilled software talent from other regions, European employers would need accelerate processes around work permits and accommodate foreign talent\u2019s requirements on salary, benefits, and working conditions.\nCreating an environment that enables accelerated progress\nAbout the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility\nThese insights were developed by the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM). Since 2011, the MCFM has worked with stakeholders across the mobility ecosystem by providing independent and integrated evidence about possible future-mobility scenarios. With our unique, bottom-up modeling approach, our insights enable an end-to-end analytics journey through the future of mobility\u2014from consumer needs to modal mix across urban/rural areas, sales, value pools, and life cycle sustainability. Contact us if you are interested in getting full access to our market insights via the McKinsey Mobility Insights Portal.\nEuropean automotive players are moving in the right direction but should consider scaling and accelerating their efforts. To accomplish this, a wide variety of stakeholders in the region would need to create an environment that breeds progress and future wins for the region\u2019s automotive industry. The formula requires a road map, catalysts, and platforms for cooperation.\nA clear road map such as the one we outline is needed to help accelerate the European automotive industry\u2019s progress. Its seven pillars would need to be converted into actionable measures and quantifiable targets for industry stakeholders\u2014suppliers, OEMs, players from adjacent industries, and regulatory bodies. Associations could take on a coordinating role.\nCatalysts play a significant role in implementing the road map. One is a competitive regulatory environment. Clearly defining and communicating common standards and codifying interoperability across all elements of the road map is likely to be critical.\nAnother critical catalyst of the European industry\u2019s transition is EV infrastructure. According to our analysis, the industry will need a cumulative \u20ac300 billion worth of infrastructure investments in electricity generation, the electricity grid, EV chargers, and hydrogen refueling systems through 2030.25European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. European stakeholders have begun to install public chargers at a pace of 2,000 charging points per week.26European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. But to meet demand, decision makers would need to build out charging infrastructure to the tune of 6,000 to 14,000 charging points per week.27European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. We found that the wind and solar assets required to fulfill the corresponding demand for energy with renewable sources would require four times as many workers in Europe by 2030 than are currently available.\nFinally, the industry would need platforms for collaboration. As industry boundaries are redefined, three kinds of partnership will become more important: horizontal partnerships between entities in the same parts of the value chain (such as multiple car companies) for efforts such as software development or to gain a solid footing in the Chinese market; vertical partnerships between entities in different parts of the value chain (such as car companies with tech companies) to secure access to technology and talent; and cross-industry partnerships, such as collaborations between automotive players and utilities to facilitate structural goals such as seamless sector coupling.\nOur road map shows a way forward for a globally competitive European auto industry. The work will require action from an expansive array of regional stakeholders and a supportive administrative environment. Time is of the essence.\nAndreas Cornet and Andreas Tschiesner are senior partners in McKinsey\u2019s Munich office, where Patrick Schaufuss is a partner; Ruth Heuss is a senior partner in the Berlin office.\nThe authors wish to thank Ondrej Burkacky, Julian Conzade, Johannes Deichmann, Lauritz Fischer, Maximilian Geirhos, Marco Groth, Volker Gr\u00fcntges, Antonia Gutzler, Martin Hattrup-Silberberg, Martin Kellner, Martin Linder, Nicoline L\u00fchrs, Lukas Michor, Jan Paulitschek, and Kirsten Weerda for their contributions to this report.",
    "Summarized_Document": "The European automotive industry is a significant contributor to the region's economy, accounting for nearly 7% of GDP and employing around 14 million people. However, it faces challenges such as the shift to electrified powertrains, software differentiation, and competition from new entrants, particularly from China. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports, with 3.0 million vehicles compared to Germany's 2.6 million. Rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions further complicate the industry's landscape.The industry has historically been a hub of innovation, with 30% of global automotive patents originating from Europe. Investments in R&D have led to advancements in sustainability and safety. The brand value of the top ten European auto companies is estimated at \u20ac200 billion, with five of the ten most valuable car brands being European.Despite these strengths, the industry is undergoing significant disruptions. European OEMs have lost market share to Chinese competitors, particularly in battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The transition to EVs is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80% annually since 2020. European OEMs have announced plans to launch over 150 EV models by 2030.The shift to software-defined vehicles is also crucial, with semiconductors and batteries becoming key components. European suppliers need to adapt to this change, as modern vehicles may have up to 150 control units. The industry must also address supply chain challenges, particularly in batteries and semiconductors, to remain competitive.Macroeconomic challenges such as high energy costs, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and a productivity crisis further impact the industry. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe are twice those in the U.S. and triple those in China, affecting production costs.To navigate these challenges, a road map with seven pillars is proposed: understanding customer needs, focusing on cost and speed, executing a winning strategy for the Chinese market, creating resilient supply chains, developing competitive battery and semiconductor players, advancing ADAS with policy support, and closing the software skill gap.European OEMs need to localize R&D and production in China, develop products tailored to Chinese consumers, and form strategic partnerships. Resilient supply chains require localization, circularity, and sustainability. The industry needs significant investments in battery and semiconductor manufacturing to meet future demand.Collaboration across the industry and with adjacent sectors is essential. A competitive regulatory environment and substantial investments in EV infrastructure are critical. The industry must also focus on software skills, with only 15-20% of current R&D workers having software expertise compared to 45% at new entrants.In summary, the European automotive industry must act swiftly and collaboratively to maintain its global competitiveness in the face of profound changes and challenges.",

For decades, the industry has been an important contributor to Europe\u2019s economic growth, innovation, and prosperity, accounting for almost 7 percent of the region\u2019s GDP and being directly or indirectly responsible for employing almost 14 million people.1\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, European Commission, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d ACEA, September 1, 2022; 25 actions for a successful restart of the EU\u2019s automotive sector, CLEPA, May 2020. The industry also carries significant symbolic weight; taglines such as \u201cMade in Germany,\u201d \u201cItalian car design,\u201d \u201cEuro NCAP for Saver Cars,\u201d and \u201cBritish racing\u201d have come to stand for European innovation and craftsmanship.\nHowever, the status quo is being challenged and the industry faces massive ongoing transformations, such as the shift from internal combustion engines to electrified powertrains and a shift in focus from hardware to differentiation through software. This dynamic has allowed new entrants in Europe and abroad\u2014especially in China, the largest automotive market in the world2\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d China - Country Commercial Guide, International Trade Administration, updated April 7, 2023.\u2014to disrupt the market and win market share. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports for the first time, with exports of about 3.0 million vehicles, in contrast to Germany\u2019s 2.6 million.3\u201cWhat if Germany stopped making cars?,\u201d Economist, July 31, 2023. These transformative forces overlap with a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, including rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. All of these factors have greatly affected the European auto industry and make navigating the sector\u2019s transformation challenging. A prosperous future for the European automotive industry will therefore depend on how well and quickly it responds and how European stakeholders can shape the necessary conditions for future success. The need for action is urgent.\nTo that end, we have sketched a road map that covers seven areas. Executing on this plan will require action from a variety of industry stakeholders. Speedy action from automotive companies will be important, but the regional ecosystem, including the public sector and multiple adjacent sectors, will need to participate in shaping a level playing field and a fertile environment for the future of the European automotive industry.\nA multidecade success story\nThe European automotive industry has been an engine powering prosperity and growth, employment, and innovation and has contributed to Europe\u2019s image and perception on the global stage (Exhibit 1).\nAn economic powerhouse for the region, the automotive industry contributed about 10 percent of Europe\u2019s exports in 2022.425 actions for a successful restart, May 2020; \u201cEuropean Union exports by category,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023.

Significantly, the industry directly or indirectly employs more than 6 percent of the region\u2019s workforce,6\u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d September 1, 2022. creating positive spillover effects outside the sector.\nThe automotive industry has also been a nexus of innovation. Technical champions and small and medium-size businesses within the ecosystem have continuously innovated, especially in the areas of combustion engine powertrain, chassis, safety systems, and exterior and interior design. Indeed, about 30 percent of global automotive patents originated from European countries, the most of any region.7McKinsey analysis based on data about automotive industry global patents from IPlytics and Innography by Clarivate, accessed June 12, 2023. Significant investments into research and development have helped European automakers introduce new technologies that have contributed to major advances in sustainability and safety by improving fuel economies and reducing emissions, noise, and accidents.\nProgress and investment in the European auto industry over the past several decades have contributed to Europe\u2019s global image. German engineering is widely touted,8Dave Taylor, \u201cWho owns the idea of German engineering among German car brands?,\u201d Taylor Brand Group, April 8, 2013. and our research suggests many European automakers are considered front-runners in sustainability, with some of the most ambitious targets around electric vehicles (EVs), decarbonization, and safety.\nThanks in part to this work, the brand value of the ten largest European auto companies is conservatively estimated at a combined \u20ac200 billion; five of the ten most valuable car brands worldwide are European.9\u201cLargest automakers by market capitalization,\u201d CompaniesMarketcap.com, accessed August 15, 2023; brand value analysis based on 2023 data on European automotive companies from Brand Finance, accessed June 20, 2023; Alex Haigh, \u201c2022 Automotive industry trends: Doubling down on electric and connected cars,\u201d Brand Finance, February 22, 2022. The grand challenge now is to maintain and build on these assets in the face of profound and accelerating change.\nDisruption and transformation\nThe historic strengths and recently reported record margins of European OEMs may create a false sense of safety for the industry. Accelerated disruptions around electrification, software, and new competitive pressures loom.\nSubstantial market disruptions have been observed in other industries, with serious outcomes. For instance, European manufacturers lost more than 90 percent of their share of the smartphone market in just six years.10\u201cGlobal market share held by Nokia smartphones from 1st quarter 2007 to 2nd quarter 2013,\u201d Statista Research Department, July 25, 2013. McKinsey analysis shows that leading players in the film camera industry lost similar market share over nine years.\nMarket share data suggest that European OEMs\u2019 leadership position is being challenged as new entrants, especially from China, gain traction. Our analysis also suggests that European market conditions for local development and production are becoming less competitive. Analysis from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility shows that since 2019, European incumbents have lost six percentage points of market share in their home market and five percentage points in China. Meanwhile, Chinese OEMs are gaining ground in both China and Europe, reaching 45 percent market share in their home market in 2022 and octupling their market share in Europe between 2020 and 2022.11McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. This dynamic is even more apparent in battery electric vehicles (BEVs): new EV-focused entrants hold 51 percent of the global BEV market (Exhibit 2).12McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. Besides market share, European OEMs also face the challenge of running profitable BEV businesses.\nA more detailed look at different segments offers a more nuanced picture of the industry. In the premium segment\u2014home turf for many European OEMs\u2014European OEMs still hold 71 percent of global sales. But this segment is also becoming more challenging to hold: newcomers claimed 18 percent of the premium market in 2022.13McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023.\nThis shake-up stems from the fast pace of change in the industry. The transition from internal-combustion-engine (ICE) to zero-emissions vehicles is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80 percent per year since 2020. McKinsey analysis suggests that many global mobility markets will reach near-total EV penetration by the mid-2030s. In response, European OEMs have announced ambitious electrification plans to launch more than 150 EV models through 2030, according to McKinsey analysis.\nThe EV transition drives the industry\u2019s emphasis away from hardware toward software and digital. According to our analysis, EV consumers are more than twice as likely to switch brands for better in-vehicle technology, such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) features and connectivity services. Our research shows that successful automakers are developing cars defined by software, resulting in a tripling of software content per vehicle since 2015.\nWith electrified, software-defined cars becoming the norm, semiconductors and batteries are the new industry control points. In fact, more than a third of the value of a BEV is associated with the battery. Consequently, the European supplier landscape is changing rapidly, and new capabilities are needed in development and manufacturing.\nRecently, software development and hardware development are increasingly decoupling. We\u2019ve observed that European suppliers have become proficient at the interaction between software and hardware in the context of specific control units that oversee specific components of a car, such as the engine or transmission. Modern vehicles may have as many as 150 control units in a distributed software architecture. Hardware and software will increasingly decouple as software becomes more centralized into domains such as the powertrain and in-vehicle connectivity\u2014and, eventually, into computers that oversee zones of the vehicle rather than components.\nAs a result of this shift toward more centralized computing, portions of vehicles may become commoditized, and scale and incremental improvements may become the main drivers of competitiveness. As a result, several component markets increasingly resemble the smartphone industry, in which the core differentiator is software innovation\u2014in addition to economies of scale, industrial excellence, and quality in hardware. McKinsey analysis suggests that the number of build-to-print suppliers (which manufacture products and components to customers\u2019 detailed engineering instructions) in the automotive industry that provide components such as power electronics will increase. We\u2019ve found that about a third of OEMs\u2019 requests for quotes in some powertrain components and systems are already build-to-print requests.\nNew entrants are moving to supply the automotive market with critical future technologies such as batteries, semiconductors, and software. Traditional suppliers find themselves sandwiched between \u201chigh-tech commodity\u201d companies that provide semiconductors and batteries upstream and cost-pressured incumbent OEMs downstream. This dynamic threatens European supply chains. Consider that the current battery value chain is largely controlled by Chinese companies (Exhibit 3).\nTo counteract these developments and form a strong supply network like the one Europe created during the ICE era, major industry participants are announcing strategic partnerships to secure access to resources and manufacturing capacity, especially for batteries and semiconductors. For example, some incumbents plan to strengthen their control over critical portions of the value chain by partnering with mine operators or even acquiring stakes in mines.14\u201cFactbox: Automakers accelerate drive to secure battery raw materials,\u201d Reuters, April 3, 2023; Victoria Waldersee, \u201cVolkswagen to invest in mines in bid to become global battery supplier,\u201d Reuters, March 17, 2023. While these actions are steps in the right direction, the projected supply and capacity are not yet enough to meet the region\u2019s forecast demand by 2030. Accelerated efforts are necessary.\nMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\nIn a perfect storm for the European auto industry, the current macroeconomic climate is turbulent, with multiple ongoing crises. Compared with other regions, Europe is particularly exposed and affected, and the automotive sector is at a disadvantage compared with other important industries. These challenges fall into five major areas:\nEnergy and resources. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe have surged to twice the costs in the United States and triple costs in China.1McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cChina electricity prices,\u201d GlobalPetrolPrices.com, December 2022; \u201cMidwest Information Office: Average energy prices for the United States, regions, census divisions, and selected metropolitan areas,\u201d US Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed August 17, 2023; and \u201cElectricity price statistics,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. This creates challenges for the auto industry, in which a significant portion of production costs come from energy requirements.\nGeopolitical tensions. The European auto industry generates a significant\u2014and higher compared with other regions\u2014share of its revenues through exports,2McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cInternational trade in cars,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. which means current geopolitical pressures have an outsize impact on European automakers.\nSupply chain challenges. Compared with other industries, the auto industry relies more heavily on timely deliveries of parts and components from international markets. The European auto industry is therefore at considerable risk when finely tuned international supply chains are disrupted.\nInflation. Inflation has hit Europe much more severely than the United States or China, with labor costs for European automakers disproportionately affected compared with other industries.3\u201cConsumer prices up 4.9 percent from April 2022 to April 2023,\u201d\u00a0TED: The Economics Daily, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, May 15, 2023.\nProductivity crisis. Europe\u2019s productivity and economic growth lag behind those of its peers, particularly in areas such as software engineering in which the auto industry needs significant additional capacity.4\u201cUnited States full year GDP growth,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cPriority reforms key for sustaining growth and achieving China\u2019s long-term goals - World Bank report,\u201d World Bank, June 14, 2023.\nFinally, these transformative forces overlap with a European macroeconomic environment that has a particularly acute impact on the region\u2019s auto industry (see sidebar \u201cMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\u201d).\nRoad map for the European automotive industry\nThe European auto industry is in the midst of the greatest change in its history. In service of helping the industry remain globally competitive we outline a road map of seven pillars for stakeholders to act on (Exhibit 4). The time to act is now: according to our analysis, European automotive OEMs and suppliers earn about three times the revenue of their Chinese counterparts and five times the EBIT, which means the European industry can act from a position of strength.\nA rapid response from OEMs and suppliers in the European auto industry will be important. But other stakeholders\u2014including adjacent industries such as the energy, research, and public sectors\u2014would also need to act collaboratively to provide an environment that enables success for the European automotive industry (and mobility ecosystem) of the future. In short, the ecosystem approach that made Europe strong in the ICE era has to be translated to serve the era of software-defined, electrified cars.\nRevive strengths in customer understanding, product design, and brand\nThe European automotive industry will need to extend its legacy of cutting-edge product design and superior brand value and transfer it into the new context of software-defined electric vehicles.\nOf the 25 global brands with the highest brand value, all but three are European.15\u201cLuxury & premium 2023 ranking,\u201d Brandirectory, Brand Finance, accessed August 15, 2023. Our data show that brand remains among the top five purchase criteria for European, American, and Chinese auto consumers. However, in the age of electrification and software-defined cars, purchase criteria will change and brand rankings might get reshuffled.\nTo maintain superior brand value, European incumbent OEMs would need to analyze and understand customer needs and preferences to build desirable products. Traditional consumer segmentation would need to be adapted for the era of software-defined electric vehicles, with more-detailed consumer profiles and more-granular user profiles. Owning and analyzing consumer data will enable OEMs to offer tailored mobility solutions and seamlessly engage consumers across the life cycle. They can also build their product development organizations to reflect customer journeys and experiences, which would bring operational roles closer to the customer. As consumers\u2019 desires change and technology advances, OEMs would need to continuously update their software remotely to bring the most up-to-date functionality to customers and meet their needs.\nFocus relentlessly on cost and speed\nMcKinsey research from 2022 shows that the vehicle purchase price is the most important buying factor for consumers across markets.16Annual MCFM Consumer Survey 2022, McKinsey Center for Future Mobility, global n = 27,869, December 2022. Particularly in EVs, Chinese OEMs can turn their cost advantage into a competitive edge: our analysis shows that their costs are 20 to 30 percent lower than those of European OEMs.\nTo catch up, European OEMs could drive down costs strategically. According to our analysis, European OEMs could close up to 20 percentage points of the cost gap by adopting structural product design, vertically integrating battery production, scaling EV production, and improving productivity. For example, battery insourcing could decrease European OEMs\u2019 costs by three percentage points, and cost-efficient battery cell chemistry alternatives could save five to six percentage points for some vehicles and segments. As for the remaining 5 to 10 percentage-point cost gap, European OEMs could identify differentiating features that consumers would be willing to pay a premium for, such as brand differentiation; environmental, social, and governance (ESG) leadership; and superior safety performance.\nSpeed is another consideration. McKinsey analysis shows that European OEMs have a long development cycle compared with competitors from other regions, with concept-to-pilot phases lasting up to four years. By contrast, we\u2019ve found that the fastest automakers in China need only 21 months to move from concept to pilot, allowing them to respond to market trends much more quickly.\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not necessarily appropriate to make direct comparisons between the Chinese and European automotive sectors or development cycles. However, European OEMs should take on the challenge and redesign their own processes to accelerate innovation, development, and industrialization. For instance, the product design process could be accelerated through iterative styling methods. Subsequent product development could be optimized by decoupling hardware and software development and by applying agile principles to software development. Across all processes, co-locating cross-domain teams and setting up task forces for products that are behind schedule or components with supply bottlenecks can further accelerate development.\nExecute a winning strategy for the Chinese market\nOur research shows China will remain the biggest automotive market in the future, which means winning in China will be important for European OEMs and suppliers that want to play a globally relevant role.\nEuropean incumbents have lost five percentage points of market share in China since 2019, a substantial decrease. Meanwhile, our analysis shows that Chinese automakers are outpacing their competitors and have gained more than ten percentage points of market share in China, driven by their hold on more than 80 percent of the EV market.17McKinsey analysis based on global passenger-car sales data from IHS Markit, 2002\u201322, accessed May 20, 2023.\nHow have they done it? Chinese OEMs offer significantly lower price points, and their products are more appealing and tailored to Chinese consumers\u2019 needs and preferences. They also bring targeted innovations to market rapidly; our research shows that more than 70 percent of new vehicles unveiled at the Shanghai auto show in April 2023 came from Chinese OEMs.\nLike their OEM counterparts, European automotive suppliers have a hard time gaining traction with Chinese EV players, especially for EV powertrain components and systems. While Western suppliers have held more than half of China\u2019s ICE powertrain market, they hold less than 5 percent of the EV powertrain market.18McKinsey analysis based on IHS Markit Production Forecast, number of model launches by powertrain for Aion, BMW, BYD, Mercedes-Benz, NIO, Tesla, Volkswagen and Xpeng, data as of 2022, accessed June 10, 2023.\nEuropean OEMs and suppliers would need a fundamental strategic overhaul to regain competitiveness in China and meet the preferences of Chinese customers. This starts with developing products specifically tailored for the Chinese market. According to our research, the average customer in China is 34 years old, compared with 58 in Europe. These consumers have significantly different purchasing criteria. For instance, Chinese consumers place higher value on cutting-edge technology, connectivity, advanced driver assistance systems, and on-board multimedia screens than European and American consumers do. Chinese car buyers also favor simplified vehicle choices with preconfigured options.19Thomas Fang, Mingyu Guan, Bill Peng, and Tony Zhou, \u201cMcKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2023,\u201d July 14, 2023.\nTo implement a \u201clocal for local\u201d strategy\u2014in which R&D, production, and distribution are in close proximity to where products will be bought and used\u2014European players would need to adjust their operating models for the Chinese market. For example, OEMs could localize research and development capabilities and transfer decision rights to local management. Entering local partnerships across the portfolio and supply chain will also be essential to develop a strong foothold in China and to benefit from the know-how and reputations of local partners.\nCreate resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains\nTo reduce bottlenecks and dependencies, the industry will need resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains centered on batteries, semiconductors, and green materials. In 2021, the chip crisis led to a loss of ten million vehicles in global production,20\u201cS&P Global Mobility on short- & long-term impact from chip shortage,\u201d Auto Remarketing, July 14, 2023. highlighting a need to increase supply chain resilience.\nTo create resilient supply, localization is vital. We project that the European supply\u2013demand gap for batteries will reach almost 40 percent, or 500 gigawatt-hours (GWh), by 2030. To cover European battery demand locally, an additional 20 gigafactories, a \u20ac35 billion investment, would be needed.21McKinsey Battery Insights analysis assumes a 500-GWh supply\u2013demand gap and average capital expenditures of \u20ac70 million per gigawatt hour in Europe. This leads to a \u20ac35 million investment need, in addition to the already announced \u20ac70 million for planned and existing factories in Europe. The continent would also need 37 new semiconductor fabs to cover local demand, requiring a \u20ac190 billion investment.22Annual report 2020: The automotive industry in facts and figures, Verband der Automobilindustrie, 2020. As a first step, the European Chips Act will provide \u20ac43 billion in subsidies. Next steps could involve expanding the ecosystem along the value chain while safeguarding crucial supplies, with tactics such as increasing safety stock and implementing dual-sourcing strategies.\nAt least in the midterm, improving the circularity of supply chains will further decrease Europe\u2019s dependence on raw materials and components from other regions while increasing sustainability. It could also increase the share of local added value in critical EV components and create additional jobs and economic growth. Our analysis shows that reusing materials from scrapped batteries can also save up to 10 percent of costs and avoid 20 percent of the CO2 required in production. To implement a circular value chain, industry stakeholders would need to commit to the use of recycled content and material efficiency and establish reverse operations at end of life.\nEnd-to-end transparency on ESG criteria such as digital traceability is an important way to make critical supply chains more sustainable. As sustainability standards in key industries begin to develop\u2014consider the launch of the battery passport, which contains ESG data for batteries23\u201cAction partnerships: Battery passport,\u201d Global Battery Alliance, accessed August 15, 2023.\u2014the European auto industry should stay at the forefront of ESG performance to gain and maintain competitive advantage in the future.\nHyperscale competitive European battery and semiconductor players\nWe\u2019ve observed that European players are underrepresented in battery manufacturing and high-end compute and semiconductors that power artificial intelligence. According to our analysis, only one European manufacturer is among the top ten in terms of market capitalization for battery manufacturing, while in semiconductors, Europe needs to close the capability gap for the next wave of computing to deliver functionalities such as ADAS.\nA path to creating an ecosystem of technology champions consists of three elements. First, Europe should consider developing a pan-European regulatory rule book to scale high-growth firms, aligning tax standards, regulations, labor rules, and bureaucratic processes. Second, to stay at the forefront of technology, the region would need to build specialized knowledge and product innovation capabilities. Suppliers could tap into niche specialties, such as more-sustainable battery refining. Finally, the European industry would need a battery and semiconductor network, similar to the one that serves the aerospace industry. European incumbents could form strategic partnerships with emerging entrants and research institutions.\nDesign a way forward for ADAS with policy support\nAdvanced driver assistance systems features are increasingly important. They are becoming a key differentiator for vehicle buyers: According to our research, 51 percent of consumers worldwide would consider switching to some form of ADAS car in the future. Competitive pressures around ADAS are also intensifying. In 2022, Mercedes-Benz was the first automotive player to introduce and certify Level 3 autonomy, the threshold at which drivers can take their hands off the wheel.24Andrew J. Hawkins, \u201cMercedes-Benz is the first to bring Level 3 automated driving to the US,\u201d Verge, January 27, 2023. Other participants in the global industry are catching up using a variety of technology approaches.\nTo remain competitive, the European industry may need to form a cross-industry alliance. Players could collaborate in two main areas. The first area is where differentiation is negligible and where there are opportunities for savings. This would include standardizing sensor communication protocols, which would simplify the integration of new sensors. Standardizing middleware (which sits between front- and back-end technologies) and layers of the operating system are other approaches.\nThe second area of collaboration is where scale and large databases could enable a faster, more robust development process for efforts including the continuous updates of software layers in maps\u2014updates such as creating high-definition map- and location-based services. A shared pool of data could also be used for AI training and validation.\nThe right regulatory environment could be critical to enable this kind of cross-industry collaboration. Public-sector stakeholders could consider adapting existing guidelines to the context of autonomous driving. These updates could encourage collaborative precompetitive research and innovation that advance and accelerate technological progress and drive standardization.\nClose the software skill gap to win the automotive digital transition\nSoftware is essential to the future of the automotive industry. But according to our analysis, only 15 to 20 percent of current R&D workers at European incumbents have software skills, compared with almost 45 percent at new entrants.\nTo shrink the gap, industry stakeholders would need to find holistic solutions. For example, European incumbents could create shared\u2014or at least interoperable\u2014software platforms across OEMs in Europe (and possibly other regions where the industry has strong partnerships) to complement individual participants\u2019 capabilities and to avoid costly solo efforts.\nEarly hiring, reskilling, and foreign talent can also help close the gap. Players can intensify early hiring directly from universities and boost STEM and software talent education through partnerships with universities and schools. Our research shows that reskilling is already in progress: 37 percent of European suppliers have ongoing reskilling efforts, and another 41 percent have plans to implement them. To draw skilled software talent from other regions, European employers would need accelerate processes around work permits and accommodate foreign talent\u2019s requirements on salary, benefits, and working conditions.\nCreating an environment that enables accelerated progress\nAbout the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility\nThese insights were developed by the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM). Since 2011, the MCFM has worked with stakeholders across the mobility ecosystem by providing independent and integrated evidence about possible future-mobility scenarios. With our unique, bottom-up modeling approach, our insights enable an end-to-end analytics journey through the future of mobility\u2014from consumer needs to modal mix across urban/rural areas, sales, value pools, and life cycle sustainability. Contact us if you are interested in getting full access to our market insights via the McKinsey Mobility Insights Portal.\nEuropean automotive players are moving in the right direction but should consider scaling and accelerating their efforts. To accomplish this, a wide variety of stakeholders in the region would need to create an environment that breeds progress and future wins for the region\u2019s automotive industry. The formula requires a road map, catalysts, and platforms for cooperation.\nA clear road map such as the one we outline is needed to help accelerate the European automotive industry\u2019s progress. Its seven pillars would need to be converted into actionable measures and quantifiable targets for industry stakeholders\u2014suppliers, OEMs, players from adjacent industries, and regulatory bodies. Associations could take on a coordinating role.\nCatalysts play a significant role in implementing the road map. One is a competitive regulatory environment. Clearly defining and communicating common standards and codifying interoperability across all elements of the road map is likely to be critical.\nAnother critical catalyst of the European industry\u2019s transition is EV infrastructure. According to our analysis, the industry will need a cumulative \u20ac300 billion worth of infrastructure investments in electricity generation, the electricity grid, EV chargers, and hydrogen refueling systems through 2030.25European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. European stakeholders have begun to install public chargers at a pace of 2,000 charging points per week.26European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. But to meet demand, decision makers would need to build out charging infrastructure to the tune of 6,000 to 14,000 charging points per week.27European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. We found that the wind and solar assets required to fulfill the corresponding demand for energy with renewable sources would require four times as many workers in Europe by 2030 than are currently available.\nFinally, the industry would need platforms for collaboration. As industry boundaries are redefined, three kinds of partnership will become more important: horizontal partnerships between entities in the same parts of the value chain (such as multiple car companies) for efforts such as software development or to gain a solid footing in the Chinese market; vertical partnerships between entities in different parts of the value chain (such as car companies with tech companies) to secure access to technology and talent; and cross-industry partnerships, such as collaborations between automotive players and utilities to facilitate structural goals such as seamless sector coupling.\nOur road map shows a way forward for a globally competitive European auto industry. The work will require action from an expansive array of regional stakeholders and a supportive administrative environment. Time is of the essence.\nAndreas Cornet and Andreas Tschiesner are senior partners in McKinsey\u2019s Munich office, where Patrick Schaufuss is a partner; Ruth Heuss is a senior partner in the Berlin office.\nThe authors wish to thank Ondrej Burkacky, Julian Conzade, Johannes Deichmann, Lauritz Fischer, Maximilian Geirhos, Marco Groth, Volker Gr\u00fcntges, Antonia Gutzler, Martin Hattrup-Silberberg, Martin Kellner, Martin Linder, Nicoline L\u00fchrs, Lukas Michor, Jan Paulitschek, and Kirsten Weerda for their contributions to this report.",
    "Summarized_Document": "The European automotive industry is a significant contributor to the region's economy, accounting for nearly 7% of GDP and employing around 14 million people. However, it faces challenges such as the shift to electrified powertrains, software differentiation, and competition from new entrants, particularly from China. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports, with 3.0 million vehicles compared to Germany's 2.6 million. Rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions further complicate the industry's landscape.The industry has historically been a hub of innovation, with 30% of global automotive patents originating from Europe. Investments in R&D have led to advancements in sustainability and safety. The brand value of the top ten European auto companies is estimated at \u20ac200 billion, with five of the ten most valuable car brands being European.Despite these strengths, the industry is undergoing significant disruptions. European OEMs have lost market share to Chinese competitors, particularly in battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The transition to EVs is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80% annually since 2020. European OEMs have announced plans to launch over 150 EV models by 2030.The shift to software-defined vehicles is also crucial, with semiconductors and batteries becoming key components. European suppliers need to adapt to this change, as modern vehicles may have up to 150 control units. The industry must also address supply chain challenges, particularly in batteries and semiconductors, to remain competitive.Macroeconomic challenges such as high energy costs, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and a productivity crisis further impact the industry. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe are twice those in the U.S. and triple those in China, affecting production costs.To navigate these challenges, a road map with seven pillars is proposed: understanding customer needs, focusing on cost and speed, executing a winning strategy for the Chinese market, creating resilient supply chains, developing competitive battery and semiconductor players, advancing ADAS with policy support, and closing the software skill gap.European OEMs need to localize R&D and production in China, develop products tailored to Chinese consumers, and form strategic partnerships. Resilient supply chains require localization, circularity, and sustainability. The industry needs significant investments in battery and semiconductor manufacturing to meet future demand.Collaboration across the industry and with adjacent sectors is essential. A competitive regulatory environment and substantial investments in EV infrastructure are critical. The industry must also focus on software skills, with only 15-20% of current R&D workers having software expertise compared to 45% at new entrants.In summary, the European automotive industry must act swiftly and collaboratively to maintain its global competitiveness in the face of profound changes and challenges.",

    "Document": "Sustainability and the Steel City: Modernization at Pittsburgh International Airport\nA rendering of the view future travelers will see when they approach the new terminal. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nFlying is essential for work, vacation or visiting loved ones. The industry also is necessary to ship goods overseas quickly. However, it\u2019s not known for being environmentally friendly. One airport is seeking to change that.\nAviation contributes 3.5 percent of effective radiative forcing (which measures energy imbalance), 2.5 percent of carbon emissions and 1.9 percent of all greenhouse gas output. So there\u2019s a strong push to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel, starting at the airport.\nPittsburgh\u2019s Terminal Modernization\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s Terminal Modernization Program is a $1.4 billion project to create a new consolidated terminal that modernizes outdated former hub facilities, better serves passengers, fuels the region\u2019s future development, stabilizes long-term costs for airlines and evokes the essence of Pittsburgh. The new multi-modal complex will feature a new garage that nearly triples the amount of covered parking.\nThe PIT Terminal Modernization Program (TMP) was built upon these five principles that represent fundamental purposes driving the transformation:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0Stabilize\u00a0airline costs\n2.\u00a0 Be\u00a0Pittsburgh\u2019s airport\n3.\u00a0 Be environmentally\u00a0sustainable\n4.\u00a0\u00a0Enhance the experience\u00a0for all customers\n5.\u00a0 Provide\u00a0value\u00a0to our\u00a0community\n\u00a0\nCranes install steel beams as part of the terminal modernization program.(triblive.com)\n1. Airport Modernization\nThe new terminal will be between the C and D airside gate concourses, eliminating the need for the people mover train. The new facility will cater to passengers flying directly to and from Pittsburgh (origin and destination traffic) as opposed to the existing facility which was largely built as a hub facility focused on connecting traffic.\n2. Improved Experience\nThe layout should make navigating the airport quicker and easier. It will slash passengers\u2019 time from curbside to airside in half. Aesthetic improvements will enhance everyone\u2019s experience, and new outdoor terraces (pre- and post-security) will make it easier for travelers to relax before boarding their flight.\n3. Increased Area Value\nAirports raise the value of the area around them by encouraging economic growth and adding convenience for potential new residents. The terminal modernization brings more than 14,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities to the region. Currently, about 550 construction workers are onsite daily, and that number will increase to 1,000 daily workers in summer 2023.\n4. Stabilized Airline Costs\nAirport efficiency can impact the costs of airlines. The expansion will allow airlines to better process and load luggage as well as welcome passengers. It also lowers long-term O&M costs.\n5. More Sustainable Terminal\nConstruction practices for the new terminal comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Environmental Program Declaration (EPD) credit for their materials while also working to reduce emissions, water, energy and waste. Officials are targeting a minimum of LEED Silver certification for the facility.\nVendors are strongly encouraged to present products and services that comply with verified third-party certification criteria or reporting standards. The airport also urges them to source their products or materials regionally to decrease the impact on the environment and human health compared to similar vendors in other locations.\nAdvantus Engineers is collaborating with other teams and implementing sustainable practices such as water and energy efficiency, using sustainable materials, managing waste, employing electric transportation methods, and promoting healthy indoor environments.\nAdditionally, the airport is recycling and reusing construction waste, including 86,000 tons of crushed concrete for new airport roads.\nThe 2030 Challenge\nPart of constructing the new terminal is moving the airport closer to achieving the 2030 Challenge, an environmental initiative to go carbon-neutral by that year.\nThe suggested plan by Architecture 2030 is to decrease 90 percent of carbon emissions by 2025 and be 100 percent carbon neutral by 2030. New buildings, renovations and additions throughout the new terminal will have energy-consumption performance standards.\nA Timeline for Construction 2021\nApril:\u00a0Officials added safe driving lanes and barricades between concourses C and D. Saw-cutting began on the ramp to remove slabs.\nMay:\u00a0To prepare for the new terminal\u2019s foundation, 300,000 square feet of material were removed.\nJune:\u00a0An impact roller broke up large concrete sections to crush into smaller aggregate for reuse in new roadways.\nJuly:\u00a0Construction teams modified an underground fuel line for future use.\nAugust and September:\u00a0Team members began installation of electrical lines, construction trailers and underground utility work. Geotechnical borings for probe holes and test piles began for terminal foundation work.\nOctober:\u00a0A groundbreaking ceremony began heavy construction.\nNovember and December:\u00a0Foundation support drilling started after test borings. Mass excavation began and utility line work continued. About 85,000 tons of concrete was removed and crushed for new roads.\n2022\nJanuary: Team members\u00a0almost complete the auger cast piles and finish about 25 percent of the structural caissons. Approximately 400 cubic yards of concrete were used for foundation pile caps.\nFebruary:\u00a0Drilling operations continued for more than half of the caissons, and auger piles were nearly completed. More than half the cubic yards of concrete for pile caps were placed, and more than 75 percent of structural steel came onto the fabrication site.\nMarch:\u00a0Installation of the first steel beams and girders. Members positioned and embedded plate girders while work was finished on terminal caissons.\nApril:\u00a0Pile cap and grade beam installation continued. Terminal bridge foundations laid, and road modifications began.\nMay:\u00a0Three-quarters of the pole caps installation was completed. Rebar for underground foundations and the front bridge terminal foundations were installed.\nJune:\u00a0Crews continued to install rebar and lifted steel beams over the train tunnel.\nJuly:\u00a0More than half of the grade beam content and 25 of the 27 embedded plate girders were installed.\nAugust and September:\u00a0Vertical construction began, and crews completed foundation roadwork. Critical construction activities continued, with foundation and concrete work progressing. Workers installed decking, steel and detailing.\nOctober:\u00a0Backfill and excavation continued, and corridor walls were demolished. Bridge piers for elevated highways were installed.\nNovember:\u00a0Completed all structural slabs, and rebar installation continued.\nDecember:\u00a0Team members placed geoform, and tub girders arrived. The first elevated deck slab concrete was installed.\n2023\nAll foundation work was completed on the site of the new terminal at the end of January. There were multiple concrete pours, and more than half of the mechanically stabilized earth walls now are in place.\nEmbracing Pittsburgh\u2019s History\nPittsburgh\u2019s industrial nickname comes from the rise of the steel industry after the Civil War. Increased demand for armament and iron boosted the local economy. Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie introduced the Bessemer steelmaking process, which brought him from obscurity to fame.\nCarnegie began producing steel in 1875. Meanwhile, Henry Clay Frick, the grandson of whiskey distillers, made his riches operating beehive cooking ovens that could turn coal into coke\u2014an essential steelmaking ingredient. Frick later partnered with Carnegie to form Carnegie Steel Co. and, in 1901, they merged multiple companies into the United States Steel Corp.\nBefore they reached their final success, however, a dispute between Carnegie Steel and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers put a dark cloud over the area\u2019s steel production. It led to the Battle of Homestead, an armed conflict that killed 12 people. This event paved the way for modern labor practices and worker-protection laws.\nThrough the mid-1950s, Pittsburgh thrived as America\u2019s eighth-largest city and produced half of the country\u2019s steel. European immigration through Ellis Island led to a population increase of more than 500,000 individuals. The city\u2019s diversity still exists in its various neighborhoods.\nThings changed for Pittsburgh in the 1970s and 1980s when steel production slowed to a stop, and the city had to reinvent itself to survive. It\u2019s now known for technology, energy, medicine, education, research, arts, sports and advanced manufacturing. Its National Football League team, the Steelers, pays tribute to its past in the steel industry. This new terminal aims to do the same. The new terminal at PIT invokes the essence of Pittsburgh through its design focused on Nature, Technology and Community\u2014dubbed NaTeCo by the design team.\nThe terminal modernization progam will pay tribute to the city\u2019s history through art and construction. Steel tree columns are a featured part of the new terminal, creating a nostalgic and stylistic design. Their brownish color is meant to invoke importance of nature in Western Pennsylvania. All of the steel in the new terminal, procured throughout the United States, is being fabricated just 10 miles away from the airport in Ambridge, Pa.\n\n\n(Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nThe Airport Authority also recruited artists Patrick Marold and Adam Kuby to create an exhibition honoring the steel industry through sculptures and other design elements. Other artisans contribute to the terminal through PIT\u2019s Art in the Airport initiative.\nSustainability in the Steel City\nThroughout the years, Pittsburgh made strides to create a healthier, more-sustainable city. From 2015-2020, the Department of City Planning released a yearly \u201cState of Sustainability\u201d report that examined ongoing efforts to reduce waste and minimize the use of nonrenewable resources.\nNonprofit organization Sustainable Pittsburgh advocates and educates individuals and groups through various initiatives such as recognizing corporations that make efforts toward decarbonization.\nUniversities in the city also are embracing measures to create a greener city. The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University and Point Park University each have their own sustainability programs to encourage research and on-campus responsibility.\nThe terminal modernization project is another major step toward creating a Pittsburgh that lives in harmony with its environment.\nTime for an Update\nAllegheny County Airport was the first airport in the region, opening in 1931, and at the time was one of the largest and most advanced terminals of its time. The Greater Pittsburgh Airport opened in 1952, becoming the region\u2019s primary commercial airport. (Allegheny County Airport continues to operate today as a robust general aviation airport with more than 60,000 operations annually.)\nThat terminal existed until 1992, when officials opened the more modern Pittsburgh International Airport, built and designed as a hub for US Airways. US Airways pulled its hub status in 2004, leaving Pittsburgh with a facility built for another time and a different purpose. The airport today offers nonstop service to more than 60 nonstop destinations on 16 airlines, including international service to London Heathrow on British Airways as well service to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.\nBoth Pittsburgh International Airport and Allegheny County Airport are operated under the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which has experienced several changes through the years, with the new terminal project being the largest.\nOfficials announced the new terminal in 2017, but construction was put on hold in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project resumed in 2021 and is now making consistent progress. The groundbreaking happened in October 2021, making it the first U.S. terminal built from the ground up after the pandemic.\nTravelers will get the opportunity to enjoy fresh air and greenery while they await their flights. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nManaging Construction\nACAA selected the architecture and engineering teams of Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects to lead work on the project. This collaboration ensures international best practices are met without sacrificing local characteristics.\nGensler is headquartered in San Francisco but has multiple Pennsylvania offices and designed the PNC tower downtown. The firm also has airport experience with Incheon Airport. HDR is headquartered in Omaha, Neb., but has an office in Pittsburgh. It replaced the Greenfield Bridge and renovated the Honolulu Airport.\nLuis Vidal completed terminal projects for Heathrow, Madrid-Barajas and other airports.\nBlue Sky News/Pittsburgh International Airport\nTaking in Local Concerns\nThe Allegheny County Airport Authority engaged the community and airlines to determine the best course of action for the terminal project. The terminal modernization has a program advisory group and a best practice group with experts in sustainability, accessibility, passenger experience, technology, health, culture and arts. These members represent constituencies, share their expertise and ensure the authority uses best practices in the new terminal design.\nFeedback was gathered through community and stakeholder meetings, interviews, surveys and the feedback section of the program\u2019s website,\u00a0PITtransformed.com.\nAlthough there are concerns with any project, Pittsburgh\u2019s local \u201cyinzers\u201d are known for being open to sustainable initiatives and creating socioeconomic changes that positively impact the environment, preserving it for future generations. These efforts are known internationally, with the United Nations Foundation recognizing the city as an example of America\u2019s growing sustainability movement.\nManaging the TPM Budget\nWith a high cost comes the need for strict budget management, and the program management team keeps spending under control. No local tax dollars are involved, and most of the construction is funded through long-term bonds, essentially borrowing money and then paying off that debt as part of its yearly operating budget. Paying for the project comes from airport revenues, including airline fees, parking and rental fees, passenger facility charges, terminal concessions revenues, and natural gas revenue.\nNatural Construction and Energy\nLarge windows will produce abundant natural light in the new terminal, minimizing the need for external lighting sources. Outside these windows are expansive outdoor terraces featuring local flora. Using local plants reduces the need for excess water and electricity.\nPlanting local trees, flowers and bushes enables visitors to learn and appreciate native plants, especially when the airport might be the only part of Pennsylvania some travelers see. They also cut carbon emissions by eliminating the need to transport outside flora.\nThe terrace will have chairs for passengers to relax as well as open spaces for kids and pets to run around before getting on their flights.\nOne of the largest changes to the terminal is the private microgrid with nearly 10,000 solar panels and five natural-gas generators. These energy sources will power the new terminal, cutting the airport\u2019s carbon footprint and creating a more-sustainable environment. The microgrid is already up and running, powering the existing facility since June 2021. This is significant for the 2030 goal, as construction and demolition projects generate approximately 569 million tons of waste annually.\nThis is advantageous for passengers and airlines, providing a power source when electricity goes out as well as decreasing flight delays. In addition to being more resilient, the microgrid saves PIT more than $1 million annually in utility costs and saves more than 6 million pounds of carbon emissions annually.\nLeading the Way for Sustainability\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s terminal modernization project is the first post-pandemic terminal built from the ground up and holds great promise. Sustainability has always been top of mind, but the ability to continue working toward the 2030 goal after a significant delay shows a commitment to creating a more eco-friendly airport. During the construction delay, PIT designers took that time to incorporate additional public health measures into the project.\nOfficials hope projects can look toward PIT as an example that sustainability, economic growth, customer satisfaction and local pride can exist in the same place.\u00a0\nAbout Rose Morrison\nRose Morrison is a freelance writer with a passion for sustainable building and innovative construction technologies; email: [email\u00a0protected].\nSubscribe\nSubscribe now to receive our FREE print publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nProject of the Week\n\nFort McHenry Tunnel\nClick here for details and to submit your project!\nCurrent Issue\n\n4th Annual Sustainable Engineering Issue 2024\nPopular Tags\nTwitter Feed\nLocation\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\nRequest More Information From Sponsor\n\n\u0394\n",

    "Document": "Sustainability and the Steel City: Modernization at Pittsburgh International Airport\nA rendering of the view future travelers will see when they approach the new terminal. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nFlying is essential for work, vacation or visiting loved ones. The industry also is necessary to ship goods overseas quickly. However, it\u2019s not known for being environmentally friendly. One airport is seeking to change that.\nAviation contributes 3.5 percent of effective radiative forcing (which measures energy imbalance), 2.5 percent of carbon emissions and 1.9 percent of all greenhouse gas output. So there\u2019s a strong push to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel, starting at the airport.\nPittsburgh\u2019s Terminal Modernization\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s Terminal Modernization Program is a $1.4 billion project to create a new consolidated terminal that modernizes outdated former hub facilities, better serves passengers, fuels the region\u2019s future development, stabilizes long-term costs for airlines and evokes the essence of Pittsburgh. The new multi-modal complex will feature a new garage that nearly triples the amount of covered parking.\nThe PIT Terminal Modernization Program (TMP) was built upon these five principles that represent fundamental purposes driving the transformation:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0Stabilize\u00a0airline costs\n2.\u00a0 Be\u00a0Pittsburgh\u2019s airport\n3.\u00a0 Be environmentally\u00a0sustainable\n4.\u00a0\u00a0Enhance the experience\u00a0for all customers\n5.\u00a0 Provide\u00a0value\u00a0to our\u00a0community\n\u00a0\nCranes install steel beams as part of the terminal modernization program.(triblive.com)\n1. Airport Modernization\nThe new terminal will be between the C and D airside gate concourses, eliminating the need for the people mover train. The new facility will cater to passengers flying directly to and from Pittsburgh (origin and destination traffic) as opposed to the existing facility which was largely built as a hub facility focused on connecting traffic.\n2. Improved Experience\nThe layout should make navigating the airport quicker and easier. It will slash passengers\u2019 time from curbside to airside in half. Aesthetic improvements will enhance everyone\u2019s experience, and new outdoor terraces (pre- and post-security) will make it easier for travelers to relax before boarding their flight.\n3. Increased Area Value\nAirports raise the value of the area around them by encouraging economic growth and adding convenience for potential new residents. The terminal modernization brings more than 14,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities to the region. Currently, about 550 construction workers are onsite daily, and that number will increase to 1,000 daily workers in summer 2023.\n4. Stabilized Airline Costs\nAirport efficiency can impact the costs of airlines. The expansion will allow airlines to better process and load luggage as well as welcome passengers. It also lowers long-term O&M costs.\n5. More Sustainable Terminal\nConstruction practices for the new terminal comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Environmental Program Declaration (EPD) credit for their materials while also working to reduce emissions, water, energy and waste. Officials are targeting a minimum of LEED Silver certification for the facility.\nVendors are strongly encouraged to present products and services that comply with verified third-party certification criteria or reporting standards. The airport also urges them to source their products or materials regionally to decrease the impact on the environment and human health compared to similar vendors in other locations.\nAdvantus Engineers is collaborating with other teams and implementing sustainable practices such as water and energy efficiency, using sustainable materials, managing waste, employing electric transportation methods, and promoting healthy indoor environments.\nAdditionally, the airport is recycling and reusing construction waste, including 86,000 tons of crushed concrete for new airport roads.\nThe 2030 Challenge\nPart of constructing the new terminal is moving the airport closer to achieving the 2030 Challenge, an environmental initiative to go carbon-neutral by that year.\nThe suggested plan by Architecture 2030 is to decrease 90 percent of carbon emissions by 2025 and be 100 percent carbon neutral by 2030. New buildings, renovations and additions throughout the new terminal will have energy-consumption performance standards.\nA Timeline for Construction 2021\nApril:\u00a0Officials added safe driving lanes and barricades between concourses C and D. Saw-cutting began on the ramp to remove slabs.\nMay:\u00a0To prepare for the new terminal\u2019s foundation, 300,000 square feet of material were removed.\nJune:\u00a0An impact roller broke up large concrete sections to crush into smaller aggregate for reuse in new roadways.\nJuly:\u00a0Construction teams modified an underground fuel line for future use.\nAugust and September:\u00a0Team members began installation of electrical lines, construction trailers and underground utility work. Geotechnical borings for probe holes and test piles began for terminal foundation work.\nOctober:\u00a0A groundbreaking ceremony began heavy construction.\nNovember and December:\u00a0Foundation support drilling started after test borings. Mass excavation began and utility line work continued. About 85,000 tons of concrete was removed and crushed for new roads.\n2022\nJanuary: Team members\u00a0almost complete the auger cast piles and finish about 25 percent of the structural caissons. Approximately 400 cubic yards of concrete were used for foundation pile caps.\nFebruary:\u00a0Drilling operations continued for more than half of the caissons, and auger piles were nearly completed. More than half the cubic yards of concrete for pile caps were placed, and more than 75 percent of structural steel came onto the fabrication site.\nMarch:\u00a0Installation of the first steel beams and girders. Members positioned and embedded plate girders while work was finished on terminal caissons.\nApril:\u00a0Pile cap and grade beam installation continued. Terminal bridge foundations laid, and road modifications began.\nMay:\u00a0Three-quarters of the pole caps installation was completed. Rebar for underground foundations and the front bridge terminal foundations were installed.\nJune:\u00a0Crews continued to install rebar and lifted steel beams over the train tunnel.\nJuly:\u00a0More than half of the grade beam content and 25 of the 27 embedded plate girders were installed.\nAugust and September:\u00a0Vertical construction began, and crews completed foundation roadwork. Critical construction activities continued, with foundation and concrete work progressing. Workers installed decking, steel and detailing.\nOctober:\u00a0Backfill and excavation continued, and corridor walls were demolished. Bridge piers for elevated highways were installed.\nNovember:\u00a0Completed all structural slabs, and rebar installation continued.\nDecember:\u00a0Team members placed geoform, and tub girders arrived. The first elevated deck slab concrete was installed.\n2023\nAll foundation work was completed on the site of the new terminal at the end of January. There were multiple concrete pours, and more than half of the mechanically stabilized earth walls now are in place.\nEmbracing Pittsburgh\u2019s History\nPittsburgh\u2019s industrial nickname comes from the rise of the steel industry after the Civil War. Increased demand for armament and iron boosted the local economy. Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie introduced the Bessemer steelmaking process, which brought him from obscurity to fame.\nCarnegie began producing steel in 1875. Meanwhile, Henry Clay Frick, the grandson of whiskey distillers, made his riches operating beehive cooking ovens that could turn coal into coke\u2014an essential steelmaking ingredient. Frick later partnered with Carnegie to form Carnegie Steel Co. and, in 1901, they merged multiple companies into the United States Steel Corp.\nBefore they reached their final success, however, a dispute between Carnegie Steel and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers put a dark cloud over the area\u2019s steel production. It led to the Battle of Homestead, an armed conflict that killed 12 people. This event paved the way for modern labor practices and worker-protection laws.\nThrough the mid-1950s, Pittsburgh thrived as America\u2019s eighth-largest city and produced half of the country\u2019s steel. European immigration through Ellis Island led to a population increase of more than 500,000 individuals. The city\u2019s diversity still exists in its various neighborhoods.\nThings changed for Pittsburgh in the 1970s and 1980s when steel production slowed to a stop, and the city had to reinvent itself to survive. It\u2019s now known for technology, energy, medicine, education, research, arts, sports and advanced manufacturing. Its National Football League team, the Steelers, pays tribute to its past in the steel industry. This new terminal aims to do the same. The new terminal at PIT invokes the essence of Pittsburgh through its design focused on Nature, Technology and Community\u2014dubbed NaTeCo by the design team.\nThe terminal modernization progam will pay tribute to the city\u2019s history through art and construction. Steel tree columns are a featured part of the new terminal, creating a nostalgic and stylistic design. Their brownish color is meant to invoke importance of nature in Western Pennsylvania. All of the steel in the new terminal, procured throughout the United States, is being fabricated just 10 miles away from the airport in Ambridge, Pa.\n\n\n(Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nThe Airport Authority also recruited artists Patrick Marold and Adam Kuby to create an exhibition honoring the steel industry through sculptures and other design elements. Other artisans contribute to the terminal through PIT\u2019s Art in the Airport initiative.\nSustainability in the Steel City\nThroughout the years, Pittsburgh made strides to create a healthier, more-sustainable city. From 2015-2020, the Department of City Planning released a yearly \u201cState of Sustainability\u201d report that examined ongoing efforts to reduce waste and minimize the use of nonrenewable resources.\nNonprofit organization Sustainable Pittsburgh advocates and educates individuals and groups through various initiatives such as recognizing corporations that make efforts toward decarbonization.\nUniversities in the city also are embracing measures to create a greener city. The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University and Point Park University each have their own sustainability programs to encourage research and on-campus responsibility.\nThe terminal modernization project is another major step toward creating a Pittsburgh that lives in harmony with its environment.\nTime for an Update\nAllegheny County Airport was the first airport in the region, opening in 1931, and at the time was one of the largest and most advanced terminals of its time. The Greater Pittsburgh Airport opened in 1952, becoming the region\u2019s primary commercial airport. (Allegheny County Airport continues to operate today as a robust general aviation airport with more than 60,000 operations annually.)\nThat terminal existed until 1992, when officials opened the more modern Pittsburgh International Airport, built and designed as a hub for US Airways. US Airways pulled its hub status in 2004, leaving Pittsburgh with a facility built for another time and a different purpose. The airport today offers nonstop service to more than 60 nonstop destinations on 16 airlines, including international service to London Heathrow on British Airways as well service to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.\nBoth Pittsburgh International Airport and Allegheny County Airport are operated under the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which has experienced several changes through the years, with the new terminal project being the largest.\nOfficials announced the new terminal in 2017, but construction was put on hold in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project resumed in 2021 and is now making consistent progress. The groundbreaking happened in October 2021, making it the first U.S. terminal built from the ground up after the pandemic.\nTravelers will get the opportunity to enjoy fresh air and greenery while they await their flights. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nManaging Construction\nACAA selected the architecture and engineering teams of Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects to lead work on the project. This collaboration ensures international best practices are met without sacrificing local characteristics.\nGensler is headquartered in San Francisco but has multiple Pennsylvania offices and designed the PNC tower downtown. The firm also has airport experience with Incheon Airport. HDR is headquartered in Omaha, Neb., but has an office in Pittsburgh. It replaced the Greenfield Bridge and renovated the Honolulu Airport.\nLuis Vidal completed terminal projects for Heathrow, Madrid-Barajas and other airports.\nBlue Sky News/Pittsburgh International Airport\nTaking in Local Concerns\nThe Allegheny County Airport Authority engaged the community and airlines to determine the best course of action for the terminal project. The terminal modernization has a program advisory group and a best practice group with experts in sustainability, accessibility, passenger experience, technology, health, culture and arts. These members represent constituencies, share their expertise and ensure the authority uses best practices in the new terminal design.\nFeedback was gathered through community and stakeholder meetings, interviews, surveys and the feedback section of the program\u2019s website,\u00a0PITtransformed.com.\nAlthough there are concerns with any project, Pittsburgh\u2019s local \u201cyinzers\u201d are known for being open to sustainable initiatives and creating socioeconomic changes that positively impact the environment, preserving it for future generations. These efforts are known internationally, with the United Nations Foundation recognizing the city as an example of America\u2019s growing sustainability movement.\nManaging the TPM Budget\nWith a high cost comes the need for strict budget management, and the program management team keeps spending under control. No local tax dollars are involved, and most of the construction is funded through long-term bonds, essentially borrowing money and then paying off that debt as part of its yearly operating budget. Paying for the project comes from airport revenues, including airline fees, parking and rental fees, passenger facility charges, terminal concessions revenues, and natural gas revenue.\nNatural Construction and Energy\nLarge windows will produce abundant natural light in the new terminal, minimizing the need for external lighting sources. Outside these windows are expansive outdoor terraces featuring local flora. Using local plants reduces the need for excess water and electricity.\nPlanting local trees, flowers and bushes enables visitors to learn and appreciate native plants, especially when the airport might be the only part of Pennsylvania some travelers see. They also cut carbon emissions by eliminating the need to transport outside flora.\nThe terrace will have chairs for passengers to relax as well as open spaces for kids and pets to run around before getting on their flights.\nOne of the largest changes to the terminal is the private microgrid with nearly 10,000 solar panels and five natural-gas generators. These energy sources will power the new terminal, cutting the airport\u2019s carbon footprint and creating a more-sustainable environment. The microgrid is already up and running, powering the existing facility since June 2021. This is significant for the 2030 goal, as construction and demolition projects generate approximately 569 million tons of waste annually.\nThis is advantageous for passengers and airlines, providing a power source when electricity goes out as well as decreasing flight delays. In addition to being more resilient, the microgrid saves PIT more than $1 million annually in utility costs and saves more than 6 million pounds of carbon emissions annually.\nLeading the Way for Sustainability\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s terminal modernization project is the first post-pandemic terminal built from the ground up and holds great promise. Sustainability has always been top of mind, but the ability to continue working toward the 2030 goal after a significant delay shows a commitment to creating a more eco-friendly airport. During the construction delay, PIT designers took that time to incorporate additional public health measures into the project.\nOfficials hope projects can look toward PIT as an example that sustainability, economic growth, customer satisfaction and local pride can exist in the same place.\u00a0\nAbout Rose Morrison\nRose Morrison is a freelance writer with a passion for sustainable building and innovative construction technologies; email: [email\u00a0protected].\nSubscribe\nSubscribe now to receive our FREE print publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nProject of the Week\n\nFort McHenry Tunnel\nClick here for details and to submit your project!\nCurrent Issue\n\n4th Annual Sustainable Engineering Issue 2024\nPopular Tags\nTwitter Feed\nLocation\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\nRequest More Information From Sponsor\n\n\u0394\n",

(NYSE, TSX: SHOP), announced today financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship,\" said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify. \"More and more merchants across the world are putting their trust in Shopify's unified commerce operating system to fuel growth and simplify complex operations. We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance. We drove strong growth in GMV, revenue, and gross profit, all amidst a mixed consumer spend environment, continued to take share and concurrently expanded our free cash flow margin. We delivered across every metric,\" said Jeff Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer of Shopify. \"Our results underscore our commitment to providing exceptional value to our merchants through focused operating execution and efficiency. As a high-growth global technology leader in commerce, we remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and investing in opportunities to achieve sustainable growth and long-term profitability.\"\nSecond-Quarter Financial Highlights (all comparisons are to the second quarter of 2023)\nGross Merchandise Volume1 (\"GMV\") increased 22% to $67.2 billion\nRevenue increased 21% to $2.0 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 25% after adjusting for the sale of our logistics businesses\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 19% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the growth of GMV and continued penetration of Shopify Payments\nGross Payments Volume2 (\"GPV\") grew to $41.1 billion, representing 61% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $31.7 billion, or 58%\nSubscription Solutions revenue increased 27% to $563 million, driven by growth in the number of merchants and pricing increases on our subscription plans\nMonthly Recurring Revenue3\u00a0(\"MRR\") as of June 30, 2024 increased 25% to $169 million, driven by growth in merchants. Shopify Plus contributed $52 million, or 31%, of MRR\nGross profit dollars grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 51.1% compared to 49.3%, driven primarily by the lack of the dilutive impact of the logistics businesses and changes in pricing plans partially offset by continued growth of payments\nFree cash flow4 was $333 million compared to free cash flow of $97 million\nFree cash flow margin4\u00a0for the quarter was 16% compared to free cash flow margin of 6%\nCash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, and we had a net cash position of $4.1 billion after consideration of our outstanding convertible notes\n2024 Outlook\nThe outlook that follows supersedes all prior financial outlook statements made by Shopify, constitutes forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and is based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks. Actual results could vary materially as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control. Please see \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we expect:\nRevenue to grow at a low-to-mid-twenties percentage rate on a year-over-year basis;\nGross margin to be higher by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q2 2024;\nGAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue to be 41% to 42%;\nStock-based compensation to be $120 million; and\nFree cash flow margin to be similar to Q2 2024.

Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.

Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.

Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results\n\nConsolidated results came in at the high end or ahead of guidance for key performance metrics\nBROOKLYN, N.Y., July 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ETSY), which operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world, today announced results for its second quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024.\n\"We are pleased that second quarter consolidated results included sequential acceleration of Etsy marketplace year-over-year GMS, higher consolidated revenue both year-over-year and sequentially, and strong adjusted EBITDA profitability,\" said Josh Silverman, Etsy, Inc. Chief Executive Officer. \"Gifting is proving to be a winning theme - driving growth as a key source of differentiation for Etsy. We are making excellent progress with other bold moves and investments meant to raise consideration among buyers - to help us stand apart more than ever. While this is a challenging environment for our type of goods, we are focused on reigniting Etsy marketplace growth and gaining market share.\"\nSecond quarter 2024 performance highlights include:\n\"We are investing in strategic growth areas including Gifting, highlighting the best of Etsy through Quality initiatives, launching a new Loyalty Program, expanding our App, and more, while also carefully managing expenses to deliver very healthy profit,\" said Rachel Glaser, Chief Financial Officer. \"In fact, second quarter adjusted EBITDA was about 28%, ahead of our guidance and up 130 bps from last year, as we gained leverage year-over-year on employee costs and cost of revenue, which was partially offset by higher level of performance marketing investments to help fuel buyer growth and frequency. The Etsy marketplace's record level of active buyers has held up quite well, and we added approximately 12 million new and reactivated buyers during the quarter.\"\n______________________________________\n1\u00a0Etsy Gifting GMS: Estimate based upon word 'gift' in the listing title, shipped with a gift message, or other signal the item was purchased as a gift.\n2\u00a0Source: Consumer Edge spend data from sampling of credit card transactions from online 'gifting' peers Zola, Zazzle, Minted, Uncommon Goods, Hallmark, and Mark and Graham.\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Summary(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThe financial results of Elo7 have been included in our consolidated financial results for the prior year periods, as Elo7 was sold on August 10, 2023.

In 2024, we are focused on building buyer consideration by making it easier to 'find the best stuff' on Etsy, driving association that Etsy sellers offer great value, and making shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable. The below highlights some of our key initiatives:\nProduct Highlights:\nIn order to drive\u00a0buyer Consideration, we are making progress in our efforts to position Etsy as an indispensable partner for Gifting, with broad based investments positively impacting our performance:\nWe launched a \"Made for You\" microsite to increase consideration and help buyers get the most out of shopping on Etsy. It features our latest product improvements, including Gift Mode, the Deals Tab, the Etsy's Picks badge, and Etsy Purchase Protection.\u00a0The microsite was launched globally in June, is available in 11 languages, and has already attracted hundreds of thousands of users.\nTo help buyers 'find the best stuff on Etsy,' we invested in the following Quality initiatives:\nAligned with our efforts to make shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable, and also to drive international growth, we recently secured a new preferred shipping partnership with a third party to simplify cross-border logistics for Turkish sellers. We continued to expand Etsy Payments globally, with about 98% of our GMS now processed through our platform.\nWe worked to continue to build trust in our marketplace with a roll out of our new seller set-up fee in additional regions. This fee, meant to strengthen our new shop onboarding process, and in combination with added trust and safety enforcement - resulted in a significant decline in fraudulent onboarding, while continuing to provide ample access for creative entrepreneurs to start businesses on Etsy.\nMarketing Highlights:\nWe further developed plans to launch our new Etsy Insider Loyalty program, currently scheduled to be introduced in invitation-only beta form to targeted occasional Etsy U.S. buyers in mid-September. Etsy Insider will be buyer-fee based, offering free U.S. domestic shipping on millions of items, item discounts, first access merchandise and other benefits, with a goal to drive frequency and loyalty over time.\nWe now manage all of Etsy's paid search campaigns in-house, enabling us to reallocate the significant external costs of managing these campaigns directly into the campaigns themselves.\nTo support our U.S. sellers, we launched a targeted marketing campaign to promote the availability of a seller financing program offered via a third party partner. We've observed strong initial engagement from the campaign signaling interest and need for additional capital among our seller community.\nEtsy's Creator Collective program, which incentivizes creators and influencers to drive purchases, social conversation, and unique content for Etsy by providing affiliate links to any page on Etsy.com and boosting top posts, has reached over 260,000 participants.\nReverb\nDepop\nConsolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance\u00a0\nQ3 24 Guidance\nGMS \nWe currently estimate that Consolidated GMS will decline in the low single digit range on a year-over-year basis. \nTake Rate\nSimilar to Q2 24\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n~27%\nRegarding our full-year 2024 outlook, we reiterate that consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin should come in at least the same as the 2023 result.\nPlease note that our guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain unchanged at current levels.\nWith respect to our expectations under \"Consolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance \" and outlook for the remainder of 2024 above, reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA; in particular, stock-based compensation expense, foreign exchange (gain) loss, interest and other non-operating income, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, acquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses, and other non-recurring expenses.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\u00a0\nEtsy will host a video webcast conference call to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, which will be live-streamed via our Investor Relations website (investors.etsy.com) under the Events section. A copy of the earnings call presentation will also be posted to our website.\nA replay of the video webcast will be available through the same link following the conference call starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time this evening, for at least three months thereafter.\nAbout Etsy\nEtsy, Inc. operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world.

provision (benefit) for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; foreign exchange (gain) loss; acquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses; asset impairment charges;\u00a0restructuring and other exit (income) costs; and retroactive non-income tax expense. We also provide Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP financial measure that presents Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because they are key measures used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans, determine incentive compensation, and assess the health of our business. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more in our platforms.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business as they remove the impact of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net income, revenue, and our other GAAP results.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and the Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNet income\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 53,005\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 61,915\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 116,009\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 136,452\nExcluding:\nInterest and other non-operating income, net \n(3,947)\n(5,934)\n(9,257)\n(11,623)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n25,972\n(56,501)\n42,623\n(49,767)\nDepreciation and amortization\n27,087\n22,946\n53,933\n46,118\nStock-based compensation expense (1)\n74,717\n77,281\n145,400\n145,964\nForeign exchange (gain) loss\n(4,861)\n(1,852)\n(11,116)\n765\nAcquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses \n234\n289\n2,132\n578\nAsset impairment charges\n\u2014\n68,091\n\u2014\n68,091\nRestructuring and other exit (income) costs \n(76)\n\u2014\n342\n\u2014\nRetroactive non-income tax expense\u00a0 (2)\n7,244\n\u2014\n7,244\n\u2014\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 179,375\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 166,235\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 347,310\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 336,578\nDivided by:\nRevenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 647,806\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 628,876\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,293,760\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,269,753\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n27.7\u00a0%\n26.4\u00a0%\n26.8\u00a0%\n26.5\u00a0%\n(1)\nStock-based compensation expense included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented below is as follows:\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCost of revenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,787\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,171\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16,491\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 15,417\nMarketing\n5,882\n6,107\n12,319\n11,369\nProduct development\n38,441\n38,220\n72,505\n74,929\nGeneral and administrative\n21,607\n24,783\n44,085\n44,249\nStock-based compensation expense \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 74,717\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 77,281\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,400\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,964\n(2)\nRetroactive non-income tax expense related to the digital services tax legislation in Canada, which was enacted on June 28, 2024 retroactive to January 1, 2022.\n\u00a0\n View original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/etsy-inc-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211378.html\nSOURCE  Etsy, Inc.\n\nEmail Alerts\n\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

Highlights include sequential acceleration of Etsy marketplace year-over-year GMS, higher consolidated revenue, and strong adjusted EBITDA profitability.

Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results\n\nConsolidated results came in at the high end or ahead of guidance for key performance metrics\nBROOKLYN, N.Y., July 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ETSY), which operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world, today announced results for its second quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024.\n\"We are pleased that second quarter consolidated results included sequential acceleration of Etsy marketplace year-over-year GMS, higher consolidated revenue both year-over-year and sequentially, and strong adjusted EBITDA profitability,\" said Josh Silverman, Etsy, Inc. Chief Executive Officer. \"Gifting is proving to be a winning theme - driving growth as a key source of differentiation for Etsy. We are making excellent progress with other bold moves and investments meant to raise consideration among buyers - to help us stand apart more than ever. While this is a challenging environment for our type of goods, we are focused on reigniting Etsy marketplace growth and gaining market share.\"\nSecond quarter 2024 performance highlights include:\n\"We are investing in strategic growth areas including Gifting, highlighting the best of Etsy through Quality initiatives, launching a new Loyalty Program, expanding our App, and more, while also carefully managing expenses to deliver very healthy profit,\" said Rachel Glaser, Chief Financial Officer. \"In fact, second quarter adjusted EBITDA was about 28%, ahead of our guidance and up 130 bps from last year, as we gained leverage year-over-year on employee costs and cost of revenue, which was partially offset by higher level of performance marketing investments to help fuel buyer growth and frequency. The Etsy marketplace's record level of active buyers has held up quite well, and we added approximately 12 million new and reactivated buyers during the quarter.\"\n______________________________________\n1\u00a0Etsy Gifting GMS: Estimate based upon word 'gift' in the listing title, shipped with a gift message, or other signal the item was purchased as a gift.\n2\u00a0Source: Consumer Edge spend data from sampling of credit card transactions from online 'gifting' peers Zola, Zazzle, Minted, Uncommon Goods, Hallmark, and Mark and Graham.\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Summary(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThe financial results of Elo7 have been included in our consolidated financial results for the prior year periods, as Elo7 was sold on August 10, 2023.

In 2024, we are focused on building buyer consideration by making it easier to 'find the best stuff' on Etsy, driving association that Etsy sellers offer great value, and making shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable. The below highlights some of our key initiatives:\nProduct Highlights:\nIn order to drive\u00a0buyer Consideration, we are making progress in our efforts to position Etsy as an indispensable partner for Gifting, with broad based investments positively impacting our performance:\nWe launched a \"Made for You\" microsite to increase consideration and help buyers get the most out of shopping on Etsy. It features our latest product improvements, including Gift Mode, the Deals Tab, the Etsy's Picks badge, and Etsy Purchase Protection.\u00a0The microsite was launched globally in June, is available in 11 languages, and has already attracted hundreds of thousands of users.\nTo help buyers 'find the best stuff on Etsy,' we invested in the following Quality initiatives:\nAligned with our efforts to make shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable, and also to drive international growth, we recently secured a new preferred shipping partnership with a third party to simplify cross-border logistics for Turkish sellers. We continued to expand Etsy Payments globally, with about 98% of our GMS now processed through our platform.\nWe worked to continue to build trust in our marketplace with a roll out of our new seller set-up fee in additional regions. This fee, meant to strengthen our new shop onboarding process, and in combination with added trust and safety enforcement - resulted in a significant decline in fraudulent onboarding, while continuing to provide ample access for creative entrepreneurs to start businesses on Etsy.\nMarketing Highlights:\nWe further developed plans to launch our new Etsy Insider Loyalty program, currently scheduled to be introduced in invitation-only beta form to targeted occasional Etsy U.S. buyers in mid-September. Etsy Insider will be buyer-fee based, offering free U.S. domestic shipping on millions of items, item discounts, first access merchandise and other benefits, with a goal to drive frequency and loyalty over time.\nWe now manage all of Etsy's paid search campaigns in-house, enabling us to reallocate the significant external costs of managing these campaigns directly into the campaigns themselves.\nTo support our U.S. sellers, we launched a targeted marketing campaign to promote the availability of a seller financing program offered via a third party partner. We've observed strong initial engagement from the campaign signaling interest and need for additional capital among our seller community.\nEtsy's Creator Collective program, which incentivizes creators and influencers to drive purchases, social conversation, and unique content for Etsy by providing affiliate links to any page on Etsy.com and boosting top posts, has reached over 260,000 participants.\nReverb\nDepop\nConsolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance\u00a0\nQ3 24 Guidance\nGMS \nWe currently estimate that Consolidated GMS will decline in the low single digit range on a year-over-year basis. \nTake Rate\nSimilar to Q2 24\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n~27%\nRegarding our full-year 2024 outlook, we reiterate that consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin should come in at least the same as the 2023 result.\nPlease note that our guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain unchanged at current levels.\nWith respect to our expectations under \"Consolidated Q3 24 Financial Guidance \" and outlook for the remainder of 2024 above, reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA; in particular, stock-based compensation expense, foreign exchange (gain) loss, interest and other non-operating income, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, acquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses, and other non-recurring expenses.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\u00a0\nEtsy will host a video webcast conference call to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, which will be live-streamed via our Investor Relations website (investors.etsy.com) under the Events section. A copy of the earnings call presentation will also be posted to our website.\nA replay of the video webcast will be available through the same link following the conference call starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time this evening, for at least three months thereafter.\nAbout Etsy\nEtsy, Inc. operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world.

These risks and uncertainties include: (1) the level of demand for our services or products sold in our marketplaces; (2) the importance to our success of the trustworthiness of our marketplaces and our ability to attract and retain active and engaged communities of buyers and sellers; (3) the fluctuation of our quarterly operating results; (4) our failure to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations; (5) any real or perceived inaccuracies in our operational metrics; (6) if we or our third-party providers are unable to protect against technology vulnerabilities, service interruptions, security breaches, or other cyber-related events; (7) our dependence on continued and unimpeded access to third-party services, platforms, and infrastructure; (8) macroeconomic events that are outside of our control; (9) operational and compliance risks related to our payments systems; (10) our ability to recruit and retain employees; (11) our ability to compete effectively; (12) enforcement of our marketplace policies; (13) our ability to enhance our current offerings and develop new offerings to respond to the changing needs of sellers and buyers; (14) risks related to our environmental, social, and governance activities and disclosures; (15) our efforts to expand our operations outside of the United States; (16) acquisitions that may prove unsuccessful or divert management attention; (17) failure to deal effectively with fraud; (18) compliance with evolving regulations, including in the area of privacy and data protection; and (19) litigation and regulatory matters, including intellectual property claims. These and other risks and uncertainties are more fully described in our filings with the\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the section entitled\u00a0\"Risk Factors\"\u00a0in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and subsequent reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make.

provision (benefit) for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; foreign exchange (gain) loss; acquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses; asset impairment charges;\u00a0restructuring and other exit (income) costs; and retroactive non-income tax expense. We also provide Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP financial measure that presents Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because they are key measures used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans, determine incentive compensation, and assess the health of our business. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more in our platforms.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business as they remove the impact of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net income, revenue, and our other GAAP results.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and the Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNet income\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 53,005\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 61,915\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 116,009\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 136,452\nExcluding:\nInterest and other non-operating income, net \n(3,947)\n(5,934)\n(9,257)\n(11,623)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n25,972\n(56,501)\n42,623\n(49,767)\nDepreciation and amortization\n27,087\n22,946\n53,933\n46,118\nStock-based compensation expense (1)\n74,717\n77,281\n145,400\n145,964\nForeign exchange (gain) loss\n(4,861)\n(1,852)\n(11,116)\n765\nAcquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses \n234\n289\n2,132\n578\nAsset impairment charges\n\u2014\n68,091\n\u2014\n68,091\nRestructuring and other exit (income) costs \n(76)\n\u2014\n342\n\u2014\nRetroactive non-income tax expense\u00a0 (2)\n7,244\n\u2014\n7,244\n\u2014\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 179,375\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 166,235\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 347,310\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 336,578\nDivided by:\nRevenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 647,806\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 628,876\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,293,760\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,269,753\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n27.7\u00a0%\n26.4\u00a0%\n26.8\u00a0%\n26.5\u00a0%\n(1)\nStock-based compensation expense included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented below is as follows:\nThree Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\nSix Months Ended \u00a0June 30,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCost of revenue\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,787\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,171\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16,491\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 15,417\nMarketing\n5,882\n6,107\n12,319\n11,369\nProduct development\n38,441\n38,220\n72,505\n74,929\nGeneral and administrative\n21,607\n24,783\n44,085\n44,249\nStock-based compensation expense \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 74,717\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 77,281\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,400\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 145,964\n(2)\nRetroactive non-income tax expense related to the digital services tax legislation in Canada, which was enacted on June 28, 2024 retroactive to January 1, 2022.\n\u00a0\n View original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/etsy-inc-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302211378.html\nSOURCE  Etsy, Inc.\n\nEmail Alerts\n\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.

Words such as \"continue\", \"could\", \"will\", \"believe\", \"assume\" and \"expect\" or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on Shopify's current projections and expectations about future events and financial trends that management believes might affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs, and on certain assumptions and analysis made by Shopify in light of the experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments and other factors management believes are appropriate. These projections, expectations, assumptions and analyses are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results, performance, events and achievements to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Although Shopify believes that the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements are reasonable, they may prove to be incorrect, and readers cannot be assured that actual results will be consistent with these forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, including certain risk factors, many of which are beyond Shopify's control, including but not limited to: sustaining our rapid growth; managing our growth; our potential inability to compete successfully against current and future competitors; the security of personal information we store relating to merchants and their buyers, as well as consumers with whom we have a direct relationship including users of our apps; a cyberattack or security breach; our ability to innovate; the impact of worldwide economic conditions, particularly softening economic growth in key regions including Europe and the United States, including the resulting effect on spending by small and medium-sized businesses or their buyers; our current reliance on a few suppliers to provide the technology we offer through Shopify Payments; the reliance of our business, including the services we provide to merchants, in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties; our limited operating history in new and developing markets and new geographic regions; international sales and operations and the use of our platform in various countries; our potential inability to hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including key personnel; our reliance on third-party cloud providers to deliver our services; complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide; our dependence on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key employees; payments processed through Shopify Payments, Shop Pay Installments, or payments processed or funds managed through Shopify Balance; our potential failure to effectively maintain, promote and enhance our brand; our history of losses and our efforts to maintain profitability; serious errors or defects in our software or hardware; evolving privacy laws and regulations, cross-border data transfer restrictions, data localization requirements and other domestic or foreign regulations that may limit the use and adoption of our services; acquisitions and investments, including strategic investments and fluctuations in our share of income and loss from equity method investment; risks associated with Shopify Capital, and offering financing to merchants; our potential inability to achieve or maintain data transmission capacity; potential claims by third parties of intellectual property infringement or other third party or governmental claims, litigation, disputes, or other proceedings; activities of merchants or partners or the content of merchants' shops and our ability to detect and address unauthorized activity on our platform; unanticipated changes in tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns; being required to collect federal, state, provincial or local business taxes, sales and use taxes or other indirect taxes in additional jurisdictions on transactions by our merchants; changes to technologies used in our platform or new versions or upgrades of operating systems and internet browsers; our potential inability to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information or prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our technology; our pricing decisions and changes to our pricing models for our solutions; our use of open source software; seasonal fluctuations in our operating results; exchange rate fluctuations that may negatively affect our results of operations; our dependence upon buyers' and merchants' access to, and willingness to use, the internet for commerce; provisions of our financial instruments including our convertible notes; our potential inability to raise additional funds as may be needed to pursue our growth strategy or continue our operations, on favorable terms or at all; our tax loss carryforwards; the ownership of our shares; our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting; the perceived impact of a return on investment without issuing a dividend; our status as a foreign private issuer and the laws applicable to us as a foreign private issuer; the impact of provisions of Canadian law applicable to us; provisions of our constating documents and charter documents; and other events and factors disclosed previously and from time to time in Shopify's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the securities commissions or similar securities regulatory authorities in each of the provinces or territories of Canada. The forward-looking statements contained in this news release, represent Shopify's expectations as of the date of this news release, or as of the date they are otherwise stated to be made, and subsequent events may cause these expectations to change. Shopify undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets(Expressed in US millions except share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows(Expressed in US millions)\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), Shopify uses certain non-GAAP and other financial measures to provide additional information in order to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the financial tables below for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures.\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nFree Cash Flow Reconciliation\nThe following table illustrates how free cash flow is calculated in this press release:\n\u00a0\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Analysis\nThe following table converts our GMV, revenues, gross profit and (loss) income from operations using the comparative period's monthly average exchange rates. The table below setting out the effect of foreign exchange rates on GMV and our consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\u00a0\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\u00a0\n_________________________\n1. Gross Merchandise Volume, or GMV, represents the total dollar value of orders facilitated through the Shopify platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes.\r\n2. Gross Payments Volume, or GPV, is the amount of GMV processed through Shopify Payments.\r\n3. Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is calculated by multiplying the number of merchants by the average monthly subscription plan fee in effect on the last day of that period and is used by management as a directional indicator of subscription solutions revenue going forward assuming merchants maintain their subscription plan the following month. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company revised the inclusion of paid trials in the calculation of MRR. Please refer to \u201cKey Performance Indicators\u201d below for more information.\r\n4. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin are non-GAAP financial measures.

But as most small business owners know, there are times where you need to stop and make sure that your business is bringing in the revenue it should be.\nOur research indicates that figuring out the best trucking rates per mile is the key to making sure that your business remains profitable, but it can also be a complex process as rates are constantly changing.\nBefore getting into the details on trucking rates per mile 2024, it\u2019s important to understand what goes into determining freight truck rates.\nIn this guide, you\u2019ll find out what current trucking rates per mile are and get a refresher on the industry terms to remember as you navigate truck rates.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nHow to calculate trucking  freight rates\nThe trucking rates can be calculated by multiplying your trucking rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points.\nTotal trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles)\nLike other trades jobs, there is a lot that goes into determining the best trucking rate per mile for your business.\nOur findings show that not only do you have to constantly monitor your fuel spend as well as supply and demand, but you also have to take into account your fixed costs.\nBut let\u2019s start with the basics for truck rates per mile.\nA truck freight rate is a price a shipper or broker will pay you, the carrier, to haul a load. The concept is simple, but our research indicates that trucking rates per mile can vary significantly depending on the time of year and current fuel prices.\nWhich can make knowing the national average trucking cost per mile feel like a black box.\nTrucking freight rates are calculated on a per mile basis. Therefore, the most important number when it comes to calculating truck rates is the number of miles between your starting point and the destination.\nBased on our observations, having the average rate per mile for trucking and accurate information about trucking freight rates is essential to properly pricing trips and negotiating rates with your customers.\nBe aware, however, that calculating the overall freight rate depends on various other factors. Below, you\u2019ll find what you need to consider when calculating trucking rates.\nFactor #1: Distance of travel\nImage credit: Nelson Gono via Unsplash\nWhether you\u2019re transporting locally or looking at over the road trucking rates, the distance between destinations is an important part of determining trucking rates per mile.\nYou want to ensure that you have the right mileage from the beginning to avoid any surprises along the way and get the correct per mile trucking rates.\nDouble-check that your driver will not be required to make any long detours because of road closures. Otherwise, you risk job profitability, timing, and changes to the rate per mile for truck drivers.\nFactor #2: The weight of the shipment\nAfter the distance, our findings show that the weight of the shipment is one of the most significant factors for the cost of trucking per mile. It is important to manage the overall weight load for your fleet to control costs and determine your per mile rate for trucking.\nTo be successful at this, you\u2019ll need to consider variables like heavy haul rates per mile, FTL trucking rates, number of passengers, etc.\nOtherwise, you stand to incorrectly answer \u201cWhat is the average freight cost per mile?\u201d.\nWhen it comes to your average per mile rate for freight, it\u2019s best to be on the safe side and start with higher rates per mile for trucking to allow your customer to negotiate while still ensuring revenue for your business.\nWith this approach, your average haulage cost per mile is sure to bring a profit to your business.\nFactor #3: Shipment density\nThe shipment density is another factor that will determine how much room a shipment will take up in your truck and, in turn, your trucking per mile rates.\nDrawing from our experience, once you know the weight of the shipment, calculating the shipment density is simple. All you have to do is divide the cargo weight by its cubic feet.\nFactor #4: Freight classification\nA question that often goes unanswered is \u201cWhat is the average freight rate per mile?\u201d.\nAnd the question makes sense based on our observations given the number of important industry standards to keep up with for freight classification.\nThe National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) has defined 18 classes of shipments that affect freight rates per mile.\nFreight classification is determined by factors such as:\nHaving a thorough knowledge of how to use these factors to calculate trucking rates per mile will ensure that your business remains competitive and profitable.\nOur findings show that most trucking companies charge customers per mile based on factors like:\nYou need to strike a good balance when setting your rates \u2013 setting a low rate may cause you to lose money, while setting a high rate may turn customers away toward cheaper companies.\nA good rule of thumb to stay competitive rate-wise is to keep an eye on both national and local trucking rates. And based on our observations, providing a fair rate with excellent service is the key to getting (and retaining) more customers.\nAt the time of writing, the national average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile. However, this is just a national average, which means your area may have higher or lower rates.\nTo set a fair price for your flatbed truck services, you need to consider things like:\nThrough our practical knowledge, setting a fair per-mile rate means you can pay truckers a fair wage, keep the clients happy, and still a profit.\nAlthough these are the main takeaways on how to calculate trucking rates, you want to ensure that you have the basic industry knowledge to determine other factors that may influence your truck rates.\nLet\u2019s take a look at some key trucking terms, beyond freight trucking rates, to set you up for success.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nThe terms in trucking you need to know\nKeeping up to date with all of the basic trucking terms is an important factor in knowing how to calculate trucking rates and freight cost per mile.\nFirst things first, there are several types of freight trucks, and they are each ideal to haul different cargo. Your freight type will determine your trucking rates per mile as freight costs per mile steeply influence your fuel spend.\nDifferent types of freight trucks include:\nHere are some other industry terms that play a factor in the national trucking rate per mile and that will help you understand what the going rate for freight per mile is.\nConsignor\nThe consignor is the party that is shipping the product you\u2019re transporting. They are also known as the seller and are your customer.\nThe consignor can be:\nThe ownership of the products stays with the consignor until the consignee pays them in full. Still, our investigation demonstrated that that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the liability stays with them.\nConsignee\nA consignee is a recipient of the products being shipped. You can think of them as the buyer, and they can be an individual or a company.\nThe consignee must be physically present to accept the shipment from the consignor unless specifically stated otherwise in the bill of lading.\nCarrier\nImage credit: Quintin Gellar via Pexels\nYour role in the shipping process will be that of the carrier. The carrier is the party in charge of delivering the products to their destination.\nAs a carrier, you\u2019re responsible for receiving the bill of lading and safely transporting items to the consignee.\nBill of lading (BOL)\nThe consignor sends the goods to you, the freight carrier, to ship them to the consignee. However, the ownership of the freight doesn\u2019t legally change until the recipient of the goods signs the bill of lading (BOL).\nA BOL is a document required in the shipping process that involves all parties: the consignor, consignee, and carrier. The consignor and consignee each get a copy of the BOL, and then there is usually a third copy for the bank.\nThe BOL includes relevant details necessary to ship the product and invoice the transaction correctly once it is completed.\nIt includes the following information:\nFree on board point (FOB)\nFree on board (FOB), also known as freight on board, is a term used to indicate whether the buyer or the seller is liable for goods that are lost, damaged, or destroyed during shipping.\nThe FOB shipping point indicates that the title and responsibility of goods transfer from the seller to the buyer when the goods are placed on your delivery vehicle.\nOn the other hand, a FOB destination means that the seller is responsible for the goods until the goods are delivered to the buyer.\nLoss and damage\nAs a carrier, you may have to deal with loss or damage claims from time to time.\nA damage claim involves visible damage to either the goods or the storage container that the goods are in. The damage should be noted on the bill of lading or another delivery document.\nA loss claim is when a shipment is not delivered or when it shows that it was delivered, but the recipient hasn\u2019t received it. This can be due to typography errors in the bill of lading causing the shipment to go to the wrong address.\nFull truckload shipping (FTL)\nFull truckload shipping (FTL) applies to a shipment that takes up an entire trailer. This is a key price variable as it affects the cost of freight per mile.\nWhen it comes to FTL freight rates factors, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s the smallest truck in your fleet or the largest as FTL applies as long as you use up your entire space. Typically, FTL freight will exceed 15,000 pounds.\nThe full truck load cost per mile typically costs a higher rate per mile since your truck is at full capacity.\nLess than truckload (LTL)\nA less than truckload shipment (LTL) doesn\u2019t take up an entire trailer but may need to move between vehicles during the shipping process. For this reason, LTL rates per mile aren\u2019t always standard across jobs and will affect your average LTL cost per mile.\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll need to charge your customers a different rate than the average truckload rate per mile if you\u2019re at less than a truckload.\nTrucking rates per mile for LTL will vary depending on how far your company will be taking the shipment.\nLoad rates for trucks\nLoad rates or freight rates are what you charge for a truck to deliver cargo from one place to another.\nLoad rates are typically paid per mile and can be influenced by factors such as:\nAdditional services like warehouse storage, loading and unloading, and automotive insurance may be included in calculating a customer\u2019s load rates.\nOur findings show that load rates also vary depending on the type of cargo being carried because different cargo may need different types of trucks to transport.\nDrayage\nDrayage is a term that involves shipping goods at a short distance via ground freight. Basically, it is the process of moving a large container to your truck.\nBased on our firsthand experience, this may be an extra cost that you have to consider when giving your customer an estimate of the total cost of your services.\nPallets\nPallets are portable platforms used to package items for freight shipping. Pallets come in different sizes, but the most common size that you\u2019ll find is the standard 40 x 48 size to ship items.\nPallets not only make loading and unloading items easier, but they also allow you to maximize space in your truck. This may reduce your total cost and allow you to provide more competitive trucking rates per mile.\nStop keeping unit (SKU)\nAn SKU (Stock keeping unit) is a service identification code. They\u2019re usually displayed alphanumerically or as a barcode.\nSKUs help track products in inventory as they contain all factors required to identify an item, such as:\nHundredweight (CWT)\nA hundredweight, also known as a CWT, is a unit of measurement. In North America, a hundredweight refers to 100 pounds, whereas the British consider a hundredweight to be 112 pounds.\nIn the past, packages that take up less than an entire truckload were measured by CWTs, but it is not common to measure packages by CWT today. Measuring by pounds or kilograms is now the standard.\nGrow your field service business with automation.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nIn order to continue to offer competitive trucking rates per mile, you need to know how much do trucking companies charge per mile. Cost per mile is influenced by factors such as:\nFinancing is also a cost that may influence the cost per mile. The cost of financing trucks and trailers ranges from 0% to 30% of revenue.\nAs of July 2021, trucking rates per mile remain steady. Here are the current rates for the most popular freight truck types:\nFuel prices have been steadily increasing over the past year and are a huge variable in knowing how to calculate transportation rates.\nThe national diesel price was sitting at $3.34 per gallon, with a $0.05 increase from June 2021 to July 2021. However, in 2024 prices have increased greatly with high rates of fluctuation when it comes to price and supply availability.\nAverage rate per mile for owner-operators\nIn contrast to company drivers, owner-operators are truckers who own or lease their own trucks. These people usually work with a trucking company to get back-office support and find trucking jobs.\nOwner-operators generally earn about 70 to 80 percent of the loads they take. For example, if flatbed truck transport is $3.14 per mile, the owner-operator can earn up to $2.51 per mile. If they\u2019re out on the road often, they may earn up to $156,000 annually.\nWhere does the rest of your per-mile rate go? The remaining 20 to 30 percent goes to your trucking company. An owner-operator at a trucking company benefits from access to cargo jobs, in-house mechanics, and gas station location optimization.\nBeing an owner-operator is a great way to earn more money, but it also means you will be dealing with the stress and finances largely on your own.\nFor example, you\u2019ll have to shoulder truck maintenance, health insurance, and other business expenses.\nIf you\u2019re not prepared to take on the added risk and costs, becoming a company trucker is always viable.\nTrucking rates per mile 2024 FAQs:\nHere are the top questions truckers have in 2024:\nDo trucking companies pay for empty miles?\nEmpty miles, also known as non-revenue or deadhead miles, are miles garnered by the truck when it isn\u2019t earning any revenue.\nBased on our observations, this happens when there\u2019s a load to the destination but no load back. Empty miles range from 33 \u2013 40% of total miles driven, making them very wasteful for your trucking business.\nTo avoid empty miles, try to minimize any unnecessary movement of goods and improve your scheduling so that your trucks are carrying a load as often as possible.\nIf you can\u2019t avoid an empty mile, it\u2019s best to add a portion of it to your rate per mile trucking costs.\nWhat is a good rate per mile for trucking companies to charge?\nAfter putting it to the test, it is difficult to determine an average rate for trucking rates per mile, but if you keep up with industry news, you\u2019ll always have a good idea of average trucking rates.\nTo answer your question on what is the going rate per mile for trucking \u2014 current trucking rates per mile 2024 averages are:\nKeep in mind that these are just average per mile trucking rates, and your business may profit from a different rate. Based on our observations, providing the lowest rates may not be enough to bring your revenue, but a rate that\u2019s too high may price you out of the competition.\nThe same goes for how much you offer your drivers. As per our expertise, you need to know what is the average rate per mile for truck drivers in your area so you can be fair as well as competitive when it comes to wages.\nWhat is the going rate for trucking per mile?\nThe average going rates for trucking per mile are:\nMany things influence trucking freight rates. Some key factors include:\nWhy are trucking rates so low?\nOur findings show that recent trucking rates are low because of a larger supply compared to the available demand.\nWhen the pandemic began, people needed more things shipped, and the for-hire trucking market soared. Trucking companies started large recruiting drives, and many people decided to start trucking businesses of their own.\nBut now that the volume of shipments is falling to pre-pandemic levels, there are simply too many truckers and not enough demand for shipments by truck. As the laws of supply and demand dictate, an abundance of supply means that prices are going to fall.\nHowever, that\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s thrown a wrench in the trucking industry. Recent global developments, such as the war in Ukraine raising fuel prices and a COVID resurgence in China\u2019s export centers causing commodity prices to rise, have made it harder for truckers to make a profit.\nThat said, the decreased demand for consumer goods doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all bad for truckers. While consumer goods shipments are down, 70-80% of freight consists of manufactured goods, and manufacturing companies are still willing to pay for truck deliveries.\nHow much do owner-operators make per mile?\nOwner-operators generally make 70 to 80% of their load per mile.\nIf we take flatbed rates as an example, a flatbed truck owner-operator stands to make up to $2.51 per mile out of the $3.14 per mile average rate.\nThe rest of the money goes to the trucking company to pay for benefits such as:\nThis is in contrast to company drivers, who may only get 38 to 52 cents per mile with the same load. However, the larger cut that owner-operators get comes with extra risks.\nAlthough they get benefits from their trucking company, owner-operators are still independent contractors who need to do everything themselves.\nWhile owner-operators stand to gain more money, they also need to set aside more cash for life and automotive insurance, fuel and maintenance, and taxes.\nBecause of this, owner-operators are more likely to be experienced truckers. Typically, those who have worked as company drivers for several years want more freedom and the chance to make their own decisions.\nIf you\u2019re a new trucker or are simply averse to taking more risks and responsibilities, you can become a company driver first to gain more experience and confidence.\nHow much does a freight broker charge per load?\nFreight brokers usually charge around 25-35% of the load.\nA freight broker is a middleman between a shipper and the carrier. They take the shipment from the customer and contact a carrier fleet to take the shipment to its destination.\nShippers like working with freight brokers because the broker deals with everything related to the carriers, becoming the single point of contact for updates. On the other side, carriers also like working with freight brokers because they can optimize routes and give the truckers multiple shipments to reduce deadhead miles.\nWhy trucking rates are important\nYour number one goal is to have a profitable trucking business, and keeping up with average trucking rates per mile is the best way to ensure that your business continues to grow. The key to this is having the right cost per mile trucking, so you win jobs and turn a profit.\nHopefully, you\u2019ve learned everything from what is the average rate per mile for hauling freight to standard truck shipping rates per mile in this article.\nTo recap, the truck rates you use for your business can be influenced by the:\nBy becoming an expert on what is the average trucking rate per mile and keeping up with industry trends, you\u2019ll be able to offer competitive prices and attract more customers, meaning more revenue.\nImage credit: Zetong Li via\u00a0Unsplash\nStreamline your business with Method\nStart your free trial \u2014 no credit card, no contract.\nFeatures\nCompany\n\nResources\nSupport\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Method Integration.

    "Summarized_Document": "Freight rates: Trucking rates per mile 2024\n\nIf you own a trucking business, ensuring profitability is crucial. Determining the best trucking rates per mile is key, but it can be complex due to constantly changing rates. This guide provides insights into current trucking rates per mile and essential industry terms.\n\nHow to calculate trucking freight rates\n\nTrucking rates are calculated by multiplying the rate per mile by the distance between starting and destination points. The total trucking rate = trucking rate per mile * total travel distance (in miles). Factors influencing trucking rates include distance, weight of the shipment, shipment density, and freight classification.\n\nKey factors in calculating trucking rates:\n\n1. Distance of travel: Ensure accurate mileage to avoid surprises and maintain profitability.\n2. Weight of the shipment: Manage overall weight load to control costs.\n3. Shipment density: Calculate by dividing cargo weight by its cubic feet.\n4. Freight classification: The NMFTA defines 18 classes of shipments affecting rates.\n\nTrucking companies charge customers per mile based on these factors. National average flatbed truck rates are $3.14 per mile, but rates vary by area. Setting a fair per-mile rate ensures fair wages for truckers, happy clients, and profitability.\n\nIndustry terms to know:\n\n- Consignor: The party shipping the product.\n- Consignee: The recipient of the products.\n- Carrier: The party delivering the products.\n- Bill of lading (BOL): A document required in the shipping process.\n- Free on board point (FOB): Indicates liability for goods during shipping.\n- Loss and damage: Claims for visible damage or undelivered shipments.\n- Full truckload shipping (FTL): A shipment that takes up an entire trailer.\n- Less than truckload (LTL): A shipment that doesn't take up an entire trailer.\n- Load rates: Charges for delivering cargo, influenced by various factors.\n- Drayage: Shipping goods a short distance via ground freight.\n- Pallets: Portable platforms for packaging items for freight shipping.\n- Stop keeping unit (SKU): A service identification code for tracking products.\n- Hundredweight (CWT): A unit of measurement (100 pounds in North America).\n\nCurrent trucking rates per mile (2024 averages):\n\n- Flatbed: $3.14 per mile\n- Reefer: $3.19 per mile\n- Dry van: $2.50 per mile\n\nOwner-operators generally earn 70-80% of the load per mile. For example, with flatbed rates at $3.14 per mile, an owner-operator can earn up to $2.51 per mile. The remaining 20-30% goes to the trucking company for benefits like access to cargo jobs and in-house mechanics.\n\nTrucking rates are influenced by factors such as fuel prices, supply and demand, and global developments. Keeping up with industry trends and average rates ensures competitive pricing and profitability for your trucking business.",

This choice will significantly reduce or completely eliminate fees for dispatching your inventory to various inbound locations within the Amazon network.\nIn relation to inbound fees, effective March 1, 2024, Amazon will introduce an inbound defect fee. This particular Amazon fee will cover shipments delivered to the wrong fulfillment center or deleted and abandoned shipments.

You may refer to the table below for the allotted discount per SIPP-certified unit in 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Jan 24, 2024.\nInventory and Storage Fee Changes\nAmazon recommends that sellers using Fulfillment by Amazon ensure they have a healthy inventory level to minimize order fulfillment costs, including shipping costs.\nIn an effort to promote healthy inventory levels among third-party sellers, Amazon is introducing a low-inventory-level fee for standard-sized products that consistently fall below customer demand. The said fee is set to be implemented on April 1st, 2024, and for guidance may refer to the table below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 Jan 24, 2024.\nIn relation to storage fee updates, Amazon indicated that non-peak monthly storage for standard-size product fees will be reduced.

    "Document": "Amazon Fee Changes 2024: Significant Fee Updates\nAmazon regularly introduces changes to their FBA fulfillment fees in order to complement the changes in the global eCommerce industry. This year, the tech giant introduced significant changes in core Amazon FBA fees and other Amazon selling fees in general, the majority of which will take effect on February 5th, 2024.\nThe upcoming Amazon fee changes are brought about by multiple factors affecting Amazon\u2019s business operations and the eCommerce industry in its totality. The new Amazon fees for 2024 are designed to motivate sellers to utilize the platform\u2019s services to benefit all parties involved, facilitating faster deliveries and ensuring efficient use of space in Amazon fulfillment centers.\nAmazon Fee Changes in 2024 | Summary\nAs Amazon continues to invest in technology, infrastructure, transportation, and people in order to innovate its services, additional costs are bound to be incurred. The changes to Amazon fees are largely focused on fulfillment, referral, storage, unit sales, and returns processing.\nAs an overview of the impact of these changes in Amazon fees, an average increase of $0.15 in fees per unit sold is to be expected by Amazon sellers. However, Amazon emphasizes that such an increase is \u201csignificantly less than other logistics providers.\u201d\nTo further enlighten sellers on the changes in Amazon selling fees this year, here are some core fee adjustments to be implemented in 2024.\nAmazon Referral Fees Update for 2024\nStarting January 15, 2024, there will be some changes in Amazon referral fees for apparel products, while other referral fees will remain unchanged. Apparel products priced at a certain level will be updated.\nAs mentioned, referral fees for other Amazon products will remain unchanged. You may refer on the table below for the referral fees of specific Amazon categories:\n15% for products with a total sales price greater than $10.00\n15% for items with a total sales price greater than $10.00\n8% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $300.00\n8% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $100.00\n15% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $100.00 up to $1,000.00,\n10% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $1,000.00 up to $5,000.00, and\n5% for the portion of the total sales price greater than $5,000.00\n10% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $200.00\n15% for products with a total sales price greater than $15.00\n5% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $250.00\n8% for products with a total sales price greater than $500.00\n3% for any portion of the total sales price greater than $1,500.00\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cReferral fee rates,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nFBA Fulfillment Fees (Excluding Apparel)\nOn February 5th, 2024, the new granular rate cards for standard-sized products and large bulky & extra-large size tiers will take effect.

The standard-sized products will have an average fee of $0.27 per unit, whereas Large Bulky-sized products will have an average fee of $1.58 per unit.\nThe implementation of this inbound placement service fee will commence 45 days after the products are received. It means that Amazon will start charging sellers inbound placement fees on April 15th, 2024. For reference, you can check the table below.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cFBA inbound placement service fee,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nSource: Adapted from Seller Central \u2013 \u201cFBA inbound placement service fee,\u201d Jan 24, 2024.\nTo minimize or eliminate fees associated with inbound placement services, Amazon recommends opting for the \u201cDiscounted\u201d FBA inbound placement service, provided your shipping plan meets the criteria. This choice will significantly reduce or completely eliminate fees for dispatching your inventory to various inbound locations within the Amazon network.\nIn relation to inbound fees, effective March 1, 2024, Amazon will introduce an inbound defect fee.

Significant business model issues have been starting to manifest for fleets already deploying battery-electric trucks.\nIn many respects, Sanchez\u2019s message echoed that of J.B. Hunt President Shelley Simpson the previous day.\nBEV Technology is Still in its Infancy\nLooking at diesel versus electric in light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, Sanchez said that while Ryder expected to see cost increases for adopting BEVs instead of conventional diesel trucks, they did not expect to see the magnitude of those costs, which he cited as a major barrier to widespread adoption at the current time.\n\u201cWe know the commercial EVs beyond light-duty transit vans are not ready for mass adoption due to price range and payload limitations,\u201d Sanchez told show attendees.\n\u201cWe also know that we have a lack of critical charging infrastructure, and we would [have to] make major improvements to their power grid in order to support it.\n\u201cFrom our point of view, for commercial EVs to work in the real world, we need a breakthrough in battery technology and an expansion of the charging infrastructure. We need an inflection point.\u201d\nToday's EVs are Like the First Mobile Phones\nSanchez produced a vintage Motorola \u201cbrick\u201d cell phone from the podium to make his next point: That BEV technology \u2014 much like the brick cell phone in the late 1970s \u2014 is still in the very earliest stage of its development path.\nOver time, of course, cellphone technology improved exponentially. Better batteries were developed. Phones got smaller. And, as more and more capabilities were added, they eventually evolved into smartphones.\nThere\u2019s a distinct parallel between the evolution of cellular and commercial zero-emissions vehicle technology, Sanchez said. Like the cell phone, he added, the industry needs electric vehicle costs to come down.\n\u201cWe need smaller, lighter and more powerful battery technology to improve the range and capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need a nationwide infrastructure. We need the fastest applicable charges available where professional drivers can conveniently charge their trucks.\u201d\nWe Need a Technological Breakthrough\nThe North American trucking industry clearly needs a new technological breakthrough to drive capabilities up and costs down. The problem, Sanchez cautioned, is that we don\u2019t know when that breakthrough will come, and what kind of changes it will bring.\nThe real-world numbers highlight the scope of issue.\n\u201cAt Ryder, we have a stable of nearly 250,000 commercial vehicles,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnd only 60 of those trucks are EVs.\n\u201cWe also have 40,000 commercial vehicle customers. And so far, only 18 of them have chosen to deploy EVs in their fleets.\u201d\nThose figures hold true for the North American trucking industry at large, Sanchez added. He said that there are nearly 16 million commercial vehicles in service in North America today. And to date, only 28,000 of them are EVs.\n\u201cThe problem is not lack of interest,\u201d Sanchez explained. \u201cWe have many customers who asked about the cost benefit of converting to EVs. We found that there was significant barrier to conversion in the total cost of transport, or the TCT.\u201d\nTCT, he explained, includes the cost of vehicle, fuel or electricity, driver wages, as well as other factors that go into transporting the same load the same distance and achieving the equivalent delivery times.\nThe business case for converting to BEV technology just isn\u2019t there yet, Sanchez said.\nIn fact, he added, if you take the average load that is currently being moved by a heavy-duty diesel truck today and convert that tractor to electric, it requires nearly two vehicles and more than two trailers to deliver the same load at the same time as one diesel vehicle, at more than double TCT.\n\u201cI think most of you would agree that this is a tough sell.\u201d\nThe Diesel and Electric Total Cost of Transport Gap\nRyder did the math to better understand how significant the TCT gap between diesel and battery-electric trucks actually is. The results are detailed in a white paper, \u201cCharged Logistics: The cost of electric vehicle conversion for U.S. commercial fleets.\u201d\nRyder analyzed the total cost to transport, in one-to-one comparisons, for transitioning Class 4 (light-duty), Class 6 (medium-duty), and Class 8 (heavy-duty) vehicles operating in California and Georgia from internal combustion engines to EVs in today\u2019s market.\nThen it also examined the TCT for transitioning a mixed fleet (light, medium, and heavy) of 25 ICE vehicles to EVs. The mix was based on the overall mix of commercial vehicles in the U.S. according to Polk Data Services.\nThe analysis is based on representative network loads and routes from Ryder\u2019s dedicated fleet operations, which includes more than 13,000 commercial vehicles and professional drivers, as well as the impact of EV charging time and maximum payload to achieve equivalent delivery times.\nCritical factors include general labor, energy costs, loads and routes, Sanchez explained.\n\u201cWe then factored in a number of cost assumptions using current market prices for vehicles, maintenance, fuel, and charging infrastructure. We also factored in driver\u2019s wages, other professional costs, as well as general and administrative expenses.\u201d\nThen, Ryder took the range and payload capabilities needed to achieve equivalent diesel delivery targets and ran the numbers.\n\u201cIt currently costs about $170,000 a year to run the light-duty diesel Transit van,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cFor electric vehicles, that cost increases an estimated 3%. The cost of the vehicle nearly doubles. However, maintenance cost savings largely offset the increase in vehicle cost.\u201d\nThe additional driver hours needed for EV charging time in Georgia costs a fleet about $156,000 per year. And while equipment maintenance costs remain the same as that of California, Sanchez noted, Georgia\u2019s lower fuel and energy costs do not provide the same level of savings while transitioning from diesel to electric. All this results in a higher cost disadvantage for Georgia than California.\nHeavy-Duty Comparison\nAs the study moved from light-duty to larger vehicles, the cost benefits start to wane even more.\nLooking at Class 8, in Georgia, it costs a fleet about $291,000 to run a diesel-powered truck. In California, it\u2019s about $334,000 per year.\nBut given current BEV range and payload limitations, Sanchez said it could require nearly twice the equipment and more than twice the labor compared to a diesel truck for fleets to deliver the same loads.\nSo for that same fleet in Georgia, an electric truck would take $622,438 to deliver the same loads.\nIn California, the cost to deliver those same loads with electric would cost $648,712.\nOverall, Ryder\u2019s analysis estimates cost increases of 94% to 114% to convert heavy-duty trucks to EVs and 56% to 67% to convert mixed fleets of 25 vehicles, depending on which state.\nOverall, Ryder\u2019s analysis estimates cost increases of 94% to 114% to convert heavy-duty trucks to EVs.\nImage: HDT graphic\nUltimately, consumers will have to pay for those prices increases.\n\u201cKeep in mind that nearly three-quarters of all goods in the U.S. are transported by trucks,\u201d he added.\n\u201cSo if you extrapolate the TCT analysis for the entire U.S. fleet of commercial vehicles to a 100% transition to EVs, and passing the average total cost of transport on to consumers, we estimate that this increased costs cumulatively adding from .5% to 1% in overall inflation.\u201d\nCan the Cost Parity Gap Be Closed?\nSanchez said the purpose of Ryder\u2019s analysis is to quantify the current gap in cost between diesel and EVS and to identify the cost drivers.\nThis, in turn, will help equipment manufacturers, technology companies, innovators, and regulators to better focus their ZEV development efforts.\n\u201cWe believe those to be advanced battery technology to address payload and range limitations, reducing vehicle costs, and building out sufficient charging networks and delivering power,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe believe [by addressing] those three areas \u2026 we can start to close the gap and created a cost parity between diesel and electric trucks.\u201d\nThere are also multiple ways to reduce vehicle emissions, including electric, natural gas, hydrogen, hybrid carbon capture, as well as continuing to advance diesel emissions technology, Sanchez added.\n\u201cPeople and businesses will see the benefits of zero-emission vehicles,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cAnd mass adoption will follow. It will take all of us in this room and throughout the industry, working together to strike a balance between encouraging innovation, safeguarding the interests of businesses and consumers and the environment alignment.

Robert Sanchez, Ryder System\u2019s CEO, highlighted this during his keynote at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo (ACT Expo) in Las Vegas on May 22, 2024. Despite advancements in zero-emission powertrain technologies, significant business model issues have emerged for fleets using BEVs. Sanchez compared the current state of BEV technology to the early stages of mobile phones, emphasizing the need for breakthroughs in battery technology and charging infrastructure.Ryder's analysis of the total cost of transport (TCT) for Class 4, Class 6, and Class 8 vehicles in California and Georgia revealed substantial cost disparities between diesel and electric trucks. For instance, running a light-duty diesel Transit van costs about $170,000 annually, while an electric version increases costs by 3%. For heavy-duty trucks, the cost to run a diesel truck in Georgia is approximately $291,000, compared to $622,438 for an electric truck. In California, these costs are $334,000 for diesel and $648,712 for electric.Overall, Ryder estimates a 94% to 114% cost increase for converting heavy-duty trucks to EVs and a 56% to 67% increase for mixed fleets of 25 vehicles. These increased costs could add 0.5% to 1% to overall inflation if passed on to consumers. Sanchez stressed the need for advancements in battery technology, vehicle cost reduction, and charging infrastructure to close the cost parity gap between diesel and electric trucks. He also mentioned other emission reduction methods, including natural gas, hydrogen, hybrid carbon capture, and advanced diesel emissions technology.",

    "Query": "What was the impact on delivery times for Amazon Prime deliveries in San Francisco between March 2024 and September 2024?",
    "Document_ID": "DOC_121",
    "Document": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024\nOne thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them.\nTo that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe.\nThis is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers.\nFastest speeds ever in 2023\nWe achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service.\nIn the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them.\nAnd we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEven faster delivery speeds in 2024\nAfter reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019.\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever:\n1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers\nWe\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow.\nLast year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024.\nAround the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster.\nAs part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient.\n2.\u00a0Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally\nAmazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day.\nWe know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT.\nIn December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey.\nFor services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix.\n3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies\nWe\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.\nWe\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location.\nMany years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.\nSign up for the weekly Amazon newsletter\nWhat is Amazon Day Delivery?

And the teams have been at it for multiple quarters now, and we\u2019re seeing it pay off.\n\n\tTarget\u2019s e-commerce business saw 8.7 comparable sales growth in the quarter, outpacing the 0.7 percent comparable sales growth for stores. But the demand for faster delivery and pickup options is clearly working in the company\u2019s favor.\n\n\tAccording to Target CEO Brian Cornell, same-day services saw double-digit growth that surpassed the digital sales growth.\n\n\tThe Drive Up curbside pickup service and the membership-based Target Circle 360 same-day delivery offering both grow roughly 14 percent each.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSame-day services now account for more than two-thirds of e-commerce sales, with the biggest contribution coming from Drive Up, which generated sales of more than $2 billion in the second quarter and more than $4 billion so far this year.\n\n\t\u201cThe thing we see when people engage with Drive Up and with Circle 360 same-day delivery, is that their in-store shopping actually increases after they become users of those services,\u201d Fiddelke said. \u201cAnd so, continue to watch that relationship closely and growth of those services means growth in our share of wallet as the consumers that use those services.\u201d\n\n\tThe digital sales jump for Target is promising, as it was the largest individual increase for the company since the second quarter of 2022, when online comparable sales growth jumped 9 percent. The metric increased just 1.4 percent from the year prior in the first quarter.\n\n\tAcross the company, Target saw total revenue increase 2.7 percent to $25.5 billion on net income of $1.2 billion\u2014a 42.7 percent improvement from the year prior. Comparable store sales increased 2 percent year over year, with traffic growing 3 percent in the period.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Newsletters\n\t\n\t\nReceive Our Daily Newsletter & Special Offers\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Recommends\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAAFA Calls on Biden to Intervene in East Coast Port\u00a0Talks\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChain Reaction: John Singleton of Wen-Parker Logistics on Navigating Post-Pandemic Supply Chain\u00a0Disruptions\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2018A Very Difficult Moment\u2019 for Retail: How Could A Change to De Minimis Impact Shippers\u2019\u00a0Costs?\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025\u00a0Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSJ Newsletters\t\t\n\t\n\nGet the news straight to your inbox\n\n\n\t\n\t\tVideos\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIs Your Cotton Safe?

    "Summarized_Document": "Target\u2019s second-quarter sales increase was accompanied by faster delivery speeds due to the expansion of sortation centers. According to Michael Fiddelke, Target\u2019s COO and CFO, local orders processed through a sortation center arrive more than one day faster than the company\u2019s network average. Additionally, unit delivery costs from a sortation center are about 20 percent lower than the average. In 2024, Target\u2019s sortation centers have processed 19 percent more packages than the same period in 2023. Target is investing $100 million in the sortation project to enhance last-mile delivery capabilities. These facilities are positioned farther downstream from the retailer\u2019s stores, freeing up processing space and saving labor costs in those locations. Target is opening its 11th sortation center in Detroit, expected to process up to 60,000 packages daily by 2028. The company aims to operate at least 15 sortation centers by the end of 2026. The sortation centers are also helping to cut fulfillment costs by using fewer brown boxes for packaging. Target\u2019s e-commerce business saw 8.7 percent comparable sales growth in the quarter, with same-day services accounting for more than two-thirds of e-commerce sales. Drive Up curbside pickup service and Target Circle 360 same-day delivery both grew roughly 14 percent each. Same-day services generated more than $2 billion in sales in the second quarter and more than $4 billion so far this year. Target\u2019s total revenue increased 2.7 percent to $25.5 billion, with net income of $1.2 billion, a 42.7 percent improvement from the previous year. Comparable store sales increased 2 percent year over year, with traffic growing 3 percent.",

But the demand for faster delivery and pickup options is clearly working in the company\u2019s favor.\n\n\tAccording to Target CEO Brian Cornell, same-day services saw double-digit growth that surpassed the digital sales growth.\n\n\tThe Drive Up curbside pickup service and the membership-based Target Circle 360 same-day delivery offering both grow roughly 14 percent each.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSame-day services now account for more than two-thirds of e-commerce sales, with the biggest contribution coming from Drive Up, which generated sales of more than $2 billion in the second quarter and more than $4 billion so far this year.\n\n\t\u201cThe thing we see when people engage with Drive Up and with Circle 360 same-day delivery, is that their in-store shopping actually increases after they become users of those services,\u201d Fiddelke said. \u201cAnd so, continue to watch that relationship closely and growth of those services means growth in our share of wallet as the consumers that use those services.\u201d\n\n\tThe digital sales jump for Target is promising, as it was the largest individual increase for the company since the second quarter of 2022, when online comparable sales growth jumped 9 percent. The metric increased just 1.4 percent from the year prior in the first quarter.\n\n\tAcross the company, Target saw total revenue increase 2.7 percent to $25.5 billion on net income of $1.2 billion\u2014a 42.7 percent improvement from the year prior. Comparable store sales increased 2 percent year over year, with traffic growing 3 percent in the period.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Newsletters\n\t\n\t\nReceive Our Daily Newsletter & Special Offers\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Recommends\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAAFA Calls on Biden to Intervene in East Coast Port\u00a0Talks\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChain Reaction: John Singleton of Wen-Parker Logistics on Navigating Post-Pandemic Supply Chain\u00a0Disruptions\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2018A Very Difficult Moment\u2019 for Retail: How Could A Change to De Minimis Impact Shippers\u2019\u00a0Costs?\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025\u00a0Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSJ Newsletters\t\t\n\t\n\nGet the news straight to your inbox\n\n\n\t\n\t\tVideos\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIs Your Cotton Safe?

    "Summarized_Document": "Target\u2019s second-quarter sales increase was accompanied by faster delivery speeds due to the expansion of sortation centers. According to Michael Fiddelke, Target\u2019s COO and CFO, local orders processed through a sortation center arrive more than one day faster than the company\u2019s network average. Additionally, unit delivery costs from a sortation center are about 20 percent lower than the average. In 2024, Target\u2019s sortation centers have processed 19 percent more packages than the same period in 2023. Target is investing $100 million in the sortation project to enhance last-mile delivery capabilities. These facilities are positioned farther downstream from the retailer\u2019s stores, freeing up processing space and saving labor costs in those locations. Target is opening its 11th sortation center in Detroit, expected to process up to 60,000 packages daily by 2028. The company aims to operate at least 15 sortation centers by the end of 2026. The sortation centers are also helping to cut fulfillment costs by using fewer brown boxes for packaging. Target\u2019s e-commerce business saw 8.7 percent comparable sales growth in the quarter, with same-day services accounting for more than two-thirds of e-commerce sales. Drive Up curbside pickup service and Target Circle 360 same-day delivery both grew roughly 14 percent each. Same-day services generated more than $2 billion in sales in the second quarter and more than $4 billion so far this year. Target\u2019s total revenue increased 2.7 percent to $25.5 billion, with net income of $1.2 billion, a 42.7 percent improvement from the previous year. Comparable store sales increased 2 percent year over year, with traffic growing 3 percent.",

    "Summarized_Document": "Target\u2019s second-quarter sales increase was accompanied by faster delivery speeds due to the expansion of sortation centers. According to Michael Fiddelke, Target\u2019s COO and CFO, local orders processed through a sortation center arrive more than one day faster than the company\u2019s network average. Additionally, unit delivery costs from a sortation center are about 20 percent lower than the average. In 2024, Target\u2019s sortation centers have processed 19 percent more packages than the same period in 2023. Target is investing $100 million in the sortation project to enhance last-mile delivery capabilities. These facilities are positioned farther downstream from the retailer\u2019s stores, freeing up processing space and saving labor costs in those locations. Target is opening its 11th sortation center in Detroit, expected to process up to 60,000 packages daily by 2028. The company aims to operate at least 15 sortation centers by the end of 2026. The sortation centers are also helping to cut fulfillment costs by using fewer brown boxes for packaging. Target\u2019s e-commerce business saw 8.7 percent comparable sales growth in the quarter, with same-day services accounting for more than two-thirds of e-commerce sales. Drive Up curbside pickup service and Target Circle 360 same-day delivery both grew roughly 14 percent each. Same-day services generated more than $2 billion in sales in the second quarter and more than $4 billion so far this year. Target\u2019s total revenue increased 2.7 percent to $25.5 billion, with net income of $1.2 billion, a 42.7 percent improvement from the previous year. Comparable store sales increased 2 percent year over year, with traffic growing 3 percent.",

The most significant have included the US-China trade war, the COVID-19 pandemic-era consumer goods boom and the Russia-Ukraine war. Supply chain disruptions have also included a variety of natural disasters, financial failures and operational difficulties.\nSupply chain activity has normalized in operational terms during 2023, but there are significant risks across the industrial policy, labor action and environmental policy implementation spheres heading into 2024.\nSupply chains need to be more resilient, but questions remain over whether corporations and their investors are willing to make the investments necessary to fortify them.\nThe Take\nGlobal supply chains largely normalized in 2023 after years of disruption, and the need for resilience is clear. The willingness of corporations to build that resiliency is not.\nFalling operating margins and higher interest rates may be leading companies to cut their inventory balances and reverse recent supplier diversification increases.\nThere is no shortage of technology available to enable supply chain resilience, with generative AI as the latest example. Most companies need to see short-term returns on investment, and recent experiences with blockchain, for instance, are leaving some hesitant.\nOrganizational alignments are necessary to ensure continuing supply chain resilience. Tools for success include increased engagement with labor unions, geographic diversification with an eye to mitigating operational risk, closer tracking of environment profiles, reshoring and enhanced supplier engagement to manage tariff and geopolitical risk.\nPaying for Resilience in a High-Cost Environment\nS&P Global Market Intelligence data indicates that gross operating profit margins for manufacturers globally are expected to fall to 10.4% of sales in 2024 from 10.7% in 2022. The decline is expected to be particularly stark for the computing and electronics sector and domestic appliance manufacturing. At the same time, capital expenditures are forecast to exceed gross operating profits by 5% in 2024 after being equal to them in 2022. Reinvesting in capital stock may take priority over spending on supply chains.\nEmpty shelves were one of the most tangible signs of supply chain challenges during the pandemic era. The shortage of inventories, whether of toilet paper or computer chips, led many companies to over-order and subsequently cut stock levels in late 2022 and into 2023.\nData from the S&P Global Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) indicates that manufacturing stocks of finished goods were in retreat for eight of the first nine months of 2023. Destocking has been particularly notable in computing, which has been going on for 27 months while the downturn in consumer goods has been more sporadic.\nThe evidence from corporate financial data is mixed. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the Russell 3000 group of manufacturers and retailers of goods was 54.1% on a trailing three-month basis as of Sept. 30 compared to 50.1% on average for the 2016 to 2019 period. The elevated level is not necessarily evidence of a change in inventory patterns, as it is below the 54.8% peak reached in March.\nThe increase is also caused by just a handful of sectors. The apparel sector has an inventory-to-sales ratio of 74.7% versus 68.6% historically, while electronics excluding semiconductors stands at 39.1% versus its historical average of 29.9%.\nSectors with longer sales cycles are closer to balance. In the case of household durable goods, the inventory-to-sales ratio of 55.0% in September is well below the 64.7% peak of a 2022 and in line with the 54.9% historic average.\nDiversification of suppliers and reshoring are not the same thing. Both can reduce the inherent risk of a supply chain, and they often go hand-in-hand. However, diversification of suppliers can come in and out of fashion depending on the need for cost reductions.\nWith a focus on cost cutting in 2024, there may be less diversification as companies seek to shorten their supplier lists by pushing more orders to fewer suppliers to get better prices.\nThe number of suppliers per ultimate consignee for US seaborne imports for all industrial companies \u2014 nonfinancial, logistics or services \u2014 among the top 500 US importers increased by 13% in 2021 compared to 2019, indicating the use of more suppliers to deal with disruptions.\nThat increase in suppliers broadly started to reverse in 2022 and fell below pre-pandemic levels in the 12 months through Sept. 30, 2023. At a sector level, consumer goods companies registered one of the steepest drop-offs in suppliers. Similarly, the pool of suppliers for consumer durables companies \u2014 including furniture, appliances and leisure goods \u2014 expanded through 2021 but has contracted since then, dropping below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe auto industry\u2019s supplier pool has crested but remained elevated, potentially reflecting the secular shift to electric auto production while maintaining internal combustion engine production. Electronics has also remained elevated after a drop in 2022.\nChris Rogers is the Head of Supply Chain Research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nMark Fontecchio is a Research Analyst, covering the Internet of Things, 451 Research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nAmy Chang is the Lead Analyst at Panjiva, S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nEmilee Nason is a Data Scientist at Panjiva, S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nTo read the full report, click here.\nContact\nWashington International Trade Association (WITA)\nRonald Reagan Building and International Trade Center\n1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Suite G-329\nWashington, DC 20004\nwita@wita.org\nT (202) 312-1600\nF (202) 312-1601\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024.

    "Document": "What is a Good LSAT Score? 2024 Data\nAre you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results?\nIf so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What\u00a0is\u00a0a good LSAT score?\nThen you\u2019re in the right place.\nReady? Let\u2019s go!\nWhat is a good LSAT score in 2024?\u00a0\nBefore we get into scores, let\u2019s take a look at some of the statistics surrounding LSAT scores:\nLSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180.\nWith that big of a range, what kind of score should you aim for?\nRealistically, you should try to get a score of at least 150. That\u2019s the score that will get you into any accredited law school.\nBut if your dream school is among the best in America, you should aim higher.\nTo get into any of the top 25 law schools in America, you need to score at least 160.\nAnd if you want to attend a top 10 law school, you should try to score even higher \u2013 at least 170.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re taking the LSAT for the first time, you might be wondering how your score will compare to others.\u00a0\nKeep reading to find out.\u00a0\nWhat is the average LSAT score for first-time takers?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0Law School Admission Council\u00a0(LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151.\nOf course, if you\u2019re unhappy with your LSAT score, you can always\u00a0take it again.\nJust remember that you\u2019re limited to taking it three times in a single testing year (August to June) and five times in the past five years.\nIn total, you can take the LSAT seven times in your lifetime.\nBut is taking it again\u00a0really\u00a0worth it? Contrary to popular belief, doing so won\u2019t always help.\nRemember, first-time test takers score 151.\nPeople who take the LSAT for a second time score an average of 151.7, which is a slight increase.\nAnd while you might think that taking it for a third time would increase your score, that\u2019s not always true.\nIn fact, people who take the LSAT for a third time earn the lowest scores.\nThat\u2019s why I always tell my clients to really consider if retaking it is right for them. After all, your score isn\u2019t going to make or break your chances of acceptance, but we\u2019ll talk about that a bit later.\nLet\u2019s move on to the LSAT score you need to get accepted into your dream law school.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for law school?\u00a0\nAccording to the\u00a0American Bar Association\u00a0(ABA), the median LSAT score of full-time first-year JD students in the fall of 2022 was 158.5.\u00a0\nThe 75th percentile score was 160.9, and the 25th percentile score was 154.8.\nThat\u2019s not to say that you won\u2019t get into the program of your choice with a lower score. An LSAT score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program.\nYou just need to have the right kind of application.\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed the median LSAT score, let\u2019s move on to the highest scores.\nWhat is the highest LSAT score?\u00a0\nLSAT scores can range anywhere from 120 to 180.\nGetting a perfect 180 on the LSAT is practically unheard of. In fact, just 0.1% of test-takers have achieved it.\nA 170 is considered a great score, as it would mean you got at least 90 of the 101 questions on the test right.\u00a0\nDoing so would put you in the top 2-3% of test takers, meaning you would get into most law schools.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s discuss the kind of LSAT scores you would need to be accepted into the top 10 law schools in the country.\nWhat LSAT score do you need for the top 10 law schools?\u00a0\nIf you want to\u00a0attend one of the top 10 law schools in the country, you should aim for an LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the low, median, and high LSAT scores at each school.\nStanford University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nYale University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0175\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0178\nUniversity of Chicago\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (Carey)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0167\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nDuke University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0168\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0170\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0171\nHarvard University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0170\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0174\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0176\nNew York University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0169\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0172\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0174\nColumbia University\nLow LSAT:\u00a0171\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0173\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0175\nUniversity of Virginia\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0173\nNorthwestern University (Pritzker)\nLow LSAT:\u00a0166\nMedian LSAT:\u00a0171\nHigh LSAT:\u00a0172\nAs you can see, each of these schools has a median LSAT score of 170 or higher.\nBut even with a lower score, you can still get in.\nKeep reading to learn how.\nHow important are LSAT scores for law school admissions?\nIt\u2019s true that a higher score will increase your chances of acceptance into the law school of your choice.\nTypically, a score that falls within the 150 range is considered average. While it will get you accepted into most law schools, it could make it difficult to stand out.\nA score of at least 160 is considered strong, and most law schools have median scores within this range. However, keep in mind that scholarships may require higher scores.\nLast but not least, a score of 170 or more puts you comfortably among the top 2-3% of test-takers and will certainly get the attention of some of the best law schools in the country.\nBut I want to let you in on a secret: Your admission doesn\u2019t hinge solely on your LSAT score.\nYour\u00a0undergraduate GPA\u00a0also plays a part in it.\nAccording to the ABA,\u00a0the average GPA among admitted law school students\u00a0is around 3.6. But just like LSAT scores, that average varies across schools.\nAmong students who get into top-tier law schools like the ones mentioned earlier, the average GPA is 3.8 or higher.\nWhile both your GPA and LSAT scores are important factors in determining how successful you would be as a law school student, schools tend to weigh the LSAT more heavily.\nBut even if you score a couple of points lower than the median LSAT score or GPA at your number one school of choice, don\u2019t let it keep you from applying.\nThe law school admission process is a holistic one, which means that they\u2019ll look at more than just your score.\nIt all comes down to being able to prove you have what it takes to succeed as a law student in your application. With the right strategy, application elements like your personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation will help you stand out.\nNow that we\u2019ve touched on average LSAT scores and the kind of scores needed for top schools, let\u2019s move on to the three different types of LSAT scores.\nHow does LSAT work?\u00a0\nWhen talking about LSAT scores, most people only talk about the numbers, like 150, 170, or 180.\nBut there are actually\u00a0three\u00a0types of LSAT scores you should be aware of.\nThe first is called the raw score. Your raw score reflects the number of questions you answered correctly on the test.\nFor instance, if an LSAT was made up of 100 questions and you got 85 correct, you would score an 85.\nThe second type of score is a scaled score, which is the kind of score you\u2019re probably most familiar with.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0the kind of score that reads 150, 170, or 180.\u00a0\nA scaled score is what you get when you convert your raw score into an LSAT score based on the Score Conversion Chart. In this chart, scores range from 120 to 180.\nFinally, there\u2019s a percentile score, which shows how well you tested compared to others who have taken the LSAT over the last three years.\u00a0\nNext steps\nThere you have it! Everything you need to know about what makes for a good LSAT score.\nDon\u2019t let the pressure of a high LSAT score keep you from trying.\nAfter all, even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right kind of application strategy.\nDon\u2019t believe me?\u00a0\nI\u2019ve worked with several students who have scored well beneath the median and still gone on to receive admission letters.\nIf you want to make sure you\u2019re a top candidate, sign up for my\u00a0on-demand workshop today.

    "Summarized_Document": "Are you getting ready to take the LSAT or anxiously awaiting your results? If so, you\u2019ve probably wondered: What is a good LSAT score? LSAT takers can score anywhere from 120 to 180. Realistically, you should aim for at least 150 to get into any accredited law school. For top 25 law schools, aim for at least 160, and for top 10 law schools, aim for at least 170. According to the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), first-time LSAT takers score an average of 151. If you\u2019re unhappy with your score, you can retake it, but note that scores typically don\u2019t improve significantly on subsequent attempts. The median LSAT score for full-time first-year JD students in fall 2022 was 158.5, with the 75th percentile at 160.9 and the 25th percentile at 154.8. A score of 150 will typically earn you admission into any accredited JD program. LSAT scores range from 120 to 180, with a perfect 180 being extremely rare (0.1% of test-takers). A score of 170 or higher is considered excellent and places you in the top 2-3% of test-takers. For the top 10 law schools, the median LSAT scores are as follows: Stanford University (173), Yale University (175), University of Chicago (173), University of Pennsylvania (172), Duke University (170), Harvard University (174), New York University (172), Columbia University (173), University of Virginia (171), and Northwestern University (171). LSAT scores are important for law school admissions, but your undergraduate GPA also plays a significant role. The average GPA among admitted law school students is around 3.6, with top-tier schools averaging 3.8 or higher. The LSAT has three types of scores: raw score (number of correct answers), scaled score (converted from raw score, ranging from 120 to 180), and percentile score (compared to other test-takers over the last three years). Even if you don\u2019t score as high as your dream school\u2019s median, you can still get in with the right application strategy, including a strong personal statement, diversity statement, and letters of recommendation.",

Note: Prior to FY13, DEW did not report revenue as \u00e2\u0080\u009cother non-tax,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a category that includes sales of assets, fees, and investment income. Previously, most of those revenues were reported as local funds.\nEducation in the State Budget\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJust over 40 percent of Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total state budget is spent on K-12 education.\nSource: Ohio Legislative Service Commission, Historical Revenues and Expenditures, Table 2.

    "Summarized_Document": "2024 Ohio Education by the Numbers The Thomas B. Fordham Institute presents the seventh edition of Ohio Education By The Numbers, offering a fact-based overview of K-12 education in Ohio. For more information, visit www.fordhaminstitute.org/ohio. Student Enrollment Ohio has 1.6 million public school students. Enrollment statistics include traditional district, public charter, and independent STEM school students but exclude joint-vocational districts, educational service centers, non-public schools, and homeschooled students. Public School Enrollment by Grade Level Ohio has roughly 100,000 to 130,000 public school students per grade level. Public School Enrollment Trends Since 2005-06, overall public school enrollment has declined by nearly 10 percent. Enrollment for white and African American students has also declined, while Hispanic, multiracial, and Asian/Pacific Islander student enrollment has increased. English learner enrollment has more than doubled, and the number of students with disabilities has slightly increased. The percentage of economically disadvantaged students has increased since 2005-06. Ohio School Districts and Typologies Ohio DEW categorizes districts into eight typologies based on geographic and socio-economic characteristics. 28 percent of Ohio students reside in urban areas, 35 percent in suburban communities, 21 percent in small towns, and 15 percent in rural areas. Public School Students in Urban Areas Almost nine in ten urban students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Suburban Areas About one in five suburban students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Small Town Areas More than two in five small town students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Rural Areas Just under half of rural students are economically disadvantaged. Ohio\u2019s Twenty-Five Largest Districts by Enrollment (2022-23) Ohio Virtual Academy is considered equivalent to a school district. School Options Enrollment by Educational Model 80 percent of Ohio students attend traditional public school districts, over 110,000 attend charter schools, and more than 200,000 attend non-public schools or homeschool. Public Charter Schools Ohio has 334 charter schools serving over 110,000 students. Characteristics of Charter School Students 80 percent of charter school students are economically disadvantaged, and a majority are Black or Hispanic. Interdistrict Open Enrollment Four in five Ohio districts participate in interdistrict open enrollment, with approximately 80,000 students open enrolling. Private School Scholarships Over 80,000 students used state-funded scholarships to attend private schools in 2022-23. Homeschooling Nearly 50,000 students participate in homeschooling. Student Achievement: National Exams National Exams: NAEP 2022 Approximately 30 to 40 percent of Ohio students reach the national standard for proficiency. Ohio Compared to Other States Ohio ranks between 11th and 20th in fourth and eighth grade math and reading. National Exams: How Ohio Compares to Nearby States Ohio ranks 1st in fourth grade reading proficiency and is tied for 3rd in fourth grade math proficiency. Ohio ranks 1st in eighth grade reading proficiency and 4th in eighth grade math proficiency. Ohio\u2019s NAEP Scores over Time: Fourth Grade Fourth grade reading scores have been largely flat until recent declines. Fourth grade math scores increased from 2003 to 2013 but have declined recently. Ohio\u2019s NAEP Scores over Time: Eighth Grade Eighth grade reading scores were flat until a significant decline in 2022. Eighth grade math scores increased from 2003 to 2013 but have declined since. National Exams: Achievement by Race/Ethnicity Between 40 and 50 percent of Ohio\u2019s white fourth grade students achieve proficiency, but less than 15 percent of Black students do so. Student Achievement: State Exams Statewide Achievement in Selected Grades and Subjects 59 and 67 percent of Ohio fourth grade students reach proficient or above on state ELA and math exams, respectively. 58 and 46 percent of Ohio eighth grade students reach proficient or above on state ELA and math exams, respectively. Achievement Gaps Black and Hispanic students achieve at lower levels than white students on state exams. Economically disadvantaged students achieve at lower levels than their peers. Achievement gaps have generally widened since the pandemic. Student Achievement by District Typology Fourth and eighth grade proficiency rates are highest in suburban areas and lowest in urban areas. Proficiency Trends in Fourth and Eighth Grade Proficiency rates dipped in 2020-21 due to Covid-related disruptions. Math scores have rebounded but remain below pre-pandemic levels. ELA scores still trail pre-pandemic levels in fourth grade but have recovered in eighth grade. Proficiency Trends on Selected High School Exams Proficiency rates on state EOC exams declined in 2020-21 and have slightly rebounded in algebra I but not in geometry or English. Proficiency Rates on All State Exams The percent of Ohio students reaching proficiency on state exams ranges from 40 to 70 percent. Post-Secondary Readiness and Outcomes ACT Scores Over Time Ohio\u2019s average ACT composite score fell significantly beginning with the class of 2018. Average ACT Scores by Race/Ethnicity Large gaps in average ACT scores exist between race/ethnic groups. ACT Exam: College Readiness of the Class of 2023 College readiness varies by ACT content area, with just 20 percent of Ohio students reaching college-ready benchmarks in all four areas. Industry Credentials Approximately one in ten students earn twelve or more points in Ohio\u2019s industry credentialing system before graduating. Advanced Placement (AP) Scores 14 percent of Ohio students pass at least one AP exam.

The chart displays the spring part of the school year, a convention often used in this guide.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, public school enrollment has increased significantly among Hispanic, multiracial, and Asian/Pacific Islander students.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends by Selected Characteristics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, English learner enrollment has more than doubled, while the number of students with disabilities has slightly increased. The number of students identified as gifted has declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nLow Income Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe percentage of students identified as economically disadvantaged has increased since 2005-06. However, the percentage of Ohio children living in poverty has remained mostly static.\nSource: Economically disadvantaged data are from Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23); childhood poverty data are from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Kids Count Data Center and based on U.S. Census poverty estimates (data were not reported for 2020 and are not yet available for 2023). Notes: Ohio identifies students as \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomically disadvantaged\u00e2\u0080\u009d via federal meal programs, open to pupils from households with incomes at or below 185% of federal poverty. However, in 2010, Congress passed the Community Eligibility Provision which allows certain schools to deem all students as disadvantaged (even higher-income children) for the purposes of meals eligibility. In contrast, children in poverty are from households at or below 100% federal poverty.\nOhio School Districts and Typologies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor analytic purposes, the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce categorizes districts into eight typologies based on their geographic and socio-economic characteristics. This publication displays various statistics by typology to illustrate patterns of enrollment and achievement across the state.\nSource: Ohio DEW, School District Typology. Note: This map displays the border of each district and its corresponding typology.\nPublic School Students by Typology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28 percent of Ohio students reside in urban areas and 35 percent are from suburban communities; 21 percent live in small towns while 15 percent are from rural areas.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: Public charter and STEM schools are assigned to the typology of the district in which the school is located, as reported in DEW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s community school directory. Online charters\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as e-schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094are not included in a typology, since they can enroll students statewide.\nPublic School Students in Urban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents living in urban areas come from various racial and ethnic backgrounds, and almost nine in ten are identified as economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the urban typologies (i.e., urban: very high poverty and urban: high poverty).\nPublic School Students in Suburban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents from suburban areas are majority white, with modest racial and ethnic diversity. About one in five suburban students are economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23).

This table does not include charter or STEM students as part of the district\u00e2\u0080\u0099s student population. Enrollment changes of less than +/- 1 percent are considered to have had no substantive change (marked as \u00e2\u0080\u009c--\u00e2\u0080\u009c).\nSchoolOptions\n\nEnrollment by Educational Model\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoughly 80 percent of Ohio students attend traditional public school districts, while more than 110,000 students attend charter schools and more than 200,000 students attend non-public schools or homeschool.\nSources: All data are for 2022-23 and drawn from various sources from Ohio DEW.\nPublic Charter Schools\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has 334 charter schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as community schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094serving more than 110,000 students.\nSources: Ohio DEW downloadable file titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuilding Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d was used to calculate enrollments for 2022-23 and the community school directory was used to identify the type of charter school. Historical enrollment data were drawn from DEW, Community School Annual Report: 2021-2022.\nCharacteristics of Charter School Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoughly 80 percent of charter school students are economically disadvantaged, and a majority are Black or Hispanic. Nearly 70 percent of charter school students attend brick-and-mortar charters located in urban communities.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23).

    "Summarized_Document": "2024 Ohio Education by the Numbers The Thomas B. Fordham Institute presents the seventh edition of Ohio Education By The Numbers, offering a fact-based overview of K-12 education in Ohio. For more information, visit www.fordhaminstitute.org/ohio. Student Enrollment Ohio has 1.6 million public school students. Enrollment statistics include traditional district, public charter, and independent STEM school students but exclude joint-vocational districts, educational service centers, non-public schools, and homeschooled students. Public School Enrollment by Grade Level Ohio has roughly 100,000 to 130,000 public school students per grade level. Public School Enrollment Trends Since 2005-06, overall public school enrollment has declined by nearly 10 percent. Enrollment for white and African American students has also declined, while Hispanic, multiracial, and Asian/Pacific Islander student enrollment has increased. English learner enrollment has more than doubled, and the number of students with disabilities has slightly increased. The percentage of economically disadvantaged students has increased since 2005-06. Ohio School Districts and Typologies Ohio DEW categorizes districts into eight typologies based on geographic and socio-economic characteristics. 28 percent of Ohio students reside in urban areas, 35 percent in suburban communities, 21 percent in small towns, and 15 percent in rural areas. Public School Students in Urban Areas Almost nine in ten urban students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Suburban Areas About one in five suburban students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Small Town Areas More than two in five small town students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Rural Areas Just under half of rural students are economically disadvantaged. Ohio\u2019s Twenty-Five Largest Districts by Enrollment (2022-23) Ohio Virtual Academy is considered equivalent to a school district. School Options Enrollment by Educational Model 80 percent of Ohio students attend traditional public school districts, over 110,000 attend charter schools, and more than 200,000 attend non-public schools or homeschool. Public Charter Schools Ohio has 334 charter schools serving over 110,000 students. Characteristics of Charter School Students 80 percent of charter school students are economically disadvantaged, and a majority are Black or Hispanic. Interdistrict Open Enrollment Four in five Ohio districts participate in interdistrict open enrollment, with approximately 80,000 students open enrolling. Private School Scholarships Over 80,000 students used state-funded scholarships to attend private schools in 2022-23. Homeschooling Nearly 50,000 students participate in homeschooling. Student Achievement: National Exams National Exams: NAEP 2022 Approximately 30 to 40 percent of Ohio students reach the national standard for proficiency. Ohio Compared to Other States Ohio ranks between 11th and 20th in fourth and eighth grade math and reading. National Exams: How Ohio Compares to Nearby States Ohio ranks 1st in fourth grade reading proficiency and is tied for 3rd in fourth grade math proficiency. Ohio ranks 1st in eighth grade reading proficiency and 4th in eighth grade math proficiency. Ohio\u2019s NAEP Scores over Time: Fourth Grade Fourth grade reading scores have been largely flat until recent declines. Fourth grade math scores increased from 2003 to 2013 but have declined recently. Ohio\u2019s NAEP Scores over Time: Eighth Grade Eighth grade reading scores were flat until a significant decline in 2022. Eighth grade math scores increased from 2003 to 2013 but have declined since. National Exams: Achievement by Race/Ethnicity Between 40 and 50 percent of Ohio\u2019s white fourth grade students achieve proficiency, but less than 15 percent of Black students do so. Student Achievement: State Exams Statewide Achievement in Selected Grades and Subjects 59 and 67 percent of Ohio fourth grade students reach proficient or above on state ELA and math exams, respectively. 58 and 46 percent of Ohio eighth grade students reach proficient or above on state ELA and math exams, respectively. Achievement Gaps Black and Hispanic students achieve at lower levels than white students on state exams. Economically disadvantaged students achieve at lower levels than their peers. Achievement gaps have generally widened since the pandemic. Student Achievement by District Typology Fourth and eighth grade proficiency rates are highest in suburban areas and lowest in urban areas. Proficiency Trends in Fourth and Eighth Grade Proficiency rates dipped in 2020-21 due to Covid-related disruptions. Math scores have rebounded but remain below pre-pandemic levels. ELA scores still trail pre-pandemic levels in fourth grade but have recovered in eighth grade. Proficiency Trends on Selected High School Exams Proficiency rates on state EOC exams declined in 2020-21 and have slightly rebounded in algebra I but not in geometry or English. Proficiency Rates on All State Exams The percent of Ohio students reaching proficiency on state exams ranges from 40 to 70 percent. Post-Secondary Readiness and Outcomes ACT Scores Over Time Ohio\u2019s average ACT composite score fell significantly beginning with the class of 2018. Average ACT Scores by Race/Ethnicity Large gaps in average ACT scores exist between race/ethnic groups. ACT Exam: College Readiness of the Class of 2023 College readiness varies by ACT content area, with just 20 percent of Ohio students reaching college-ready benchmarks in all four areas. Industry Credentials Approximately one in ten students earn twelve or more points in Ohio\u2019s industry credentialing system before graduating. Advanced Placement (AP) Scores 14 percent of Ohio students pass at least one AP exam. Dual Enrollment Credit 13 percent of Ohio students earn twelve or more college credits through dual enrollment programs.

College Completion Rates 30 percent of Ohio students attain at least an associate degree within six years of leaving high school. Trends in College Enrollment and Completion College enrollment has decreased in recent years, while college completion rates remained generally flat. Ohio\u2019s Educators Public School Teachers Ohio public schools employ roughly 100,000 teachers, or 16 students per teacher. Characteristics of Ohio Teachers Nearly three in four teachers are female, and 90 percent are white. Non-Teaching Staff Positions Ohio public schools have approximately 220,000 non-teaching staff positions. Staff Positions in Ohio Schools Classroom teachers represent about one-third of the total staff positions. Teacher Salaries by District Typology On average, Ohio teachers earn almost $70,000 per year. Trends in Teacher Salaries Adjusted for inflation, average teacher salaries have ranged from $70,000 to $80,000 per year since 2009. Trends in Superintendent and Principal Salaries Adjusted for inflation, average superintendent salaries have ranged from $125,000 to $145,000 per year since 2009, while principal salaries have ranged from $100,000 to $115,000 per year. School Funding How Ohio Funds Public Schools Ohio public schools receive more than $27 billion per year. State funds provide 36 percent of total revenues, while local taxes contribute 44 percent. How Ohio Funds Public Schools: Trend Over Time State and local taxpayer dollars provide the bulk of funding for K-12 education. Education in the State Budget Just over 40 percent of Ohio\u2019s total state budget is spent on K-12 education. How Funds Are Spent Nearly 60 percent of education funding is spent on classroom instruction. How Funds Are Spent: Salaries and Benefits 61 percent of public schools\u2019 instructional expenditures are spent on salaries and 23 percent on benefits.

Note: Public school enrollment statistics include traditional district, public charter, and independent STEM school students, but do not include students attending joint-vocational districts and educational service centers, pupils attending non-public schools, or home schooled students. More information about those enrollments are found in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSchool Options\u00e2\u0080\u009d section.\nPublic School Enrollment by Grade\u00a0Level\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has roughly 100,000 to 130,000 public school students per grade level.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23).\nPublic School Enrollment Trends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, overall public school enrollment has declined by nearly 10 percent. Enrollment for Ohio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest race/ethnic student groups, white and African American students, has also declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent change from 2006 to 2023. The chart displays the spring part of the school year, a convention often used in this guide.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, public school enrollment has increased significantly among Hispanic, multiracial, and Asian/Pacific Islander students.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nPublic School Enrollment Trends by Selected Characteristics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince 2005-06, English learner enrollment has more than doubled, while the number of students with disabilities has slightly increased. The number of students identified as gifted has declined.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23). Note: The percentages refer to the percent changes from 2006 to 2023.\nLow Income Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe percentage of students identified as economically disadvantaged has increased since 2005-06. However, the percentage of Ohio children living in poverty has remained mostly static.\nSource: Economically disadvantaged data are from Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2005-06 to 2022-23); childhood poverty data are from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Kids Count Data Center and based on U.S. Census poverty estimates (data were not reported for 2020 and are not yet available for 2023). Notes: Ohio identifies students as \u00e2\u0080\u009ceconomically disadvantaged\u00e2\u0080\u009d via federal meal programs, open to pupils from households with incomes at or below 185% of federal poverty. However, in 2010, Congress passed the Community Eligibility Provision which allows certain schools to deem all students as disadvantaged (even higher-income children) for the purposes of meals eligibility. In contrast, children in poverty are from households at or below 100% federal poverty.\nOhio School Districts and Typologies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor analytic purposes, the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce categorizes districts into eight typologies based on their geographic and socio-economic characteristics. This publication displays various statistics by typology to illustrate patterns of enrollment and achievement across the state.\nSource: Ohio DEW, School District Typology. Note: This map displays the border of each district and its corresponding typology.\nPublic School Students by Typology\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28 percent of Ohio students reside in urban areas and 35 percent are from suburban communities; 21 percent live in small towns while 15 percent are from rural areas.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: Public charter and STEM schools are assigned to the typology of the district in which the school is located, as reported in DEW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s community school directory. Online charters\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as e-schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094are not included in a typology, since they can enroll students statewide.\nPublic School Students in Urban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents living in urban areas come from various racial and ethnic backgrounds, and almost nine in ten are identified as economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23). Note: This table combines districts and charters in both of the urban typologies (i.e., urban: very high poverty and urban: high poverty).\nPublic School Students in Suburban Areas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudents from suburban areas are majority white, with modest racial and ethnic diversity. About one in five suburban students are economically disadvantaged.\nSource: Calculations based on Ohio DEW downloadable files titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistrict and Building Details\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2022-23).

This table does not include charter or STEM students as part of the district\u00e2\u0080\u0099s student population. Enrollment changes of less than +/- 1 percent are considered to have had no substantive change (marked as \u00e2\u0080\u009c--\u00e2\u0080\u009c).\nSchoolOptions\n\nEnrollment by Educational Model\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoughly 80 percent of Ohio students attend traditional public school districts, while more than 110,000 students attend charter schools and more than 200,000 students attend non-public schools or homeschool.\nSources: All data are for 2022-23 and drawn from various sources from Ohio DEW.\nPublic Charter Schools\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOhio has 334 charter schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094also known as community schools\u00e2\u0080\u0094serving more than 110,000 students.\nSources: Ohio DEW downloadable file titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuilding Overview\u00e2\u0080\u009d was used to calculate enrollments for 2022-23 and the community school directory was used to identify the type of charter school. Historical enrollment data were drawn from DEW, Community School Annual Report: 2021-2022.\nCharacteristics of Charter School Students\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoughly 80 percent of charter school students are economically disadvantaged, and a majority are Black or Hispanic. Nearly 70 percent of charter school students attend brick-and-mortar charters located in urban communities.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Advanced Reports (2022-23). Note: All statistics in this table include online charter schools; they are not assigned to district typologies, however, because they can draw students from all areas of the state.\nInterdistrict Open Enrollment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFour in five Ohio districts participate in interdistrict open enrollment. Approximately 80,000 students open enroll, with participation generally, until recently, increasing over time.\nSources: Two sources were used for this chart, based on the availability of data. For 2002-03 to 2011-12, data from the Ohio Auditor of State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 report, Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Open Enrollment were used. For 2012-13 to 2022-23, enrollments are calculated based on school districts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 funding reports; see Ohio DEW, Traditional Public Schools Funding.\nPrivate School Scholarships\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore than 80,000 students used state-funded scholarships (often referred to as vouchers) to attend private schools in 2022-23.\nSource: Historical Historical data through 2020-21 are from American Federation for Children, School Choice Yearbook (2021). Ohio DEW began recently reporting more detailed voucher data and beginning with 2021-22, numbers are from Advanced Reports. Note: The chart displays the total number of students in the various scholarship programs. For more information on each program, see Ohio DEW\u00e2\u0080\u0099s webpage, Scholarships.\nHomeschooling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNearly 50,000 students participate in homeschooling; the number of homeschoolers significantly increased in 2020-21 and has decreased slightly since then.\nSource: Ohio DEW, Homeschool Student Data. Note: Students attending online charter schools are not considered homeschool students.\nStudent Achievement:National Exams\n\nNational Exams: NAEP 2022\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApproximately 30 to 40 percent of Ohio students reach the national standard for proficiency, just above the national average.\nSource: National Assessment of Educational Progress, Data Explorer (2022).

    "Summarized_Document": "2024 Ohio Education by the Numbers The Thomas B. Fordham Institute presents the seventh edition of Ohio Education By The Numbers, offering a fact-based overview of K-12 education in Ohio. For more information, visit www.fordhaminstitute.org/ohio. Student Enrollment Ohio has 1.6 million public school students. Enrollment statistics include traditional district, public charter, and independent STEM school students but exclude joint-vocational districts, educational service centers, non-public schools, and homeschooled students. Public School Enrollment by Grade Level Ohio has roughly 100,000 to 130,000 public school students per grade level. Public School Enrollment Trends Since 2005-06, overall public school enrollment has declined by nearly 10 percent. Enrollment for white and African American students has also declined, while Hispanic, multiracial, and Asian/Pacific Islander student enrollment has increased. English learner enrollment has more than doubled, and the number of students with disabilities has slightly increased. The percentage of economically disadvantaged students has increased since 2005-06. Ohio School Districts and Typologies Ohio DEW categorizes districts into eight typologies based on geographic and socio-economic characteristics. 28 percent of Ohio students reside in urban areas, 35 percent in suburban communities, 21 percent in small towns, and 15 percent in rural areas. Public School Students in Urban Areas Almost nine in ten urban students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Suburban Areas About one in five suburban students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Small Town Areas More than two in five small town students are economically disadvantaged. Public School Students in Rural Areas Just under half of rural students are economically disadvantaged. Ohio\u2019s Twenty-Five Largest Districts by Enrollment (2022-23) Ohio Virtual Academy is considered equivalent to a school district. School Options Enrollment by Educational Model 80 percent of Ohio students attend traditional public school districts, over 110,000 attend charter schools, and more than 200,000 attend non-public schools or homeschool. Public Charter Schools Ohio has 334 charter schools serving over 110,000 students. Characteristics of Charter School Students 80 percent of charter school students are economically disadvantaged, and a majority are Black or Hispanic. Interdistrict Open Enrollment Four in five Ohio districts participate in interdistrict open enrollment, with approximately 80,000 students open enrolling. Private School Scholarships Over 80,000 students used state-funded scholarships to attend private schools in 2022-23. Homeschooling Nearly 50,000 students participate in homeschooling. Student Achievement: National Exams National Exams: NAEP 2022 Approximately 30 to 40 percent of Ohio students reach the national standard for proficiency.

National Exams: How Ohio Compares to Nearby States Ohio ranks 1st in fourth grade reading proficiency and is tied for 3rd in fourth grade math proficiency. Ohio ranks 1st in eighth grade reading proficiency and 4th in eighth grade math proficiency. Ohio\u2019s NAEP Scores over Time: Fourth Grade Fourth grade reading scores have been largely flat until recent declines. Fourth grade math scores increased from 2003 to 2013 but have declined recently. Ohio\u2019s NAEP Scores over Time: Eighth Grade Eighth grade reading scores were flat until a significant decline in 2022. Eighth grade math scores increased from 2003 to 2013 but have declined since. National Exams: Achievement by Race/Ethnicity Between 40 and 50 percent of Ohio\u2019s white fourth grade students achieve proficiency, but less than 15 percent of Black students do so. Student Achievement: State Exams Statewide Achievement in Selected Grades and Subjects 59 and 67 percent of Ohio fourth grade students reach proficient or above on state ELA and math exams, respectively. 58 and 46 percent of Ohio eighth grade students reach proficient or above on state ELA and math exams, respectively. Achievement Gaps Black and Hispanic students achieve at lower levels than white students on state exams. Economically disadvantaged students achieve at lower levels than their peers. Achievement gaps have generally widened since the pandemic. Student Achievement by District Typology Fourth and eighth grade proficiency rates are highest in suburban areas and lowest in urban areas. Proficiency Trends in Fourth and Eighth Grade Proficiency rates dipped in 2020-21 due to Covid-related disruptions. Math scores have rebounded but remain below pre-pandemic levels. ELA scores still trail pre-pandemic levels in fourth grade but have recovered in eighth grade.

Today, most college and university students in the U.S. take at least some classes online.\nOnline degrees have a broad reach, encompassing new higher education concepts like microcredentials and massive open online courses (MOOCs), along with traditional college degrees.\nDistance learners, too, are a diverse group. As a remote student, your peers may include traditional college-age students, working parents, military service members, established professionals and lifelong learners.\nThis fast-growing field clearly holds wide appeal, but how big is online learning, exactly?\nThis article examines the popularity of online learning, charting how fast the field has grown in recent years and exploring the motivations behind distance learning. If you\u2019re a prospective or current online student, a parent or an educator\u2014or if you\u2019re just curious about the online learning phenomenon\u2014these are the key statistics to know.\nKey Takeaways\nOnline Learning by the Numbers\nAll types of colleges and universities offer classes online. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), public colleges enrolled about 8.5 million online students in 2021. Another 2.7 million remote learners attended private schools, including 1.9 million at nonprofit institutions and nearly 800,000 at for-profit schools.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the availability of online learning in higher education starting in 2020. NCES reports that 75% of all postsecondary students in the U.S.\u2014over 14 million learners\u2014took online classes in fall 2020 as the pandemic restricted in-person learning, whereas only 36% had enrolled in distance education in fall 2019.\nWith many schools opening classrooms for in-person learning again in 2021, the percentage of students enrolled in distance learning courses dropped to about 60%\u2014still much higher than in pre-pandemic years.\nOnline enrollment levels vary depending on where students live. Alaska, Hawai\u2019i and New Hampshire boast the highest percentages of online students in the United States.\nOnline Schools vs. Traditional College\nMany online degree seekers attend traditional schools, but as of 2020, about 15% of all U.S. college students attended primarily online institutions. NCES defines primarily online schools as those enrolling 90% or more of their student body in distance education. About 11% of U.S. colleges and universities\u2014422 institutions in total\u2014fit this profile.\nOften catering to working students, some online schools have always offered fully remote programs. Others began as traditional campus-based institutions, later establishing online divisions that grew to dwarf their brick-and-mortar counterparts.\nIn 2020, primarily online schools enrolled over 1.5 million full-time degree seekers. Another 1.2 million learners took classes part time. Female students outnumbered male students among both full-time and part-time enrollees, making up about 62% of all learners.\nOnline Learning Through the Years\nIn 2020, the onset of Covid-19 disrupted traditional education, abruptly forcing students, instructors and administrators to adapt to remote learning models.\nEven before the pandemic, however, remote learning had been growing steadily for almost a decade as daily life became more digitized and remote learning technology and infrastructure improved.\nIn 2012\u2014a watershed year in online education that saw the founding of MOOC giants edX and Coursera\u2014over 25% of U.S. college and university students took at least one distance learning course, NCES reports. By 2019, that number had risen to 36%, about half of whom attended exclusively online.\nIn 2020, the number of online students at traditional higher education institutions exploded as schools shifted courses online amid lockdown restrictions. During that year, about 46% of U.S. learners studied entirely online, and another 28% took at least some courses remotely. As of 2021, remote learning numbers remained high, with about 60% of college students taking some or all of their classes online.\nMany traditional degree-seeking students returned to in-person learning when schools reopened in 2021, but online education as a whole continued to grow.\nThe World Economic Forum reports that in 2016, Coursera had 21 million registered users. By 2019, 44 million learners used the MOOC platform. This number leaped to 71 million in 2020, but unlike online college enrollment numbers, Coursera\u2019s enrollment did not drop in 2021. Instead, the platform gained even more users, totaling 92 million in 2022.\nOnline Degrees\nRemote learning programs serve this growing body of online students with degree programs at all levels. NCES reports that in the 2019-20 academic year, primarily online colleges conferred:\nMale-identifying students earned 37% to 39% of these degrees, with female-identifying students earning 61% to 63%.\nStudents at primarily online schools make up 14.7% of all college and university enrollees. They earn:\nOnline doctoral programs are relatively uncommon; remote learners earn only 7.6% of all doctorates.\nOnline Learning by Race\nOnline schools serve a racially diverse student body, with more than half of all learners identifying as nonwhite.

Today, most college and university students in the U.S. take at least some classes online.\nOnline degrees have a broad reach, encompassing new higher education concepts like microcredentials and massive open online courses (MOOCs), along with traditional college degrees.\nDistance learners, too, are a diverse group. As a remote student, your peers may include traditional college-age students, working parents, military service members, established professionals and lifelong learners.\nThis fast-growing field clearly holds wide appeal, but how big is online learning, exactly?\nThis article examines the popularity of online learning, charting how fast the field has grown in recent years and exploring the motivations behind distance learning. If you\u2019re a prospective or current online student, a parent or an educator\u2014or if you\u2019re just curious about the online learning phenomenon\u2014these are the key statistics to know.\nKey Takeaways\nOnline Learning by the Numbers\nAll types of colleges and universities offer classes online. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), public colleges enrolled about 8.5 million online students in 2021. Another 2.7 million remote learners attended private schools, including 1.9 million at nonprofit institutions and nearly 800,000 at for-profit schools.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the availability of online learning in higher education starting in 2020. NCES reports that 75% of all postsecondary students in the U.S.\u2014over 14 million learners\u2014took online classes in fall 2020 as the pandemic restricted in-person learning, whereas only 36% had enrolled in distance education in fall 2019.\nWith many schools opening classrooms for in-person learning again in 2021, the percentage of students enrolled in distance learning courses dropped to about 60%\u2014still much higher than in pre-pandemic years.\nOnline enrollment levels vary depending on where students live. Alaska, Hawai\u2019i and New Hampshire boast the highest percentages of online students in the United States.\nOnline Schools vs. Traditional College\nMany online degree seekers attend traditional schools, but as of 2020, about 15% of all U.S. college students attended primarily online institutions. NCES defines primarily online schools as those enrolling 90% or more of their student body in distance education. About 11% of U.S. colleges and universities\u2014422 institutions in total\u2014fit this profile.\nOften catering to working students, some online schools have always offered fully remote programs. Others began as traditional campus-based institutions, later establishing online divisions that grew to dwarf their brick-and-mortar counterparts.\nIn 2020, primarily online schools enrolled over 1.5 million full-time degree seekers. Another 1.2 million learners took classes part time. Female students outnumbered male students among both full-time and part-time enrollees, making up about 62% of all learners.\nOnline Learning Through the Years\nIn 2020, the onset of Covid-19 disrupted traditional education, abruptly forcing students, instructors and administrators to adapt to remote learning models.\nEven before the pandemic, however, remote learning had been growing steadily for almost a decade as daily life became more digitized and remote learning technology and infrastructure improved.\nIn 2012\u2014a watershed year in online education that saw the founding of MOOC giants edX and Coursera\u2014over 25% of U.S. college and university students took at least one distance learning course, NCES reports. By 2019, that number had risen to 36%, about half of whom attended exclusively online.\nIn 2020, the number of online students at traditional higher education institutions exploded as schools shifted courses online amid lockdown restrictions. During that year, about 46% of U.S. learners studied entirely online, and another 28% took at least some courses remotely. As of 2021, remote learning numbers remained high, with about 60% of college students taking some or all of their classes online.\nMany traditional degree-seeking students returned to in-person learning when schools reopened in 2021, but online education as a whole continued to grow.\nThe World Economic Forum reports that in 2016, Coursera had 21 million registered users. By 2019, 44 million learners used the MOOC platform. This number leaped to 71 million in 2020, but unlike online college enrollment numbers, Coursera\u2019s enrollment did not drop in 2021. Instead, the platform gained even more users, totaling 92 million in 2022.\nOnline Degrees\nRemote learning programs serve this growing body of online students with degree programs at all levels. NCES reports that in the 2019-20 academic year, primarily online colleges conferred:\nMale-identifying students earned 37% to 39% of these degrees, with female-identifying students earning 61% to 63%.\nStudents at primarily online schools make up 14.7% of all college and university enrollees. They earn:\nOnline doctoral programs are relatively uncommon; remote learners earn only 7.6% of all doctorates.\nOnline Learning by Race\nOnline schools serve a racially diverse student body, with more than half of all learners identifying as nonwhite. These institutions enroll minority learners at higher rates than conventional schools across most reported categories, as shown in the chart below.\nIlana Hamilton is a writer and editor specializing in education and career topics.

Alari\ufb011\u2709& Steve Song2 This study is a comparative analysis of online distance learning and traditional in-person education at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on understanding how different educational modalities affect student achievement. The justi\ufb01cation for this study lies in the rapid shift towards online learning, especially highlighted by the educational changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the \ufb01nal test scores of freshman students in \ufb01ve core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years, the research provides empirical insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of online versus traditional edu-cation. Initial observations suggested that students in online settings scored lower in most courses. However, after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores using multiple linear regression, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the crucial need for a nuanced, data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems. It brings to light the fact that the success of educational methodologies is highly contingent on speci\ufb01c contextual factors. This \ufb01nding advocates for educational administrators and policymakers to exercise careful and informed judgment when adopting online learning modalities. It encourages them to thoroughly evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes. This approach ensures that decisions about implementing online edu-cation are made with a comprehensive understanding of its diverse and context-speci\ufb01c impacts, aiming to optimize educational effectiveness and student success.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 OPEN 1 Department of Sports and Recreation Management, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Division of Research and Doctoral Studies, Concordia University Chicago, 7400 Augusta Street, River Forest, IL 60305, USA. \u2709email: balari\ufb01@ksu.edu.sa HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he year 2020 marked an extraordinary period, character-ized by the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and institutions worldwide had to adapt to unforeseen challenges across various domains, including health, economy, and education. In response, many educational institutions quickly transitioned to distance teaching (also known as e-learning, online learning, or virtual classrooms) to ensure continued access to education for their students. However, despite this rapid and widespread shift to online learning, a compre-hensive examination of its effects on student achievement in comparison to traditional in-person instruction remains largely unexplored.\nIn research examining student outcomes in the context of online learning, the prevailing trend is the consistent observation that online learners often achieve less favorable results when compared to their peers in traditional classroom settings (e.g., Fischer et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017; Edvardsson and Oskarsson, 2008). However, it is important to note that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of research on online learning has primarily focused on its potential impact (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., 2020; Di Pietro et al., 2020) or explored various perspectives (Aucejo et al., 2020; Radha et al., 2020) concerning distance education. These studies have often omitted a comprehensive and nuanced examination of its concrete academic consequences, particularly in terms of test scores and grades.\nGiven the dearth of research on the academic impact of online learning, especially in light of Covid-19 in the educational arena, the present study aims to address that gap by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person teaching in \ufb01ve required freshmen-level courses at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. To accomplish this objective, the current study compared the \ufb01nal exam results of 8297 freshman students who were enrolled in the \ufb01ve courses in person in 2020 to their 8425 \ufb01rst-year counterparts who has taken the same courses at the same institution in 2021 but in an online format.\nThe \ufb01nal test results of the \ufb01ve courses (i.e., University Skills 101, Entrepreneurship 101, Computer Skills 101, Computer Skills 101, and Fitness and Health Culture 101) were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors such as gender, class size and admission scores, which have been cited in past research to be correlated with student achievement (e.g., Meinck and Brese, 2019; Jepsen, 2015) Additionally, as the preparatory year at King Saud University is divided into \ufb01ve tracks\u2014health, nursing, science, business, and humanity, the study classi\ufb01ed students based on their respective disciplines.\nMotivation for the study The rapid expansion of distance learning in higher education, particularly highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Volk et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017), underscores the need for alternative educational approaches during crises. Such disrup-tions can catalyze innovation and the adoption of distance learning as a contingency plan (Christensen et al., 2015). King Saud University, like many institutions worldwide, faced the challenge of transitioning abruptly to online learning in response to the pandemic.\nE-learning has gained prominence in higher education due to technological advancements, offering institutions a competitive edge (Valverde-Berrocoso et al., 2020). Especially during condi-tions like the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic communication was utilized across the globe as a feasible means to overcome barriers and enhance interactions (Bozkurt, 2019).\nDistance learning, characterized by \ufb02exibility, became crucial when traditional in-person classes are hindered by unforeseen circumstance such as the ones posed by COVID-19 (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015). Scholars argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, often referred to as self-directed learning (Hiemstra, 1994) or self-education (Gadamer, 2001). Additional advantages include accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and \ufb02exibility (Sadeghi, 2019).\nHowever, distance learning is not immune to its own set of challenges.\nTechnical impediments, encompassing network issues, device limitations, and communication hiccups, represent formidable hurdles (Sadeghi, 2019). Furthermore, concerns about potential distractions in the online learning environment, fueled by the ubiquity of the internet and social media, have surfaced (Hall et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017). The absence of traditional face-to-face interactions among students and between students and instructors is also viewed as a potential drawback (Sadeghi, 2019).\nGiven the evolving understanding of the pros and cons of distance learning, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning, speci\ufb01cally in terms of student achievement, as compared to in-person classroom learning at King Saud University, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest higher education institutions.\nAcademic achievement: in-person vs online learning The primary driving force behind the rapid integration of tech-nology in education has been its emphasis on student perfor-mance (Lai and Bower, 2019). Over the past decade, numerous studies have undertaken comparisons of student academic achievement in online and in-person settings (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021). This section offers a concise review of the disparities in academic achievement between college students engaged in in-person and online learning, as identi\ufb01ed in existing research.\nA number of studies point to the superiority of traditional in-person education over online learning in terms of academic outcomes. For example, Fischer et al. (2020) conducted a com-prehensive study involving 72,000 university students across 433 subjects, revealing that online students tend to achieve slightly lower academic results than their in-class counterparts.\nSimilarly, Bettinger et al. (2017) found that students at for-pro\ufb01t online universities generally underperformed when compared to their in-person peers. Supporting this trend, Figlio et al. (2013) indicated that in-person instruction consistently produced better results, particularly among speci\ufb01c subgroups like males, lower-performing students, and Hispanic learners.\nAdditionally, Kaupp\u2019s (2012) research in California community colleges demonstrated that online students faced lower completion and success rates compared to their traditional in-person counterparts (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, other studies present evidence of online students outperforming their in-person peers. For example, Iglesias-Pradas et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of 43 bachelor courses at Telecommunication Engineering College in Malaysia, revealing that online students achieved higher academic out-comes than their in-person counterparts. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gonzalez et al. (2020) found that students engaged in online learning performed better than those who had previously taken the same subjects in traditional in-class settings.\nExpanding on this topic, several studies have reported mixed results when comparing the academic performance of online and in-person students, with various student and instructor factors emerging as in\ufb02uential variables. Chesser et al. (2020) noted that student traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion play a substantial role in academic achievement, ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 regardless of the learning environment\u2014be it traditional in-person classrooms or online settings. Furthermore, Cacault et al.\n(2021) discovered that online students with higher academic pro\ufb01ciency tend to outperform those with lower academic cap-abilities, suggesting that differences in students\u2019 academic abilities may impact their performance. In contrast, Bergstrand and Savage (2013) found that online classes received lower overall ratings and exhibited a less respectful learning environment when compared to in-person instruction. Nevertheless, they also observed that the teaching ef\ufb01ciency of both in-class and online courses varied signi\ufb01cantly depending on the instructors\u2019 back-grounds and approaches. These \ufb01ndings underscore the multi-faceted nature of the online vs. in-person learning debate, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.\nTheoretical framework. Constructivism is a well-established learning theory that places learners at the forefront of their educational experience, emphasizing their active role in con-structing knowledge through interactions with their environment (Duffy and Jonassen, 2009). According to constructivist princi-ples, learners build their understanding by assimilating new information into their existing cognitive frameworks (Vygotsky, 1978). This theory highlights the importance of context, active engagement, and the social nature of learning (Dewey, 1938).\nConstructivist approaches often involve hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and opportunities for collaborative exploration (Brooks and Brooks, 1999).\nIn the realm of education, subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emerges as a vital perspective that acknowledges the distinctive nature of different academic disciplines (Shulman, 1986). It suggests that teaching methods should be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of each subject, recognizing that subjects like mathematics, literature, or science require different approaches to facilitate effective learning (Shulman, 1987). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emphasizes that the methods of instruction should mirror the ways experts in a particular \ufb01eld think, reason, and engage with their subject matter (Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005).\nWhen applying these principles to the design of instruction for online and in-person learning environments, the signi\ufb01cance of adapting methods becomes even more pronounced. Online learning often requires unique approaches due to its reliance on technology, asynchronous interactions, and potential for reduced social presence (Anderson, 2003). In-person learning, on the other hand, bene\ufb01ts from face-to-face interactions and immediate feedback (Allen and Seaman, 2016). Here, the interplay of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy becomes evident.\nOnline learning. In an online environment, constructivist principles can be upheld by creating interactive online activities that promote exploration, re\ufb02ection, and collaborative learning (Salmon, 2000). Discussion forums, virtual labs, and multimedia presentations can provide opportunities for students to actively engage with the subject matter (Harasim, 2017). By integrating subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy, educators can design online content that mirrors the discipline\u2019s methodologies while leveraging technology for authentic experiences (Koehler and Mishra, 2009).\nFor instance, an online history course might incorporate virtual museum tours, primary source analysis, and collaborative time-line projects.\nIn-person learning. In a traditional brick-and-mortar class-room setting, constructivist methods can be implemented through group activities, problem-solving tasks, and in-depth discussions that encourage active participation (Jonassen et al., 2003). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy complements this by shaping instructional methods to align with the inherent characteristics of the subject (Hattie, 2009). For instance, in a physics class, hands-on experiments and real-world applications can bring theoretical concepts to life (Hake, 1998).\nIn sum, the fusion of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy offers a versatile approach to instructional design that adapts to different learning environments (Garrison, 2011). By incorporating the principles of both theories, educators can tailor their methods to suit the unique demands of online and in-person learning, ultimately providing students with engaging and effective learning experiences that align with the nature of the subject matter and the mode of instruction.\nCourse description The Self-Development Skills Department at King Saud University (KSU) offers \ufb01ve mandatory freshman-level courses. These courses aim to foster advanced thinking skills and cultivate sci-enti\ufb01c research abilities in students. They do so by imparting essential skills, identifying higher-level thinking patterns, and facilitating hands-on experience in scienti\ufb01c research. The design of these classes is centered around aiding students\u2019 smooth transition into university life. Brief descriptions of these courses are as follows: University Skills 101 (CI 101) is a three-hour credit course designed to nurture essential academic, communication, and Fig. 1 Comparison of Final Exam Results for the Five Courses Mandatory Freshman Courses in King Saud University by Year (2020 and 2021). The \ufb01gure compared student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, using independent-samples t-tests; the results show a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 3 personal skills among all preparatory year students at King Saud University. The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the practical abilities they need to excel in their academic pursuits and navigate their university lives effectively. CI 101 comprises 12 sessions and is an integral part of the curriculum for all incoming freshmen, ensuring a standardized foundation for skill development.\nFitness and Health 101 (FAJB 101) is a one-hour credit course.\nFAJB 101 focuses on the aspects of self-development skills in terms of health and physical, and the skills related to personal health, nutrition, sports, preventive, psychological, reproductive, and \ufb01rst aid. This course aims to motivate students\u2019 learning process through entertainment, sports activities, and physical exercises to maintain their health. This course is required for all incoming freshmen students at King Saud University.\nEntrepreneurship 101 (ENT 101) is a one-hour- credit course.\nENT 101 aims to develop students\u2019 skills related to entrepre-neurship. The course provides students with knowledge and skills to generate and transform ideas and innovations into practical commercial projects in business settings. The entrepreneurship course consists of 14 sessions and is taught only to students in the business track.\nComputer Skills 101 (CT 101) is a three-hour credit course.\nThis provides students with the basic computer skills, e.g., com-ponents, operating systems, applications, and communication backup. The course explores data visualization, introductory level of modern programming with algorithms and information security. CT 101 course is taught for all tracks except those in the human track.\nComputer Skills 102 (CT 102) is a three-hour credit course. It provides IT skills to the students to utilize computers with high ef\ufb01ciency, develop students\u2019 research and scienti\ufb01c skills, and increase capability to design basic educational software. CT 102 course focuses on operating systems such as Microsoft Of\ufb01ce.\nThis course is only taught for students in the human track.\nStructure and activities. These courses ranged from one to three hours. A one-hour credit means that students must take an hour of the class each week during the academic semester. The same arrangement would apply to two and three credit-hour courses.\nThe types of activities in each course are shown in Table 1.\nAt King Saud University, each semester spans 15 weeks in duration. The total number of semester hours allocated to each course serves as an indicator of its signi\ufb01cance within the broader context of the academic program, including the diverse tracks available to students. Throughout the two years under study (i.e., 2020 and 2021), course placements (fall or spring), course content, and the organizational structure remained consistent and uniform.\nData Participants. The study\u2019s data comes from test scores of a cohort of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students enrolled at King Saud Uni-versity in Saudi Arabia over the span of two academic years: 2020 and 2021. Among these students, 8297 were engaged in tradi-tional, in-person learning in 2020, while 8425 had transitioned to online instruction for the same courses in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the student population consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. However, in 2021, there was a reversal in these proportions, with female students accounting for 48.5% and male students comprising 51.5% of the total participants.\nRegarding student enrollment in the \ufb01ve courses, Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown by average class size, admission scores, and the number of students enrolled in the courses during the two years covered by this study. While the total number of students in each course remained relatively consistent across the two years, there were noticeable \ufb02uctuations in average class sizes.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, four out of the \ufb01ve courses experienced substantial increases in class size, with some nearly doubling in size (e.g., ENT_101 and CT_102), while one course (CT_101) showed a reduction in its average class size.\nIn this study, it must be noted that while some students enrolled in up to three different courses within the same academic year, none repeated the same exam in both years. Speci\ufb01cally, students who failed to pass their courses in 2020 were required to complete them in summer sessions and were consequently not included in this study\u2019s dataset. To ensure clarity and precision in our analysis, the research focused exclusively on student test scores to evaluate and compare the academic effectiveness of online and traditional in-person learning methods. This approach was chosen to provide a clear, direct comparison of the educational impacts associated with each teaching format.\nMethods. Descriptive analysis of the \ufb01nal exam scores for the two years (2020 and 2021) were conducted. Additionally, comparison of student outcomes in in-person classes in 2020 to their online platform peers in 2021 were conducted using an independent-samples t-test. Subsequently, in order to address potential Table 1 Learning activities and total course hours per semester.\nLearning Activities Courses Lecture Laboratory Total Semester Hours CT_101 50% 50% 45 CT_102 50% 50% 45 ENT_101 100% 0% 15 FAJB_101 100% 0% 15 CI_101 100% 0% 45 CI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nTable 2 Class size, gender distribution, and admission scores by courses in 2020 and 2021.\nCourses Average Class Size Gender Distribution Admission Scores 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 FAJB 101 23.1 46.1 M = 53.8%, F = 46.2% M = 58.3%, F = 41.7% 89.58 87.95 CI 101 21.6 35.2 M = 54%, F = 46% M = 58%, F = 42% 89.57 87.96 ENT 101 33.7 66.7 M = 68.1%, F = 31.9% M = 69.7%, F = 30.3% 87.94 90.19 CT 101 42.7 22.3 M = 62.7%, F = 37.3% M = 64.2%, F = 35.8% 90.84 88.22 CT 102 21.1 46.5 M = 51.4%, F = 48% M = 57%, F = 43% 87.85 86.85 Source: Deanship of Admission and Registration Affairs at King Saud University.\nCI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 disparities between the two groups arising from variables such as gender, class size, and admission scores (which serve as an indicator of students\u2019 academic aptitude and pre-enrollment knowledge), multiple regression analyses were conducted. In these multivariate analyses, outcomes of both in-person and online cohorts were assessed within their respective tracks. By carefully considering essential aforementioned variables linked to student performance, the study aimed to ensure a comprehensive and equitable evaluation.\nStudy instrument. The study obtained students\u2019 \ufb01nal exam scores for the years 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) from the school\u2019s records of\ufb01ce through their examination management system. In the preparatory year at King Saud University, \ufb01nal exams for all courses are developed by committees composed of faculty members from each department. To ensure valid com-parisons, the \ufb01nal exam questions, crafted by departmental committees of professors, remained consistent and uniform for the two years under examination.\nTable 3 provides a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of all \ufb01ve tests included in our analysis. These tests exhibit a strong degree of internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coef\ufb01cients spanning a range from 0.77 to 0.86. This robust and consistent internal consistency measurement underscores the dependable nature of these tests, af\ufb01rming their reliability and suitability for the study\u2019s objectives.\nIn terms of assessing test validity, content validity was ensured through a thorough review by university subject matter experts, resulting in test items that align well with the content domain and learning objectives. Additionally, criterion-related validity was established by correlating students\u2019 admissions test scores with their \ufb01nal required freshman test scores in the \ufb01ve subject areas, showing a moderate and acceptable relationship (0.37 to 0.56) between the test scores and the external admissions test. Finally, construct validity was con\ufb01rmed through reviews by experienced subject instructors, leading to improvements in test content. With guidance from university subject experts, construct validity was established, af\ufb01rming the effectiveness of the \ufb01nal tests in assessing students\u2019 subject knowledge at the end of their coursework.\nCollectively, these validity and reliability measures af\ufb01rm the soundness and integrity of the \ufb01nal subject tests, establishing their suitability as effective assessment tools for evaluating students\u2019 knowledge in their \ufb01ve mandatory freshman courses at King Saud University.\nProcedure. After obtaining research approval from the Research Committee at King Saud University, the coordinators of the \ufb01ve courses (CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101) supplied the researchers with the \ufb01nal exam scores of all \ufb01rst-year preparatory year students at King Saud University for the initial semester of the academic years 2020 and 2021. The sample encompassed all students who had completed these \ufb01ve courses during both years, resulting in a total of 16,722 students forming the \ufb01nal group of participants.\nLimitations. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the research was conducted within a well-resourced major public university. As such, the experiences with online classes at other types of institutions (e.g., community colleges, private institutions) may vary signi\ufb01cantly. Additionally, the limited data pertaining to in-class teaching practices and the diversity of learning activities across different courses represents a gap that could have provided valuable insights for a more thor-ough interpretation and explanation of the study\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\nFindings To compare student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, independent-samples t-tests were conducted.\nTable 4 shows a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nThe biggest decline was with CT_102 with 3.58 points, and the smallest decline was with CI_101 with 0.18 points.\nHowever, such simple comparison of means between the two years (via t-tests) by subjects does not account for the differences in gender composition, class size, and admission scores between the two academic years, all of which have been associated with student outcomes (e.g., Ho and Kelman, 2014; De Paola et al., 2013). To account for such potential confounding variables, multiple regressions were conducted to compare the 2 years\u2019 results while controlling for these three factors associated with student achievement.\nTable 5 presents the regression results, illustrating the variation in \ufb01nal exam scores between 2020 and 2021, while controlling for gender, class size, and admission scores.

Conversely, in the case of ENT_101, online students in 2021 scored 0.69 points lower than their 2020 in-person counterparts. With CT_102, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences in \ufb01nal exam scores between the two cohorts of students.\nDiscussion The study sought to assess the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning in the higher education setting in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed the \ufb01nal exam scores of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students in King Saud University in \ufb01ve required subjects (i.e., CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101). The study initially performed a simple comparison of mean scores by tracks by year (via t-tests) and then a number of multiple regression analyses which controlled for class size, gender composition, and admission scores.\nOverall, the study\u2019s more in-depth \ufb01ndings using multiple regression painted a wholly different picture than the results obtained using t-tests. After controlling for class size, gender composition, and admissions scores, online students in 2021 performed better than their in-person instruction peers in 2020 in University Skills (CI_101), Fitness and Health (FAJB_101), and Computer Skills (CT_101), whereas in-person students out-performed their online peers in Entrepreneurship (ENT_101).\nThere was no meaningful difference in outcomes for students in the Computer Skills (CT_102) course for the two years.\nIn light of these \ufb01ndings, it raises the question: why do we observe minimal differences (less than a one-point gain or loss) in student outcomes in courses like University Skills, Fitness and Health, Entrepreneurship, and Advanced Computer Skills based on the mode of instruction? Is it possible that when subjects are primarily at a basic or introductory level, as is the case with these courses, the mode of instruction may have a limited impact as long as the concepts are effectively communicated in a manner familiar and accessible to students?\nIn today\u2019s digital age, one could argue that students in more developed countries, such as Saudi Arabia, generally possess the skills and capabilities to effectively engage with materials pre-sented in both in-person and online formats. However, there is a notable exception in the Basic Computer Skills course, where the online cohort outperformed their in-person counterparts by more than 5 points. Insights from interviews with the instructors of this course suggest that this result may be attributed to the course\u2019s basic and conceptual nature, coupled with the availability of instructional videos that students could revisit at their own pace.\nGiven that students enter this course with varying levels of computer skills, self-paced learning may have allowed them to cover course materials at their preferred speed, concentrating on less familiar topics while swiftly progressing through concepts they already understood. The advantages of such self-paced learning have been documented by scholars like Tullis and Ben-jamin (2011), who found that self-paced learners often outper-form those who spend the same amount of time studying identical materials. This approach allows learners to allocate their time more effectively according to their individual learning pace, providing greater ownership and control over their learning experience. As such, in courses like introductory computer skills, it can be argued that becoming familiar with fundamental and conceptual topics may not require extensive in-class Table 5 Regression Summary of Freshman Final Exam Results in 2020 (In Person) and 2021(Online) by Courses, Controlling for Gender Composition, Class Size, and Admission Scores in King Saud University.\nCI_101 FAJB_101 ENT_101 CT_101 CT_102 \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta \u03b2 Standardized Beta Constant \u22121820.97*** --\u22121145.93*** --1382.01*** --\u221210709.12*** --\u22121360.93*** --Year 0.89*** 0.07 0.56** 0.05 \u22120.69*** \u22120.06 5.28*** 0.32 0.66 0.04 Gender 4.18*** 0.31 4.20*** 0.34 3.80*** 0.31 2.38*** 0.14 4.07*** 0.23 Class Size 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02*** 0.08 0.16*** 0.23 \u22120.13*** \u22120.20 Admission Scores 0.62*** 0.42 0.55*** 0.41 0.44*** 0.35 0.75*** 0.43 0.78*** 0.37 Adjusted-R2 0.32 0.35 0.30 0.28 0.24 Gender was represented with male = 0 and female = 1.

Instead, it may be more about exposure to and digestion of materials in a format and at a pace tailored to stu-dents with diverse backgrounds, knowledge levels, and skill sets.\nFurther investigation is needed to more fully understand why some classes bene\ufb01tted from online instruction while others did not, and vice versa. Perhaps, it could be posited that some content areas are more conducive to in-person (or online) format while others are not. Or it could be that the different results of the two modes of learning were driven by students of varying academic abilities and engagement, with low-achieving students being more vulnerable to the limitations of online learning (e.g., Kofoed et al., 2021). Whatever the reasons, the results of the current study can be enlightened by a more in-depth analysis of the various factors associated with such different forms of learning. Moreover, although not clear cut, what the current study does provide is additional evidence against any dire consequences to student learning (at least in the higher ed setting) as a result of sudden increase in online learning with possible bene\ufb01ts of its wider use being showcased.\nBased on the \ufb01ndings of this study, we recommend that edu-cational leaders adopt a measured approach to online learning\u2014a stance that neither fully embraces nor outright denounces it. The impact on students\u2019 experiences and engagement appears to vary depending on the subjects and methods of instruction, sometimes hindering, other times promoting effective learning, while some classes remain relatively unaffected.\nRather than taking a one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, educational leaders should be open to exploring the nuances behind these outcomes. This involves examining why certain courses thrived with online delivery, while others either experienced a decline in student achievement or remained largely unaffected. By exploring these differentiated outcomes associated with diverse instructional formats, leaders in higher education institutions and beyond can make informed decisions about resource allo-cation. For instance, resources could be channeled towards in-person learning for courses that bene\ufb01t from it, while simul-taneously expanding online access for courses that have demonstrated improved outcomes through its virtual format.\nThis strategic approach not only optimizes resource allocation but could also open up additional revenue streams for the institution.\nConsidering the enduring presence of online learning, both before the pandemic and its accelerated adoption due to Covid-19, there is an increasing need for institutions of learning and scholars in higher education, as well as other \ufb01elds, to prioritize the study of its effects and optimal utilization. This study, which compares student outcomes between two cohorts exposed to in-person and online instruction (before and during Covid-19) at the largest university in Saudi Arabia, represents a meaningful step in this direction.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.\nReceived: 7 June 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023; References Allen IE, Seaman J (2016) Online report card: Tracking online education in the United States.

    "Summarized_Document": "This study compares online and in-person learning at King Saud University, focusing on the impact on student achievement. The research analyzed final test scores of 16,722 freshman students in five core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years. Initial observations indicated lower scores for online students, but after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the need for a data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems, considering the variable effects on learning outcomes.The study's motivation stems from the rapid shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for alternative educational approaches. Distance learning offers flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness but also faces challenges like technical issues and potential distractions. The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning at King Saud University.Theoretical frameworks of constructivism and subject-specific pedagogy were applied to understand the differences in learning environments. Constructivism emphasizes active learning and context, while subject-specific pedagogy tailors teaching methods to the characteristics of each subject. These principles were used to design instruction for both online and in-person learning environments.The study's data comes from test scores of 16,722 first-year students at King Saud University over two academic years: 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online). The final exam results of five courses were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors like gender, class size, and admission scores. Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare student outcomes.Findings showed a statistically significant drop in test scores from 2020 to 2021 for all courses except Computer Skills 101. However, after controlling for confounding variables, online students in 2021 performed better in University Skills 101, Fitness and Health 101, and Computer Skills 101, while in-person students outperformed online peers in Entrepreneurship 101. There was no significant difference in outcomes for Computer Skills 102.The study suggests that the mode of instruction may have limited impact on basic or introductory courses, as long as concepts are effectively communicated. The advantages of self-paced learning in online environments were highlighted, particularly for courses like introductory computer skills. The study recommends a measured approach to online learning, exploring the nuances behind different outcomes and optimizing resource allocation based on course-specific needs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence against any dire consequences to student learning due to the shift to online learning, with potential benefits for certain courses. Educational leaders should adopt a strategic approach, considering the specific needs of each course and the potential advantages of online learning.",
